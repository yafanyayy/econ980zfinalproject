Good morning, and thank you for joining us. If we look back on 2015, Aflac 60th year of operations, let me start off by saying that the final quarter of 2015 concluded another great year for Aflac. What's been true for these 6 dec",1347,"Right. Thank you, Robin. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. If we look back on 2015, Aflac 60th year of operations, let me start off by saying that the final quarter of 2015 concluded another great year for Aflac. What's been true for these 6 decades and what separates us from every other competitor is our distinct product focus on voluntary and supplemental insurance in both the United States and in Japan. That kind of direct approach has been a major factor in our success, and I believe it will continue to propel our leading position in the future. I am especially pleased that our operating earnings per share growth before currency exceeded our expectations for the year rising 7.5%. I think this is especially notable given historically lower interest rates, market volatility and economic uncertainty in the world. I couldn't be more proud that the hard work and accomplishments of our management team, employees and sales distribution in Japan and the United States. It is an honor to work alongside our team who are dedicated to enhancing our long-term growth of the company and to represent all the Aflac stands for the Aflac world. 
Now I will provide to you some highlights related to our Japanese operations, where I believe we set the standard in many ways for other insurance companies in Japan. We are not only the pioneer and leading provider of cancer insurance, but we are also the #1 seller of medical insurance too. This is particular impressive given our increasing competitive medical market for insurance has become in Japan. But our relevant products, trusted brand and divorced distribution are a powerful combination that's very hard to compete with and it propelled Aflac to ensure 1 out of 4 households. I am thrilled with Aflac Japan's tremendous annual growth of 13.4% increase in sales for third sector products, which surpassed our original expectation considerably. Not only where our 2015 results impressed us across all channels, but we pointed out in our release last night that third sector sales increase for 2015 is particularly phenomenal because that marked the second highest annual third sector growth in 10 years. 
On the product side, it's exciting that sales of our bounding cancer insurance were up with tremendous 40.6% for the year. As the pioneer of cancer insurance, this remarkable results underscores the importance of Japanese consumers place on selecting a brand they know and trust. 
Turning to first sector products, the actions taken by the Bank of Japan on Friday resulted in JGB yields decline, as well as additional weakening of the yen to the dollar. 
As discussed on our December outlook call, we have taken steps to control the sale of first sector products as we entered 2016. Managing through the low interest rate environment is nothing new to Aflac Japan. The actions of the Bank of Japan simply reinforce our strategy, and we will continue to remove potential and further actions as the rate environment plays out. Fred will touch on the financial considerations in his comments. 
Looking at our distributions that our traditional agencies had been and remain contributors to our success and this was certainly true throughout 2015. At the same time, I am pleased with Aflac Japan's significant strides in further developing our alliance with Japan Post throughout the year. We completed the expansion of the number of post offices and their agents selling their products to more than 20,000 analysts during 2015. With this expansion, we continue to ramp up our training of Japan Post employs to ensure they have the knowledge and tools to sell Aflac products successfully. The 22 of tremendous sales results is difficult comparisons they create. As we indicated, we believe the sales of third sector products in 2016 will be down mid-single digits following another year of outstanding sales in 2015. 
However, looking further out, we continued to be Aflac Japan's long-term compound annual growth rate is being in the range of 4% to 6%. 
Now turning to Aflac U.S., 2015 was a year building our business through our carrier and broker distribution channels. We not only enhanced our carrier sales management infrastructure over the last 1.5 year, but we also laid the foundation for greater opportunities within the broker market. As you saw in the earnings release, Aflac U.S. hit an all-time record for the quarter with a premium amount of $497 million in new sales which equated to a 9.6% increase. I am especially happy with the fourth quarter given that it followed a 14.1% sales increase in the prior year. 
Our quarterly results exceeded our expectations and drove our total sales of $1.5 billion, which translates to a 3.7% increase for the year. Our sales results for 2016 exemplified that we have been communicated. Our sales are increasingly concentrated toward the end of the fourth quarter, and we believe this will continue to be the case. As you all well know, success and opportunities, breach competition. That combined with the clear needs of voluntary products has resulted in a number of other companies in the voluntary supplemental insurance market. These have included insurance carriers who sell voluntary insurance as well as companies involved in various aspects of healthcare management. But keep in mind, Aflac's singular focus on supplemental voluntary products has greatly contributed to our dominant position in the work side insurance market, and I believe will continue to drive our competitive edge. 
One Day Pay remains a differentiator for Aflac. We will continue our promotion of One Day Pay to consumers, which we believe will help increase brand loyalty and account penetration. Here is a maintenance In 2015, we paid 1.2 million clients a 100% of eligible one-day pay claims submitted were paid within one-day. I think we will pay over 2 million One Day Pay claims in 2016. In the minds of consumers already high integrity jumped back 22%, the biggest move ever and we believe it's because of One Day Pay. Paying claims in just 1 day translates to this statement from consumers. ""If you are paying it in just 1 day, you must be a good company and with high integrity."" Also independent research continues to show that there is no doubt Americans consumers need cash quickly and paying claims fast and fairly sets us apart from the competition. 
Even further differentiating Aflac, I am also proud that Aflac's contact center has been recognized by J.D. Powers for providing outstanding customer service experience. This recognition is based on successful completion of an audit and exceeding our customer satisfaction benchmark. It is these kinds of initiatives and feedback that demonstrates our commitment to delivering on our promise to our policyholders. While 2015 was a year of building, we see 2016 as the year of stabilization in growth. We continue to believe that Aflac U.S. annualized premium sales growth in 2016 will be in the range of 3% to 5%. 
Turning to capital deployment, Fred will provide more detail shortly, but let me just say that we do growing the cash dividend and purchasing our shares as the most attractive means of deploying capital, particularly in the absence of any compelling alternatives. Our plan for 2016 is to repurchase $1.4 billion of our shares, and we anticipate concentrating the majority in the first half of the year. As we indicated last quarter, 2015 was a 33th consecutive year in which we have increased the cash dividend. Our objective is to grow the dividend at a rate generally in line with the increases in operating earnings per diluted share before the impact of foreign currency translation. 
I will conclude by reiterating how proud I am of our teams in both the United States and in Japan, as they worked hard to generate our 2015 results. You know I have been in the business for more than 40 years now, and I am truly excited today more than I am ever been about Aflac's future. So now, let me turn the program over to Fred for financial results and outlook. Fred?"

You all had a chance to review the details in our earnings release. As Dan noted in his comments, our fourth quarter and full year results exceeded the high end of our earnings guidance, driven by strong overall margins in both the U.S. and Japan. The only notable item to call out in the quarter was a favorable adjustment to certain retirement benefit liabilities as a result of refining our assumptions. These adjustments impacted our parent company only results and contributed approximately $13 million pretax or $0.02 per share to the quarter's earnings. Our Japan segment margins came in strong driven by continued favorable benefit ratios. We had a few adjustments to reserves in the quarter, result of our year end actuarial work. These adjustments were largely offsetting and on a net basis contributed modestly to the out-performance in the period. Our expense ratio came in favorable to our expectations as we are balancing investments with continued focus on expense managing. We would expect both our benefit and expense ratios to normalize within our outlook default guidance range as we move into 2016. 
In the U.S., benefit ratios were considerably better than last year's quarter, but fairly consistent with our strong performance throughout 2015 and at the favorable end of our outlook called guidance range. As with Japan, our quarterly and year-end actuarial work resulted in certain reserve adjustments that were largely offsetting. Our expense ratio in the U.S. was elevated in the quarter. This is not unusual in the fourth quarter and roughly in line with last year's quarter and in part reflects the conscious decision to accelerate certain investments in our platform. 
Turning to investments. Throughout 2015, we were successful in defending net investment income, recognizing that as higher yield in securities mature, we are investing new money into a low rate environment and need to proceed with caution given market volatility. As we noted during our outlook call, this dynamic represents a natural headwind to investment income in 2016. We continue our efforts to build a position in diversified asset classes, helping to support higher long-term returns. Our capital and liquidity position remain strong. As this is typically the case, we have only estimates on SMR and RBC at this time, but expect both to remain strong and consistent with recent periods. Between dividends and repurchase, we returned just over $400 million to our shareholders in the quarter and achieved our guidance of 1.3 billion in repurchase for the year. 
Before I turn the call back over to Robin for Q&A, I would like to comment on market volatility, the relative strength of our financial position and our outlook. The month of January is certainly been extraordinary with the return of credit and equity market volatility by continuation of the low rate environment in the U.S. and Japan and concern over energy and commodity prices and related exposures. In the case of Aflac, recent Bank of Japan actions drove our renewed focus on Japan rates mainly yen. I think the following considerations are important and support the investment thesis that Aflac is well-positioned to perform in the phase of market volatility. First, our core franchise in Japan and the U.S. supplemental health markets remain strong with natural demographic and economic catalysts driving core underwriting margins and favorable trends. These core franchise growth and earnings drivers are largely unaffected by recent market volatility. Second, as with the rest of the industry, we are carefully monitoring interest rates. As Dan mentioned in his comments and consistent with Paul's strategic outlook in December, the recent move in Japan rates simply reinforces our strategy to actively manage down the sale of lump sum first sector products focusing on appropriately priced level premium product in support of our high return third sector business and our core agency distribution network. 
From the financial impact standpoint, we have concluded all of our year-end actuarial work, including review and testing of core assumptions and maintain very strong margins across all material blocks of business and have very little liability and balance sheet risk associated with very low to very long interest rates. In terms of Investment Strategy, we are only in the beginning stages of building our growth asset portfolio, thus we have modest exposure to naturally volatile asset classes. In some cases, we now have an opportunity to enter these asset classes at better evaluations. With historically low JGB yields, the success of the dollar program and expansion into new asset classes, we have naturally lightened our new money allocation to JGBs and that will continue into 2016. 
In addition, we prebrought approximately 60% of our JGB budget prior to the BOJ easing announcement of late last week. In terms of the dollar program, we carefully watch our hedging costs, but have been proactive in modestly extending the duration of our hedge positions to reduce the exposure to short-term spikes. While our long-term views for hedging cost arrives, we remain comfortably within our tolerances and continue to drive significant value over and above JGB rates. Finally, in terms of credit exposure, like the rest of our peers we are carefully monitoring our exposure to energy sector along with metals and mining. We have a $6.6 billion energy portfolio measured at book value that is well-diversified in high quality. Only 7% of the portfolio is below investment grade and effectively all in the BB category. As of the end of the January, our below investment grade energy holdings were in an unrealized loss of only  $140 million. As we analyzed security by security holdings, we do not see acute default risk but do know that downgrade risk is present and pricing is under significant pressure on select names, which could result in accounting driven impairments and securities trade at deep discount for prolonged periods. 
In summary, core margins are expected to remain strong and largely resilient to market volatility. Balance sheet exposures to low for long rates in the U.S. and Japan are modest. And our general account assets are defensively positioned with limited exposure to naturally volatile asset classes and we are well-positioned in terms of our energy and energy-related exposures. We, therefore, have made no adjustments to our earnings per share guidance of $6.17 to $6.41 assuming an average exchange rate of roughly JPY 121 to the $1. And capital deployment guidance provided in our December outlook call remains the same. Based on our capital conditions, earnings and cash flow stability, we are maintaining our repurchase target for 2016 at $1.4 billion. Having repatriated additional excess capital in the fourth quarter, we are front-end loading approximately $1 billion of repurchase in the first half of the year. Our performance in the fourth quarter certainly bodes well for 2016, but it is obviously very early in the year and we will update accordingly. 
Thank you, and I will now hand the call back to Robin to begin Q&A. Robin?"

So we were patriated an additional 60 billion yens in the fourth quarter, roughly USD 500 million. That has built up a liquidity position of the holding company, which we are now spending down in the form of front-end loading the repurchase of approximately $1 billion or $1.4 billion target in 2016. You are also correct in that over the past few years, we have benefited some elevated repatriation and cash flow related to these reinsurance transactions. I would know, however, that we have had a balanced approach to the use of proceeds that, if you will, freed up capital from reinsurance, roughly 40%-or-so dedicated to assuring up our SMR ratio, protecting the capital strength of our insurance franchise. The remaining 60% then repatriated only after being comfortable with our capital ratios. That is roughly the same type of approach that we would take forward if we did in fact continue to entertain reinsurance transactions. Right now, we are out there with a long-range guidance of 2015 to 2017 of excess capital of $6.3 billion to $7.5 billion. We remain consistent in that number. The difference between 6.3 and 7.5 is tied up in excess capital some of which is in Japan and could be unlocked via reinsurance. Our basic approach to that Randy is that to be opportunistic and defensive. Meaning if there are compelling opportunities to unlock and go through the exercise of unlocking that excess capital for redeployment of higher returns, we will entertain that. We also wanted to be defensive as we make our way through market volatility and watch things unfold over the next year or 2. We want to be equally careful to recognize that excess capital. It needs to be held in some cases to defend the balance sheet. So it's a balanced approach. We don't have any reinsurance dialed into our estimates for 2016 as I mentioned on the outlook call, but we will continue to watch markets unfold and look for opportunities."

And in fact, we have even got commitments, if you will, for funded reinsurance that allows us the flexibility to pull down reinsurance if necessary for either defensive or offensive groups. And that's largely a healthy approach because we are talking about health businesses and morbidity risk, which is an attractive type of risk to take in the capital markets these days by reinsurers and becomes unaffected by capital market volatility. It tends to be something we can count on with reliability. So I am not at all concerned about the nature of the discussions with reinsurers and our access to reinsurance. The issue is more whether or not it make sense from a capital strength standpoint or an opportunity standpoint to entertain any of those transactions. And then in terms of the second part of your question, as I mentioned in my comments, we are very well-positioned relative to low for long interest rates and that is not my concern relative to the balance sheet. It's an issue relative to watching our earnings trajectory going forward as I have mentioned, but it's not a balance sheet issue as we have very little relative liabilities exposed to low for long rates. The bigger issue is whether or not we are entering into the early stages of a credit cycle and being careful about that. All eyes are on of course the energy market and commodities, but broadly we need to be careful about whether or not a mild or moderate credit cycle is in front of us. So it's a good time to be careful. I think spreads have widened which is usually a signal, downgrades are outpacing, upgrades modestly right now even beyond the energy sector. So we have to be careful to watch that, but as I said we are particularly well-positioned and we naturally have a defensive general account because we haven't been as aggressive as many in the industry in terms of entering into more volatile asset classes. We have just started to begin there."

Well, as everybody knows we have been expecting hedge cost to go up and in fact that's the case about 1 year or so ago, they were running about 60 basis points now, they are running about 130 to 140. And that's including the actions by the BOJ the other day, which increased the hedge cost around 10 to 15. Having said that, we were planning for hedge costs in 2016 to be upwards of 180, 190 basis points based on where our markets were back in the third quarter, meaning look at what the Fed was going to do for potential rate hikes, this new information from Japan. And even at that level of 180 basis points to 200 basis points, we still deem our portfolio to be very profitable versus buying the portfolio of JGB's, which is what we measured against. And part of that is, because new investments on the U.S. dollar program were going into higher yields and higher spreads. We did take advantage throughout the allocation of some of the dislocation and the high yields in the bank loan market, which get us higher yields. And we have continued to see JGB yields go down. So that creates a widespread. But importantly, relative to the program, the fact is that monetary policy around the globe continues to be easy, by either the Bank of Japan, but the Federal Reserve is unlikely to raise more time unless there is really strong economic growth in the U.S. So when you look at things like forward curves, the 180 to 200 that we thought it was going to go to is unlikely to be realized this year. It most likely will continue to be lower. Nevertheless, we have programs and analysis that looks at this continually and the tools that we have are either find higher-yielding assets and to Fred's point earlier, as we are starting to explode grow assets those have higher yields and returns and the fixed income continue to modify the types of hedges we have. Again, Fred mentioned that we in the duration of some of the hedges which has helped us to lock guidance of lower cost. So those are the parameters we continue to look to improve the performance of the program, but it's holding us much better than we would have expected. And monetary policy is in our favor right now.

Jimmy, let me begin by saying that 13.4% increase in sales last year creates your first You are correct very difficult comparisons and that's going to persist throughout the year. We do believe that we will have a strong year, but without a product launch of 1 of our major cool products that being a complete revitalization of either our cancer and medical plan. We are in a year where we are going to have what we consider to be more moderate product launches and therefore we believe the sales comparisons, especially against such a large year will be difficult. We have some product launches smaller and major that we will look forward in the first half of the year. And then as I mentioned on the outlook call, we will be launching a completely new product line then we believe will enhance the second half of the year. That said, as in the case of Japan, when you do think that are brand-new to the company, they tend to have a much lower adoption rate as well as a much lower rate of usage by different channels as we both negotiate with those channels as well as teach them the process or sales of best product. And so we expect 2016 to be a year where we are enhancing our products and opening up new potential growth, but we expect the majority of that growth to happen beyond 2016. Unfortunately, I can't go into the specifics about the products and sales, but we feel very comfortable with our plan and our plan for '17 and '18 beyond that."

It also can factor into how much of the dollar investment program we want to leave unhedged at times based on our view of the markets. So it factors into the investment strategy predominantly. I would also add that those hedging costs also play into even our actuarial testing work.

I would not overread accelerated investment into the expense ratio in the fourth quarter that there were some acceleration expenses into the fourth quarter. But as my comments in my prepared remarks, we would expect our expense ratio in 2016 to fall back down within the guidance range that we provided for the year. You had a couple things going on expense wise, you had some acceleration of expenses. You had some miscellaneous items running through the expense line, which we will have from quarter-to-quarter and naturally fluctuate. One of the items I would note is that we did have a bit more docking amortization in the quarter. And in fact, we believe this relates also to modestly improved benefit ratio in the period and that while lapse rates were not unusually outside our expectation, what lapsed in terms of the mix of business that lapsed tended to be policies that were caring higher reserves and higher dock balances. As a result, it tended to push up a better benefit ratio, if you will, or improve our benefit ratio I should say and pushed up our expense ratio little bit. Estimates in and around 100 basis points, but I would certainly say approximately just to give you an idea. So on the expense side, we would expect to settle back down into our guidance. I do think you should expect what has been a natural seasonal pattern here at the company that we tend to move through the year well within the ranges, but it's not uncommon for us to see a little bit of elevated expense ratio in the fourth quarter."

When we think about first sector products, as we mentioned in the past, we really divided into 2 categories: first is lump sum products; and second is more of a premium products. With those lump sum products, we believe especially given the low interest rate environment and it is not in our best interest to focus on those products.

As it relates to our level premium products, however, we believe those still are strong enhancement to our portfolio primarily because of the cross sale we are getting with our traditional third sector products with cancer and medical. And those products continue to be an overall positive for us. We believe though -- the sales of those will remain relatively flat for the foreseeable future. In terms of the BOJ impact to our third sector products, at this point, we don't expect it to have a significant impact. The level of the overall competition in third sector products, especially in medical, remains high, but we don't expect there to be any short-term impact to expedite or make that much faster.

The other dynamic that I mentioned is that, in this particular quarter, we also had lapse rats played in, meaning not so much how much lapsed, but the nature of the product that lapsed in the period. The product tended to carry on average higher reserves and so there was a greater release of reserves, if you will, related to the This also as I mentioned played into accelerated dock amortization and weighed on the expense ratio.

Good morning, and thank you for joining us. If we look back on 2015, Aflac 60th year of operations, let me start off by saying that the final quarter of 2015 concluded another great year for Aflac. What's been true for these 6",1347,"All right. Thank you, Robin. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. If we look back on 2015, Aflac 60th year of operations, let me start off by saying that the final quarter of 2015 concluded another great year for Aflac. What's been true for these 6 decades and what separates us from every other competitor is our distinct product focus on voluntary and supplemental insurance in both the United States and in Japan. That kind of direct approach has been a major factor in our success, and I believe it will continue to propel our leading position in the future. I'm especially pleased that our operating earnings per share growth before currency exceeded our expectations for the year rising 7.5%. I think this is especially notable given historically low interest rates, market volatility and economic uncertainty in the world. I couldn't be more proud that the hard work and accomplishments of our management team, employees and sales distribution in Japan and the United States. It is an honor to work alongside our team who are dedicated to enhancing our long-term growth of the company and who represent all that Aflac stands for the Aflac way. 
Now I will provide you some highlights related to our Japanese operations, where I believe we set the standard in many ways for other insurance companies in Japan. We are not only the pioneer and leading provider of cancer insurance, but we are also the #1 seller of medical insurance too. This is particularly impressive given our increasing competitive medical market for insurance that has become in Japan. But our relevant products, trusted brand and diversed distribution are a powerful combination that's very hard to compete with and it propelled Aflac to insure 1 out of 4 households. I'm thrilled with Aflac Japan's tremendous annual growth of 13.4% increase in sales for third sector products, which surpassed our original expectation considerably. Not only where our 2015 results impressed us across all channels, but we pointed out in our release last night that third sector sales increase for 2015 is particularly phenomenal because that marked the second highest annual third sector growth in 10 years. 
On the product side, it's exciting that sales of our bounding cancer insurance were up a tremendous 40.6% for the year. As the pioneer of cancer insurance, this remarkable results underscore the importance of Japanese consumers' place on selecting a brand they know and trust. 
Turning to first sector products, the actions taken by the Bank of Japan on Friday resulted in JGB yields decline, as well as additional weakening of the yen to the dollar. 
As discussed on our December outlook call, we have taken step to control the sale of first sector products as we entered 2016. Managing through the low-interest-rate environment is nothing new to Aflac Japan. The actions of the Bank of Japan simply reinforce our strategy, and we will continue to remove potential and further actions as the rate environment plays out. Fred will touch on the financial considerations in his comments. 
Looking at our distributions that our traditional agencies had been and remain viable contributors to our success, and this was certainly true throughout 2015. At the same time, I am pleased with Aflac Japan's significant strides in further developing our alliance with Japan Post throughout the year. We completed the expansion of the number of post offices and their agents selling their products to more than 20,000 analysts during 2015. With this expansion, we continue to ramp up our training of Japan Post employs to ensure they have the knowledge and tools to sell Aflac products successfully. The catch-22 of tremendous sales results is the difficult comparisons they create. As we indicated, we believe the sales of third sector products in 2016 will be down mid-single digits following another year of outstanding sales in 2015. 
However, looking further out, we continue to view Aflac Japan's long-term compound annual growth rate as being in the range of 4% to 6%. 
Now turning to Aflac U.S., 2015 was a year of building our business through our carrier and broker distribution channels. We not only enhanced our carrier sales management infrastructure over the last 1.5 years, but we also laid the foundation for greater opportunities within the broker market. As you saw in the earnings release, Aflac U.S. hit an all-time record for the quarter with a premium amount of $497 million in new sales, which equated to a 9.6% increase. I'm especially happy with the fourth quarter, given that it followed a 14.1% sales increase in the prior year. 
Our quarterly results exceeded our expectations and drove our total sales of $1.5 billion, which translates to a 3.7% increase for the year. Our sales results for 2016 exemplified that we have been communicated. Our sales are increasingly concentrated toward the end of the fourth quarter, and we believe this will continue to be the case. As you all well know, success and opportunities breach competition. That combined with a clear need of voluntary products has resulted in a number of other companies that are in the voluntary supplemental insurance market. These have included insurance carriers who sell voluntary insurance as well as companies involved in various aspects of healthcare management. But keep in mind, Aflac's singular focus on supplemental voluntary products has greatly contributed to our dominant position in the work side insurance market, and I believe will continue to drive our competitive edge. 
One Day Pay remains a differentiator for Aflac. We will continue our promotion of One Day Pay to consumers, which we believe will help increase brand loyalty and account penetration. Here is the maintenance statistics. In 2015, we paid 1.2 million clients a 100% of eligible One Day Pay claims submitted were paid within one day. I think we will pay over 2 million One Day Pay claims in 2016. In the minds of consumers, already high integrity jumped back 22%, the biggest move ever and we believe it's because of One Day Pay. Paying claims in just one day translates to this statement from consumers. ""If you are paying it in just one day, you must be a good company and with high integrity."" Also independent research continues to show that there is no doubt Americans consumers need cash quickly and paying claims fast and fairly sets us apart from the competition. 
Even further differentiating Aflac, I am also proud that Aflac's contact center has been recognized by J.D. Powers for providing outstanding customer service experience. This recognition is based on successful completion of an audit and exceeding a customer satisfaction benchmark. It is these kinds of initiatives and feedback that demonstrate our commitment to delivering all our promise to our policyholders. While 2015 was a year of building, we see 2016 as the year of stabilization and growth. We continue to believe that Aflac U.S. annualized premium sales growth in 2016 will be in the range of 3% to 5%. 
Turning to capital deployment, Fred will provide more details shortly, but let me just say that we view growing the cash dividend and purchasing our shares as the most attractive means of deploying capital, particularly in the absence of any compelling alternatives. Our plan for 2016 is to repurchase $1.4 billion of our shares, and we anticipate concentrating the majority in the first half of the year. As we indicated last quarter, 2015 was a 33rd consecutive year, in which we have increased the cash dividend. Our objective is to grow the dividend at a rate generally in line with the increases in operating earnings per diluted share before the impact of foreign currency translation. 
I will conclude by reiterating how proud I am of our teams in both the United States and in Japan, as they worked hard to generate our 2015 results. I have been in the business for more than 40 years now, and I'm truly excited today, more than I'm ever been, about Aflac's future. So now, let me turn the program over to Fred for financial results and outlook. Fred?"

Our Japan segment margins came in strong driven by continued favorable benefit ratios. We had a few adjustments to reserves in the quarter, result of our year end actuarial work. These adjustments were largely offsetting and on a net basis contributed modestly to the outperformance in the period. Our expense ratio came in favorable to our expectations, as we are balancing investments with continued focus on expense managing. We would expect both our benefit and expense ratios to normalize within our outlook call guidance range as we move into 2016. 
In the U.S., benefit ratios were considerably better than last year's quarter, but fairly consistent with our strong performance throughout 2015 and at the favorable end of our outlook call guidance range. As with Japan, our quarterly and year-end actuarial work resulted in certain reserve adjustments that were largely offsetting. Our expense ratio in the U.S. was elevated in the quarter. This is not unusual in the fourth quarter and roughly in line with last year's quarter and, in part, reflects the conscious decision to accelerate certain investments in our platform. 
Turning to investments. Throughout 2015, we were successful in defending net investment income, recognizing that as higher yield in securities mature, we are investing new money into a low rate environment and need to proceed with caution given market volatility. As we noted during our outlook call, this dynamic represents a natural headwind to investment income in 2016. We continue our efforts to build a position in diversified asset classes, helping to support higher long-term returns. Our capital and liquidity position remain strong. As this is typically the case, we have only estimates on SMR and RBC at this time, but expect both to remain strong and consistent with recent periods. Between dividends and repurchase, we returned just over $400 million to our shareholders in the quarter and achieved our guidance of 1.3 billion in repurchase for the year. 
Before I turn the call back over to Robin for Q&A, I'd like to comment on recent market volatility, the relative strength of our financial position and our outlook. The month of January has certainly been extraordinary with the return of credit and equity market volatility, continuation of the low rate environment in the U.S. and Japan, and a concern over energy and commodity prices and related exposures. In the case of Aflac, recent Bank of Japan actions drove our renewed focus on Japan rates and the yen. I think the following considerations are important and support the investment thesis that Aflac is well positioned to perform in the phase of market volatility. First, our core franchise in Japan and the U.S. supplemental health markets remain strong with natural demographic and economic catalysts, driving core underwriting margins and favorable trends. These core franchise growth and earnings drivers are largely unaffected by recent market volatility. Second, as with the rest of the industry, we are carefully monitoring interest rates. As Dan mentioned in his comments and consistent with Paul's strategic outlook in December, the recent move in Japan rates simply reinforces our strategy to actively manage down the sale of lump sum first sector products, focusing on appropriately priced level premium product in support of our high return third sector business and our core agency distribution network. 
From a financial impact standpoint, we have concluded all of our year-end actuarial work, including review and testing of core assumptions and maintain very strong margins across all material blocks of business and have very little liability and balance sheet risk associated with very low to very long interest rates. In terms of Investment Strategy, we are only in the beginning stages of building our growth asset portfolio. Thus, we have modest exposure to naturally volatile asset classes. In some cases, we now have an opportunity to enter these asset classes at better evaluations. With historically low JGB yields, the success of the dollar program and expansion into new asset classes, we have naturally lightened our new money allocation to JGBs and that will continue into 2016. 
In addition, we pre-brought approximately 60% of our JGB budget prior to the BOJ easing announcement of late last week. In terms of the dollar program, we carefully watched our hedging costs, but have been proactive in modestly extending the duration of our hedge positions to reduce exposure to short-term spikes. While our long-term views for hedging cost arrives, we remain comfortably within our tolerances and continue to drive significant value over and above JGB rates. 
Finally, in terms of credit exposure, like the rest of our peers, we are carefully monitoring our exposure to energy sector along with metals and mining. We have a $6.6 billion energy portfolio measured at book value that is well diversified and high quality. Only 7% of the portfolio is below investment grade and effectively all in the BB category. As of the end of January, our below investment grade energy holdings were in an unrealized loss position of only $140 million. As we analyzed security by security holdings, we do not see acute default risk, but do note that downgrade risk is present and pricing is under significant pressure on select names, which could result in accounting-driven impairments and securities trade at deep discount for prolonged periods. 
In summary, core margins are expected to remain strong and largely resilient to market volatility. Balance sheet exposures to low for long rates in the U.S. and Japan are modest. And our general account assets are defensively positioned with limited exposure to naturally volatile asset classes, and we are well positioned in terms of our energy and energy-related exposures. We, therefore, have made no adjustments to our earnings per share guidance of $6.17 to $6.41, assuming an average exchange rate of roughly JPY 121 to the $1. And capital deployment guidance provided in our December outlook call remains the same. Based on our capital conditions, earnings and cash flow stability, we are maintaining our repurchase target for 2016 at $1.4 billion. Having repatriated additional excess capital in the fourth quarter, we are front-end loading approximately $1 billion of repurchase in the first half of the year. Our performance in the fourth quarter certainly bodes well for 2016, but it is obviously very early in the year, and we will update accordingly. 
Thank you, and I will now hand the call back to Robin to begin Q&A. Robin?"

And it sounded like you are actively looking at different blocks, and the market was active there. So I'd like to get an update on what that outlook looks like, because if we're going to continue to have high levels of buyback kind of looking forward in 2017, it seems there needs to be another material reinsurance transaction at sometime this year."

So we repatriated an additional JPY 60 billion, as you know, in the fourth quarter, roughly USD 500 million. That has built up a liquidity position at the holding company, which we are now spending down in the form of front-end loading and repurchase of approximately $1 billion of our $1.4 billion target in 2016. You are also correct, and note that over the past few years, we have benefited some from elevated repatriation and cash flow related to these reinsurance transactions. I would note, however, that we have had a balanced approach to the use of proceeds, if you will, on freed up capital from reinsurance, roughly 40% or so dedicated to shoring up our SMR ratio and protecting the capital strength of our insurance franchise. The remaining 60% then repatriated only after being comfortable with our capital ratios. That is roughly the same type of approach that we would take forward, if we did in fact continue to entertain reinsurance transactions. Right now, we are out there with a long-range guidance of 2015 to 2017 of excess capital of $6.3 billion to $7.5 billion. We remain consistent in that number. The difference between 6.3 and 7.5 is tied up in excess capital, some of which is in Japan and could be unlocked via reinsurance. Our basic approach to that, Randy, is that to be opportunistic and defensive. Meaning, if there are compelling opportunities to unlock and go through the exercise of unlocking that excess capital for redeployment at higher returns, we'll entertain that. We also, though, wanted to be defensive as we make our way through market volatility and watch things unfold over the next year or 2. We want to be equally careful to recognize that excess capital needs to be held in some cases to defend the balance sheet. So it's a balanced approach. We don't have any reinsurance dialed into our estimates for 2016, as I mentioned on the outlook call, but we'll continue to watch markets unfold and look for opportunities."

And then, I guess the capital absorption in a downside scenario, is that -- are you thinking like low -- yours thinking kind of further moves by the BOJ on Japanese interest rates? Is that the main shock you would be looking at? Or are you thinking more on the credit side -- what would that main concern be there?"

So first part of your question, we continue to maintain healthy reinsurance relationships. And in fact, we have even got commitments, if you will, for unfunded reinsurance that allows us the flexibility to pull down reinsurance, if necessary, for either defensive or offensive groups. And that's largely a healthy approach because we are talking about health businesses and morbidity risk, which is an attractive type of risk to take in the capital markets these days by reinsurers. And becomes it's unaffected by capital market volatility, it tends to be something we can count on with reliability. So I'm not at all concerned about the nature of the discussions with reinsurers and our access to reinsurance. The issue is more whether or not it make sense from a capital strength standpoint or an opportunity standpoint to entertain any of those transactions. And then in terms of the second part of your question, as I mentioned in my comments, we are very well positioned relative to low for long interest rates, and that is not my concern relative to balance sheet. It's an issue relative to watching our earnings trajectory going forward, as I have mentioned, but it's not a balance sheet issue as we have very little relative liabilities exposed to low for long rates. The bigger issue is whether or not we are entering into the early stages of a credit cycle and being careful about that. All eyes are on, of course, the energy market and commodities, but more broadly, we need to be careful about whether or not a mild or moderate credit cycle is in front of us. So it's a good time to be careful. I think spreads have widened, which is usually a signal, downgrades are outpacing upgrades modestly right now even beyond the energy sector. So we have to be careful to watch that, but as I said, we are particularly well positioned and we naturally have a defensive general account, because we haven't been as aggressive as many in the industry in terms of entering into more volatile asset classes. We're just starting to begin there."

Well, as everybody knows, we have been expecting hedge cost to go up and, in fact, that's the case about a year or so ago. They were running about 60 basis points.

Well, as everybody knows, we have been expecting hedge cost to go up and, in fact, that's the case about a year or so ago. They were running about 60 basis points. Now, they are running about 130 to 140. And that's including the actions by the BOJ the other day, which increased the hedge cost around 10 to 15. Having said that, we were planning for hedge costs in 2016 to be upwards of 180, 190 basis points based on where markets were back in the third quarter, meaning look at what the Fed was going to do for potential rate hikes, this new information from Japan. And even at that level of 180 basis points to 200 basis points, we still deem our portfolio to be very profitable versus buying a portfolio of JGB's, which is what we measured against. And part of that is because new investments on the U.S. dollar program were going into higher yields and higher spreads. We did take advantage throughout the allocation of some of the dislocation and the high yields in the bank loan market, which get us higher yields. And we have continued to see JGB yields go down. So that creates a widespread. But importantly, relative to the program, the fact is that monetary policy around the globe continues to be easy; i.e., the Bank of Japan, but the Federal Reserve is unlikely to raise more time, unless there is really strong economic growth in the U.S. So when you look at things like forward curves, the 180 to 200 that we thought it was going to go to is unlikely to be realized this year. It most likely will continue to be lower. Nevertheless, we have programs and analysis that looks at this continually and the tools that we have are either find higher-yielding assets and to Fred's point earlier, as we are starting to explode growth assets, those have higher yields and returns and fixed income continue to modify the types of hedges we have. Again, Fred mentioned that we've lengthened the duration of some of our hedges, which has helped us to lock in some lower cost. So those are the parameters we continue to look out to improve the performance of the program, but it's holding us much better than we would have expected. And monetary policy is in our favor right now. And Fred, may be, you want to talk about below the line?"

Jimmy, let me begin by saying that 13.4% increase in sales last year creates your first hurdle. You are correct. We're having very difficult comparisons and that's going to persist throughout the year. We do believe that we'll have a strong year, but without a product launch of one of our major core products that being a complete revitalization of either our cancer or medical plan, we are in a year where we're going to have what we consider to be more moderate product launches and, therefore, we believe the sales comparisons, especially against such a large year, will be difficult. We have some product launches smaller and major that we'll look forward in the first half of the year. And then as I mentioned on the outlook call, we'll be launching a completely new product line that we believe will enhance the second half of the year. That said, as is in the case in Japan, when you do things that are brand-new to the company, they tend to have a much lower adoption rate as well as a much slower rate of usage by different channels, as we both negotiate with those channels as well as teach them the process or sales of that product. And so we expect 2016 to be a year where we are enhancing our products and opening up new potential growth, but we expect the majority of that growth to happen beyond 2016. Unfortunately, I can't go into the specifics about the products and sales, but we feel very comfortable with our plan and our plan for '17 and '18 beyond that."

But as my comments in my prepared remarks, we would expect our expense ratio in 2016 to fall back down within the guidance range that we provided for the year. You had a couple of things going on expense wise. You had some acceleration of expenses. You had some miscellaneous items running through the expense line, which will happen from quarter to quarter and naturally fluctuate. One other item I would note is that we did have a bit more dock amortization in the quarter. And in fact, we believe this relates also to modestly improved benefit ratio in the period and that while lapse rates were not unusually outside our expectation, what lapsed in terms of the mix of business that lapsed tended to be policies that were carrying higher reserves and higher dock balances. As a result, it tended to push up a better benefit ratio, if you will, or improve our benefit ratio, I should say, and pushed up our expense ratio a little bit.

When we think about first sector products, as we mentioned in the past, we really divide it into 2 categories: First is the lump sum products and second is more of a level premium products. And with those lump sum products, we believe that especially given the low interest rate environment, it is not in our best interest to focus on those products. And as a result, we put strong pressure on those sales. We put caps in place and we believe that the lump sum will be down as much as 50% or more in 2016. As it relates to our level premium products, however, we believe those still are a strong enhancement to our portfolio, primarily because of the cross sale we are getting with our traditional third sector products with cancer and medical. And those products continue to be an overall positive for us. We believe that though the sales of those will remain relatively flat for the foreseeable future, in terms of the BOJ impact to our third sector products, at this point, we don't expect it to have a significant impact. The level of the overall competition in third sector products, especially in medical, remains high, but we don't expect there to be any short-term impact to expedite or make that much faster. I hope that answers."

So the returns are good in our view and priced appropriately. I think we are right in line with competitive pricing in the marketplace. I don't view ourselves as being priced to drive business growth. I think we're doing it the old-fashioned way. What I would say is because we are in such a growth mode on the group side, we're obviously investing heavier in the group platform to absorb that growth and build for further growth.

While I think that aspect has been stabilizing, it's been favorable and remains favorable. The other dynamic that I mentioned is that in this particular quarter, we also had lapse rates played in, meaning not so much how much lapsed, but the nature of the product that lapsed in the period. The product tended to carry on average higher reserves and so there was a greater release of reserves, if you will, related to the lapsation. This also, as I mentioned, played into accelerated dock amortization and weighed on the expense ratio. As we look at the year-over-year trend, as I mentioned earlier, we would approximate the impact of that dynamic to be in and around a 100 basis points related to benefit ratio improvements. Again, that's based on the actuarial information we have and analyzing the nature of products that's lapsed. So I think that mix of business in lapsation, that will go on from quarter to quarter; this is not an unusual quarter. The mix of business will be different from time to time. We will monitor it going forward, but right now, we hold to the benefit ratio guidance that we've provided on the U.S."

Remember what I said earlier, we now have a portfolio of hedge instruments of different types, and we stratified the maturities of those. So when I say hedge costs are 130 to 140, those are current annualized hedge costs. Our realized hedge costs will most likely overtime be lower than the annualized. So to Fred's point, to answer your question specifically requires a little bit of putting it down on paper, but also not all of our hedges are forwards, though those hedge costs pertain to forward contracts. Predominantly, we are in forwards, but we do use power instruments as well and colors could have a settlement, but that will be more dependent on the level of the yen where it settles versus how we strike the colors. And currently, we have about 1.2 billion-or-so of collars and the rest of forwards. So it's a little bit more complex to answer your question, but I would say this for today.

Good morning, and thank you for joining us. If we look back on 2015, Aflac 60th year of operations, let me start off by saying that the final quarter of 2015 concluded another great year for Aflac. What's been true for these 6",1347,"All right. Thank you, Robin. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. If we look back on 2015, Aflac 60th year of operations, let me start off by saying that the final quarter of 2015 concluded another great year for Aflac. What's been true for these 6 decades and what separates us from every other competitor is our distinct product focus on voluntary and supplemental insurance in both the United States and in Japan. That kind of direct approach has been a major factor in our success, and I believe it will continue to propel our leading position in the future. I'm especially pleased that our operating earnings per share growth before currency exceeded our expectations for the year, rising 7.5%. I think this is especially notable, given historically low interest rates, market volatility and economic uncertainty in the world. I couldn't be more proud that the hard work and accomplishments of our management team, employees and sales distribution in Japan and the United States. It is an honor to work alongside our team who are dedicated to enhancing our long-term growth of the company and who represent all that Aflac stands for, the Aflac Way. 
Now I will provide you some highlights related to our Japanese operations, where I believe we set the standard in many ways for other insurance companies in Japan. We are not only the pioneer and leading provider of cancer insurance, but we are also the #1 seller of medical insurance too. This is particularly impressive given our increasing competitive medical market for insurance has become in Japan. But our relevant products, trusted brand and diverse distribution are a powerful combination that's very hard to compete with and it propelled Aflac to insure 1 out of 4 households. I am thrilled with Aflac Japan's tremendous annual growth of 13.4% increase in sales for third sector products, which surpassed our original expectation considerably. Not only were our 2015 results impressive across all channels, but we pointed out in our release last night that third sector sales increase for 2015 is particularly phenomenal because that marked the second highest annual third sector growth in 10 years. 
On the product side, it's exciting that sales of our founding [ph] cancer insurance were up a tremendous 40.6% for the year. As the pioneer of cancer insurance, this remarkable result underscores the importance of Japanese consumers' place on selecting a brand they know and trust. 
Turning to first sector products, the actions taken by the Bank of Japan on Friday resulted in JGB yields decline, as well as additional weakening of the yen to the dollar. 
As discussed on our December outlook call, we have taken steps to control the sale of first sector products as we enter 2016. Managing through the low-interest-rate environment is nothing new to Aflac Japan. The actions of the Bank of Japan simply reinforce our strategy, and we will continue to remove potential and further actions as the rate environment plays out. Fred will touch on the financial considerations in his comments. 
Looking at our distribution side, our traditional agencies have been and remain vital contributors to our success, and this was certainly true throughout 2015. At the same time, I am pleased with Aflac Japan's significant strides in further developing our alliance with Japan Post throughout the year. We completed the expansion of the number of post offices and their agents selling their products to more than 20,000 outlets during 2015. With this expansion, we continue to ramp up our training of Japan Post employees to ensure they have the knowledge and tools to sell Aflac products successfully. The catch-22 of tremendous sales results is the difficult comparisons they create. As we indicated, we believe the sales of third sector products in 2016 will be down mid-single digits following another year of outstanding sales in 2015. 
However, looking further out, we continue to view Aflac Japan's long-term compound annual growth rate as being in the range of 4% to 6%. 
Now turning to Aflac U.S., 2015 was a year of building our business through our career and broker distribution channels. We not only enhanced our career sales management infrastructure over the last 1.5 years, but we also laid the foundation for greater opportunities within the broker market. As you saw in the earnings release, Aflac U.S. hit an all-time record for the quarter, with the premium amount of $497 million in new sales, which equated to a 9.6% increase. I'm especially happy with the fourth quarter, given that it followed a 14.1% sales increase in the prior year. 
Our quarterly results exceeded our expectations and drove our total sales of $1.5 billion, which translates to a 3.7% increase for the year. Our sales results for 2016 exemplified that we have been communicating. Our sales are increasingly concentrated toward the end of the fourth quarter, and we believe this will continue to be the case. As you all well know, success and opportunities breeds competition. That combined with a clear need for voluntary products has resulted in a number of other companies that are in the voluntary supplemental insurance market. These have included insurance carriers who sell voluntary insurance as well as companies involved in various aspects of healthcare management. But keep in mind, Aflac's singular focus on supplemental voluntary products has greatly contributed to our dominant position in the worksite insurance market, and I believe will continue to drive our competitive edge. 
One Day Pay remains a differentiator for Aflac. We will continue our promotion of One Day Pay to consumers, which we believe will help increase brand loyalty and account penetration. Here's an amazing statistic; in 2015, we paid 1.2 million claims, a 100% of the eligible One Day Pay claims submitted were paid within one day. I think we will pay over 2 million One Day Pay claims in 2016. In the minds of consumers, our already high integrity jumped by 22%, the biggest move ever and we believe it's because of One Day Pay. Paying claims in just one day translates to this statement from consumers. ""If you are paying it in just one day, you must be a good company and with high integrity."" Also, independent research continues to show that there is no doubt Americans consumers need cash quickly and paying claims fast and fairly sets us apart from the competition. 
Even further differentiating Aflac, I am also proud that Aflac's Contact Center has been recognized by J.D. Powers for providing outstanding customer service experience. This recognition is based on successful completion of an audit and exceeding a customer satisfaction benchmark. It is these kinds of initiatives and feedback that demonstrate our commitment to delivering on our promise to our policyholders. While 2015 was a year of building, we see 2016 as the year of stabilization and growth. We continue to believe that Aflac U.S. annualized premium sales growth in 2016 will be in the range of 3% to 5%. 
Turning to capital deployment, Fred will provide more details shortly, but let me just say that we view growing the cash dividend and purchasing our shares as the most attractive means of deploying capital, particularly in the absence of any compelling alternatives. Our plan for 2016 is to repurchase $1.4 billion of our shares, and we anticipate concentrating the majority in the first half of the year. As we indicated last quarter, 2015 was the 33rd consecutive year in which we have increased the cash dividend. Our objective is to grow the dividend at a rate generally in line with the increases in operating earnings per diluted share before the impact of foreign currency translation. 
I will conclude by reiterating how proud I am of our teams in both the United States and in Japan, as they've worked hard to generate our 2015 results. I have been in the business for more than 40 years now and I'm truly excited today, more than I've ever been, about Aflac's future. So now, let me turn the program over to Fred for financial results and outlook. Fred?"

You've all had a chance to review the details in our earnings release. As Dan noted in his comments, our fourth quarter and full year results exceeded the high end of our earnings guidance, driven by strong overall margins in both the U.S.",1161,"Thank you, Dan. You've all had a chance to review the details in our earnings release. As Dan noted in his comments, our fourth quarter and full year results exceeded the high end of our earnings guidance, driven by strong overall margins in both the U.S. and Japan. The only notable item to call out in the quarter was a favorable adjustment to certain retirement benefit liabilities as a result of refining our assumptions. These adjustments impacted our parent company only results and contributed approximately $13 million pretax or $0.02 per share to the quarter's earnings. Our Japan segment margins came in strong, driven by continued favorable benefit ratios. We had a few adjustments to reserves in the quarter, a result of our year-end actuarial work. These adjustments were largely offsetting and on a net basis contributed modestly to the outperformance in the period. Our expense ratio came in favorable to our expectations, as we are balancing investments with continued focus on expense managing. We would expect both our benefit and expense ratios to normalize within our outlook call guidance range as we move into 2016. 
In the U.S., benefit ratios were considerably better than last year's quarter, but fairly consistent with our strong performance throughout 2015 and at the favorable end of our outlook call guidance range. As with Japan, our quarterly and year-end actuarial work resulted in certain reserve adjustments that were largely offsetting. Our expense ratio in the U.S. was elevated in the quarter. This is not unusual in the fourth quarter and roughly in line with last year's quarter and, in part, reflects a conscious decision to accelerate certain investments in our platform. 
Turning to investments. Throughout 2015, we were successful in defending net investment income, recognizing that, as higher yield in securities mature, we are investing new money into a low rate environment and need to proceed with caution given market volatility. As we noted during our outlook call, this dynamic represents a natural headwind to investment income in 2016. We continue our efforts to build a position in diversified asset classes, helping to support higher long-term returns. Our capital and liquidity position remain strong. As is typically the case, we have only estimates on SMR and RBC at this time, but expect both to remain strong and consistent with recent periods. Between dividends and repurchase, we returned just over $400 million to our shareholders in the quarter and achieved our guidance of 1.3 billion in repurchase for the year. 
Before I turn the call back over to Robin for Q&A, I'd like to comment on recent market volatility, the relative strength of our financial position, and our outlook. The month of January has certainly been extraordinary, with the return of credit and equity market volatility, a continuation of the low rate environment in the U.S. and Japan, and a concern over energy and commodity prices and related exposures. In the case of Aflac, recent Bank of Japan actions draw a renewed focus on Japan rates and the yen. I think the following considerations are important and support the investment thesis that Aflac is well positioned to perform in the face of market volatility. First, our core franchise in Japan and the U.S. supplemental health markets remain strong with natural demographic and economic catalysts driving core underwriting margins and favorable trends. These core franchise growth and earnings drivers are largely unaffected by recent market volatility. Second, as with the rest of the industry, we are carefully monitoring interest rates. As Dan mentioned in his comments and consistent with Paul's strategic outlook in December, the recent move in Japan rates simply reinforces our strategy to actively manage down the sale of lump sum first sector products, focusing on appropriately priced level premium product in support of our high return third sector business and our core agency distribution network. 
From a financial impact standpoint, we have concluded all of our year-end actuarial work, including review and testing of core assumptions and maintain very strong margins across all material blocks of business and have very little liability and balance sheet risk associated with very low, for very long, interest rates. In terms of Investment Strategy, we are only in the beginning stages of building our growth asset portfolio, thus, we have modest exposure to naturally volatile asset classes. In some cases, we now have an opportunity to enter these asset classes at better valuations. With historically low JGB yields, the success of the dollar program, and expansion into new asset classes, we have naturally lightened our new money allocation to JGBs and that will continue into 2016. 
In addition, we pre-brought approximately 60% of our JGB budget prior to the BOJ easing announcement of late last week. In terms of the dollar program, we carefully watch our hedging costs, but have been proactive in modestly extending the duration of our hedge positions to reduce exposure to short-term spikes. While our long-term view is for hedging cost to rise, we remain comfortably within our tolerances and continue to drive significant value over and above JGB rates. 
Finally, in terms of credit exposure, like the rest of our peers, we are carefully monitoring our exposure to energy sector, along with metals and mining. We have a $6.6 billion energy portfolio measured at book value that is well-diversified and high quality. Only 7% of the portfolio is below investment grade and effectively all in the BB category. As of the end of January, our below investment grade energy holdings were in an unrealized loss position of only $140 million. As we analyzed security by security holdings, we do not see acute default risk, but do note that downgrade risk is present and pricing is under significant pressure on select names, which could result in accounting-driven impairments as securities trade at deep discount for prolonged periods. 
In summary, core margins are expected to remain strong and largely resilient to market volatility. Balance sheet exposures to low for long rates in the U.S. and Japan are modest. And our general account assets are defensively positioned with limited exposure to naturally volatile asset classes, and we are well positioned in terms of our energy and energy-related exposures. We, therefore, have made no adjustments to our earnings per share guidance of $6.17 to $6.41, assuming an average exchange rate of roughly JPY 121 to the $1. And capital deployment guidance provided in our December outlook call remains the same. Based on our capital conditions, earnings and cash flow stability, we are maintaining our repurchase target for 2016 at $1.4 billion. Having repatriated additional excess capital in the fourth quarter, we are front-end loading approximately $1 billion of repurchase in the first half of the year. Our performance in the fourth quarter certainly bodes well for 2016, but it is obviously very early in the year, and we will update accordingly. 
Thank you, and I will now hand the call back to Robin to begin Q&A. Robin?"

That is roughly the same type of approach that we would take going forward, if we did in fact continue to entertain reinsurance transactions. Right now, we are out there with a long-range guidance of 2015 to 2017 of excess capital of $6.3 billion to $7.5 billion. We remain consistent in that number. The difference between 6.3 and 7.5 is tied up in excess capital, some of which is in Japan and could be unlocked via reinsurance. Our basic approach to that, Randy, is that to be opportunistic and defensive. Meaning, if there are compelling opportunities to unlock and go through the exercise of unlocking that excess capital for redeployment at higher returns, we'll entertain that. We also, though, want to be defensive as we make our way through market volatility and watch things unfold over the next year or 2. We want to be equally careful to recognize that excess capital needs to be held in some cases to defend the balance sheet. So it's a balanced approach. We don't have any reinsurance dialed into our estimates for 2016, as I mentioned on the outlook call, but we'll continue to watch markets unfold and look for opportunities."

And then, I guess the capital absorption in a downside scenario, is that -- are you thinking like low -- your thinking kind of further moves by the BOJ on Japanese interest rates? Is that the main shock you would be looking at? Or are you thinking more on the credit side -- what would that main concern be there?"

So first part of your question, we continue to maintain healthy reinsurance relationships. And in fact, we have even got commitments, if you will, for unfunded reinsurance that allows us the flexibility to pull down reinsurance, if necessary, for either defensive or offensive moves. And that's largely a healthy approach because we are talking about health businesses and morbidity risk, which is an attractive type of risk to take in the capital markets these days by reinsurers. And because it's unaffected by capital market volatility, it tends to be something we can count on with reliability. So I'm not at all concerned about the nature of the discussions with reinsurers and our access to reinsurance. The issue is more whether or not it make sense from a capital strength standpoint or an opportunity standpoint to entertain any of those transactions. And then in terms of the second part of your question, as I mentioned in my comments, we are very well positioned relative to low for long interest rates, and that is not my concern relative to balance sheet. It's an issue relative to watching our earnings trajectory going forward, as I have mentioned, but it's not a balance sheet issue as we have very little relative liabilities exposed to low for long rates. The bigger issue is whether or not we are entering into the early stages of a credit cycle and being careful about that. All eyes are on, of course, the energy market and commodities, but more broadly, we need to be careful about whether or not a mild or moderate credit cycle is in front of us and so it's a good time to be careful. I think spreads have widened, which is usually a signal, downgrades are outpacing upgrades modestly right now, even beyond the energy sector. So we have to be careful to watch that, but as I said, we are particularly well positioned and we naturally have a defensive general account, because we haven't been as aggressive as many in the industry in terms of entering into more volatile asset classes, we're just starting to begin now."

Well, as everybody knows, we have been expecting hedge cost to go up and, in fact, that's the case about a year or so ago, they were running about 60 basis points. Now, they are running about 130 to 140 and that's including the actions by the BOJ the other day, which increased the hedge cost around 10 to 15. Having said that, we were planning for hedge costs in 2016 to be upwards of 180, 190 basis points, based on where markets were back in the third quarter, meaning look at what the Fed was going to do for potential rate hikes, this new information from Japan. And even at that level, of 180 basis points to 200 basis points, we still deem our portfolio to be very profitable versus buying a portfolio of JGB's, which is what we measure it against. And part of that is because new investments on the U.S. dollar program were going in at higher yields and higher spreads. We did take advantage, through asset allocation, of some of the dislocation in the high yield in the bank loan market, which get us higher yields. And we have continued to see JGB yields go down. So that creates a wider spread. But importantly, relative to the program, the fact is that monetary policy around the globe continues to be easy; i.e., the Bank of Japan, but the Federal Reserve is unlikely to raise 4x unless there is really strong economic growth in the U.S. So when you look at things like forward curves, the 180 to 200 that we thought it was going to go to is unlikely to be realized this year. It most likely will continue to be lower. Nevertheless, we have programs and analysis that looks at this continually and the tools that we have are either: find higher-yielding assets, and to Fred's point earlier, as we are starting to explore growth assets, those have higher yields and returns than fixed income; continue to modify the types of hedges we have,  again, Fred mentioned that we've lengthened the duration of some of our hedges which has helped us to lock in some lower cost. So those are the parameters we continue to look at to improve the performance of the program, but it's holding up much better than we would have expected and monetary policy is in our favor right now. And Fred, maybe you want to talk about below the line?"

Jimmy, let me begin by saying that the 13.4% increase in sales last year creates your first hurdle. You are correct, we are up against very difficult comparisons and that's going to persist throughout the year. We do believe that we'll have a strong year, but without a product launch of one of our major core products, that being a complete revitalization of either our cancer or medical plan, we are in a year where we're going to have what we consider to be more moderate product launches and, therefore, we believe that the sales comparisons, especially against such a large year, will be difficult. We have some product launches, smaller in nature, that we'll look for in the first half of the year. And then as I mentioned on the outlook call, we'll be launching a completely new product line that we believe will enhance the second half of the year. That said, as is in the case in Japan, when you do things that are brand-new to the company, they tend to have a much slower adoption rate as well as a much slower rate of usage by different channels as we both negotiate with those channels as well as teach them the process for sales of that product. And so we expect 2016 to be a year where we are enhancing our products and opening up new potential growth, but we expect the majority of that growth to happen beyond 2016. Unfortunately, I can't go into the specifics about the products themselves, but we feel very comfortable with our plan and our plan for '17 and '18 beyond that."

You had a couple of things going on expense-wise. You had some acceleration of expenses. You had some miscellaneous items running through the expense line, which will happen from quarter to quarter and naturally fluctuate. One other item I would note is that we did have a bit more DAC amortization in the quarter and in fact, we believe this relates also to a modestly improved benefit ratio in the period and that; while lapse rates were not unusually outside our expectation, what lapsed, in terms of the mix of business that lapsed, tended to be policies that were carrying higher reserves and higher DAC balances. As a result, it tended to push up a better benefit ratio, if you will, or improve our benefit ratio, I should say, and pushed up our expense ratio a little bit. Estimates, in and around 100 basis points, but I would certainly say approximately, just to give you an idea. So on the expense side, we would expect to settle back down into our guidance. I do think you should expect what has been a natural seasonal pattern here at the company, that we tend to move through the year well within the ranges, but it's not uncommon for us to see a little bit of elevated expense ratio in the fourth quarter."

What I would tell you is that we certainly price the product with a notion of meeting our return expectations and, obviously, more than -- and comfortably covering our cost of capital. So the returns are good in our view and priced appropriately. I think we are right in line with competitive pricing in the marketplace. I don't view ourselves as being priced to drive business growth, I think we're doing it the old-fashioned way. What I would say is because we are in such a growth mode on the group side, we're obviously investing heavier in the group platform to absorb that growth and build for further growth. So because it has been a relatively recent tick up in brokered group sales, we are heavily investing and that weighs down on our reported, if you will, returns.

While I think that aspect has been stabilizing, it's been favorable and remains favorable. The other dynamic that I mentioned is that in this particular quarter, we also had lapse rates played in, meaning not so much how much lapsed, but the nature of the product that lapsed in the period. The product tended to carry on average higher reserves and so there was a greater release of reserves, if you will, related to the lapsation. This also, as I mentioned, played into accelerated DAC amortization and weighed on the expense ratio. As we look at the year-over-year trend, as I mentioned earlier, we would approximate the impact of that dynamic to be in and around a 100 basis points related to benefit ratio improvements. Again, that's based on the actuarial information we have and analyzing the nature of products that's lapsed. So I think that mix of business in lapsation, that will go on from quarter to quarter; this is not an unusual quarter. The mix of business will be different from time to time. We will monitor it going forward, but right now, we hold to the benefit ratio guidance that we've provided on the U.S."

Remember what I said earlier, we now have a portfolio of hedge instruments of different types, and we stratify the maturities of those. So when I say hedge costs are 130 to 140, those are current annualized hedge costs. Our realized hedge costs will most likely over time be lower than the annualized. So to Fred's point, to answer your question specifically requires a little bit of putting it down on paper, but also not all of our hedges are forwards, though those hedge costs pertain to forward contracts. Predominantly, we are in forwards, but we do use collars instruments as well and collars could have a settlement, but that will be more dependent on the level of the yen, where it settles versus how we strike the collars. And currently, we have about 1.2 billion-or-so of collars and the rest of forwards.

Let me begin by saying that the first quarter of 2016 was a great start for Aflac. Let me first provide an update on Aflac Japan, our largest earnings contributor. You will recall that the last quarter that we anticipated sales products would be down mid-single digits for the full year following very strong production results in 2015, and that is still the case. However, sales of Aflac Japan's third sector products were up 1% for the quarter, which means we're running ahead of expectations for the third quarter sales. No one aspect of our business is contributing to outperformance. It simply stronger-than-expected productivity across all key distribution channels. We continue to believe the long-term compound annual growth of third sector products will be in the range 4% to 6%. Consistent with our expectations, sales of first sector products were elevated in the quarter as discussed on our fourth quarter conference call, steps to control the sale of first sector products are being taken, and we continue to implement various substantial actions later in the second quarter. These include a combination of production commission restructuring, product repricing and in select cases, product discontinued. As a result of these planned actions, we anticipate seeing at least 50% decline in first sector product sales namely: WAYS in the second half of 2016 compared to the second half of 2015. Managing through the low-interest rate environment is nothing new to Aflac Japan. Paul and the team from Aflac Japan are going to cover this in more details next month at our financial analyst presentation. 
From a product's perspective, we work hard to remain in stack with the launch and needs of the Japanese consumer in our distribution channels. In doing so, we continuously enhance our portfolio of products. This quarter, we introduced a cancer insurance product designed for those who have previously been diagnosed with cancer and been cancer free 5 years just as we do in the United States as well as an enhanced nonstandard medical insurance product. We will continue to be innovative in our providing options that millions of Japanese consumers are looking for as they struggle to bear the financial burden of higher medical expenses. 
From a distribution perspective, our and remain viable contributors to our success and this was certainly true in first quarter. Additionally, all of our alliance partners continue to produce strong results and I'm especially pleased with Japan post and their 20,000-plus postal outlets selling our cancer insurance. Our goal remains to be where the people want to buy and our various distribution outlets broaden our reach. 
Turning to Aflac U.S. You'll recall that 2015 was the year of building our business through our career at broker distribution channels. In doing so, we established a foundation for greater long-term growth opportunities. We see 2016 as the year of stabilization and growth and continue to execute on our strategy. With Aflac generating new annualized premium sales of 3.7%, we're off to a good start towards our expectation of a 3% to 5% sales growth for the U.S. in 2016. I do want to again emphasize that we anticipate our sales will be increasingly concentrated towards the end of the fourth quarter. But what we achieved prior to that lays the groundwork for our ultimate success. 
As you all well know, success and opportunities competition. That combine with the clear need for voluntary products has resulted in company entering the voluntary supplemental insurance market. These have included insurance carriers who sell voluntary insurance as well as companies involved in various aspects of the health care management. As a result, we are executing on strategies designed to increase Aflac's importance to the employer and employees in an effort to drive further growth and penetration in our core supplemental voluntary products. But keep in mind, Aflac's singular focus on supplemental voluntary products has greatly contributed to our dominant position in the worksite insurance industry. And I believe, we will continue to drive us in a competitive edge. Teresa will cover this in more detail at the financial analyst review. One Day Pay also remains a key differentiator for Aflac. We will continue to promote One Day Pay to consumers, which we believe will help drive increase brand loyalty and account penetration. Here is an amazing statistic. In 2015, continuing through the first quarter 100% of the eligible One Day Pay claims submitted were paid within 1 day. I think that we will process more than 2 million One Day Pay claims in 2016. Independent research continues to show that there is no doubt that consumers need cash quickly and paying clients fast and fairly sets us apart from the competition, and I believe, will really drive our sales. 
Turning to capital deployments. Fred will provide more details shortly, but let me just say that we continue to be growing the cash dividend and purchasing our shares as the most attractive means for deploying capital, particularly in the absence of compelling alternatives. Despite recent market volatility, our capital position remains strong, and reinforces our plan of repurchasing $1.4 billion of shares with the majority concentrated in first half of the year. I'll conclude by reiterating that I've been in this business now more than 40 years and I'm more excited today than I've ever been, because of future is so bright at Aflac. Now let me turn it over to Fred for the financial results. Fred?"

You've all had a chance to review the details of our earnings release. As Dan noted in his comments, our first quarter results certainly gave us a great start to the year and achieving our 2016 earning guidance. Our results were driven by strong overall margins in both the U.S. and Japan. Nearly notable item in the quarter was an unfavorable expense item running through our corporate line of approximately $8 million after-tax or $0.02 per share. This item represents an acceleration of stock compensation expense in order to properly reflect our guidelines for retirement eligible employees. We would not expect this portion of the expense to repeat in future quarters and the expense itself is largely a timing issue. Our Japan's segment margins were solid in the quarter, with continued strength and benefit ratios. Routine adjustments to reserves contributed modestly to the performance in the period and reflects favorable claims trends. Our expense ratio came in as expected, and generally in line with our outlook guidance. 
In the U.S., benefit ratios were considerably better than last year's quarter, but fairly consistent with our seasonal expectation for a strong first quarter. Benefit ratios tend to be lower early in the year as policyholders manage deductibles and are less likely to experience routine injuries that come without their activity. Labs rates also tend to be modestly elevated in the first quarter, which has the effect of driving a benefit ratio down in amortization higher. Our overall expense ratio in the U.S. was in line with our expectations as general expenses were down offset by elevated amortization. In Japan and the U.S., we would expect both our benefit and expense ratios to trend within our December outlook guidance ranges as we move into the second quarter and for the remainder of the year. 
Turning to investments. New money rates in Japan were influenced by the of our annual budget of JGBs that serve to depress our purchase yields relative to our full year expectation. This tactical strategy was critical and that we purchased the majority of our JGB budget prior to the BOJ's action, allowing us time to fully implement measures and tend to the sale of certain first sector products while defending profitability. As we move forward, navigating the rate environment in Japan will involve allocations to long-dated JGBs which while low yielding provides certain ALM and capital benefits. We will continue our work to develop alternative yen investments and support our hedged dollar program. U.S. new money rates were influenced by the continued buildout of our strategic asset allocation and were modestly elevated relative to our full year expectations, due to a concentration of purchases in higher yielding middle market loans. We continue our efforts to build a position in diversified asset classes, helping to support higher long-term returns. 
Let me comment for a moment on hedged costs and know that I'll go into some more detail on strategy at our financial analyst briefing in May. We have experienced an increase in hedge costs as compared to last year. This is not only market driven, but somewhat the results of our tactical efforts to extend the average duration of the forwards backing the dollar program. As you know, from our previous comments, the rise in hedge costs was fully expected as recent years have experienced that normally low cost relative to historic norms. As indicated in our press release, we recorded $29 million after-tax or $0.07 a share in hedge costs for the quarter. We record the full cost of forwards upfront in the quarter purchased, thus the timing of what is rolling on and off the program can make a difference in anyone We have approximately $13 billion of dollar buying program hedged with forwards at an estimated full year average pretax cost of roughly 110 basis points. While early in the year in recognizing the accounting treatment, the 110 basis points range is a practical pretax estimate for our full year cost expectations on our existing portfolio, thus assuming no material change in our hedging strategy or market movements. Our capital and liquidity position remained strong. We have only estimates on SMR and RBC at this time, but expect both to remain strong and generally consistent with recent periods despite a return to volatility in the quarter. Impairments in the quarter were modest and prices in our energy portfolio have recovered somewhat after a volatile January and February. Between dividends and repurchase, we returned $773 million to our shareholders in the quarter. Depending on overall capital conditions, we expect to repatriate 80% to 100% of FSA earnings in 2016 or roughly JPY 120 billion to JPY 150 billion. We continue to spend down excess capital held at the holding company in part driven by repatriation of 2015 reinsurance proceeds and are on pace to achieve our $1 billion share repurchase target for the first half of 2016 and $1.4 billion in repurchase for the full year. Our business model is resilient to market volatility and our overall cost of capital continues to decline in contrast to industry players with more exposed business models. We've made no adjustments to our earnings guidance of $6.17 to $6.41 per share assuming the same average exchange rate as last year, which was roughly JPY 121 million to the dollar. Given strength in the yen during the quarter, we have provided in our press release, an EPS range for the second quarter assuming a yen to dollar of 105 to 115. While important to recognize exchange rates with respect to cash flows and capital ratios, we focus on EPS progress on a currency-neutral basis. We believe our performance in the quarter certainly bodes well for 2016. Thank you. And I'll now turn call back to Robin, who'll begin our Q&A session. Robin?"

There are a couple of components to be mind for strengthening yen. One is, because we, of course, have a dollar program where we're generating dollar based income from the investment perspective, on a cash basis, you're needing to convert that dollar back into yen and as a converse, it will actually be a headwind to FSA earnings. And so when it comes to looking at repatriation, for example, just FSA earnings themselves will typically save some modest headwind related to yen strengthening. Now you couple that also, however, with looking at the overall condition in your SMR ration and what's happening in capital conditions. And as I mentioned in my comments, we continue to have stability in our SMR ratio, meaning that exchange rates aside the spread gap -- gap in spreads and lower interest rates have actually provided a little bit of modest lift to SMR ratio. So when you combine those 2, the capital conditions by SMR and looking at any pressure to FSA earnings, I would expect to hold steady on our repatriation  efforts. Now the other end of your question is a good one, and that is well, don't you have an opportunity to then convert that yen back into more dollars in the U.S. through your hedging of repatriation activity. And the answer is yes. But there is a lagging effect. And the reason there is lagging effect is because our strategy on hedging repatriated yen is to really roll forward if you will dollar cost average our way into hedging typically about 5 to maybe as much as 6 quarters out in advance. So eventually we start locking future cash flows into more attractive exchange rates on a yen to dollar basis before it lags. So for example, in 2016, we've hedged effectively all of our repatriated -- repatriation plans at least on an FSA earnings basis. And the average hedge exchange rate that we've converted dollars into is about 117 -- yen is about 117 to the dollar. So that gives you an idea, so we're on the negative side if you will compare to current exchange rates. But realize overtime that we'll all flow together in dollar cost averaging, there is no doubt via time where we're actually on the attractive end of converting yen to dollars as exchange rates move around."

Only then, do I think about exchange rate strategy. And that's really, exchange rate strategy, in my view is the tail that wags the door, it's not the major dynamics. So if you were to, for example, assume stability in capital conditions, which currently we think conditions are relatively stable, then what we on the margin is go out a little further and lock in more on that yen coming back home into dollars. We may also toggle between that 80% and 100% of FSA earnings based on somewhat on the value of the dollars or the yen to dollar that we're bringing back. But that is a very, very minor component to the overall decision, which is, hey, what's going on with the capital conditions in Japan."

And as you recall from last year, over the course of the year, but most predominantly in the fourth quarter, we effectively brought the majority of that JPY 90 billion if you will, back to the U.S. or let's call it $750 million. That served to really kick up the level of excess capital that we had at the holding company at year-end, and we have been essentially spending that down through the combination of accelerated repurchase into the first quarter, but also we will gradually feather down that excess capital over the course of 2016 and also 2017. So the important point to note that is there is the true free cash flow of the company, and then there is the cash flow or excess capital that's been generated through reinsurance and last year's exercise is a good example of that. So as we spend that down over the course of 2016 and '17, that's what is supporting some of our deployment capital estimates that you've seen historically in previous discussion."

But just on the margins, first of all, these products have been priced to exceed our cost to capital and obviously drive economic value for the company, realizing that in many cases, we're selling the product in combination with third sector distribution relationships, and so we think in terms of sort of a blended economic value driven off the distribution. Where there are distribution partners that are more dominant in the first sector and much more, say lump sum dumping or interest-sensitive sites sales, that's where you particularly want to take more decisive action. 
Now I mentioned that early in the year, we bought -- pre-bought JGB. We bought JGB at little north of 1% at an average duration of around 20 or 22 years. And obviously, pricing these days, you're talking about yields more down around 30 to 40 basis points, that has gone a long way to defending our returns in the product over the course of this year. It doesn't completely immunize the returns, but it gives you a great start to defending and allows you or buys you time to take not only actions on the distribution front, but also actions on the investment front as flows come in overtime. In so, right now keep in mind that we tend to price these products out with an expectation for yields in the roughly 1.25% to 1.4% range and just to give you an idea, in the first quarter alone, even with the allocation to JGBs, we after hedge costs generated around a 2%-or-so yield, net of hedge cost. And so we've got some realm in pricing to suffer the natural low-interest rate environment over time, and still defend yield, but we've got to be diligent in shutting down the flows, because overtime clearly these are much less attractive and we need time to reprice and recalibrate. Paul, maybe I'll pass it to you on some of the actions"

Nigel, first and foremost, I want to go back and revisit the fourth quarter outlook call for this year when we basically differentiated between first sector savings products and first sector products that allow a premium product. So I'm going to differentiate a little bit here, because we're obviously making significantly higher profit margins on the level premium than we are with savings products. So to get into the specific measures that we're taking, we are suspending sales of our waste product while we are restricting sales on our level premium product. We're also going to move up to repricing of our products into this year. Additionally, for all of firs t sector, we're going to reprice our products effective of 2017, and so we believe that will put the portfolio back in a much better place. In terms of channel and distribution partners, because as Fred said, this is a critical component to the decision of lot of stake in the market. From a prospective effective May 2, we've suspended all weight and lump sum from a nonexclusive agency perspective, which is some of the largest growing agencies throughout Japan, April 1, we put in caps for And finally for the traditional agencies, we're lowering commission. Now again, as what I've said in the past, when we have these exclusive agencies who sign the contract to basically offer only Aflac products, they do so when they believe that we're going to provide them not only third sector products, but also first sector products. And as a result, we make sure that we offer those products, and that permits us from discontinuing them altogether. Now that said, I know you want us focused on third sector and as Dan mentioned in his opening remarks, we're heavily focused on the 2 new products given their smaller products that we've just put out for cancer survivors and our revived nonstandard medical and even though as only the last couple of weeks to those were out, we're very happy with how those are starting. Finally, we're going to be launching a new product this summer and we can't go in all the details yet hopefully by FAB, we'll able to cover some of the details about that new third sector product line that we've never been in before. But we are refocusing the attention of our distribution partners on third sectors we can, we did anticipate the spike in first sector as a result of these discontinuances and sales restrictions that we're putting in place and we believe in the second half of the year, we will have a substantial reduction in first sector because of the changes that we're making and we've accounted for all of this."

In my comments, I do want to be clear that what definitely is expected when we play out the seasonal dynamics of our business is that we would experience stronger than normal and in fact, typically the strongest quarter of the year is the first quarter for the reasons I mentioned on my calls, natural seasonality. Some of the natural that comes up with the strong 4Q sales into 1Q sales and the enrollment periods and everything that plays into the natural rolling of our business. That all plays into a better benefit ratio in the first quarter. However, I will tell you that this benefit ratio is certainly a bit lower than we would have naturally planned for. This is still doing a little better than what we would expect. And I think, as we go through the numbers obviously and dive into the actuarial performance in the business, we're seeing a few things. One is obviously of the some continued positive trends we've been experiencing in recent years in terms of just overall claim activity, when you couple that with the natural adjustments or in some cases lack of adjustments in IBNR, as you're actual to expected continues to perform well, you can essentially hike. You have enhanced if you will the impact on your benefit ratio in any period. In other words, couple just good old-fashioned positive claims activity with positive IBNR adjustments once you study the business long enough to make the adjustments. In past years, I would tell you that even though we've experienced strong first quarters, there were at times where we need certain IBNR adjustment on select lines of business where we felt there was modest efficiencies, for example when looking at actual to expected. And now having caught up with those reserve strengthenings, we are not seeing as much of that anymore. And so you tend to highlight the first quarter, but I want to remind you that we also had quite positive fourth quarter relative to our expectations. So we will develop perhaps a little more dialogue around this at our FAB meeting in May and what I would tell you is that our practice here as it takes quite a bit of time of research and looking at the trends, before we would declare victory if you will on resetting our expectations for benefit ratios, we fully expect second quarter benefit ratios to rebound back if you will towards our outlook guidance that we gave in December and you should anticipate that as you thinking modeling our results."

You don’t need to necessarily concern yourself with that, but we really trap things in terms of the year-end to year-end 03/31. But we're focusing on repatriation, that's effectively our estimate right now is JPY 120 billion to JPY 150 billion, and that is essentially 80% to 100% of our FSA -- or annualized FSA earnings estimate for the year. And  we'll have to see how things play out. What would cause you to go from 80% to 100% is entirely on the overall dynamics of capital development key ratios that we look at course investments and investment risk and performance, it's all the things you would expect. Again, conditions seem to be moving forward nicely. But we have to be careful there were some yellow lights flashing if you will in the first quarter with market volatility, energy prices, et cetera.

Part of that reason is we maintain extremely strong ratings, and can access the capital markets at very aggressive rates, both yen and US dollars. So we want to make sure we protect that. Our coverage ratio is essential. In fact, actually there is only a true north separation between our financial strength ratings and our holding company ratings and part of that is because of the very strong interest coverage ratios we have. So we pay attention to that one. But I would argue, yes. We have level of debt capacity, but no immediate plans to leverage up."

But this is a product set in general that even though we can achieve and cover, for example, our cost of capital arguably as economic value. This is not just a lower return of capital related to third sector, but it can also be potentially more volatile return on capital, meaning, think of that as the spray of potential return outcomes on the product quite a bit wider and less predictable if you will, less manageable if you will than in third sector. This relates to things like labs rates, buyer behavior. As you know, the WAYS product, for example, converts into several different options of products, so who converts and who converts into what can play into it. So you have a lot of dynamics that play -- that really in my mind raise the stakes of the return expectations. In other words, if you were to describe a broader spray of potential returns to me, I would have a higher expectation of returns in general. And that's not the case given the rate environment, so what I would say is, remember we're remaining in the game. It's just at a greatly reduced level. And we're remaining in the game for the very reason you point out, Eric, and that is, we can certainly reprice and cover cost to capital in such a way that we remain offering the product and support our distribution partnerships in Japan, which is critical to third sector. It's just that from a relative due to use of capital, we'll want to grow in support and build third sector all day long and would rather pull back a little bit on first sector, which showed by the way over time, now over a long period of time should by the way bring gradual lift to FSA earnings and cash flow and allow us to repatriate and redeploy capital in other higher returning opportunities."

The likelihood was JGB as we continue to go down. So we made that tactical move, which turned out to be a good one. But you're right, as we go through the rest of the year, dollar assets, growth assets will be 17% probably of our allocation with JGB is being about 25% or so or JGB like investments as part of our plan. So when you look at it in that regard, in the first quarter, and this is growth hedge cost and other numbers 2014 hedge cost as Fred mentioned is up 201. With the rest of the year, we would expect that new money yield based on that allocation differences to be about 320 take-off about 5 or 6 for a hedge cost depending on new exact makeup of the asset. So for the full year, our expectation now based on market conditions, cash flows that we know, we'll be about 270 before hedge cost and again not offered for average weighted hedge cost new money yield with respect of the rest of the year.

In terms of medicals, there is no doubt that the markets -- there are high volume of competitors that it is a highly competitive situation, and that we continue to focus on making better and better profits. I think the factor that we have to place on this is quicker product launches. We are more likely going to see a more periodic launch of a new product with new benefits based on health care changes as well as competition in the marketplace, but we've not seen substantially lower margins put on by other companies and so we feel like still with the brand that we have, with the products that we put in place and the distribution outlets that we have that are pretty much comprehensive is compared to most of our competitors who will focus on 1 or 2 distribution channels. We feel like we're in the right places to grow this business. Additionally, I mentioned that we're going to launch a new third sector product in category later this year.

And so it is served to both year-over-year and on a sequential basis, in particular, even if you just look at fourth quarter to the first quarter actually up your shareholders' equity and therefore pops up your book value per share a little bit more than you should obviously bought back a good amount stock as well. But then also it ways down mechanically, if you will, on the ROE reported sequentially in year-over-year, but also can also play into your leverage calculation as well. So as we go forward and as investors pay more attention to that book value, book value growth, ROE and the like, we want to take some more time and understanding mechanics of the calculation and make sure you understand what's being done to move ROE forward. Obviously coming up the earnings in the first quarter buyback of stock, we certainly pushed our ROE revolver forward, which do have some FX related denominator impacts in those ROE calculations."

Let me begin by saying that the first quarter of 2016 was a great start for Aflac. 
Let me first provide an update on Aflac Japan, our largest earnings contributor. You will recall that the last quarter that we anticipated sales products of third sector products would be down mid-single digits for the full year, following very strong production results in 2015, and that is still the case. However, sales of Aflac Japan's third sector products were up 1% for the quarter, which means we're running ahead of expectations for the third quarter sales. 
No one aspect of our business is contributing to the outperformance. It's simply stronger-than-expected productivity across all key distribution channels. We continue to believe the long-term compound annual growth of third sector products will be in the range of 4% to 6%. 
Consistent with our expectation, sales of first sector products were elevated in the quarter. As discussed on our fourth quarter conference call, steps to control the sale of first sector products are being taken, and we continue to implement various substantial actions later in the second quarter. These include a combination of production caps, commission restructuring, product repricing and, in select cases, product discontinuance. 
As a result of these planned actions, we anticipate seeing at least a 50% decline in first sector product sales, namely, WAYS and child endowment, in the second half of 2016 compared to the second half of 2015. Managing through the low interest rate environment is nothing new to Aflac Japan. Paul and the team from Aflac Japan are going to cover this in more details next month at our Financial Analyst Briefing. 
From a product perspective, we work hard to remain in step with the wants and needs of the Japanese consumer in our distribution channels. In doing so, we continually enhance our portfolio of products. This quarter, we introduced a cancer insurance product designed for those who have previously been diagnosed with cancer and been cancer-free for 5 years just as we do in the United States as well as an enhanced nonstandard medical insurance product. We will continue to be innovative in our providing options that millions of Japanese consumers are looking for as they struggle to bear the financial burden of higher medical expenses. 
From a distribution perspective, our traditional agencies have been and remain valuable contributors to our success, and this was certainly true in the first quarter. Additionally, all of our alliance partners continue to produce strong results, and I am especially pleased with Japan Post and their 20,000-plus postal outlets selling our cancer insurance. Our goal remains to be where the people want to buy, and our various distribution outlets broaden our reach. 
Turning to Aflac U.S. You'll recall that 2015 was the year of building out our business through our carrier and broker distribution channels. In doing so, we established the foundation for greater long-term growth opportunities. We see 2016 as the year of stabilization and growth and continue to execute on our strategies. 
With Aflac generating new annualized premium sales of 3.7%, we're off to a good start toward our expectation of a 3% to 5% sales growth for the U.S. in 2016. I do want to again emphasize that we anticipate our sales will be increasingly concentrated toward the end of the fourth quarter. But what we achieved prior to that time lays the groundwork for our ultimate success. 
As you all well know, success and opportunity breeds competition. That, combined with a clear need for voluntary products, has resulted in a number of other companies entering the voluntary supplemental insurance market. These have included insurance carriers who sell voluntary insurance as well as companies involved in various aspects of the health care management. As a result, we are executing on strategies designed to increase Aflac's importance to the employer and employees in an effort to drive further growth and penetration in our core supplemental voluntary products. 
But keep in mind, Aflac's singular focus on supplemental voluntary products has greatly contributed to our dominant position in the worksite insurance industry, and I believe we will continue to drive us in a competitive edge. Teresa will cover this in more detail at the financial analyst briefing. 
One Day Pay also remains a key differentiator for Aflac. We will continue to promote One Day Pay to consumers, which we believe will help drive increased brand loyalty and account penetration. 
Here is an amazing statistic. In 2015 and continuing through the first quarter, 100% of the eligible One Day Pay claims submitted were paid within 1 day. I think that we will process more than 2 million One Day Pay claims in 2016. Independent research continues to show that there is no doubt that American consumers need cash quickly, and paying clients fast and fairly sets us apart from the competition and, I believe, will really drive our sales. 
Turning to capital deployment. Fred will provide more details shortly, but let me just say that we continue to view growing the cash dividend and purchasing our shares as the most attractive means for deploying capital, particularly in the absence of compelling alternatives. Despite recent market volatility, our capital position remains strong and reinforces our plan of repurchasing $1.4 billion of shares, with the majority concentrated in the first half of the year. 
I'll conclude by reiterating that I've been in this business now more than 40 years, and I'm more excited today than I've ever been because the future is so bright at Aflac. 
Now let me turn it over to Fred for our financial results. Fred?"

As Dan noted in his comments, our first quarter results certainly gave us a great start to the year and achieving our 2016 earning guidance. Our results were driven b",981,"Thank you, Dan. You've all had a chance to review the details of our earnings release. As Dan noted in his comments, our first quarter results certainly gave us a great start to the year and achieving our 2016 earning guidance. 
Our results were driven by strong overall margins in both the U.S. and Japan. The only notable item in the quarter was an unfavorable expense item running through our corporate line of approximately $8 million after tax or $0.02 per share. This item represents an acceleration of stock compensation expense in order to properly reflect our guidelines for retirement-eligible employees. We would not expect this portion of the expense to repeat in future quarters, and the expense itself is largely a timing issue. 
Our Japan segment margins were solid in the quarter with continued strength in benefit ratios. Routine adjustments to reserves contributed modestly to the performance in the period and reflect favorable claims trends. Our expense ratio came in as expected and generally in line with our outlook called guidance. 
In the U.S., benefit ratios were considerably better than last year's quarter but fairly consistent with our seasonal expectation for a strong first quarter. Benefit ratios tend to be lower early in the year as policyholders manage deductibles and are less likely to experience routine injuries that come with outdoor activity. Lapse rates also tend to be modestly elevated in the first quarter, which has the effect of driving the benefit ratio down and DAC amortization higher. Our overall expense ratio in the U.S. was in line with our expectations as general expenses were down, offset by elevated DAC amortization. 
In Japan and the U.S., we would expect both our benefit and expense ratios to trend within our December outlook called guidance ranges as we move into the second quarter and for the remainder of the year. 
Turning to investments. New money rates in Japan were influenced by the prebind of our annual budget of JGBs, which served to depress our purchase yields relative to our full year expectation. This tactical strategy was critical in that we purchased the majority of our JGB budget prior to the BOJ's action, allowing us time to fully implement measures intended to curb the sale of certain first sector products while defending profitability. 
As we move forward, navigating the rate environment in Japan will involve allocations to long-dated JGBs, which, while low yielding, provide certain ALM and capital benefits. We will continue our work to develop alternative yen investments and support our hedged dollar program. 
U.S. new money rates were influenced by the continued buildout of our strategic asset allocation and were modestly elevated relative to our full year expectations due to a concentration of purchases in higher-yielding middle-market loans. We continue our efforts to build a position in diversified asset classes, helping to support higher long-term returns. 
Let me comment for a moment on hedge costs and know that I'll go into some more detail on strategy at our Financial Analyst Briefing in May. We have experienced an increase in hedge costs as compared to last year. This is not only market-driven but somewhat the result of our tactical efforts to extend the average duration of the forwards backing the dollar program. As you know from our previous comments, the rise in hedge costs was fully expected as recent years have experienced abnormally low costs relative to historic norms. 
As indicated in our press release, we recorded $29 million after tax or $0.07 a share in hedge costs for the quarter. We record the full cost of forwards upfront in the quarter purchased. Thus, the timing of what is rolling on and off the program can make a difference in any 1 quarter. We have approximately $13 billion of dollar bond program hedged with forwards at an estimated full year average pretax cost of roughly 110 basis points. 
While early in the year and recognizing the accounting treatment, the 110 basis point range is a practical pretax estimate for our full year cost expectations on our existing portfolio, this assuming no material change in our hedging strategy or market movements. 
Our capital and liquidity position remain strong. We have only estimates on SMR and RBC at this time but expect both to remain strong and generally consistent with recent periods despite a return to volatility in the quarter. Impairments in the quarter were modest, and prices in our energy portfolio have recovered somewhat after a volatile January and February. 
Between dividends and repurchase, we returned $773 million to our shareholders in the quarter. Depending on overall capital conditions, we expect to repatriate 80% to 100% of FSA earnings in 2016 or roughly JPY 120 billion to JPY 150 billion. We continue to spend down excess capital held at the holding company, in part driven by repatriation of 2015 reinsurance proceeds, and are on pace to achieve our $1 billion share repurchase target for the first half of 2016 and $1.4 billion in repurchase for the full year. 
Our business model is resilient to market volatility, and our overall cost of capital continues to decline in contrast to industry players with more exposed business models. We have made no adjustments to our earnings guidance of $6.17 to $6.41 per share assuming the same average exchange rate as last year, which was roughly JPY 121 million to the dollar. Given strength in the yen during the quarter, we have provided in our press release an EPS range for the second quarter assuming a yen to dollar of JPY 105 to JPY 115. While important to recognize exchange rates with respect to cash flows and capital ratios, we focus on EPS progress on a currency-neutral basis. 
We believe our performance in the quarter certainly bodes well for 2016.

There's a couple of components to be mindful of in a strengthening yen. One is because we, of course, have a dollar program where we're generating dollar-based income from an investment perspective, on a cash basis, you're needing to convert that dollar back into yen, and as it converts, it will actually be a headwind to FSA earnings. And so when it comes to looking at repatriation, for example, just FSA earnings themselves will typically see some modest headwind related to yen strengthening. Now you couple that also, however, with looking at the overall condition in your SMR ratio and what's happening in capital conditions. And as I mentioned in my comments, we continue to have stability in our SMR ratio, meaning that exchange rates aside, the spread gap -- gap in spreads and lower interest rates have actually provided a little bit of a modest lift to SMR ratio. So when you combine those 2, the capital conditions by SMR and looking at any pressure to FSA earnings, I would expect to hold steady on our repatriation efforts. Now the other end of your question is a good one, and that is, well, don't you have an opportunity to then convert that yen back into more dollars in the U.S. through your hedging of repatriation activity? And the answer is yes, but there's a lagging effect. And the reason there's a lagging effect is because our strategy on hedging repatriated yen is to really roll forward, if you will, our dollar cost, average our way into hedging typically about 5 to maybe as much as 6 quarters out in advance. So eventually, we start locking future cash flows into more attractive exchange rates on a yen to dollar basis, but for a while, it lags. So for example, in 2016, we've hedged effectively all of our repatriated -- repatriation plans at least on an FSA earnings basis, and the average hedged exchange rate that we've converted dollars into is about JPY 117 -- of about JPY 117 to the dollar. So that gives you an idea. So we're on the negative side, if you will, compared to current exchange rates, but realize, over time, that will all flow together in dollar cost averaging.

Only then do I think about exchange rate strategy. And that's really -- exchange rate strategy, in my view, is the tail that wags the dog. It's not the major dynamic. So if you were to, for example, assume stability in capital conditions, which currently, we think conditions are relatively stable, then what we may do on the margin is go out a little further and lock in more of that yen coming back home into dollars. We may also toggle between that 80% and 100% of FSA earnings based on -- somewhat on the value of the dollars or the yen to dollar that we're bringing back. But that is a very, very minor component to the overall decision, which is, hey, what's going on with the capital conditions in Japan."

And as you recall from last year, over the course of the year but most predominantly in the fourth quarter, we effectively brought the majority of that JPY 90 billion, if you will, back to the U.S. or let's call it $750 million. That served to really kick up the level of excess capital that we had at the holding company at year-end, and we have been essentially spending that down through the combination of accelerated repurchase into the first quarter, but also, we will gradually feather down that excess capital over the course of 2016 and also 2017. So the important point to note that is there's the true free cash flow of the company, and then there's the cash flow or excess capital that's been generated through reinsurance. And last year's exercise is a good example of that. So as we spend that down over the course of 2016 and '17, that's what's supporting some of our deployment -- deployable capital estimates that you've seen historically in previous FAB discussion."

But just on the margins, first of all, these products have been priced to exceed our cost of capital and obviously drive economic value for the company, realizing that, in many cases, we're selling the product in combination with third sector distribution relationships, and so we think in terms of sort of a blended economic value driven off the distribution. Where there are distribution partners that are more dominant in the first sector in much more, say, lump sum dumping or interest-sensitive type sales, that's where you particularly want to take more decisive action. Now I mentioned that early in the year, we bought -- prebought JGBs. We bought JGBs at around a little north of 1% at an average duration of around 20, 22 years, and obviously, pricing these days, you're talking about yields more down around 30 to 40 basis points. That has gone a long way to defending our returns in the product over the course of this year. It doesn't completely immunize the returns, but it gives you a great start to defending and allows you or buys you time to take not only actions on the distribution front but also actions on the investment front as flows come in over time. And so right now, keep in mind that we tend to price these products out with an expectation for yields in the roughly 1.25% to 1.4% range. And just to give you an idea, in the first quarter alone, even with the heightened allocation to JGBs, we, after hedge costs, generated around a 2% or so yield, net of hedge costs. And so we've got some room in our pricing to suffer the natural low interest rate environment over time and still defend yields. But we've got to be diligent in shutting down the flows because over time, clearly, these are much less attractive, and we need time to reprice and recalibrate. Paul, maybe I'll toss to you then on some of the actions we're taking."

Nigel, first and foremost, I want to go back and revisit the fourth quarter outlook call for this year when we basically differentiated between first sector savings products and first sector products that are level premium products. And so I'm going to differentiate a little bit here because we're obviously making significantly higher profit margins on the level premium than we are with savings products. So to get into the specific measures that we're taking, we are suspending sales of our lump sum WAYS product while we are restricting sales on our level premium WAYS product. We're also going to move up the repricing of our WAYS product into this year. Additionally, for all of first sector, we're going to reprice our products effective April of 2017, and so we believe that, that would put the portfolio back in a much better place. In terms of channel and distribution partners, because, as Fred said, this is a critical component to the decision of a lot of stake in the market, from a bank channel perspective, effective May 2, we've suspended all WAYS and lump sum child endowment from a nonexclusive agency perspective, which are some of the largest growing agencies throughout Japan. April 1, we put in caps for WAYS and child endowment. And finally, for the traditional agencies, we are lowering commission. Now again, as what I've said in the past, when we have these exclusive agencies who sign a contract to basically offer only Aflac product, they do so with a belief that we're going to provide them not only third sector products but also first sector products. And as a result, we make sure that we offer those products, and that prevents us from discontinuing them altogether. Now that said, I know you want us focused on third sector, and as Dan mentioned in his opening remarks, we're heavily focused on the 2 new products given they're smaller products that we've just put out our cancer for cancer survivors and our revised nonstandard medical. And even though it was only the last couple of weeks of the quarter that those were out, we're very happy with how those are starting. Finally, we're going to be launching a new product this summer, and we can't go into all the details yet. Hopefully, by FAB, we'll be able to cover some of the details about that new third sector product line that we've never been in before. But we are refocusing the attention of our distribution partners on third sectors to the extent we can. We did anticipate the spike in first sector as a result of these discontinuances and sales restrictions that we're putting in place. And we believe the second half of the year, we will be having some substantial reduction in first sector because of the changes that we're making, and we've accounted for all of this."

Yes, in my comments, I do want to be clear that what definitely is expected when we play out the seasonal dynamics of our business is that we would experience stronger than normal, and in fact, typically, the strongest quarter of the year is the first quarter for the reasons I mentioned on my calls. Natural seasonality, some of the natural lapsation that comes off of a strong 4Q sales into 1Q sales and the enrollment periods and everything that plays into the natural rolling of our business, that all plays into a better benefit ratio in the first quarter. However, I would tell you that this benefit ratio is certainly a bit lower than we would have naturally planned for. This is still doing a little better than what we would expect. And I think as we go through the numbers obviously and dive into the actuarial performance in the business, we're seeing a few things. One is obviously some of the continued positive trends we've been experiencing in recent years in terms of just overall claim activity. When you couple that with the natural adjustments or, in some cases, lack of adjustments in IBNR, as your actual to expected continues to perform well, you can essentially hike -- enhance, if you will, the impact on your benefit ratio in any period. In other words, couple just good old-fashioned positive claims activity with positive IBNR adjustments once you've studied the business long enough to make the adjustments. In past few years, I would tell you that even though we have experienced strong first quarters, there were at times where we made certain IBNR adjustments on select lines of business where we felt as if there was modest efficiencies, for example, when looking at actual to expected. And now having caught up with those reserve strengthenings, we are not seeing as much of that anymore. And so you tend to highlight the first quarter, but I want to remind you that we also had actually quite a positive fourth quarter relative to our expectations. So we will develop perhaps a little more dialogue around this at our FAB meeting in May. And what I would tell you is that our practice here, as it takes quite a bit of time, of research and looking at the trends before we would declare victory, if you will, on resetting our expectations for benefit ratios, we fully expect second quarter benefit ratios to rebound back, if you will, towards our outlook guidance that we gave in December, and you should anticipate that as you think about modeling our results."

But when focusing on repatriation, that's -- effectively, our estimate right now is JPY 120 billion to JPY 150 billion, and that is essentially 80% to 100% of our FSA -- our annualized FSA earnings estimate for the year. And we'll have to see how things play out. What would cause you to go from 80% to 100% is entirely on the overall dynamics of the capital development, key ratios that we look at, of course, investments and investment risk and performance. It's all the things you would expect. Again, conditions seem to be moving forward nicely, but we have to be careful. There were some yellow lights flashing, if you will, in the first quarter with market volatility, energy prices, et cetera. And so we had to pay very careful attention.

And so when we go out, reinsurance, we have a blended approach of retention to support our capital ratios and defend our capital ratios and repatriation where it makes sense to repatriate and deploy. And so over the last few years, supporting our deployable capital measures has certainly been the rolling-through reinsurance transactions. If you were to subtract out those benefits and move to more of a true cash flow, it's typically more essentially the repatriation estimates in any given year plus what I would call free cash flow in the U.S. and/or the movement of excess capital in the U.S. up to the holding company.

Part of the reason we have a very low cost of capital -- and in fact, in recent periods, our cost of capital has been drifting actually below 8%, which is tremendous. Part of that reason is we maintain extremely strong ratings and can access the capital markets at very aggressive rates, both yen and U.S. dollar. And so we want to make sure we protect that. Our coverage ratio is essential. In fact, actually, there's only a 2-notch separation between our financial strength ratings and our holding company ratings, and part of that is because of the very strong interest coverage ratios we have.

But this is a product set in general that even though we can achieve and cover, for example, our cost of capital and arguably add economic value, this is not just a lower return of capital relative to third sector, but it can also be a potentially more volatile return on capital, meaning think of it as the spray of potential return outcomes on the product can be quite a bit wider and less predictable, if you will, less manageable, if you will, than third sector. This relates to things like lapse rates, buyer behavior. As you know, the WAYS product, for example, converts into several different options of products, so who converts and who converts into what can play into it. So you have a lot of dynamics at play that really, in my mind, raise the stakes on the return expectations. In other words, if you were to describe a broader spray of potential returns to me, I would have a higher expectation of returns in general. And that's not the case given the rate environment, so what I would say is, remember, we're remaining in the game. It's just at a greatly reduced level. And we're remaining in the game for the very reason you point out, Eric, and that is we can certainly reprice and cover our cost of capital in such a way that we remain offering the product and support our distribution partnerships in Japan, which is critical to third sector. It's just that from a relative use of capital, we'll want to grow and support and build third sector all day long and would rather pull back a little bit on first sector, which should, by the way, over time, now over a long period of time, should, by the way, bring gradual lift to FSA earnings and cash flow and allow us to repatriate and redeploy capital in other higher-returning opportunities."

About 70% of our full year expectations for JGBs were purchased in the first quarter. And that was a tactical move on the investment group's part partly because one, we were aware of the cash flows related to WAYS and had an expectation of them being more overweighted in the first half of the year; and second, we obviously always talk about macro factors like the DOJ. We were pretty strong in understanding that the likelihood was -- JGB as we continue to go down. So we made that tactical move, which turned out to be a good one. But you're right, as we go through the rest of the year, dollar assets, growth assets will be 17% probably of our allocation, with JGBs being about 25% or so or JGB-like investments as part of our plan. So when you look at it in that regard, in the first quarter, and this is gross hedge cost and other numbers, 214 net of hedge costs, as Fred mentioned, about 201. For the rest of the year, we would expect that new money yield based on that allocation differences to be about 320, take off about 5 or 6 for a hedge cost depending on the exact makeup of the asset. So for the full year, our expectation now, based on market conditions, cash flows that we know, would be about 270 before hedge cost and, again, knock off about 5 for our average weighted hedge cost in that new money yield with respect to the rest of the year. Now for us, as you know, the markets are dynamic, things are moving quickly, so we certainly reserve the right, based on where markets are, asset classes are, to change those allocations. But based on plan, that's our expectation."

If you noticed and remember my comments, I said, hey, timing is everything as you move quarter-to-quarter because of the way in which we account for that. We had $44 million pretax, $29 million after tax, $0.07 a share in the first quarter. If you look at a run rate basis, you're thinking about more in terms of $0.05, maybe a little north of $0.05 of share. And so I made the comment that, hey, I would expect, for the year as we roll the whole year together and look at it, that it's something in the 110 basis point range but realizing the first quarter, that was ticked up a little bit because of the simple buying pattern. Now one other thing to be careful about, right, is I'm holding essentially all else equal. I'm holding the size of our portfolio equal, I'm holding our hedge strategy effectively equal, and I'm holding the markets in and around where they're at today. Markets have stabilized a little bit. No one is getting excited or anything, but after a March rise in hedge costs over the last year, there's been a little bit of stabilization as we see markets calm down. But I think we're about, what, 12 hours away from a Bank of Japan meeting or so, if not short of them to add. And so things can change. We'll have to watch it carefully and carefully manage it."

And this has been happening for 1.5 decades. In reality, we've been able to fend those off and continue to grow our business. And I think there's no better evidence of that than the sales we saw from our cancer plan, which many people thought could be a saturated market, but in reality, we see it as a growth market as it continues. We think that our resurgence is up above 70% market share at one point as we launched the product and now staying above 50%. It's very positive for us. In terms of medical, there is no doubt that the markets -- there are a high volume of competitors, that it is a highly competitive situation and that we continue to focus on making better and better product. I think the factor that we have to place on this is quicker product launches. We are more likely going to see a more periodic launch of a new product with new benefits based on health care changes as well as competition in the marketplace, but we have not seen substantially lower margins put on by other companies. And so we feel like we can still, with the brand that we have, with the products that we've put in place and the distribution outlets that we have that are pretty much comprehensive as compared to most of our competitors who will focus on 1 or 2 distribution channels, we feel like we're in the right places to grow this business. Additionally, I mentioned that we're going to launch a new third sector product and category later this year. And we believe that's one more benefit to our overall third sector portfolio.

It's just a lot of little ones, and again, I think most of them spike, and then it goes back down. And so I believe, because it is our major product and that's what we do all of our concentration on, that we've got a distinct advantage. And although these life insurers that talk about getting into third sector, if that's all they've got to look forward to, they're in big trouble. So they've got to solve their life insurance issues one way or another and have got to find other ways. We can -- they could get in third sector for a little bit, but it's not going to solve their problems. And so I feel pretty comfortable with the way we're doing it. And at the same time, I don't want to be cocky because anything can happen. But I think we're better prepared with new products, new ideas, and continue to pretend like we're #2 instead of #1 where we're always fighting to stay on top.

But just note that in the way in which we calculate it, while we removed unrealized gains and losses on funds from traditional pricing issues or traditionally what most insurance companies do, in our calculation remains an unrealized gain and loss on foreign exchange, on FX. And what you saw here with the strengthening of the yen is that line item in our shareholders' equity, which has, in recent years, been a large negative number, has become less of a negative number, with yen strengthening, i.e., adding to shareholders' equity. And so it has served to, both year-over-year and on a sequential basis in particular even if you just look at fourth quarter to the first quarter, actually kick up your shareholders' equity and therefore pops up your book value per share a little bit more than usual. Obviously, we bought back a good amount of stock as well. But then also, it weighs down mechanically, if you will, on the ROE reported sequentially and year-over-year but also can also play into your leverage calculation as well. So as we go forward and as investors pay more attention to that book value, book value growth, ROE and the like, we'll want to take some more time in understanding the mechanics of the calculation and make sure you understand what's being done to move ROE forward. Obviously, coming off the earnings in the first quarter, our buyback of stock, we certainly pushed ROE forward, but you do have some FX-related denominator impacts in those ROE calculations."

Let me begin by saying that the first quarter of 2016 was a great start for Aflac. 
Let me first provide an update on Aflac Japan, our largest earnings contributor. You will recall that the last quarter that we anticipated sales of third sector products would be down mid-single digits for the full year, following very strong production results in 2015, and that is still the case. However, sales of Aflac Japan's third sector products were up 1% for the quarter, which means we're running ahead of expectations for the third quarter sales. 
No one aspect of our business is contributing to the outperformance. It's simply stronger-than-expected productivity across all key distribution channels. We continue to believe the long-term compound annual growth of third sector products will be in the range of 4% to 6%. 
Consistent with our expectation, sales of first sector products were elevated in the quarter. As discussed on our fourth quarter conference call, steps to control the sale of first sector products are being taken, and we continue to implement various substantial actions later in the second quarter. These include a combination of production caps, commission restructuring, product repricing and, in select cases, product discontinuance. 
As a result of these planned actions, we anticipate seeing at least a 50% decline in first sector product sales, namely, WAYS and child endowment, in the second half of 2016 compared to the second half of 2015. Managing through the low interest rate environment is nothing new to Aflac Japan. Paul and the team from Aflac Japan are going to cover this in more details next month at our Financial Analyst Briefing. 
From a product perspective, we work hard to remain in step with the wants and needs of the Japanese consumer in our distribution channels. In doing so, we continually enhance our portfolio of products. This quarter, we introduced a cancer insurance product designed for those who have previously been diagnosed with cancer and been cancer-free for 5 years just as we do in the United States as well as an enhanced nonstandard medical insurance product. We will continue to be innovative in our providing options that millions of Japanese consumers are looking for as they struggle to bear the financial burden of higher medical expenses. 
From a distribution perspective, our traditional agencies have been and remain valuable contributors to our success, and this was certainly true in the first quarter. Additionally, all of our alliance partners continue to produce strong results, and I am especially pleased with Japan Post and their 20,000-plus postal outlets selling our cancer insurance. Our goal remains to be where the people want to buy, and our various distribution outlets broaden our reach. 
Turning to Aflac U.S. You'll recall that 2015 was the year of building out our business through our carrier and broker distribution channels. In doing so, we established the foundation for greater long-term growth opportunities. We see 2016 as the year of stabilization and growth and continue to execute on our strategies. 
With Aflac generating new annualized premium sales of 3.7%, we're off to a good start toward our expectation of a 3% to 5% sales growth for the U.S. in 2016. I do want to again emphasize that we anticipate our sales will be increasingly concentrated toward the end of the fourth quarter. But what we achieved prior to that time lays the groundwork for our ultimate success. 
As you all well know, success and opportunity breeds competition. That, combined with a clear need for voluntary products, has resulted in a number of other companies entering the voluntary supplemental insurance market. These have included insurance carriers who sell voluntary insurance as well as companies involved in various aspects of the health care management. As a result, we are executing on strategies designed to increase Aflac's importance to the employer and employees in an effort to drive further growth and penetration in our core supplemental voluntary products. 
But keep in mind, Aflac's singular focus on supplemental voluntary products has greatly contributed to our dominant position in the worksite insurance industry, and I believe we will continue to drive us in a competitive edge. Teresa will cover this in more detail at the financial analyst briefing. 
One Day Pay also remains a key differentiator for Aflac. We will continue to promote One Day Pay to consumers, which we believe will help drive increased brand loyalty and account penetration. 
Here is an amazing statistic. In 2015 and continuing through the first quarter, 100% of the eligible One Day Pay claims submitted were paid within 1 day. I think that we will process more than 2 million One Day Pay claims in 2016. Independent research continues to show that there is no doubt that American consumers need cash quickly, and paying clients flat up fast and fairly sets us apart from the competition and, I believe, will really drive our sales. 
Turning to capital deployment. Fred will provide more details shortly, but let me just say that we continue to view growing the cash dividend and purchasing our shares as the most attractive means for deploying capital, particularly in the absence of compelling alternatives. Despite recent market volatility, our capital position remains strong and reinforces our plan of repurchasing $1.4 billion of shares, with the majority concentrated in the first half of the year. 
I'll conclude by reiterating that I've been in this business now more than 40 years, and I'm more excited today than I've ever been because the future is so bright at Aflac. 
Now let me turn it over to Fred for our financial results. Fred?"

You've all had a chance to review the details of our earnings release. As Dan noted in his comments, our first quarter results certainly gave us a great start to the year and achieving our 2016 earning guidance. Our results were driven b",981,"Thank you, Dan. You've all had a chance to review the details of our earnings release. As Dan noted in his comments, our first quarter results certainly gave us a great start to the year and achieving our 2016 earning guidance. 
Our results were driven by strong overall margins in both the U.S. and Japan. The only notable item in the quarter was an unfavorable expense item running through our corporate line of approximately $8 million after tax or $0.02 per share. This item represents an acceleration of stock compensation expense in order to properly reflect our guidelines for retirement-eligible employees. We would not expect this portion of the expense to repeat in future quarters, and the expense itself is largely a timing issue. 
Our Japan segment margins were solid in the quarter with continued strength in benefit ratios. Routine adjustments to reserves contributed modestly to the performance in the period and reflect favorable claims trends. Our expense ratio came in as expected and generally in line with our outlook called guidance. 
In the U.S., benefit ratios were considerably better than last year's quarter but fairly consistent with our seasonal expectation for a strong first quarter. Benefit ratios tend to be lower early in the year as policyholders manage deductibles and are less likely to experience routine injuries that come with outdoor activity. Lapse rates also tend to be modestly elevated in the first quarter, which has the effect of driving the benefit ratio down and DAC amortization higher. Our overall expense ratio in the U.S. was in line with our expectations as general expenses were down, offset by elevated DAC amortization. 
In Japan and the U.S., we would expect both our benefit and expense ratios to trend within our December outlook called guidance ranges as we move into the second quarter and for the remainder of the year. 
Turning to investments. New money rates in Japan were influenced by the prebind of our annual budget of JGBs, which served to depress our purchase yields relative to our full year expectation. This tactical strategy was critical in that we purchased the majority of our JGB budget prior to the BOJ's action, allowing us time to fully implement measures intended to curb the sale of certain first sector products while defending profitability. 
As we move forward, navigating the rate environment in Japan will involve allocations to long-dated JGBs, which, while low yielding, provide certain ALM and capital benefits. We will continue our work to develop alternative yen investments and support our hedged dollar program. 
U.S. new money rates were influenced by the continued buildout of our strategic asset allocation and were modestly elevated relative to our full year expectations due to a concentration of purchases in higher-yielding middle-market loans. We continue our efforts to build a position in diversified asset classes, helping to support higher long-term returns. 
Let me comment for a moment on hedge costs and know that I'll go into some more detail on strategy at our Financial Analyst Briefing in May. We have experienced an increase in hedge costs as compared to last year. This is not only market-driven but somewhat the result of our tactical efforts to extend the average duration of the forwards backing the dollar program. As you know from our previous comments, the rise in hedge costs was fully expected as recent years have experienced abnormally low costs relative to historic norms. 
As indicated in our press release, we recorded $29 million after tax or $0.07 a share in hedge costs for the quarter. We record the full cost of forwards upfront in the quarter purchased. Thus, the timing of what is rolling on and off the program can make a difference in any 1 quarter. We have approximately $13 billion of dollar bond program hedged with forwards at an estimated full year average pretax cost of roughly 110 basis points. 
While early in the year and recognizing the accounting treatment, the 110 basis point range is a practical pretax estimate for our full year cost expectations on our existing portfolio, this assuming no material change in our hedging strategy or market movements. 
Our capital and liquidity position remain strong. We have only estimates on SMR and RBC at this time but expect both to remain strong and generally consistent with recent periods despite a return to volatility in the quarter. Impairments in the quarter were modest, and prices in our energy portfolio have recovered somewhat after a volatile January and February. 
Between dividends and repurchase, we returned $773 million to our shareholders in the quarter. Depending on overall capital conditions, we expect to repatriate 80% to 100% of FSA earnings in 2016 or roughly JPY 120 billion to JPY 150 billion. We continue to spend down excess capital held at the holding company, in part driven by repatriation of 2015 reinsurance proceeds, and are on pace to achieve our $1 billion share repurchase target for the first half of 2016 and $1.4 billion in repurchase for the full year. 
Our business model is resilient to market volatility, and our overall cost of capital continues to decline in contrast to industry players with more exposed business models. We have made no adjustments to our earnings guidance of $6.17 to $6.41 per share assuming the same average exchange rate as last year, which was roughly JPY 121 million to the dollar. Given strength in the yen during the quarter, we have provided in our press release an EPS range for the second quarter assuming a yen to dollar of JPY 105 to JPY 115. While important to recognize exchange rates with respect to cash flows and capital ratios, we focus on EPS progress on a currency-neutral basis. 
We believe our performance in the quarter certainly bodes well for 2016.

There's a couple of components to be mindful of in a strengthening yen. One is because we, of course, have a dollar program where we're generating dollar-based income from an investment perspective, on a cash basis, you're needing to convert that dollar back into yen, and as it converts, it will actually be a headwind to FSA earnings. And so when it comes to looking at repatriation, for example, just FSA earnings themselves will typically see some modest headwind related to yen strengthening. Now you couple that also, however, with looking at the overall condition in your SMR ratio and what's happening in capital conditions. And as I mentioned in my comments, we continue to have stability in our SMR ratio, meaning that exchange rates aside, the spread gap -- gap in spreads and lower interest rates have actually provided a little bit of a modest lift to SMR ratio. So when you combine those 2, the capital conditions by SMR and looking at any pressure to FSA earnings, I would expect to hold steady on our repatriation efforts. Now the other end of your question is a good one, and that is, well, don't you have an opportunity to then convert that yen back into more dollars in the U.S. through your hedging of repatriation activity? And the answer is yes, but there's a lagging effect. And the reason there's a lagging effect is because our strategy on hedging repatriated yen is to really roll forward, if you will, our dollar cost, average our way into hedging typically about 5 to maybe as much as 6 quarters out in advance. So eventually, we start locking future cash flows into more attractive exchange rates on a yen to dollar basis, but for a while, it lags. So for example, in 2016, we've hedged effectively all of our repatriated -- repatriation plans at least on an FSA earnings basis, and the average hedged exchange rate that we've converted dollars into is about JPY 117 -- of about JPY 117 to the dollar. So that gives you an idea. So we're on the negative side, if you will, compared to current exchange rates, but realize, over time, that will all flow together in dollar cost averaging. There will no doubt be a time where we're actually on the attractive end of converting yen to dollars as exchange rates move around."

Only then do I think about exchange rate strategy. And that's really -- exchange rate strategy, in my view, is the tail that wags the dog. It's not the major dynamic. So if you were to, for example, assume stability in capital conditions, which currently, we think conditions are relatively stable, then what we may do on the margin is go out a little further and lock in more of that yen coming back home into dollars. We may also toggle between that 80% and 100% of FSA earnings based on -- somewhat on the value of the dollars or the yen to dollar that we're bringing back. But that is a very, very minor component to the overall decision, which is, hey, what's going on with the capital conditions in Japan."

The -- what my comment is referring to is, in 2015, as you know, in March of 2015, right, prior to my arrival, Aflac executed on a reinsurance transaction that generated after tax about JPY 90 billion, if you will, in FSA earnings.

And as you recall from last year, over the course of the year but most predominantly in the fourth quarter, we effectively brought the majority of that JPY 90 billion, if you will, back to the U.S. or let's call it $750 million. That served to really kick up the level of excess capital that we had at the holding company at year-end, and we have been essentially spending that down through the combination of accelerated repurchase into the first quarter, but also, we will gradually feather down that excess capital over the course of 2016 and also 2017. So the important point to note that is there's the true free cash flow of the company, and then there's the cash flow or excess capital that's been generated through reinsurance. And last year's exercise is a good example of that. So as we spend that down over the course of 2016 and '17, that's what's supporting some of our deployment -- deployable capital estimates that you've seen historically in previous FAB discussion."

But just on the margins, first of all, these products have been priced to exceed our cost of capital and obviously drive economic value for the company, realizing that, in many cases, we're selling the product in combination with third sector distribution relationships, and so we think in terms of sort of a blended economic value driven off the distribution. Where there are distribution partners that are more dominant in the first sector in much more, say, lump sum dumping or interest-sensitive type sales, that's where you particularly want to take more decisive action. Now I mentioned that early in the year, we bought -- prebought JGBs. We bought JGBs at around a little north of 1% at an average duration of around 20, 22 years, and obviously, pricing these days, you're talking about yields more down around 30 to 40 basis points. That has gone a long way to defending our returns in the product over the course of this year. It doesn't completely immunize the returns, but it gives you a great start to defending and allows you or buys you time to take not only actions on the distribution front but also actions on the investment front as flows come in over time. And so right now, keep in mind that we tend to price these products out with an expectation for yields in the roughly 1.25% to 1.4% range. And just to give you an idea, in the first quarter alone, even with the heightened allocation to JGBs, we, after hedge costs, generated around a 2% or so yield, net of hedge costs. And so we've got some room in our pricing to suffer the natural low interest rate environment over time and still defend yields. But we've got to be diligent in shutting down the flows because over time, clearly, these are much less attractive, and we need time to reprice and recalibrate. Paul, maybe I'll toss to you then on some of the actions we're taking."

Nigel, first and foremost, I want to go back and revisit the fourth quarter outlook call for this year when we basically differentiated between first sector savings products and first sector products that are level premium products. And so I'm going to differentiate a little bit here because we're obviously making significantly higher profit margins on the level premium than we are on savings products. So to get into the specific measures that we're taking, we are suspending sales of our lump sum WAYS product while we are restricting sales on our level premium WAYS product. We're also going to move up the repricing of our WAYS product into this year. Additionally, for all of first sector, we're going to reprice our products effective April of 2017, and so we believe that, that would put the portfolio back in a much better place. In terms of channel and distribution partners, because, as Fred said, this is a critical component to the decision of a lot of stake in the market, from a bank channel perspective, effective May 2, we've suspended all WAYS and lump sum child endowment from a nonexclusive agency perspective, which are some of the largest growing agencies throughout Japan. April 1, we put in caps for WAYS and child endowment. And finally, for the traditional agencies, we are lowering commission. Now again, as what I've said in the past, when we have these exclusive agencies who sign a contract to basically offer only Aflac product, they do so with a belief that we're going to provide them not only third sector products but also first sector products. And as a result, we make sure that we offer those products, and that prevents us from discontinuing them altogether. Now that said, I know you want us focused on third sector, and as Dan mentioned in his opening remarks, we're heavily focused on the 2 new products given they're smaller products that we've just put out our cancer for cancer survivors and our revised nonstandard medical. And even though it was only the last couple of weeks of the quarter that those were out, we're very happy with how those are starting. Finally, we're going to be launching a new product this summer, and we can't go into all the details yet. Hopefully, by FAB, we'll be able to cover some of the details about that new third sector product line that we've never been in before. But we are refocusing the attention of our distribution partners on third sectors to the extent we can. We did anticipate the spike in first sector as a result of these discontinuances and sales restrictions that we're putting in place. And we believe the second half of the year, we will be having some substantial reduction in first sector because of the changes that we're making, and we've accounted for all of this."

Yes, in my comments, I do want to be clear that what definitely is expected when we play out the seasonal dynamics of our business is that we would experience stronger than normal, and in fact, typically, the strongest quarter of the year is the first quarter for the reasons I mentioned on my calls. Natural seasonality, some of the natural lapsation that comes off of a strong 4Q sales into 1Q sales and the enrollment periods and everything that plays into the natural rolling of our business, that all plays into a better benefit ratio in the first quarter. However, I would tell you that this benefit ratio is certainly a bit lower than we would have naturally planned for. This is still doing a little better than what we would expect. And I think as we go through the numbers obviously and dive into the actuarial performance in the business, we're seeing a few things. One is obviously some of the continued positive trends we've been experiencing in recent years in terms of just overall claim activity. When you couple that with the natural adjustments or, in some cases, lack of adjustments in IBNR, as your actual to expected continues to perform well, you can essentially hike -- enhance, if you will, the impact on your benefit ratio in any period. In other words, couple just good old-fashioned positive claims activity with positive IBNR adjustments once you've studied the business long enough to make the adjustments. In past few years, I would tell you that even though we have experienced strong first quarters, there were at times where we made certain IBNR adjustments on select lines of business where we felt as if there was modest efficiencies, for example, when looking at actual to expected. And now having caught up with those reserve strengthenings, we are not seeing as much of that anymore. And so you tend to highlight the first quarter, but I want to remind you that we also had actually quite a positive fourth quarter relative to our expectations. So we will develop perhaps a little more dialogue around this at our FAB meeting in May. And what I would tell you is that our practice here, as it takes quite a bit of time, of research and looking at the trends before we would declare victory, if you will, on resetting our expectations for benefit ratios, we fully expect second quarter benefit ratios to rebound back, if you will, towards our outlook guidance that we gave in December, and you should anticipate that as you think about modeling our results."

Let me also clarify something just to make sure we're all on the same page, and that is I'm talking about a 2016, just realize that we print our FSA earnings on an annual basis at 03/31 year-end. You don't need to necessarily concern yourself with that, but we really trap things in terms of year-end to year-end 03/31. But when focusing on repatriation, that's -- effectively, our estimate right now is JPY 120 billion to JPY 150 billion, and that is essentially 80% to 100% of our FSA -- our annualized FSA earnings estimate for the year. And we'll have to see how things play out. What would cause you to go from 80% to 100% is entirely on the overall dynamics of the capital development, key ratios that we look at, of course, investments and investment risk and performance. It's all the things you would expect. Again, conditions seem to be moving forward nicely, but we have to be careful. There were some yellow lights flashing, if you will, in the first quarter with market volatility, energy prices, et cetera. And so we had to pay very careful attention. Things have stabilized a bit, but I don't think anybody would declare a victory. We could still see periods of market volatility and need to be careful."

And we've retained about 40% of those proceeds and repatriated the rest, so give or take JPY 120 billion. And so when we go out, reinsurance, we have a blended approach of retention to support our capital ratios and defend our capital ratios and repatriation where it makes sense to repatriate and deploy. And so over the last few years, supporting our deployable capital measures has certainly been the rolling-through reinsurance transactions. If you were to subtract out those benefits and move to more of a true cash flow, it's typically more essentially the repatriation estimates in any given year plus what I would call free cash flow in the U.S. and/or the movement of excess capital in the U.S. up to the holding company. We'll give you a little bit more color around this for sure as part of our comments at the Financial Analyst Briefing in May."

So we do have those in our plans, but we don't have an outright levering up in our plans. I think it's true that there's a certain amount of what I would call debt capacity or leverage capacity at the holding company at Aflac. But again, I want you to be careful about any potential market volatility and also want to defend our strong ratings. Part of the reason we have a very low cost of capital -- and in fact, in recent periods, our cost of capital has been drifting actually below 8%, which is tremendous. Part of that reason is we maintain extremely strong ratings and can access the capital markets at very aggressive rates, both yen and U.S. dollar. And so we want to make sure we protect that. Our coverage ratio is essential. In fact, actually, there's only a 2-notch separation between our financial strength ratings and our holding company ratings, and part of that is because of the very strong interest coverage ratios we have. So we pay attention to that, Ryan. But I would argue, yes, we have some level of debt capacity but no immediate plans to leverage up."

But this is a product set in general that even though we can achieve and cover, for example, our cost of capital and arguably add economic value, this is not just a lower return of capital relative to third sector, but it can also be a potentially more volatile return on capital, meaning think of it as the spray of potential return outcomes on the product can be quite a bit wider and less predictable, if you will, less manageable, if you will, than third sector. This relates to things like lapse rates, buyer behavior. As you know, the WAYS product, for example, converts into several different options of products, so who converts and who converts into what can play into it. So you have a lot of dynamics at play that really, in my mind, raise the stakes on the return expectations. In other words, if you were to describe a broader spray of potential returns to me, I would have a higher expectation of returns in general. And that's not the case given the rate environment, so what I would say is, remember, we're remaining in the game. It's just at a greatly reduced level. And we're remaining in the game for the very reason you point out, Eric, and that is we can certainly reprice and cover our cost of capital in such a way that we remain offering the product and support our distribution partnerships in Japan, which is critical to third sector. It's just that from a relative use of capital, we'll want to grow and support and build third sector all day long and would rather pull back a little bit on first sector, which should, by the way, over time, now over a long period of time, should, by the way, bring gradual lift to FSA earnings and cash flow and allow us to repatriate and redeploy capital in other higher-returning opportunities."

About 70% of our full year expectations for JGBs were purchased in the first quarter. And that was a tactical move on the investment group's part partly because one, we were aware of the cash flows related to WAYS and had an expectation of them being more overweighted in the first half of the year; and second, we obviously always talk about macro factors like the DOJ. We were pretty strong in understanding that the likelihood was -- JGB as we continue to go down. So we made that tactical move, which turned out to be a good one. But you're right, as we go through the rest of the year, dollar assets, growth assets will be 17% probably of our allocation, with JGBs being about 25% or so or JGB-like investments as part of our plan. So when you look at it in that regard, in the first quarter, and this is gross hedge cost and other numbers, 214 net of hedge costs, as Fred mentioned, about 201. For the rest of the year, we would expect that new money yield based on that allocation differences to be about 320, take off about 5 or 6 for a hedge cost depending on the exact makeup of the asset. So for the full year, our expectation now, based on market conditions, cash flows that we know, would be about 270 before hedge cost and, again, knock off about 5 for average weighted hedge cost in that new money yield with respect to the rest of the year. Now for us, as you know, the markets are dynamic, things are moving quickly, so we certainly reserve the right, based on where markets are, asset classes are, to change those allocations.

If you noticed and remember my comments, I said, hey, timing is everything as you move quarter-to-quarter because of the way in which we account for that. We had $44 million pretax, $29 million after tax, $0.07 a share in the first quarter. If you look at a run rate basis, you're thinking about more in terms of $0.05, maybe a little north of $0.05 of share. And so I made the comment that, hey, I would expect, for the year as we roll the whole year together and look at it, that it's something in the 110 basis point range but realizing the first quarter, that was ticked up a little bit because of the simple buying pattern. Now one other thing to be careful about, right, is I'm holding essentially all else equal. I'm holding the size of our portfolio equal, I'm holding our hedge strategy effectively equal, and I'm holding the markets in and around where they're at today. Markets have stabilized a little bit. No one is getting excited or anything, but after a March rise in hedge costs over the last year, there's been a little bit of stabilization as we see markets calm down. But I think we're about, what, 12 hours away from a Bank of Japan meeting or so, if not short of them to add. And so things can change. We'll have to watch it carefully and carefully manage it."

In terms of medical, there is no doubt that the markets -- there are a high volume of competitors, that it is a highly competitive situation and that we continue to focus on making better and better product. I think the factor that we have to place on this is quicker product launches. We are more likely going to see a more periodic launch of a new product with new benefits based on health care changes as well as competition in the marketplace, but we have not seen substantially lower margins put on by other companies. And so we feel like we can still, with the brand that we have, with the products that we've put in place and the distribution outlets that we have that are pretty much comprehensive as compared to most of our competitors who will focus on 1 or 2 distribution channels, we feel like we're in the right places to grow this business.

And so I believe, because it is our major product and that's what we do all of our concentration on, that we've got a distinct advantage. And although these life insurers that talk about getting into third sector, if that's all they've got to look forward to, they're in big trouble. So they've got to solve their life insurance issues one way or another and have got to find other ways. We can -- they could get in third sector for a little bit, but it's not going to solve their problems. And so I feel pretty comfortable with the way we're doing it. And at the same time, I don't want to be cocky because anything can happen. But I think we're better prepared with new products, new ideas, and continue to pretend like we're #2 instead of #1 where we're always fighting to stay on top. And that's going to be our mode as it has been in the past."

It also goes to ROE implications in terms of the way we report it, even a little bit related to leverage in terms of how you define shareholders' equity. But just note that in the way in which we calculate it, while we removed unrealized gains and losses on funds from traditional pricing issues or traditionally what most insurance companies do, in our calculation remains an unrealized gain and loss on foreign exchange, on FX. And what you saw here with the strengthening of the yen is that line item in our shareholders' equity, which has, in recent years, been a large negative number, has become less of a negative number, with yen strengthening, i.e., adding to shareholders' equity. And so it has served to, both year-over-year and on a sequential basis in particular even if you just look at fourth quarter to the first quarter, actually kick up your shareholders' equity and therefore pops up your book value per share a little bit more than usual. Obviously, we bought back a good amount of stock as well. But then also, it weighs down mechanically, if you will, on the ROE reported sequentially and year-over-year but also can also play into your leverage calculation as well. So as we go forward and as investors pay more attention to that book value, book value growth, ROE and the like, we'll want to take some more time in understanding the mechanics of the calculation and make sure you understand what's being done to move ROE forward. Obviously, coming off the earnings in the first quarter, our buyback of stock, we certainly pushed ROE forward, but you do have some FX-related denominator impacts in those ROE calculations."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Let me begin by saying that second quarter rounded out a good first half of the year for Aflac.

Let me begin by saying that second quarter rounded out a good first half of the year for Aflac. I'll lead off by providing an update on Aflac Japan, our largest earnings contributor. From the distribution perspective, our traditional agencies have been and remained vital contributors our success. This was certainly true in the second quarter. Additionally, all of our alliance partners continue to produce strong results. I'm especially pleased with Japan post and their 20,000 plus postal allowance, selling our cancer insurance. Our goal remains to be what the customers want to buy in our various distribution outlook, broaden our reach to support this goal. 
From a product perspective, our priority is to remain instead to the wants and the needs of the Japanese consumers and our distribution channels. Managing through the low interest rate environment is nothing new to Aflac Japan. This entails working through our capital approach on several fronts, including strategies for product, investment and risk and capital management. Fred will cover more of the financial aspect, but let me expand on our efforts related to products. 
Starting with sector products. We're encouraged that the actions that we've taken throughout the second quarter to limit the sale of first sector products has been yielding the desired results. First sector product sales decreased 24.7% in the quarter. These actions included combination of product caps, commission restructuring, product repricing in select cases and product discontinuance. Recognizing that many of these actions were initiated in the second quarter, we continue to anticipate a sharp decline of at least 50% in first sector sales in the second half of the year compared to the second half of 2015. 
Turning to the third sector products. You will recall that last quarter, we introduced a cancer insurance product designed for those who have previously been diagnosed with cancer and have been cancer free for 5 years. This is similar to the product we offer in the United States. Last quarter, we also introduced an enhanced nonstandard medical product. We are pleased with the reception of both products in the marketplace. You'll recall from the May Financial Analyst Briefing that we anticipated sales of third sector products would be in the range of down 3% to up 2%, and that's still the case. With Aflac Japan's third sector products up 11.2% in the quarter and 6.4% year-to-date, we're running ahead of expectation for third sector sales. But there's no one single aspect of the business to this contributed to our outperformance. It's simply stronger-than-expected productivity across the majority of the distribution channels. 
Keep in mind, sales in the bank channels has been moderate by restricting our sales of the first sector products. We continue to believe that the long-term compound rate of third sector products will be in the range of 4% to 6%. We will continue to be innovative in providing options to millions of Japanese consumers who are looking for as they struggled for financial burden of higher medical expenses. 
Turning to Aflac US. As we indicated before, we see 2016 as the year of stabilization and opportunities as we continue to execute on our strategies. Our efforts are focused on enhancing the relationships we've established with brokers and providing our career agents with the tools to increase productivity. While sales in the second second quarter were below expectations, keep in mind that sales in the second half of 2015 contributed to 55.6% of the total sales. Our projections show that we're still on track to achieve our target of increasing Aflac sales 3% to 5% for the year. 
I do want to emphasize once again that we anticipate our sales will be increasingly concentrated toward the end of the fourth quarter, though what we've achieved prior to that time lays the groundwork for our overall success. As you all well know, success for each competition. U.S. healthcare reform has been highlighting and clarifying the need for the products we sell. This has resulted in a number of other companies entering the voluntary supplemental insurance market such as traditional major medical cares and companies that sell voluntary insurance. As a result, we are executing on strategies designed to set Aflac apart and further enhance our awareness and relevance to the employer, the employees and brokers. 
Aflac's single focus on supplemental voluntary products have greatly contributed to our dominant position of selling voluntary insurance at the worksite, and I believe that will continue to drive our competitive edge. Keep in mind that so far this year, we've written more business than the other 2 competitors combined. 
One Day PAy also remains a key differentiator for Aflac. We will continue our promotion of One Day Pay to consumers, which we believe will help drive increased brand loyalty, account penetration and production. Here is an amazing statistic. In 2015 and continuing through the second quarter of 2016, 100% of the eligible One Day Pay claims submitted were paid within 1 day. We have processed, proved and pay over 1 million One Day PAy clients in the first 6 months of 2016. And get this, 96% of our policyholders that used One Day Pay or Smart Claim, as we call it, said that they are likely to refer other people to Aflac. I am convinced that this will result in more new sales going forward.  Paying clients fast and fairly sets us apart from the competition. 
Turning to capital deployment. Fred will provide more details shortly, but let me just say that we can continue to view growing cash dividend and repurchasing our shares as the most attractive means for deploying capital particularly in the absence of a compelling alternative. We believe that capital strength position as a to repatriate in the range of JPY 120 billion to JPY 150 billion for the calendar year 2016. Despite market volatility, our capital position remains strong and reinforces our plan to repurchase $1.4 billion of shares of our stock, with the majority being concentrating in the first half of this year. 
One of the message I'm sending as CEO is we are laser focused on leveraging opportunities for the future. I'm letting everyone know that innovation and change are vital aspects of the business environment here at Aflac Japan. And that's what continue to propel our long-term growth and our success. We have maintained our focus on controlling the things that we have the power to control. We can and we will control our efforts to build our business and to take care of our customers, our employees and our distribution networks. By doing this, I believe he will continue to enhance shareholder value, while delivering on our promise to our policyholders. 
Now I'll turn the program over to Fred who will cover the financial results. Fred?"

You've all had a chance to review the details in our earnings release. As Dan noted in his comments, the second quarter represents the continuation of the strong financial results we reported in the first quarter and executing on key initiatives covered at this year's Financial Analyst Briefing in May. 
Second quarter showed continued progress towards achieving our full-year 2016 earnings guidance. Our results were driven by strong overall margins in both the U.S. and Japan and there were no notable earnings items to speak of in the quarter. Our Japan segment margins were solid, with both benefit and expense ratios coming in as expected and generally in line with our guidance. In the U.S., benefit ratios performed within our expected range after seasonally strong performance in the first quarter. Our expense ratio was modestly favorable in the quarter. Consistent with previous years, we fully expect our expenses to pick up in the latter half of the year as we progress on certain strategic initiatives and increased promotional spend entering the enrollment season. 
In both Japan and the U.S., we would expect our benefit ratios, expense ratios and overall margins to trend within our December outlook call guidance ranges for the remainder of the year. 
Turning to investments. New money rates in Japan were understandably down in the period as we navigate the low yield environment, but also influenced by a tactical strategy of temporarily investing in low yielding but high-quality and liquid securities, pending development of more attractive long-term investments. We continue to be on plan in terms of Japan's net investment income for 2016. 
U.S. new money rates we're influenced by an increased allocation to corporate investment grade purchases, which served to lower new money rates in the quarter. You may recall in the first quarter, we had elevated new money rates is we concentrated investments in higher-yielding middle-market loans. So to some degree, the second quarter purchases are bouncing out our allocations. 
Let me comment for a moment on market developments since our FAB meeting in May and its influence on our investment strategy as we look forward in 2016. Specifically, the negative rate environment in Japan and movement in hedge costs supporting our U.S. dollar investment strategy. 
Post-Brexit announcement, we experienced another move down in rates as JGBs and U.S. Treasuries continue to be the world's flight to quality currencies and investments. While having modestly recovered in the past few weeks, we have seen 30-year JGBs down to near 0 at times. Curtail interest sensitive premium flows is essential and as Dan noted, we are taking further action-ly to reduce the sale of first sector savings products, namely eliminating the sale of product in certain channels and accelerating pricing actions. We will continue to sell repriced savings products in support of our exclusive relationships where the ratio of third sector to first sector sales significantly in favor of third sector. 
Specific to our investment strategy, we remain in good position for 2016 asset flows and defending net investment income, but we are undertaking a review of our strategic and tactical asset allocation and associated risk limits in preparation for 2017 flows. We hope to provide additional color at our September FAB meeting in Japan. But at a high level, the plan explores developing alternative high-quality yen investments, a measured entry back into yen private placements and U.S. dollar investments where we can hedge effectively and optimizing investment income consistent with our risk limits, ALM and capital objectives. 
Turning to U.S. dollar program. Our hedge cost in the second quarter were essentially flat with the first quarter at $0.08 a share. However, hedge costs have continued to increase in recent weeks with market volatility and speculation on BOJ and Federal Reserve actions. At our May FAB meeting, we guided to realized hedge costs of 110 basis points on $13 billion notional investment in forwards, assuming no movement in pricing or change in our hedging strategy. In the weeks leading into Brexit decision, post-Brexit and in anticipation of last night's BOJ announcement, 1 year forward pricing is now closer to 160 basis points. 
As you know, from our previous comments, the rise in hedge costs was fully expected as recent years have experienced abnormally low costs relative to historic norms. Note also that we currently record the full cost of forwards upfront in the quarter purchased instead of amortizing the cost over the life of the hedge, thus the timing of what is rolling on and off the program can make a difference in our reported cost. 
In addition to market pricing, as a moment to the second half of the year, we intend on executing on a couple tactical moves that will result in an increase in our reported hedge costs. First, we have done some rebalancing and have moved to hedge additional dollar asset classes and expect to increase our net notional forward position by roughly $2.9 billion, including $1.9 billion in bank loans hedged in July. Bank loans are ideal to hedge as these are floating rate and better match for shorter dated forwards. In addition, we will look to cover a building equity and commercial real estate loan portfolio under our hedge program. 
Importantly, hedging these additional U.S. dollar asset classes, along with other related rebalancing activities are expected to strengthen our SMR ratio once completed. We estimate in the range of 30 points to 50 points at a net cost of approximately $10 million to execute on the overall strategy. Isolating the increase in the cost of hedging and our move to cover additional asset classes, increases are hedge cost to the $215 million range for the year. 
Finally, we have seen the forward pricing curve flattened, thus making it more economical to lengthen the weighted average tenure of our forwards. Together with our house view that hedge cost may rise, we are exploring lengthening the average maturity of our forwards by rolling a portion into longer dated positions. This strategy may increase our estimated cost in the $40 million to $60 million range, recognizing our current method of reporting cost at the time of purchase. This strategy may involve as markets move and we will continue to guide accordingly as we proceed through the year. 
While increasing our reported cost, these moves are favorable from a risk and capital management standpoint. Importantly, the dollar program overall and expanded asset classes continues to perform well even when considering rising hedge cost and when compared to low yielding yen alternatives. This is why we've seen a surge in dollar and currency programs among Japanese insurance players over the past few quarters. As we move forward, we will update our guidance accordingly and as is always the case, our guidance could change based on precise asset flows in market conditions. 
Turning to capital. SMR remains in the-mid 800% range, with unrealized gains up significantly in the quarter. RBC remains strong despite FX impacting the ratio negatively with the yen strengthening and realizing our Japan branch is embedded in our U.S. statutory results. Impairments in the quarter were modest and primarily related to our Japan equity portfolio where market declines have triggered impairments in accordance with our internal accounting policies. Overall credit conditions remain stable and we have seen a recovery and energy names, including our below investment grade holdings. We do not see any immediate risk with respect to Brexit and our European holdings. 
Overall capital liquidity conditions are strong and support our continued to return of deployable capital to shareholders. Between dividends and repurchase, we returned $570 million to our shareholders in the quarter. Depending on the overall capital conditions, we expect repatriate 80% to 100% of FSA earnings in 2016 or roughly JPY 120 billion to JPY 150 billion. We continue to spend down excess capital held at the holding company and are on pace to achieve our $1.4 billion of repurchase for the full year. We have made no adjustments to our earnings guidance of $6.17 to $6.41 per share, assuming the same average exchange rate as last year, which was roughly JPY 121 to $1. Given strength in the yen during the quarter, we have provided in our press release an EPS range for the third quarter, assuming the yen to dollar of JPY 100 to $1.10. 
When analyzing our performance year-to-date, we are poised for strong performance in 2016. However, we are midway through the year and we need to be conscious of the low rate environment, headwinds to investment income and associated at trial review of select intranets at the close blocks of business in Japan. In addition, from a corporate perspective, postretirement benefit liabilities are sensitive to long-term rate assumptions and we typically review these corporate liabilities in the fourth quarter. 
Overall, we remain well positioned in terms of our core margins and capital strength. Thank you, and I'll now turn the call over to Robin to begin Q&A. Robin?"

So all couple of comments. Let me handle the last second part of the question first. We are, in fact, putting on the review our definition are really our non-GAAP definition of hedge cost and how we want to report it in our definition of operating earnings. And in fact, it's very likely, Nigel, that we go to exactly what you're talking about. And that is more of unamortized cost, very similar to how you would expect coupons on bond to behave or interest costs on debt. And so that's really where we're going to move. We will give more detail on this, more precise detail on this during our outlook call, along with recognizing that we'd have to some degree adjust, if you will, our previous year results, that you could see the comparables year-over-year. But ultimately, the goal is exactly what you're alluding to and that is we want to get to a definition of hedge costs that moves logically with how you would expect. If pricing is increasing, we would expect hedge cost to go up. If we're lengthening the tenure and it's a steep curve, they would go up and vice versa. Of course, if we're doing more volume, covering more notional, they would go up or down depending on the strategy. What we want to avoid is we're seeing right now, we don't want any marked market noise, nor do we want the sheer timing of what rolls to influence it. Now to your first question, as we roll into '17, of course, but I just talk about will play into what I'm about to say. But you'll generally find a more smoother and logical approach to the cost. So a good way to think about it is if we are covering now, moving from roughly $12.7 billion notional or forwards to upwards of $5.7 billion -- or $5.6 billion notional forwards. You would expect as you move into 2017 to roughly apply the pricing or average weighted average pricing you would expect on those forwards. Now the pricing depends on the market. So it's very difficult for us to estimate what that would be. As I mentioned in my comments, we've seen pricing rise a 1-year forward, for example,, right now, if you went out and purchased it would be 160 basis points. What you would expect is that when we get to our outlook call, we will provide these types of details and ranges and sensitivities as part of our operating earnings. So that will give you, I think, a little color."

Because really, what you're talking about is bifurcating between Japan and the U.S. So in Japan, you're talking about essentially FSA earnings. And you can sort of -- implied in our guidance, if you will, where we talk about repatriating 80% to 100% of FSA earnings where that being JPY 120 billion to JPY 150 billion, that gives you an idea of our expectation around FSA earnings for this year. Okay? So what are the types of things that will cause trend lines in those statutory earnings. You mentioned a couple of them. Growth rates, realized over time, because we are seeing growth in third sector which would weigh down on FSA earnings. We're also see a gradual decline, obviously, and frankly, more than a gradual decline in first sector sales, which will really promote or help, if you will, FSA earnings. So I expect those would probably largely level out. Now you do have some other things playing into FSA earnings. You do have foreign exchange that plays into it as we convert dollar-based coupon income, if you will, in Japan, back into yen. You'll see some headwinds, if you will, related to a strengthening yen from that perspective. We have some of that factored into our guidance as you can imagine, but nevertheless, that place a weight on it. And then hedge cost. I always remind folks.  Hedge costs are in fact, brought through FSA earnings. And so as those rise, they could be weighing down on your FSA earnings as well. I would note, however, that interestingly enough, even with the rising pricing here, this year, we actually had planned for hedge cost coming in right around where we're seeing them or projecting them today. So I don't see the recent rise in hedge costs as having implication for our 2016 cash flow. When you roll over to U.S., it's a bit of a different matter, right? So it's starting with just isolating the notion of the U.S. only statutory income. We don't drive a U.S. only statutory income. So it ends up being sort of excess cash flows produced in the U.S. And those have remained relatively steady. I would say we are seeing some growth rate in the U.S. and we're also investing in the U.S. platform in the form of technology improvements and infrastructure. So some of those are headwinds to statutory earnings, but otherwise, our sheer margins in the U.S. generally favorable benefit ratios, expense ratios generally under control have been really helpful to earnings. But I don't see any sort of what I would call capital related or growth or lack thereof related pressures on statutory earnings in the U.S. I would see it more to do with the pace of investment in the platform."

So one of the things that happened in the marketplace is why we've seen hedge cost to rise, they've also -- the curb is flat. And so for example, in really just the last few months, the difference between a 6-month forward and an 18-month forward has narrowed by some 25 basis points. And so if it cost you upwards of 150 basis points to lock in a six-month forward, it may cost you more in 170, 175 basis point range to do an 18-month forward. And so as a tactical strategy, you may want to take advantage of some lengthening where you can. And that's what I was alluding to in my comments. The reason why that results in a more acute cost in 2016, this 40 million to 60 million range I mentioned in my comments, is recognizing that we would pull that whole 18-month cost right into the current period. So again, as Nigel pointed out, as we move to a more amortized approach, you won't have that type of fluctuation. And so that gives you an idea of the relative difference and curve difference of extension. Something that can remember is that at FAB, we talked about 110 basis points and remember that is a realized cost that was taking roughly $13 billion or so of notional and $140 million or so of the expected cost. So when you think about $215 million of cost setting aside the duration extension, that's right around 140 basis points. So there's a difference between the actual pricing in the market and our realized cost because, of course, we've locked in certain cost and have this accounting issue."

So you gain certain benefits. We also are covering asset classes that could be of a higher charge order such as bank loans, for example, which will tend to be lower rated, if you will, in general. So again, makes it even particularly healthy [indiscernible] and as I've mentioned in my comments, what I really like about the bank loan coverage, which took some time to qualify, right? When I talk about floating, short dated investments and short dated investments that are being managed by third-party asset managers, it took some time to work through the system to qualify for all appropriate hedge treatment. We were able to get that done here in the last couple of months and so we could expand the asset class. So it's a particularly all-in beneficial asset class to hedge and so we're really happy with the progress we've made there. But that's where you pick up the SMR benefits. In terms of the factoring into our capital plan, yes. Yes in the sense that one of the missions of the hedge program, only one of the missions, is we in fact to stabilize and secure our capital dynamics in Japan such that we can be as confident as we can the steady repatriation of cash flows for the deployment. So no matter what the magnitude, it is helpful to our capital plan. I would not view it though as some sort of just booster jump to the capital plan, more of playing good defense."

So I do not believe there's anything should be removing you should just see the straight strong performance across our channels and a desire by Japanese consumers to purchase our products. In terms of the second half of the year, the comparisons are there and we do have to go up against stronger numbers. That said, we are running ahead of where we expected to be and I think if the mini FAB meeting in September, we will be in a better position to comment on whether we thought sales would continue to trend better than they have. As you know, we launched our MIT product this past week. And so by the time we get to our mid -- mini FAB meeting in September, we should be able to give you some idea about the receptivity of that product. But as I've told you in the past, with any new product line, we're always sensitive about how we received and how long it would take the Japanese agencies to adopt and begin selling it. We are very -- seeing very favorable results out of both our cancer for cancer survivors insurance as well as our revision of our nonstandard medical plan. So I remain very optimistic.

We've been growing the old-fashioned way, which is expand the distribution, new product launches and we remain somewhat consistent, in my view, on our approach to pricing. One difference, of course, is really focusing in on first sector and third sector savings. I would say when you turn your attention to those products, not surprisingly from an in-force perspective, those products are a bit more under pressure because the opposite has happened, what we have priced for has not played out quite as well in terms of, obviously, yields and investment income of those products. So that certainly offsets my comments and that's why we're taking significant actions to make sure that we reduced the flows and shift the balance of sales and then eventually, in-force over time. So that's the way I would describe it. But obviously, from the in-force perspective on the third sector side and really the entire this U.S. platform, it continues to be a very strong story."

But obviously, as you know, yields have been trending down, both in the U.S. and Japan. So that's partially the decline for the second quarter new money yield. But the bigger attribution of the decline was, and Fred in his speech, as we're entering into an asset classes such as infrastructure, commercial mortgage loans, those take time to fund, unlike when we buy investment grade bonds, we get into the market and fund those pretty quickly. Now since we're turning those asset classes on for the first time, we knew that there'd be a delay in funding them and therefore, during the quarter, we had a buildup of cash because it is taking us a little longer for our first time entering those asset classes. When we're sitting on cash, that doesn't go into the new money yields in the way we've defined it. But nevertheless, sitting on cash is not optimal for us and we didn't want to do that. So we did put a little over $1 billion to work during the second quarter and to yen assets, mostly residential -- Japan residents of mortgage-backed securities and some JGBs as a temporary home, if you will. So that when the infrastructure and commercial mortgage loans are ready to be funded, are our managers call us up and say, we've circled deals for your portfolio, we'll then shift that out of there and put it into those assets. But because we put that cash to work and we did keep it in yen for now, we didn't want to move it back and forth between yen and dollars, that as a results of, on average, being invested at a 30 basis point yield or so. So for the quarter, that impacted the new money yield and brought it down. But as we redeploy that money in the future, from yen back to dollars, later on, whether it be later on this year, early next year, you'll see the new money yield go in the opposite direction and be higher than it normally would be. I should also mention, by putting that cash to work, we are earning for this year based on estimates of timing of reversal, about $2 million extra in net investment income versus just sitting idly in cash. So that explains most of the decline for the second quarter versus our planned new money yield. More broadly speaking, for the second quarter, about 50% of the assets that we had to invest in the second quarter. And I'm using Aflac Japan numbers, which was about JPY 224 billion, did go into yen assets because of that extra money that I just referred to. And the other half went into dollar assets, U.S. equity, investment grade, commercial mortgage loans, bank loans. The nice thing is, as you look at the mixture, we continue to diversify the asset base, which gives us as investors a multitude of choices but only from a risk return standpoint but in this very volatile environment, particularly of negative rates in Japan. As our SAA and our outsourcing program and our in-house programs buildout, those choices are opportunistic for us to balance out those things. Then very lastly, in terms of the view of JGB yields and impact to next year's cash flow, let me say this, at net negative rates, which the 10-year is still negative, about 3 weeks ago, the 20-year and the 30-year JGB were both under 10 basis points. We put a moratorium on buying JGBs. And if they should stay at those low levels, we would not be buying JGBs. But as Fred has mentioned, we are actively exploring other yen investments because we do need yen investments, certainly, from an ALM standpoint. Our liabilities, as you know, in Japan are in yen. And there are some promising things on that front, perhaps restarting private placement program. But if we do, it will be in a measured pace and, obviously, with a global credit team, with much stricter risk limits than we had in the past, bringing down our private placements to about 24% of the portfolio. We do feel that there's some capacity there, but we still have to test the market in terms of supply and whether or not the structure of those types of things will meet our requirements. There are yen corporate bonds that we could be looking at. There are some ratings, regulatory, things we need to explore. But all of that is a way to say that the ultimate rate on those assets would be based off the JGB yield curve. But we'd be earning a credit spread. And that is something that we like because we are very bullish and confident of our credit analysis and ability to analyze credit. And therefore, get the right return for the risk we're willing to take. So looking at next year, this is just so, so early but consistent with prior SAA, it would probably be about 30% to 40% yen assets, 50% to 60% dollar assets. But Fred mentioned earlier, we are right now, reviewing SAA in light of negative rates and how that -- the implication of that to the programs. And then from a tactical standpoint, as we look at these U.S. the classes, that will bear into our ultimate positions for next year. So very the luminary view and outlook for next year."

I think what's more important is be realistic about your understanding of what's moving SMR. In other words there's a difference between of SMR rising because of sheer retention and build of capital and SMR rising because of unrealized gains in your portfolio. So from following us, we're quite, I use the terms sober, in terms of understanding SMR but it's driven by unrealized gains. That doesn't necessarily give way to the release of additional capital, et cetera. So we look at it on that basis but pay careful attention to it. I think in addition to that, we look at just sheer cash flow performance and I commented earlier on dynamics involving our FSA earnings. The reason why we have a 80% to 100% of FSA earnings repatriation is a policy is that in times of stress, we may retain more capital. Right now, as I look at the risk as we go forward, I mentioned in my comments that we do have to be conscious of the couple of small close lots of business that are more sensitive to low for longer interest rates and sensitivity. I think it's really too early to tell of the moment whether we'll see any impact from that. We've of course got other blocks of business that tend to be somewhat rich with respect reserves in IBNR, and so forth. And so that could be affecting issues. So at the moment, I think we're just being cautious and looking at those issues. I do think that if you think about where we are in the credit cycle, if you think about the interest rate environment in Japan and the associated volatility, I think it is clear that, the time to be cautious about the notion of sizing, if you will, excess capital deployable capital on a purely Japan basis. Cash flow remains good. I would not really move off of any the comments I made at FAB. But we are more carefully watching it. Now contrast that with the U.S., where if you were to look at a U.S. only basis, our business remains very strong, very stable, it's by definition a low-risk profile business. We run at a very high RBC levels if you were to look on a stand-alone basis. And so I continue to promote the notion that while we're moderating our views of excess capital in Japan, we continue to be bullish on the notion of there being its capital levels in the U.S. And we'll try to balance it out as we go forward."

We do pretty extensive stress testing both in Japan and in the U.S., looking at all the variables you're accustomed to in terms of moving our ratios around.

Remember that their business models tend to be much more heavily weighted towards the types of businesses that will take it on the chin, so to speak, with respect to go for long waits. Now we are not immune from that. We have businesses, most notably, first sector savings-oriented businesses, that will get depressed, some of the longer duration businesses can get depressed related to low for longer reach them even on the third sector side. So we're not any different than the Japanese companies in the sense that we've seen headwinds on those ratios but realize on a relative basis, we tend to perform much better. We tend to model out or favorably because of the sheer strength and size of our third sector business in dominant positions. So no question there has been headwinds to those double what I call traditional economic capital positions. But we tend to do well on a relative basis and if that helps us out."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Let me begin by saying that second quarter rounded out a good first half of the year for Aflac. I'll lead off by providing an update on Aflac Japan, our largest earnings contributor. From",1141,"Thank you, Robin. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Let me begin by saying that second quarter rounded out a good first half of the year for Aflac. I'll lead off by providing an update on Aflac Japan, our largest earnings contributor. From the distribution perspective, our traditional agencies have been and remain vital contributors to our success. This was certainly true in the second quarter. Additionally, all of our alliance partners continued to produce strong results. I'm especially pleased with Japan Post and their 20,000 plus postal outlets selling our cancer insurance. Our goal remains to be where the customers want to buy in our various distribution outlets, broaden our reach to support this goal.
From a product perspective, our priority is to remain in step to the wants and the needs of the Japanese consumers and our distribution channels. Managing through the low interest rate environment is nothing new to Aflac Japan. This entails working through our tactical approach on several fronts, including strategies for product, investment and risk and capital management. Fred will cover more of the financial aspect, but let me expand on our efforts related to products.
Starting with first sector products. We're encouraged that the actions that we've taken throughout the second quarter to limit the sale in first sector products has been yielding the desired results. First sector product sales decreased 24.7% in the quarter. These actions include a combination of product caps, commission restructuring, product repricing in select cases and product discontinuance. Recognizing that many of these actions were initiated in the second quarter, we continue to anticipate a sharp decline of at least 50% in first sector sales in the second half of the year compared to the second half of 2015.
Turning to the third sector products. You'll recall that last quarter, we introduced a cancer insurance product designed for those who have previously been diagnosed with cancer and have been cancer-free for 5 years. This is similar to the product we offer in the United States. Last quarter, we also introduced an enhanced nonstandard medical product. We are pleased with the reception of both products in the marketplace. You'll recall from the May Financial Analyst Briefing that we anticipated sales of third sector products would be in the range of down 3% to up 2%, and that's still the case. With Aflac Japan's third sector products up 11.2% in the quarter and 6.4% year-to-date, we're running ahead of expectation for third sector sales. But there's no one single aspect of the business that has contributed to our outperformance. It's simply stronger-than-expected productivity across the majority of the distribution channels.
Keep in mind, sales in the bank channels had been moderate by restricting our sales of the first sector products. We continue to believe that the long-term compound rate of third sector products will be in the range of 4% to 6%. We will continue to be innovative in providing options to millions of Japanese consumers who are looking for as they struggle from financial burden of higher medical expenses.
Turning to Aflac US. As we indicated before, we see 2016 as the year of stabilization and opportunities as we continue to execute on our strategies. Our efforts are focused on enhancing the relationships we've established with brokers and providing our career agents with the tools to increase productivity. While sales in the second quarter were below expectations, keep in mind that sales in the second half of 2015 contributed to 55.6% of the total sales. Our projections show that we're still on track to achieve our target of increasing Aflac sales 3% to 5% for the year.
I do want to emphasize once again that we anticipate our sales will be increasingly concentrated toward the end of the fourth quarter, though what we've achieved prior to that time lays the groundwork for our overall success. As you all well know, success creates competition. U.S. healthcare reform has been highlighting and clarifying the need for the products we sell. This has resulted in a number of other companies entering the voluntary supplemental insurance market such as traditional major medical carriers and companies that sell voluntary insurance. As a result, we are executing on strategies designed to set Aflac apart and further enhance our awareness and relevance to the employer, the employees and brokers.
Aflac's single focus on supplemental voluntary products have greatly contributed to our dominant position of selling voluntary insurance at the work site, and I believe that will continue to drive our competitive edge. Keep in mind that so far this year, we've written more business than the other 2 competitors combined.
One Day Pay also remains a key differentiator for Aflac. We will continue our promotion of One Day Pay to the consumers, which we believe will help drive increased brand loyalty, account penetration and production. Here is an amazing statistic. In 2015 and continuing through the second quarter of 2016, 100% of the eligible One Day Pay claims submitted were paid within 1 day. We have processed, approved and paid over 1 million One Day Pay clients in the first 6 months of 2016. And get this, 96% of our policyholders that use One Day Pay or SmartClaim, as we call it, said that they are likely to refer other people to Aflac. I am convinced that this will result in more new sales going forward. Paying clients fast and fairly sets us apart from the competition.
Turning to capital deployment. Fred will provide more detail shortly, but let me just say that we continue to view growing the cash dividend and repurchasing our shares as the most attractive means for deploying capital, particularly in the absence of a compelling alternative. We believe the capital strength positioned us to repatriate in the range of JPY 120 billion to JPY 150 billion for the calendar year 2016. Despite market volatility, our capital position remains strong and reinforces our plan to repurchase $1.4 billion of shares of our stock with the majority being concentrating in the first half of this year.
One of the message I'm sending as CEO is we are laser-focused on leveraging opportunities for the future. I'm letting everyone know that innovation and change are vital aspects of the business environment here at Aflac Japan. And that's what continue to propel our long-term growth and our success. We have maintained our focus on controlling the things that we have the power to control. We can and we will control our efforts to build our business and to take care of our customers, our employees and our distribution network. By doing this, I believe we will continue to enhance shareholder value while delivering on our promise to our policyholders.
Now I'll turn the program over to Fred who will cover the financial results. Fred?"

You've all had a chance to review the details in our earnings release. As Dan noted in his comments, the second quarter represents the continuation of the strong financial results we reported in the first quarter and executing on key initiatives covered at this year's Financial Analyst Briefing in May.
Second quarter showed continued progress towards achieving our full-year 2016 earnings guidance. Our results were driven by strong overall margins in both the U.S. and Japan, and there were no notable earnings items to speak of in the quarter. Our Japan segment margins were solid with both benefit and expense ratios coming in as expected and generally in line with our guidance. In the U.S., benefit ratios performed within our expected range after seasonally strong performance in the first quarter. Our expense ratio was modestly favorable in the quarter. Consistent with previous years, we fully expect our expenses to pick up in the latter half of the year as we progress on certain strategic initiatives and increased promotional spend entering the enrollment season. In both Japan and the U.S., we would expect our benefit ratios, expense ratios and overall margins to trend within our December outlook call guidance ranges for the remainder of the year.
Turning to investments. New money rates in Japan were understandably down in the period as we navigate the low yield environment, but also influenced by a tactical strategy of temporarily investing in low-yielding but high-quality and liquid securities, pending development of more attractive long-term investments. We continue to be on plan in terms of Japan's net investment income for 2016.
U.S. new money rates we're influenced by an increased allocation to corporate investment grade purchases, which served to lower new money rates in the quarter. You may recall, in the first quarter, we had elevated new money rates as we concentrated investments in higher-yielding middle-market loans. So to some degree, the second quarter purchases are balancing out our allocations.
Let me comment for a moment on market developments since our FAB meeting in May and its influence on our investment strategy as we look forward in 2016. Specifically, the negative rate environment in Japan and movement in hedge costs supporting our U.S. dollar investment strategy.
Post-Brexit announcement, we experienced another move down in rates as JGBs and U.S. Treasuries continue to be the world's flight to quality currencies and investments. While having modestly recovered in the past few weeks, we have seen 30-year JGBs going down to near 0 at times. Curtailing interest-sensitive premium flows is essential, and as Dan noted, we are taking further actions to reduce the sale of first sector savings products, namely eliminating the sale of product in certain channels and accelerating pricing actions. We will continue to sell repriced savings products in support of our exclusive relationships where the ratio of third sector to first sector sales is significantly in favor of third sector.
Specific to our investment strategy, we remain in good position for 2016 asset flows and defending net investment income, but we are undertaking a review of our strategic and tactical asset allocation and associated risk limits in preparation for 2017 flows. We hope to provide additional color at our September FAB meeting in Japan. But at a high level, the plan explores developing alternative high-quality yen investments, a measured entry back into yen private placements, and U.S. dollar investments where we can hedge effectively and optimizing investment income consistent with our risk limits, ALM and capital objectives.
Turning to U.S. dollar program. Our hedge costs in the second quarter were essentially flat with the first quarter at $0.08 a share. However, hedge costs have continued to increase in recent weeks with market volatility and speculation on BOJ and Federal Reserve actions. At our May FAB meeting, we guided to realized hedge costs of 110 basis points on $13 billion notional investment in forwards, assuming no movement in pricing or change in our hedging strategy. In the weeks leading into Brexit decision, post-Brexit and anticipation of last night's BOJ announcement, 1-year forward pricing is now closer to 160 basis points.
As you know from our previous comments, the rise in hedge costs was fully expected as recent years have experienced abnormally low costs relative to historic norms. Note also that we currently record the full cost of forwards upfront in the quarter purchase instead of amortizing the cost over the life of the hedge, thus the timing of what is rolling on and off the program can make a difference in our reported cost.
In addition to market pricing, as we move into the second half of the year, we intend on executing on a couple tactical moves that will result in an increase in our reported hedge costs. First, we have done some rebalancing and have moved to hedge additional dollar asset classes and expect to increase our net notional forward position by roughly $2.9 billion, including $1.9 billion in bank loans hedged in July. Bank loans are ideal to hedge as these are floating rate and better match for shorter-dated forwards. In addition, we will look to cover a building equity and commercial real estate loan portfolio under our hedge program.
Importantly, hedging these additional U.S. dollar asset classes, along with other related rebalancing activities, are expected to strengthen our SMR ratio once completed. We estimate in the range of 30 points to 50 points at a net cost of approximately $10 million to execute on the overall strategy. Isolating the increase in the cost of hedging and our move to cover additional asset classes increases our hedge cost to the $215 million range for the year.
Finally, we have seen the forward pricing curve flatten, thus making it more economical to lengthen the weighted average tenure of our forwards. Together with our house view that hedge costs may rise, we are exploring lengthening the average maturity of our forwards by rolling a portion into longer-dated positions. This strategy may increase our estimated cost in the $40 million to $60 million range, recognizing our current method of reporting cost at the time of purchase. This strategy may evolve as markets move, and we will continue to guide accordingly as we proceed through the year.
While increasing our reported cost, these moves are favorable from a risk and capital management standpoint. Importantly, the dollar program overall and expanded asset classes continue to perform well, even when considering rising hedge cost and when compared to low-yielding yen alternatives. This is why we've seen a surge in dollar and currency programs among Japanese insurance players over the past few quarters. As we move forward, we will update our guidance accordingly. And as is always the case, our guidance could change based on precise asset flows and market conditions.
Turning to capital. SMR remains in the mid-800% range with unrealized gains up significantly in the quarter. RBC remains strong despite FX impacting the ratio negatively with the yen strengthening and realizing our Japan branches embedded in our U.S. statutory results. Impairments in the quarter were modest and primarily related to our Japan equity portfolio where market declines have triggered impairments in accordance with our internal accounting policies. Overall credit conditions remain stable, and we have seen a recovery in energy names, including our below-investment-grade holdings. We do not see any immediate risk with respect to Brexit and our European holdings.
Overall capital liquidity conditions are strong and support our continued to return of deployable capital to shareholders. Between dividends and repurchase, we returned $570 million to our shareholders in the quarter. Depending on the overall capital conditions, we expect to repatriate 80% to 100% of FSA earnings in 2016 or roughly JPY 120 billion to JPY 150 billion. We continue to spend down excess capital held at the holding company and are on pace to achieve our $1.4 billion of repurchase for the full year. We have made no adjustments to our earnings guidance of $6.17 to $6.41 per share assuming the same average exchange rate as last year, which was roughly JPY 121 to $1. Given strength in the yen during the quarter, we have provided, in our press release, an EPS range for the third quarter assuming the yen to dollar of JPY 100 to $1.10.
When analyzing our performance year-to-date, we are poised for strong performance in 2016. However, we are midway through the year, and we need to be conscious of the low rate environment, headwinds to investment income and associated actuarial review of select interest-sensitive closed blocks of business in Japan. In addition, from a corporate perspective, postretirement benefit liabilities are sensitive to long-term rate assumptions, and we typically review these corporate liabilities in the fourth quarter. Overall, we remain well positioned in terms of our core margins and capital strength.

Let me handle the last -- second part of your question first. We are, in fact, putting under review our definition -- really our non-GAAP definition of hedge cost and how we want to report it in our definition of operating earnings. And in fact, it's very likely, Nigel, that we go to exactly what you're talking about. And that is more of an amortized cost approach, very similar to how you would expect coupons on bonds to behave or interest costs on debt. And so that's really where we're going to move. We will give more detail on this -- more precise detail on this during our outlook call, along with recognizing that we'd have to, some degree, adjust, if you will, our previous year results so that you can see really the comparables year-over-year. But ultimately, the goal is exactly what you're alluding to, and that is we want to get to a definition of hedge costs that moves logically with how you would expect. If pricing is increasing, we would expect hedge cost to go up. If we're lengthening the tenure and it's a steep curve, they would go up and vice versa. And of course, if we're doing more volume, covering more notional, they would go up or down depending on the strategy. What we want to avoid is what we're seeing right now as we don't want any marked-to-market noise, nor do we want the sheer timing of what rolls to influence it. Now to your first question. As we roll into '17, of course, what I just talked about will play into what I'm about ready to say. But you'll generally find a more smoother and logical approach to the cost. So a good way to think about it is if we are covering now, moving from roughly $12.7 billion notional or forwards to upwards of $5.7 billion -- or $5.6 billion notional forwards, you would expect, as you move into 2017, to roughly apply the pricing or average -- weighted average pricing you would expect on those forwards. Now the pricing depends on the market. So it's very difficult for us to estimate what that would be. As I mentioned in my comments, we've seen pricing rise a 1-year forward, for example, right now if you went out and purchased it, it would be 160 basis points. What you could expect is that when we get to our outlook call, we will provide these types of details and ranges and sensitivities as part of our operating earnings. That will give you, I think, a little color."

And you can -- sort of implied in our guidance, if you will, where we talk about repatriating 80% to 100% of FSA earnings or that being JPY 120 billion to JPY 150 billion, that gives you an idea of our expectation around FSA earnings for this year. Okay? So what are the types of things that will cause trend lines in those statutory earnings? You mentioned a couple of them. Growth rates realized over time because we are seeing growth in third sector, which would weigh down on FSA earnings. We're also seeing a gradual decline, obviously, and frankly more than a gradual decline in first sector sales, which would really promote or help, if you will, FSA earnings. So I expect those would probably largely level out. Now you do have some other things playing into FSA earnings. You do have foreign exchange that plays into it as we convert dollar-based coupon income, if you will, in Japan back into yen. You'll see some headwinds, if you will, related to a strengthening yen from that perspective. We have some of that factored into our guidance as you can imagine, but nevertheless, that places a weight on it. And then hedge cost. I always remind folks, hedge costs are, in fact, brought through FSA earnings. And so as those rise, they could be weighing down on your FSA earnings as well. I would note, however, that interestingly enough, even with the rising pricing here, this year, we actually had planned for hedge cost coming in right around where we're seeing them or projecting them today. So I don't see the recent rise in hedge cost as having implication for our 2016 cash flow. When you roll over to the U.S., it's a bit of a different matter, right? So starting with just isolating the notion of U.S.-only statutory income. We don't drive the U.S.-only statutory income. So it ends up being sort of excess cash flows produced in the U.S. And those have remained relatively steady. I would say we are seeing some growth rate in the U.S., and we're also investing in the U.S. platform in the form of technology improvements and infrastructure. So some of those are headwinds to statutory earnings, but otherwise, our sheer margins in the U.S., generally favorable benefit ratios, expense ratios generally under control have been really helpful to stat earnings. So I don't see any sort of, what I would call, capital-related or growth or lack thereof related pressures on statutory earnings in the U.S. I would see it more to do with the pace of investment in the platform."

So one of the things that has happened in the marketplace is while we've seen hedge costs rise, they've also -- the curb is flat. And so for example, in really just the last few months, the difference between a 6-month forward and an 18-month forward has narrowed by some 25 basis points. And so if it costs you upwards of 150 basis points to lock in a 6-month forward, it may cost you more in the 170, 175 basis point range to do an 18-month forward. And so as a tactical strategy, you may want to take advantage of some lengthening where you can, and that's what I was alluding to in my comments. The reason why that results in a more acute cost in 2016, this 40 million to 60 million range I mentioned in my comments, is recognizing that we would pull that whole 18-month cost right into the current period. And so, again, as Nigel pointed out, as we move to a more amortized approach, you won't have that type of fluctuation. And so that gives you an idea of the relative difference and curve difference of extension. Something to remember is that at FAB, we talked about 110 basis points, and remember that is a realized cost estimate, that was taking roughly $13 billion or so of notional and $140 million or so of the expected cost. So when you think about $215 million of cost setting aside the duration extension, that's right around the 140 basis points. So there's a difference between the actual pricing in the market and our realized cost because, of course, we've locked in certain costs and have this accounting issue."

And that is when you put those hedges on, you just gather more favorable SMR treatment, if you will, as opposed to not having it due to essentially what amounts to ALM-related issues, i.e. a dollar investment backing up potentially yen liability. So you gain certain benefits. We also are covering asset classes that could be of a higher charge order, such as bank loans, for example, which will tend to be lower rated, if you will, in general. So again, makes it even particularly helpful. And as I've mentioned in my comments, what I really like about the bank loan coverage, which took some time to qualify, right? When you're talking about floating short-dated investments and short-dated investments that are being managed by third-party asset managers, it took some time to work through the system to qualify for all the appropriate hedge treatment. We were able to get that done here in the last couple months and so we could expand the asset class. So it's a particularly all-in beneficial asset class to hedge, and so we're really happy with the progress we've made there. But that's where you pick up the SMR benefits. In terms of it factoring into our capital plan, yes. Yes in the sense that one of the missions of the hedge program, only one of the missions, is in fact to stabilize and secure our capital dynamics in Japan such that we can be as confident as we can on the steady repatriation of cash flows for deployment. So no matter what the magnitude, it is helpful to our capital plan. I would not view it though as some sort of just booster jump to the capital plan, more if you are playing good defense."

We've been growing the old-fashioned way, which is expand the distribution, new product launches, and we remain somewhat consistent, in my view, on our approach to pricing. One difference, of course, is really focusing in on first sector and third sector savings. I would say when you turn your attention to those products, not surprisingly from an in-force perspective, those products are a bit more under pressure because the opposite has happened. What we have priced for has not played out quite as well in terms of, obviously, yields and investment income on those products. So that certainly offsets my comments, and that's why we're taking significant actions to make sure that we reduce the flows and shift the balance of sales and eventually, in-force over time.

And I think our comparisons, we expected recruiting to be down for this quarter or this year.

As we told you at FAB and other places, our struggle is trying to bring brokers on in a -- we're probably the only organization to have such a -- well, I know we are, to have such a dynamic field force. And so we're trying to push our field force in driving the accounts of 100 or less. The overlap is between the 100 and 1,000. And over 1,000, we tend to see brokers. Now our brokers are also using our field forces enrolls. So that doesn't break out exactly that way because that shows our broker productivity. But all in all, it's beginning to evolve in a way that will ultimately, I think, increase our production, but it has been struggling. Teresa's done an exceptional job in bringing those together. When that's really clicking, that's when you're going to see it take off. And that's what we continue to work on is that -- and the production being off a little bit is because of our field force. But we think with Everwell and our way of enrollments increasing dramatically, up to 40% if you go through that process, that's going to help our field force and the tools that we give them. So it's a delicate balance here, but we're getting closer and closer. And the thing that told me that was in recent meeting I had when some of our managers at our field level said they wanted the managers at our broker level to be at their meetings. They didn't use to want to get together and now they're working together as a team, and I think it's only going to get better as we move forward.

But obviously, as you know, yields have been trending down, both in the U.S. and Japan. So that's partially the decline for the second quarter new money yield. But the bigger attribution of the decline was, and Fred referenced this in his speech, as we're entering into new asset classes, such as infrastructure, commercial mortgage loans, those take time to fund, unlike when we buy investment grade bonds, we get into the market and fund those pretty quickly. Now since we're turning those asset classes on for the first time, we knew that there'd be a delay in funding them. And therefore, during the quarter, we had a buildup of cash because it is taking us a little longer for our first time entering those asset classes. When we're sitting on cash, that doesn't go into the new money yields in the way we've defined it. But nevertheless, sitting on cash is not optimal for us, and we didn't want to do that. So we did put a little over $1 billion to work during the second quarter into yen assets, mostly residential -- Japan residential mortgage-backed securities and some JGBs as a temporary home, if you will. So that when the infrastructure and commercial mortgage loans are ready to be funded, as are our managers call us up and say, we've circled deals for your portfolio, we'll then shift that out of there and put it into those assets. But because we put that cash to work, and we did keep it in yen for now, we didn't want to move it back and forth between yen and dollars, that had the results of, on average, being invested at a 30 basis point yield or so. So for the quarter, that impacted the new money yield and brought it down. But as we redeploy that money in the future from yen back to dollars, later on, whether it be later on this year, early next year, you'll see the new money yield go in the opposite direction and be higher than it normally would be. I should also mention by putting that cash to work, we are earning, for this year based on estimates of timing of reversal, about $2 million extra in net investment income versus it just sitting idly in cash. So that explains most of the decline for the second quarter versus our planned new money yield. More broadly speaking, for the second quarter, about 50% of the assets that we had to invest in the second quarter, and I'm using Aflac Japan numbers, which was about JPY 224 billion, did go into yen assets because of that extra money that I just referred to. And the other half went into dollar assets, U.S. equity, investment grade, commercial mortgage loans, bank loans. The nice thing is, as you look at the mixture, we continue to diversify the asset base, which gives us, as investors, a multitude of choices, not only from a risk return standpoint, but in this very volatile environment, particularly of negative rates in Japan. As our SAA and our outsourcing program and our in-house programs buildout, those choices are opportunistic for us to balance out those things. Then very lastly, in terms of the view of JGB yields and impact to next year's cash flow, let me say this, at net negative rates, which the 10-year is still negative, about 3 weeks ago, the 20-year and the 30-year JGB were both under 10 basis points. We've put a moratorium on buying JGBs. And if they should stay at those low levels, we would not be buying JGBs. But as Fred has mentioned, we are actively exploring other yen investments because we do need yen investments, certainly, from an ALM standpoint. Our liabilities, as you know, in Japan are in yen. And there are some promising things on that front, perhaps restarting our yen private placement program. But if we do, it will be in a measured pace and, obviously, with a global credit team with much stricter risk limits than we had in the past, bringing down our private placements to about 24% of the portfolio. We do feel that there's some capacity there, but we still have to test the market in terms of supply and whether or not the structure of those types of things will meet our requirements. There are yen corporate bonds that we could be looking at. There are some ratings, regulatory things we need to explore. But all of that is a way to say that the ultimate rate on those assets would be based off the JGB yield curve, but we'd be earning a credit spread. And that is something that we like because we are very bullish and confident of our credit analysis and ability to analyze credit and, therefore, get the right return for the risk we're willing to take. So looking at next year, this is just so early, but consistent with prior SAA, it would probably be about 30% to 40% yen assets, 50% to 60% dollar assets. But Fred mentioned earlier, we are right now reviewing SAA in light of negative rates and how that -- the implications of that to the programs. And then from a tactical standpoint, as we look at these new asset classes, that will bear into our ultimate decisions for next year. So very preliminary view and outlook for next year."

I think what's more important is be realistic about your understanding of what's moving SMR. In other words, there's a difference between SMR rising because of sheer retention and build of capital and SMR rising because of unrealized gains in your portfolio. So from following us, we're quite, I'll use the terms, sober in terms of understanding that our SMR may go up at times, but it's driven by unrealized gains. That doesn't necessarily give way to the release of additional capital, et cetera. So we look at it on that basis, but pay careful attention to it. I think in addition to that, we look at just sheer cash flow performance, and I commented earlier on dynamics involving our FSA earnings. The reason why we have 80% to 100% of FSA earnings repatriation as a policy is that in times of stress, we may retain more capital. Right now, as I look at the risk as we go forward, I mentioned in my comments that we do have to be conscious of the couple small closed blocks of business that are more sensitive to low for long interest rates and actuarial sensitivity. I think it's really too early to tell at the moment whether we'll see any impact from that. We've, of course, got other blocks of business that tend to be somewhat ""rich"" with respect to reserves and IBNR and so forth. And so that could be offsetting issues. So at the moment, I think we're just being cautious in looking at those issues. I do think that -- if you think about where we are in the credit cycle, if you think about the interest rate environment in Japan and the associated volatility, I think it is in fact the time to be cautious about the notion of sizing, if you will, excess capital and deployable capital on a purely Japan basis. Cash flow remains good. I would not really move off of any of the comments I made at FAB, but we are more carefully watching it. Now contrast that with the U.S., where if you were to look at U.S.-only basis, our business remains very strong, very stable. It's by definition a low-risk profile business. We run at very high RBC levels if you were to look on a stand-alone basis. And so I continue to promote the notion that while we're moderating our views of excess capital in Japan, we continue to be bullish on the notion of there being excess capital levels in the U.S. And we'll try to balance it out as we go forward."

Now we're not immune from that. We have businesses, most notably, first sector savings-oriented businesses, that will get depressed, some of the longer duration businesses can get depressed related to low for longer rates, even on the third sector side. So we're not any different than the Japanese companies in the sense that we've seen headwinds on those ratios, but realize on a relative basis, we tend to perform much better. We tend to model out more favorably because of the sheer strength and size of our third sector business and dominant positions.

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Let me begin by saying that second quarter rounded out a good first half of the year for Aflac. I'll lead off by providing an update on Aflac Japan, our largest earnings contributor. From",1141,"Thank you, Robin. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Let me begin by saying that second quarter rounded out a good first half of the year for Aflac. I'll lead off by providing an update on Aflac Japan, our largest earnings contributor. From a distribution perspective, our traditional agencies have been and remain vital contributors to our success. This was certainly true in the second quarter. Additionally, all of our alliance partners continued to produce strong results. I'm especially pleased with Japan Post and their 20,000 plus postal outlets selling our cancer insurance. Our goal remains to be where the customers want to buy in our various distribution outlets, broaden our reach to support this goal.
From a product perspective, our priority is to remain in step to the wants and the needs of the Japanese consumers and our distribution channels. Managing through the low interest rate environment is nothing new to Aflac Japan. This entails working through our tactical approach on several fronts, including strategies for product, investment and risk and capital management. Fred will cover more of the financial aspect, but let me expand on our efforts related to products.
Starting with first sector products. We're encouraged that the actions that we've taken throughout the second quarter to limit the sale in first sector products has been yielding the desired results. First sector product sales decreased 24.7% in the quarter. These actions include a combination of product caps, commission restructuring, product repricing in select cases and product discontinuance. Recognizing that many of these actions were initiated in the second quarter, we continue to anticipate a sharp decline of at least 50% in first sector sales in the second half of the year compared to the second half of 2015.
Turning to the third sector products. You'll recall that last quarter, we introduced a cancer insurance product designed for those who have previously been diagnosed with cancer and have been cancer-free for 5 years. This is similar to the product we offer in the United States. Last quarter, we also introduced an enhanced nonstandard medical product. We are pleased with the reception of both products in the marketplace. You'll recall from the May Financial Analyst Briefing that we anticipated sales of third sector products would be in the range of down 3% to up 2%, and that's still the case. With Aflac Japan's third sector products up 11.2% in the quarter and 6.4% year-to-date, we're running ahead of expectation for third sector sales. But there's no one single aspect of the business that has contributed to our outperformance. It's simply stronger-than-expected productivity across the majority of the distribution channels.
Keep in mind, sales in the bank channels has been moderate by restricting our sales of the first sector products. We continue to believe that the long-term compound rate of third sector products will be in the range of 4% to 6%. We will continue to be innovative in providing options that millions of Japanese consumers are looking for as they struggle from financial burden of higher medical expenses.
Turning to Aflac US. As we indicated before, we see 2016 as the year of stabilization and opportunities as we continue to execute on our strategies. Our efforts are focused on enhancing the relationships we've established with brokers and providing our career agents with the tools to increase productivity. While sales in the second quarter were below expectations, keep in mind that sales in the second half of 2015 contributed to 55.6% of the total sales. Our projections show that we're still on track to achieve our target of increasing Aflac sales 3% to 5% for the year.
I do want to emphasize once again that we anticipate our sales will be increasingly concentrated toward the end of the fourth quarter, though what we've achieved prior to that time lays the groundwork for our overall success. As you all well know, success creates competition. U.S. healthcare reform has been highlighting and clarifying the need for the products we sell. This has resulted in a number of other companies entering the voluntary supplemental insurance market such as traditional major medical carriers and companies that sell voluntary insurance. As a result, we are executing on strategies designed to set Aflac apart and further enhance our awareness and relevance to the employer, the employees and brokers.
Aflac's single focus on supplemental voluntary products have greatly contributed to our dominant position of selling voluntary insurance at the work site, and I believe it will continue to drive our competitive edge. Keep in mind that so far this year, we've written more business than the other 2 competitors combined.
One Day Pay also remains a key differentiator for Aflac. We will continue our promotion of One Day Pay to the consumers, which we believe will help drive increased brand loyalty, account penetration and production. Here is an amazing statistic. In 2015 and continuing through the second quarter of 2016, 100% of the eligible One Day Pay claims submitted were paid within 1 day. We have processed, approved and paid over 1 million One Day Pay clients in the first 6 months of 2016. And get this, 96% of our policyholders that use One Day Pay or SmartClaim, as we call it, said that they are likely to refer other people to Aflac. I am convinced that this will result in more new sales going forward. Paying clients fast and fairly sets us apart from the competition.
Turning to capital deployment. Fred will provide more detail shortly, but let me just say that we continue to view growing the cash dividend and repurchasing our shares as the most attractive means for deploying capital, particularly in the absence of a compelling alternative. We believe the capital strength positioned us to repatriate in the range of JPY 120 billion to JPY 150 billion for the calendar year 2016. Despite market volatility, our capital position remains strong and reinforces our plan to repurchase $1.4 billion of shares of our stock with the majority being concentrating in the first half of this year.
One of the message I'm sending as CEO is we are laser-focused on leveraging opportunities for the future. I'm letting everyone know that innovation and change are vital aspects of the business environment here at Aflac Japan. And that's what will continue to propel our long-term growth and our success. We have maintained our focus on controlling the things that we have the power to control. We can and we will control our efforts to build our business and to take care of our customers, our employees and our distribution network. By doing this, I believe we will continue to enhance shareholder value while delivering on our promise to our policyholders.
Now I'll turn the program over to Fred, who will cover the financial results. Fred?"

You've all had a chance to review the details in our earnings release. As Dan noted in his comments, the second quarter represents a continuation of the strong financial results we reported in the first quarter and executing on key initiative",1483,"Thanks, Dan. You've all had a chance to review the details in our earnings release. As Dan noted in his comments, the second quarter represents a continuation of the strong financial results we reported in the first quarter and executing on key initiatives covered at this year's Financial Analyst Briefing in May.
Second quarter showed continued progress towards achieving our full-year 2016 earnings guidance. Our results were driven by strong overall margins in both the U.S. and Japan, and there were no notable earnings items to speak of in the quarter. Our Japan segment margins were solid with both benefit and expense ratios coming in as expected and generally in line with our guidance. In the U.S., benefit ratios performed within our expected range after seasonally strong performance in the first quarter. Our expense ratio was modestly favorable in the quarter. Consistent with previous years, we fully expect our expenses to pick up in the latter half of the year as we progress on certain strategic initiatives and increase promotional spend entering the enrollment season. In both Japan and the U.S., we would expect our benefit ratios, expense ratios and overall margins to trend within our December outlook call guidance ranges for the remainder of the year.
Turning to investments. New money rates in Japan were understandably down in the period as we navigate the low yield environment, but also influenced by a tactical strategy of temporarily investing in low-yielding but high-quality and liquid securities, pending development of more attractive long-term investments. We continue to be on plan in terms of Japan's net investment income for 2016.
U.S. new money rates were influenced by an increased allocation to corporate investment grade purchases, which served to lower new money rates in the quarter. You may recall, in the first quarter, we had elevated new money rates as we concentrated investments in higher-yielding middle-market loans. So to some degree, the second quarter purchases are balancing out our allocations.
Let me comment for a moment on market developments since our FAB Meeting in May and its influence on our investment strategy as we look forward in 2016. Specifically, the negative rate environment in Japan and movement in hedge costs supporting our U.S. dollar investment strategy.
Post-Brexit announcement, we experienced another move down in rates as JGBs and U.S. Treasuries continue to be the world's flight to quality currencies and investments. While having modestly recovered in the past few weeks, we have seen 30-year JGBs grind down to near 0 at times. Curtailing interest-sensitive premium flows is essential, and as Dan noted, we are taking further action to reduce the sale of first sector savings products, namely eliminating the sale of product in certain channels and accelerating pricing actions. We will continue to sell repriced savings products in support of our exclusive relationships where the ratio of third sector to first sector sales is significantly in favor of third sector.
Specific to investment strategy, we remain in good position for 2016 asset flows and defending net investment income, but we are undertaking a review of our strategic and tactical asset allocation and associated risk limits in preparation for 2017 flows. We hope to provide additional color at our September FAB Meeting in Japan. But at a high level, the plan explores developing alternative high-quality yen investments, a measured entry back into yen private placements, and U.S. dollar investments where we can hedge effectively in optimizing investment income consistent with our risk limits, ALM and capital objectives.
Turning to U.S. dollar program. Our hedge costs in the second quarter were essentially flat with the first quarter at $0.08 a share. However, hedge costs have continued to increase in recent weeks with market volatility and speculation on BOJ and Federal Reserve actions. At our May FAB Meeting, we guided to realized hedge costs of 110 basis points on $13 billion notional investment in forwards, assuming no movement in pricing or change in our hedging strategy. In the weeks leading into Brexit decision, post-Brexit and anticipation of last night's BOJ announcement, 1-year forward pricing is now closer to 160 basis points.
As you know from our previous comments, the rise in hedge costs was fully expected as recent years have experienced abnormally low costs relative to historic norms. Note also that we currently record the full cost of forwards upfront in the quarter purchase instead of amortizing the cost over the life of the hedge, thus the timing of what is rolling on and off the program can make a difference in our reported cost.
In addition to market pricing, as we move into the second half of the year, we intend on executing on a couple of tactical moves that will result in an increase in our reported hedge costs. First, we have done some rebalancing and have moved to hedge additional dollar asset classes and expect to increase our net notional forward position by roughly $2.9 billion, including $1.9 billion in bank loans hedged in July. Bank loans are ideal to hedge as these are floating rate and better match for shorter-dated forwards. In addition, we will look to cover a building equity and commercial real estate loan portfolio under our hedge program.
Importantly, hedging these additional U.S. dollar asset classes, along with other related rebalancing activities, are expected to strengthen our SMR ratio once completed. We estimate in the range of 30 points to 50 points at a net cost of approximately $10 million to execute on the overall strategy. Isolating the increase in the cost of hedging and our move to cover additional asset classes increases our hedge cost to the $215 million range for the year.
Finally, we have seen the forward pricing curve flatten, thus making it more economical to lengthen the weighted average tenure of our forwards. Together with our house view that hedge costs may rise, we are exploring lengthening the average maturity of our forwards by rolling a portion into longer-dated positions. This strategy may increase our estimated cost in the $40 million to $60 million range, recognizing our current method of reporting cost at the time of purchase. This strategy may evolve as markets move, and we will continue to guide accordingly as we proceed through the year.
While increasing our reported cost, these moves are favorable from a risk and capital management standpoint. Importantly, the dollar program overall and expanded asset classes continue to perform well, even when considering rising hedge cost and when compared to low-yielding yen alternatives. This is why we've seen a surge in dollar and currency programs among Japanese insurance players over the past few quarters. As we move forward, we will update our guidance accordingly. And as is always the case, our guidance could change based on precise asset flows and market conditions.
Turning to capital. SMR remains in the mid-800% range with unrealized gains up significantly in the quarter. RBC remains strong despite FX impacting the ratio negatively with the yen strengthening and realizing our Japan branches embedded in our U.S. statutory results. Impairments in the quarter were modest and primarily related to our Japan equity portfolio where market declines have triggered impairments in accordance with our internal accounting policies. Overall credit conditions remain stable, and we have seen a recovery in energy names, including our below-investment-grade holdings. We do not see any immediate risk with respect to Brexit and our European holdings.
Overall capital liquidity conditions are strong and support our continued return of deployable capital to shareholders. Between dividends and repurchase, we returned $570 million to our shareholders in the quarter. Depending on the overall capital conditions, we expect to repatriate 80% to 100% of FSA earnings in 2016 or roughly JPY 120 billion to JPY 150 billion. We continue to spend down excess capital held at the holding company and are on pace to achieve our $1.4 billion of repurchase for the full year. We have made no adjustments to our earnings guidance of $6.17 to $6.41 per share assuming the same average exchange rate as last year, which was roughly JPY 121 to $1. Given strength in the yen during the quarter, we have provided, in our press release, an EPS range for the third quarter assuming the yen to dollar of JPY 100 to $1.10.
When analyzing our performance year-to-date, we are poised for strong performance in 2016. However, we are midway through the year, and we need to be conscious of the low rate environment, headwinds to investment income and associated actuarial review of select interest-sensitive closed blocks of business in Japan. In addition, from a corporate perspective, postretirement benefit liabilities are sensitive to long-term rate assumptions, and we typically review these corporate liabilities in the fourth quarter. Overall, we remain well positioned in terms of our core margins and capital strength.

Let me handle the last -- second part of your question first. We are, in fact, putting under review our definition -- really our non-GAAP definition of hedge cost and how we want to report it in our definition of operating earnings. And in fact, it's very likely, Nigel, that we go to exactly what you're talking about. And that is more of an amortized cost approach, very similar to how you would expect coupons on bonds to behave or interest costs on debt. And so that's really where we're going to move. We will give more detail on this -- more precise detail on this during our outlook call, along with recognizing that we'd have to some degree adjust, if you will, our previous year results so that you can see really the comparables year-over-year. But ultimately, the goal is exactly what you're alluding to, and that is we want to get to a definition of hedge costs that moves logically with how you would expect. If pricing is increasing, we would expect hedge cost to go up. If we're lengthening the tenure and it's a steep curve, they would go up and vice versa. And of course, if we're doing more volume, covering more notional, they would go up or down depending on the strategy. What we want to avoid is what we're seeing right now as we don't want any marked-to-market noise, nor do we want the sheer timing of what rolls to influence it. Now to your first question. As we roll into '17, of course, what I just talked about will play into what I'm about ready to say. But you'll generally find a more smoother and logical approach to the cost. So a good way to think about it is if we are covering now, moving from roughly $12.7 billion notional or forwards to upwards of $5.7 billion -- or $5.6 billion notional forwards, you would expect, as you move into 2017, to roughly apply the pricing or average -- weighted average pricing you would expect on those forwards. Now the pricing depends on the market. So it's very difficult for us to estimate what that would be. As I mentioned in my comments, we've seen pricing rise a 1-year forward, for example, right now if you went out and purchased it, would be 160 basis points. What you could expect is that when we get to our outlook call, we will provide these types of details and ranges and sensitivities as part of our operating earnings. That will give you, I think, a little color."

And you can -- sort of implied in our guidance, if you will, where we talk about repatriating 80% to 100% of FSA earnings or that being JPY 120 billion to JPY 150 billion, that gives you an idea of our expectation around FSA earnings for this year. Okay? So what are the types of things that will cause trend lines in those statutory earnings? You'd mentioned a couple of them. Growth rates realized over time because we are seeing growth in third sector, which would weigh down on FSA earnings. We're also seeing a gradual decline, obviously, and frankly more than a gradual decline in first sector sales, which would really promote or help, if you will, FSA earnings. So I expect those would probably largely level out. Now you do have some other things playing into FSA earnings. You do have foreign exchange that plays into it as we convert dollar-based coupon income, if you will, in Japan back into yen. You'll see some headwinds, if you will, related to a strengthening yen from that perspective. We have some of that factored into our guidance as you can imagine, but nevertheless, that plays a weight on it. And then hedge cost. I always remind folks, hedge costs are, in fact, brought through FSA earnings. And so as those rise, they could be weighing down on your FSA earnings as well. I would note, however, that interestingly enough, even with the rise in pricing here, this year, we actually had planned for hedge cost coming in right around where we're seeing them or projecting them today. So I don't see the recent rise in hedge cost as having implication for our 2016 cash flow. When you roll over to the U.S., it's a bit of a different matter, right? So starting with just isolating the notion of U.S.-only statutory income. We don't drive a U.S.-only statutory income. So it ends up being sort of excess cash flows produced in the U.S. And those have remained relatively steady. I would say we are seeing some growth rate in the U.S., and we're also investing in the U.S. platform in the form of technology improvements and infrastructure. So some of those are headwinds to statutory earnings, but otherwise, our sheer margins in the U.S., generally favorable benefit ratios, expense ratios generally under control, have been really helpful to stat earnings. So I don't see any sort of, what I would call, capital-related or growth or lack thereof related pressures on statutory earnings in the U.S. I would see it more to do with the pace of investment in the platform."

So one of the things that has happened in the marketplace is while we've seen hedge costs rise, they've also -- the curb has flattened. And so for example, in really just the last few months, the difference between a 6-month forward and an 18-month forward has narrowed by some 25 basis points. And so if it costs you upwards of 150 basis points to lock in a 6-month forward, it may cost you more in the 170-, 175-basis-point range to do an 18-month forward. And so as a tactical strategy, you may want to take advantage of some lengthening where you can, and that's what I was alluding to in my comments. The reason why that results in a more acute cost in 2016, this 40 million to 60 million range I mentioned in my comments, is recognizing that we would pull that whole 18-month cost right into the current period. And so, again, as Nigel pointed out, as we move to a more amortized approach, you won't have that type of fluctuation. And so that gives you an idea of the relative difference and curve difference of extension. Something to remember is that at FAB, we talked about 110 basis points, and remember that is a realized cost estimate, that was taking roughly $13 billion or so of notional and $140 million or so of expected cost. So when you think about $215 million of cost setting aside the duration extension, that's right around 140 basis points. So there's a difference between the actual pricing in the market and our realized cost because, of course, we've locked in certain costs and have this accounting issue."

So the answer to your first question is yes. And that is when you put those hedges on, you just gather more favorable SMR treatment, if you will, as opposed to not having it due to essentially what amounts to ALM-related issues, i.e. a dollar investment backing up potentially yen liability. So you gain certain benefits. We also are covering asset classes that could be of a higher charge order, such as bank loans, for example, which will tend to be lower rated, if you will, in general. So again, makes it even particularly helpful. And as I mentioned in my comments, what I really like about the bank loan coverage, which took some time to qualify, right? When you're talking about floating short-dated investments and short-dated investments that are being managed by third-party asset managers, it took some time to work through the system to qualify for all the appropriate hedge treatment. We were able to get that done here in the last couple months and so we could expand the asset class. So it's a particularly all-in beneficial asset class to hedge, and so we're really happy with the progress we've made there. But that's where you pick up the SMR benefits. In terms of it factoring into our capital plan, yes. Yes, in the sense that one of the missions of the hedge program, only one of the missions, is in fact to stabilize and secure our capital dynamics in Japan such that we can be as confident as we can on the steady repatriation of cash flows for deployment. So no matter what the magnitude, it is helpful to our capital plan. I would not view it though as some sort of just booster jump to the capital plan, more good -- playing good defense."

In terms of the second half of the year, the comparisons are there, and we do have to go up against stronger numbers. That said, we are running ahead of where we expected to be. And I think at the mini FAB Meeting in September, we would be in a better position to comment on whether we thought sales would continue to trend better than they have. As you know, we launched our MIT product this past week. And so by the time we get to our mid -- mini FAB Meeting in September, we should be able to give you some idea about the receptivity of that product. But as I've told you in the past, with any new product line, we're always tentative about how we receive and how long it would take the Japanese agencies to adopt it and begin selling it. We are very -- seeing very favorable results out of both our cancer for cancer survivors insurance as well as our revision of our nonstandard medical plan. So I remain very optimistic.

In terms of some of the new pricing, obviously, we tried to remain very disciplined on that front. I think in Japan, there hasn't been much movement on that. We've been growing the old-fashioned way, which is expanded distribution, new product launches, and we remain somewhat consistent, in my view, on our approach to pricing. One difference, of course, is really focusing in on first sector and first sector savings. I would say when you turn your attention to those products, not surprisingly from an in-force perspective, those products are a bit more under pressure because the opposite has happened. What we have priced for has not played out quite as well in terms of, obviously, yields and investment income on those products. So that certainly offsets my comments, and it's why we're taking significant actions to make sure that we reduce the flows and shift the balance of sales and eventually, in-force over time. So that's the way I would describe it. But obviously, from the in-force perspective on the third sector side and really the entirety of the U.S. platform, it continues to be a very strong story."

And so we're trying to push our field force in deriving the accounts of 100 or less. The overlap is between the 100 and 1,000. And over 1,000, we tend to see brokers. Now our brokers are also using our field force as enrollers. So that doesn't break out exactly that way because that shows as broker productivity. But all in all, it's beginning to evolve in a way that will ultimately, I think, increase our production, but it has been a struggle. And Teresa's done an exceptional job in bringing those together. When that's really clicking, that's when you're going to see it take off. And that's what we continue to work on is that -- and the production being off a little bit is because of our field force. But we think with Everwell and our way of enrollments increasing dramatically, up to 40% if you go through that process, that's going to help our field force and the tools that we give them. So it's a delicate balance here, but we're getting closer and closer. And the thing that told me that was in a recent meeting I had when some of our managers at our field level said they wanted the managers at our broker level to be at their meetings.

But obviously, as you know, yields have been trending down, both in the U.S. and Japan. So that's partially the decline for the second quarter new money yield. But the bigger attribution of the decline was, and Fred referenced this in his speech, as we're entering into new asset classes, such as infrastructure, commercial mortgage loans, those take time to fund, unlike when we buy investment grade bonds, we get into the market and fund those pretty quickly. Now since we're turning those asset classes on for the first time, we knew that there'd be a delay in funding them. And therefore, during the quarter, we had a buildup of cash because it is taking us a little longer for our first time entering those asset classes. When we're sitting on cash, that doesn't go into the new money yields in the way we've defined it. But nevertheless, sitting on cash is not optimal for us, and we didn't want to do that. So we did put a little over $1 billion to work during the second quarter into yen assets, mostly residential -- Japan residential mortgage-backed securities and some JGBs as a temporary home, if you will. So that when the infrastructure and commercial mortgage loans are ready to be funded, as our managers call us up and say, we've circled deals for your portfolio, we'll then shift that out of there and put it into those assets. But because we put that cash to work, and we did keep it in yen for now, we didn't want to move it back and forth between yen and dollars, that had the results of, on average, being invested at a 30-basis-point yield or so. So for the quarter, that impacted the new money yield and brought it down. But as we redeploy that money in the future from yen back to dollars, later on, whether it be later on this year, early next year, you'll see the new money yield go in the opposite direction and be higher than it normally would be. I should also mention by putting that cash to work, we are earning, for this year based on estimates of timing of reversal, about $2 million extra in net investment income versus it just sitting idly in cash. So that explains most of the decline for the second quarter versus our planned new money yield. More broadly speaking, for the second quarter, about 50% of the assets that we had to invest in the second quarter, and I'm using Aflac Japan numbers, which was about JPY 224 billion, did go into yen assets because of that extra money that I just referred to. And the other half went into dollar assets, U.S. equity, investment grade, commercial mortgage loans, bank loans. The nice thing is, as you look at the mixture, we continue to diversify the asset base, which gives us, as investors, a multitude of choices, not only from a risk return standpoint, but in this very volatile environment, particularly of negative rates in Japan. As our SAA and our outsourcing program and our in-house programs build out, those choices are opportunistic for us to balance out those things. Then very lastly, in terms of the view of JGB yields and impact to next year's cash flow, let me say this, at net negative rates, which the 10-year is still negative, about 3 weeks ago, the 20-year and the 30-year JGB were both under 10 basis points. We've put a moratorium on buying JGBs. And if they should stay at those low levels, we would not be buying JGBs. But as Fred has mentioned, we are actively exploring other yen investments because we do need yen investments, certainly, from an ALM standpoint. Our liabilities, as you know, in Japan are in yen. And there are some promising things on that front, perhaps restarting our yen private placement program. But if we do, it will be in a measured pace and, obviously, with a global credit team with much stricter risk limits than we had in the past, bringing down our private placements to about 24% of the portfolio. We do feel that there's some capacity there, but we still have to test the market in terms of supply and whether or not the structure of those types of things will meet our requirements. There are yen corporate bonds that we could be looking at. There are some ratings, regulatory things we need to explore. But all of that is a way to say that the ultimate rate on those assets would be based off the JGB yield curve, but we'd be earning a credit spread. And that is something that we like because we are very bullish and confident of our credit analysis and ability to analyze credit and, therefore, get the right return for the risk we're willing to take. So looking at next year, this is just so early, but consistent with prior SAA, it would probably be about 30% to 40% yen assets, 50% to 60% dollar assets. But Fred mentioned earlier, we are right now reviewing SAA in light of negative rates and how that -- the implications of that to the programs. And then from a tactical standpoint, as we look at these new asset classes, that will bear into our ultimate decisions for next year. So very preliminary view and outlook for next year."

I think what's more important is be realistic about your understanding of what's moving SMR. In other words, there's a difference between SMR rising because of sheer retention and build of capital and SMR rising because of unrealized gains in your portfolio. So you know from following us, we're quite, I'll use the term sober, in terms of understanding that our SMR may go up at times, but it's driven by unrealized gains. That doesn't necessarily give way to the release of additional capital, et cetera. So we look at it on that basis, but pay careful attention to it. I think in addition to that, we look at just sheer cash flow performance, and I commented earlier on dynamics involving our FSA earnings. The reason why we have 80% to 100% of FSA earnings repatriation as a policy is that in times of stress, we may retain more capital. Right now, as I look at the risk as we go forward, I mentioned in my comments that we do have to be conscious of a couple small closed blocks of business that are more sensitive to low for long interest rates and actuarial sensitivity. I think it's really too early to tell at the moment whether we'll see any impact from that. We've, of course, got other blocks of business that tend to be somewhat ""rich"" with respect to reserves and IBNR and so forth. And so there could be offsetting issues. So at the moment, I think we're just being cautious in looking at those issues. I do think that -- if you think about where we are in the credit cycle, if you think about the interest rate environment in Japan and the associated volatility, I think it is in fact the time to be cautious about the notion of sizing, if you will, excess capital and deployable capital on a purely Japan basis. Cash flow remains good. I would not really move off of any of the comments I made at FAB, but we are more carefully watching it. Now contrast that with the U.S., where if you were to look at a U.S.-only basis, our business remains very strong, very stable. It's by definition a low-risk profile business. We run at very high RBC levels if you were to look on a stand-alone basis. And so I continue to promote the notion that while we're moderating our views of excess capital in Japan, we continue to be bullish on the notion of there being excess capital levels in the U.S. And we'll try to balance it out as we go forward."

We do pretty extensive stress testing, both in Japan and in the U.S., looking at all the variables you're accustomed to in terms of moving our ratios around.

Now we're not immune from that. We have businesses, most notably, first sector savings-oriented businesses, that will get depressed, some of the longer duration businesses can get depressed related to low for long rates, even on the third sector side. So we're not any different than the Japanese companies in the sense that we've seen headwinds on those ratios, but realize on a relative basis, we tend to perform much better. We tend to model out more favorably because of the sheer strength and size of our third sector business and dominant positions. So no question, there has been headwinds to those type of, what I call, traditional economic capital positions. But we tend to do well on a relative basis and that helps us out."

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Let me begin by saying that second quarter rounded out a good first half of the year for Aflac. I'll lead off by providing an update on Aflac Japan, our largest earnings contributor. From",1141,"Thank you, Robin. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Let me begin by saying that second quarter rounded out a good first half of the year for Aflac. I'll lead off by providing an update on Aflac Japan, our largest earnings contributor. From a distribution perspective, our traditional agencies have been and remain vital contributors to our success. This was certainly true in the second quarter. Additionally, all of our alliance partners continued to produce strong results. I'm especially pleased with Japan Post and their 20,000 plus postal outlets selling our cancer insurance. Our goal remains to be where the customers want to buy in our various distribution outlets, broaden our reach to support this goal.
From a product perspective, our priority is to remain in step to the wants and the needs of the Japanese consumers and our distribution channels. Managing through the low interest rate environment is nothing new to Aflac Japan. This entails working through our tactical approach on several fronts, including strategies for product, investment and risk and capital management. Fred will cover more of the financial aspect, but let me expand on our efforts related to products.
Starting with first sector products. We're encouraged that the actions that we've taken throughout the second quarter to limit the sale in first sector products has been yielding the desired results. First sector product sales decreased 24.7% in the quarter. These actions include a combination of product caps, commission restructuring, product repricing in select cases and product discontinuance. Recognizing that many of these actions were initiated in the second quarter, we continue to anticipate a sharp decline of at least 50% in first sector sales in the second half of the year compared to the second half of 2015.
Turning to the third sector products. You'll recall that last quarter, we introduced a cancer insurance product designed for those who have previously been diagnosed with cancer and have been cancer-free for 5 years. This is similar to the product we offer in the United States. Last quarter, we also introduced an enhanced nonstandard medical product. We are pleased with the reception of both products in the marketplace. You'll recall from the May Financial Analyst Briefing that we anticipated sales of third sector products would be in the range of down 3% to up 2%, and that's still the case. With Aflac Japan's third sector products up 11.2% in the quarter and 6.4% year-to-date, we're running ahead of expectation for third sector sales. But there's no one single aspect of the business that has contributed to our outperformance. It's simply stronger-than-expected productivity across the majority of the distribution channels.
Keep in mind, sales in the bank channels has been moderate by restricting our sales of the first sector products. We continue to believe that the long-term compound rate of third sector products will be in the range of 4% to 6%. We will continue to be innovative in providing options that millions of Japanese consumers are looking for as they struggle from financial burden of higher medical expenses.
Turning to Aflac US. As we indicated before, we see 2016 as the year of stabilization and opportunities as we continue to execute on our strategies. Our efforts are focused on enhancing the relationships we've established with brokers and providing our career agents with the tools to increase productivity. While sales in the second quarter were below expectations, keep in mind that sales in the second half of 2015 contributed to 55.6% of the total sales. Our projections show that we're still on track to achieve our target of increasing Aflac sales 3% to 5% for the year.
I do want to emphasize once again that we anticipate our sales will be increasingly concentrated toward the end of the fourth quarter, though what we've achieved prior to that time lays the groundwork for our overall success. As you all well know, success creates competition. U.S. healthcare reform has been highlighting and clarifying the need for the products we sell. This has resulted in a number of other companies entering the voluntary supplemental insurance market such as traditional major medical carriers and companies that sell voluntary insurance. As a result, we are executing on strategies designed to set Aflac apart and further enhance our awareness and relevance to the employer, the employees and brokers.
Aflac's single focus on supplemental voluntary products have greatly contributed to our dominant position of selling voluntary insurance at the work site, and I believe it will continue to drive our competitive edge. Keep in mind that so far this year, we've written more business than the other 2 competitors combined.
One Day Pay also remains a key differentiator for Aflac. We will continue our promotion of One Day Pay to the consumers, which we believe will help drive increased brand loyalty, account penetration and production. Here is an amazing statistic. In 2015 and continuing through the second quarter of 2016, 100% of the eligible One Day Pay claims submitted were paid within 1 day. We have processed, approved and paid over 1 million One Day Pay clients in the first 6 months of 2016. And get this, 96% of our policyholders that use One Day Pay or SmartClaim, as we call it, said that they are likely to refer other people to Aflac. I am convinced that this will result in more new sales going forward. Paying clients fast and fairly sets us apart from the competition.
Turning to capital deployment. Fred will provide more detail shortly, but let me just say that we continue to view growing the cash dividend and repurchasing our shares as the most attractive means for deploying capital, particularly in the absence of a compelling alternative. We believe the capital strength positioned us to repatriate in the range of JPY 120 billion to JPY 150 billion for the calendar year 2016. Despite market volatility, our capital position remains strong and reinforces our plan to repurchase $1.4 billion of shares of our stock with the majority being concentrating in the first half of this year.
One of the message I'm sending as CEO is we are laser-focused on leveraging opportunities for the future. I'm letting everyone know that innovation and change are vital aspects of the business environment here at Aflac Japan. And that's what will continue to propel our long-term growth and our success. We have maintained our focus on controlling the things that we have the power to control. We can and we will control our efforts to build our business and to take care of our customers, our employees and our distribution network. By doing this, I believe we will continue to enhance shareholder value while delivering on our promise to our policyholders.
Now I'll turn the program over to Fred, who will cover the financial results. Fred?"

You've all had a chance to review the details in our earnings release. As Dan noted in his comments, the second quarter represents a continuation of the strong financial results we reported in the first quarter and executing on key initiative",1483,"Thanks, Dan. You've all had a chance to review the details in our earnings release. As Dan noted in his comments, the second quarter represents a continuation of the strong financial results we reported in the first quarter and executing on key initiatives covered at this year's Financial Analyst Briefing in May.
Second quarter showed continued progress towards achieving our full-year 2016 earnings guidance. Our results were driven by strong overall margins in both the U.S. and Japan, and there were no notable earnings items to speak of in the quarter. Our Japan segment margins were solid with both benefit and expense ratios coming in as expected and generally in line with our guidance. In the U.S., benefit ratios performed within our expected range after seasonally strong performance in the first quarter. Our expense ratio was modestly favorable in the quarter. Consistent with previous years, we fully expect our expenses to pick up in the latter half of the year as we progress on certain strategic initiatives and increase promotional spend entering the enrollment season. In both Japan and the U.S., we would expect our benefit ratios, expense ratios and overall margins to trend within our December outlook call guidance ranges for the remainder of the year.
Turning to investments. New money rates in Japan were understandably down in the period as we navigate the low yield environment, but also influenced by a tactical strategy of temporarily investing in low-yielding but high-quality and liquid securities, pending development of more attractive long-term investments. We continue to be on plan in terms of Japan's net investment income for 2016.
U.S. new money rates were influenced by an increased allocation to corporate investment grade purchases, which served to lower new money rates in the quarter. You may recall, in the first quarter, we had elevated new money rates as we concentrated investments in higher-yielding middle-market loans. So to some degree, the second quarter purchases are balancing out our allocations.
Let me comment for a moment on market developments since our FAB Meeting in May and its influence on our investment strategy as we look forward in 2016. Specifically, the negative rate environment in Japan and movement in hedge costs supporting our U.S. dollar investment strategy.
Post-Brexit announcement, we experienced another move down in rates as JGBs and U.S. Treasuries continue to be the world's flight to quality currencies and investments. While having modestly recovered in the past few weeks, we have seen 30-year JGBs grind down to near 0 at times. Curtailing interest-sensitive premium flows is essential, and as Dan noted, we are taking further action to reduce the sale of first sector savings products, namely eliminating the sale of product in certain channels and accelerating pricing actions. We will continue to sell repriced savings products in support of our exclusive relationships where the ratio of third sector to first sector sales is significantly in favor of third sector.
Specific to investment strategy, we remain in good position for 2016 asset flows and defending net investment income, but we are undertaking a review of our strategic and tactical asset allocation and associated risk limits in preparation for 2017 flows. We hope to provide additional color at our September FAB Meeting in Japan. But at a high level, the plan explores developing alternative high-quality yen investments, a measured entry back into yen private placements, and U.S. dollar investments where we can hedge effectively in optimizing investment income consistent with our risk limits, ALM and capital objectives.
Turning to U.S. dollar program. Our hedge costs in the second quarter were essentially flat with the first quarter at $0.08 a share. However, hedge costs have continued to increase in recent weeks with market volatility and speculation on BOJ and Federal Reserve actions. At our May FAB Meeting, we guided to realized hedge costs of 110 basis points on $13 billion notional investment in forwards, assuming no movement in pricing or change in our hedging strategy. In the weeks leading into Brexit decision, post-Brexit and anticipation of last night's BOJ announcement, 1-year forward pricing is now closer to 160 basis points.
As you know from our previous comments, the rise in hedge costs was fully expected as recent years have experienced abnormally low costs relative to historic norms. Note also that we currently record the full cost of forwards upfront in the quarter purchase instead of amortizing the cost over the life of the hedge, thus the timing of what is rolling on and off the program can make a difference in our reported cost.
In addition to market pricing, as we move into the second half of the year, we intend on executing on a couple of tactical moves that will result in an increase in our reported hedge costs. First, we have done some rebalancing and have moved to hedge additional dollar asset classes and expect to increase our net notional forward position by roughly $2.9 billion, including $1.9 billion in bank loans hedged in July. Bank loans are ideal to hedge as these are floating rate and better match for shorter-dated forwards. In addition, we will look to cover a building equity and commercial real estate loan portfolio under our hedge program.
Importantly, hedging these additional U.S. dollar asset classes, along with other related rebalancing activities, are expected to strengthen our SMR ratio once completed. We estimate in the range of 30 points to 50 points at a net cost of approximately $10 million to execute on the overall strategy. Isolating the increase in the cost of hedging and our move to cover additional asset classes increases our hedge cost to the $215 million range for the year.
Finally, we have seen the forward pricing curve flatten, thus making it more economical to lengthen the weighted average tenure of our forwards. Together with our house view that hedge costs may rise, we are exploring lengthening the average maturity of our forwards by rolling a portion into longer-dated positions. This strategy may increase our estimated cost in the $40 million to $60 million range, recognizing our current method of reporting cost at the time of purchase. This strategy may evolve as markets move, and we will continue to guide accordingly as we proceed through the year.
While increasing our reported cost, these moves are favorable from a risk and capital management standpoint. Importantly, the dollar program overall and expanded asset classes continue to perform well, even when considering rising hedge cost and when compared to low-yielding yen alternatives. This is why we've seen a surge in dollar and currency programs among Japanese insurance players over the past few quarters. As we move forward, we will update our guidance accordingly. And as is always the case, our guidance could change based on precise asset flows and market conditions.
Turning to capital. SMR remains in the mid-800% range with unrealized gains up significantly in the quarter. RBC remains strong despite FX impacting the ratio negatively with the yen strengthening and realizing our Japan branches embedded in our U.S. statutory results. Impairments in the quarter were modest and primarily related to our Japan equity portfolio where market declines have triggered impairments in accordance with our internal accounting policies. Overall credit conditions remain stable, and we have seen a recovery in energy names, including our below-investment-grade holdings. We do not see any immediate risk with respect to Brexit and our European holdings.
Overall capital liquidity conditions are strong and support our continued return of deployable capital to shareholders. Between dividends and repurchase, we returned $570 million to our shareholders in the quarter. Depending on the overall capital conditions, we expect to repatriate 80% to 100% of FSA earnings in 2016 or roughly JPY 120 billion to JPY 150 billion. We continue to spend down excess capital held at the holding company and are on pace to achieve our $1.4 billion of repurchase for the full year. We have made no adjustments to our earnings guidance of $6.17 to $6.41 per share assuming the same average exchange rate as last year, which was roughly JPY 121 to $1. Given strength in the yen during the quarter, we have provided, in our press release, an EPS range for the third quarter assuming the yen to dollar of JPY 100 to $1.10.
When analyzing our performance year-to-date, we are poised for strong performance in 2016. However, we are midway through the year, and we need to be conscious of the low rate environment, headwinds to investment income and associated actuarial review of select interest-sensitive closed blocks of business in Japan. In addition, from a corporate perspective, postretirement benefit liabilities are sensitive to long-term rate assumptions, and we typically review these corporate liabilities in the fourth quarter. Overall, we remain well positioned in terms of our core margins and capital strength.

Let me handle the last -- second part of your question first. We are, in fact, putting under review our definition -- really our non-GAAP definition of hedge cost and how we want to report it in our definition of operating earnings. And in fact, it's very likely, Nigel, that we go to exactly what you're talking about. And that is more of an amortized cost approach, very similar to how you would expect coupons on bonds to behave or interest costs on debt. And so that's really where we're going to move. We will give more detail on this -- more precise detail on this during our outlook call, along with recognizing that we'd have to some degree adjust, if you will, our previous year results so that you can see really the comparables year-over-year. But ultimately, the goal is exactly what you're alluding to, and that is we want to get to a definition of hedge costs that moves logically with how you would expect. If pricing is increasing, we would expect hedge cost to go up. If we're lengthening the tenure and it's a steep curve, they would go up and vice versa. And of course, if we're doing more volume, covering more notional, they would go up or down depending on the strategy. What we want to avoid is what we're seeing right now as we don't want any marked-to-market noise, nor do we want the sheer timing of what rolls to influence it. Now to your first question. As we roll into '17, of course, what I just talked about will play into what I'm about ready to say. But you'll generally find a more smoother and logical approach to the cost. So a good way to think about it is if we are covering now, moving from roughly $12.7 billion notional or forwards to upwards of $5.7 billion -- or $5.6 billion notional forwards, you would expect, as you move into 2017, to roughly apply the pricing or average -- weighted average pricing you would expect on those forwards. Now the pricing depends on the market. So it's very difficult for us to estimate what that would be. As I mentioned in my comments, we've seen pricing rise a 1-year forward, for example, right now if you went out and purchased it, would be 160 basis points. What you could expect is that when we get to our outlook call, we will provide these types of details and ranges and sensitivities as part of our operating earnings. That will give you, I think, a little color."

And you can -- sort of implied in our guidance, if you will, where we talk about repatriating 80% to 100% of FSA earnings or that being JPY 120 billion to JPY 150 billion, that gives you an idea of our expectation around FSA earnings for this year. Okay? So what are the types of things that will cause trend lines in those statutory earnings? You'd mentioned a couple of them. Growth rates realized over time because we are seeing growth in third sector, which would weigh down on FSA earnings. We're also seeing a gradual decline, obviously, and frankly more than a gradual decline in first sector sales, which would really promote or help, if you will, FSA earnings. So I expect those would probably largely level out. Now you do have some other things playing into FSA earnings. You do have foreign exchange that plays into it as we convert dollar-based coupon income, if you will, in Japan back into yen. You'll see some headwinds, if you will, related to a strengthening yen from that perspective. We have some of that factored into our guidance as you can imagine, but nevertheless, that plays a weight on it. And then hedge cost. I always remind folks, hedge costs are, in fact, brought through FSA earnings. And so as those rise, they could be weighing down on your FSA earnings as well. I would note, however, that interestingly enough, even with the rise in pricing here, this year, we actually had planned for hedge cost coming in right around where we're seeing them or projecting them today. So I don't see the recent rise in hedge cost as having implication for our 2016 cash flow. When you roll over to the U.S., it's a bit of a different matter, right? So starting with just isolating the notion of U.S.-only statutory income. We don't drive a U.S.-only statutory income. So it ends up being sort of excess cash flows produced in the U.S. And those have remained relatively steady. I would say we are seeing some growth rate in the U.S., and we're also investing in the U.S. platform in the form of technology improvements and infrastructure. So some of those are headwinds to statutory earnings, but otherwise, our sheer margins in the U.S., generally favorable benefit ratios, expense ratios generally under control, have been really helpful to stat earnings. So I don't see any sort of, what I would call, capital-related or growth or lack thereof related pressures on statutory earnings in the U.S. I would see it more to do with the pace of investment in the platform."

So one of the things that has happened in the marketplace is while we've seen hedge costs rise, they've also -- the curb has flattened. And so for example, in really just the last few months, the difference between a 6-month forward and an 18-month forward has narrowed by some 25 basis points. And so if it costs you upwards of 150 basis points to lock in a 6-month forward, it may cost you more in the 170, 175 basis point range to do an 18-month forward. And so as a tactical strategy, you may want to take advantage of some lengthening where you can, and that's what I was alluding to in my comments. The reason why that results in a more acute cost in 2016, this 40 million to 60 million range I mentioned in my comments, is recognizing that we would pull that whole 18-month cost right into the current period. And so, again, as Nigel pointed out, as we move to a more amortized approach, you won't have that type of fluctuation. And so that gives you an idea of the relative difference and curve difference of extension. Something to remember is that at FAB, we talked about 110 basis points, and remember that is a realized cost estimate, that was taking roughly $13 billion or so of notional and $140 million or so of expected cost. So when you think about $215 million of cost setting aside the duration extension, that's right around 140 basis points. So there's a difference between the actual pricing in the market and our realized cost because, of course, we've locked in certain costs and have this accounting issue."

And that is when you put those hedges on, you just gather more favorable SMR treatment, if you will, as opposed to not having it due to essentially what amounts to ALM-related issues, i.e. a dollar investment backing up potentially yen liability. So you gain certain benefits. We also are covering asset classes that could be of a higher charge order, such as bank loans, for example, which will tend to be lower rated, if you will, in general. So again, makes it even particularly helpful. And as I mentioned in my comments, what I really like about the bank loan coverage, which took some time to qualify, right? When you're talking about floating short-dated investments and short-dated investments that are being managed by third-party asset managers, it took some time to work through the system to qualify for all the appropriate hedge treatment. We were able to get that done here in the last couple months and so we could expand the asset class. So it's a particularly all-in beneficial asset class to hedge, and so we're really happy with the progress we've made there. But that's where you pick up the SMR benefits. In terms of it factoring into our capital plan, yes. Yes, in the sense that one of the missions of the hedge program, only one of the missions, is in fact to stabilize and secure our capital dynamics in Japan such that we can be as confident as we can on the steady repatriation of cash flows for deployment. So no matter what the magnitude, it is helpful to our capital plan. I would not view it though as some sort of just booster jump to the capital plan, more good -- playing good defense."

And so by the time we get to our mid -- mini FAB Meeting in September, we should be able to give you some idea about the receptivity of that product.

In terms of some of the new pricing, obviously, we tried to remain very disciplined on that front. I think in Japan, there hasn't been much movement on that. We've been growing the old-fashioned way, which is expanded distribution, new product launches, and we remain somewhat consistent, in my view, on our approach to pricing. One difference, of course, is really focusing in on first sector and first sector savings. I would say when you turn your attention to those products, not surprisingly from an in-force perspective, those products are a bit more under pressure because the opposite has happened. What we have priced for has not played out quite as well in terms of, obviously, yields and investment income on those products. So that certainly offsets my comments, and it's why we're taking significant actions to make sure that we reduce the flows and shift the balance of sales and eventually, in-force over time. So that's the way I would describe it. But obviously, from the in-force perspective on the third sector side and really the entirety of the U.S. platform, it continues to be a very strong story."

Teresa is studying that right now. We have not made any final decisions, but the type of products would be group-like. And if we did something along those lines, some of our competitors offer that, and we feel that we will either have to offer it as -- through to another company and bring it on in some form or fashion, but we want to make sure, because it's a lower profit margin product, that we don't have our sales force concentrating on it, but rather it is a product that opens the door for higher sales of our third sector products or -- I'm used to saying that because [indiscernible] is paying so much -- of our supplemental products in the U.S."

As we told you at FAB and other places, our struggle is trying to bring brokers on in a -- we're probably the only organization to have such a -- well, I know we are, to have such a dynamic field force. And so we're trying to push our field force in deriving the accounts of 100 or less. The overlap is between the 100 and 1,000. And over 1,000, we tend to see brokers. Now our brokers are also using our field force as enrollers. So that doesn't break out exactly that way because that shows as broker productivity. But all in all, it's beginning to evolve in a way that will ultimately, I think, increase our production, but it has been a struggle. And Teresa's done an exceptional job in bringing those together. When that's really clicking, that's when you're going to see it take off. And that's what we continue to work on is that -- and the production being off a little bit is because of our field force. But we think with Everwell and our way of enrollments increasing dramatically, up to 40% if you go through that process, that's going to help our field force and the tools that we give them. So it's a delicate balance here, but we're getting closer and closer. And the thing that told me that was in a recent meeting I had when some of our managers at our field level said they wanted the managers at our broker level to be at their meetings. They didn't use to want to get together and now they're working together as a team, and I think it's only going to get better as we move forward. And I'm very encouraged about that, but it's slower than I like."

But obviously, as you know, yields have been trending down, both in the U.S. and Japan. So that's partially the decline for the second quarter new money yield. But the bigger attribution of the decline was, and Fred referenced this in his speech, as we're entering into new asset classes, such as infrastructure, commercial mortgage loans, those take time to fund, unlike when we buy investment grade bonds, we get into the market and fund those pretty quickly. Now since we're turning those asset classes on for the first time, we knew that there'd be a delay in funding them. And therefore, during the quarter, we had a buildup of cash because it is taking us a little longer for our first time entering those asset classes. When we're sitting on cash, that doesn't go into the new money yields in the way we've defined it. But nevertheless, sitting on cash is not optimal for us, and we didn't want to do that. So we did put a little over $1 billion to work during the second quarter into yen assets, mostly residential -- Japan residential mortgage-backed securities and some JGBs as a temporary home, if you will. So that when the infrastructure and commercial mortgage loans are ready to be funded, as our managers call us up and say, we've circled deals for your portfolio, we'll then shift that out of there and put it into those assets. But because we put that cash to work, and we did keep it in yen for now, we didn't want to move it back and forth between yen and dollars, that had the results of, on average, being invested at a 30 basis point yield or so. So for the quarter, that impacted the new money yield and brought it down. But as we redeploy that money in the future from yen back to dollars, later on, whether it be later on this year, early next year, you'll see the new money yield go in the opposite direction and be higher than it normally would be. I should also mention by putting that cash to work, we are earning, for this year based on estimates of timing of reversal, about $2 million extra in net investment income versus it just sitting idly in cash. So that explains most of the decline for the second quarter versus our planned new money yield. More broadly speaking, for the second quarter, about 50% of the assets that we had to invest in the second quarter, and I'm using Aflac Japan numbers, which was about JPY 224 billion, did go into yen assets because of that extra money that I just referred to. And the other half went into dollar assets, U.S. equity, investment grade, commercial mortgage loans, bank loans. The nice thing is, as you look at the mixture, we continue to diversify the asset base, which gives us, as investors, a multitude of choices, not only from a risk return standpoint, but in this very volatile environment, particularly of negative rates in Japan. As our SAA and our outsourcing program and our in-house programs build out, those choices are opportunistic for us to balance out those things. Then very lastly, in terms of the view of JGB yields and impact to next year's cash flow, let me say this, at net negative rates, which the 10-year is still negative, about 3 weeks ago, the 20-year and the 30-year JGB were both under 10 basis points. We've put a moratorium on buying JGBs. And if they should stay at those low levels, we would not be buying JGBs. But as Fred has mentioned, we are actively exploring other yen investments because we do need yen investments, certainly, from an ALM standpoint. Our liabilities, as you know, in Japan are in yen. And there are some promising things on that front, perhaps restarting our yen private placement program. But if we do, it will be in a measured pace and, obviously, with a global credit team with much stricter risk limits than we had in the past, bringing down our private placements to about 24% of the portfolio. We do feel that there's some capacity there, but we still have to test the market in terms of supply and whether or not the structure of those types of things will meet our requirements. There are yen corporate bonds that we could be looking at. There are some ratings, regulatory things we need to explore. But all of that is a way to say that the ultimate rate on those assets would be based off the JGB yield curve, but we'd be earning a credit spread. And that is something that we like because we are very bullish and confident of our credit analysis and ability to analyze credit and, therefore, get the right return for the risk we're willing to take. So looking at next year, this is just so early, but consistent with prior SAA, it would probably be about 30% to 40% yen assets, 50% to 60% dollar assets. But Fred mentioned earlier, we are right now reviewing SAA in light of negative rates and how that -- the implications of that to the programs. And then from a tactical standpoint, as we look at these new asset classes, that will bear into our ultimate decisions for next year. So very preliminary view and outlook for next year."

I think what's more important is be realistic about your understanding of what's moving SMR. In other words, there's a difference between SMR rising because of sheer retention and build of capital and SMR rising because of unrealized gains in your portfolio. So you know from following us, we're quite, I'll use the term sober, in terms of understanding that our SMR may go up at times, but it's driven by unrealized gains. That doesn't necessarily give way to the release of additional capital, et cetera. So we look at it on that basis, but pay careful attention to it. I think in addition to that, we look at just sheer cash flow performance, and I commented earlier on dynamics involving our FSA earnings. The reason why we have 80% to 100% of FSA earnings repatriation as a policy is that in times of stress, we may retain more capital. Right now, as I look at the risk as we go forward, I mentioned in my comments that we do have to be conscious of a couple small closed blocks of business that are more sensitive to low for long interest rates and actuarial sensitivity. I think it's really too early to tell at the moment whether we'll see any impact from that. We've, of course, got other blocks of business that tend to be somewhat ""rich"" with respect to reserves and IBNR and so forth. And so there could be offsetting issues. So at the moment, I think we're just being cautious in looking at those issues. I do think that -- if you think about where we are in the credit cycle, if you think about the interest rate environment in Japan and the associated volatility, I think it is in fact the time to be cautious about the notion of sizing, if you will, excess capital and deployable capital on a purely Japan basis. Cash flow remains good. I would not really move off of any of the comments I made at FAB, but we are more carefully watching it. Now contrast that with the U.S., where if you were to look at a U.S.-only basis, our business remains very strong, very stable. It's by definition a low-risk profile business. We run at very high RBC levels if you were to look on a stand-alone basis. And so I continue to promote the notion that while we're moderating our views of excess capital in Japan, we continue to be bullish on the notion of there being excess capital levels in the U.S. And we'll try to balance it out as we go forward."

And very, very importantly, don't lose sight of the stress testing. We do pretty extensive stress testing, both in Japan and in the U.S., looking at all the variables you're accustomed to in terms of moving our ratios around. And under those stress tests, that can guide us to some degree on how much capital we carry. So I've got my partner, if you will, Todd Daniels, right next to me, and he is our Risk Manager globally.

Now we're not immune from that. We have businesses, most notably, first sector savings-oriented businesses, that will get depressed, some of the longer duration businesses can get depressed related to low for long rates, even on the third sector side. So we're not any different than the Japanese companies in the sense that we've seen headwinds on those ratios, but realize on a relative basis, we tend to perform much better. We tend to model out more favorably because of the sheer strength and size of our third sector business and dominant positions. So no question, there has been headwinds to those type of, what I call, traditional economic capital positions. But we tend to do well on a relative basis and that helps us out."

Let me begin by saying that I am pleased with the company's overall financial results for both the third quarter and the first 9 months of the year. As you no doubt saw from yesterday's press release, these strong results gave us confidence to upwardly revise our operating EPS outlook for this year to the range of $6.40 to $6.60. Fred will provide more color on earnings and our outlook during his comments. 
I'll lead off by providing an update of AFLAC Japan, our largest earnings contributor. From a distribution perspective, our traditional agencies, which include individual agencies independent corporate agencies, affiliated corporate agencies, have historically been and remain today vital contributors to our success. Additionally, our alliance partners continued to advance our strong results. I am particularly pleased that just this month, Japan Post, there was 20,000-plus postal outlets began selling our new cancer insurance product designed exclusively for cancer survivors.  Our traditional agencies first began selling this product in March of this year. While we anticipate the sale of our cancer insurance for cancer survivors, we'll be slightly additive to our overall sales results. More importantly, it underscores our reputation and commitment to being there for Japanese consumers when they need us most. These various distribution outlets further our goal of having a presence in all the places people want to make their insurance decisions. 
From a product perspective, I am pleased with the progress we've made in limiting the sale of first sector savings products, which are interestingly [ph] sensitive. First sector product sales decreased 54% in the quarter, putting us squarely on target to reduce first sector sales by at least 50% in the second half of the year compared to the second half of 2015. We have been aggressively and pulling product from select channels, conservatively repricing our ways in endowment products for the reality of a prolonged low interest rate environment. We are extremely encouraged with the significant progress we made in limiting the sale of the first sector products.
Turning to the third sector sales results, you'll recall that we upwardly revised our annual sales target for these products last month at the Tokyo Analyst Briefing, making this the second positive revision to our sales target this year. At the meeting, we announced a new third sector sales outlook to flat to up 5%. We are pleased that Aflac Japan generated a third sector sales increase of 2.5% for the quarter and 5% year-to-date. These strong sales results in the face of difficult comparisons reflect stronger-than-expected productivity across the majority of the distribution channels. This is even more notable when you consider the sales through the bank channels as they moderated significantly by restrictions on the sale of first sector products. I will remind you that fourth quarter still presents difficult third sector comparisons, particularly following the 2 years of extremely strong cancer and medical sales. 
Our third quarter sales results also benefited from the July introduction of a new third sector product called Income Support Insurance, which accounted for JPY 708 million or 3.3% of the third sector sales.  This product provides fixed benefit amounts in the event that a policy, although [ph] is unable to work due to the significant illness or injury. Additionally, this product was developed as supplement to disability coverage within Japan's Social Security System. Our Income Support Insurance product targets young to middle-aged consumers, ranging in age from 20 through their 40s, a segment of the population in which we believe were underpenetrated and represented. By focusing our efforts on this demographic, we believe that we're building relationships that lay the groundwork for the sale of cancer and medical insurance later in life. While it's still early, we are happy with the reception of the Income Support Insurance as received. We believe this product has the potential to gradually develop into a new Aflac pillar product over the long term. 
Turning to Aflac U.S, we are pleased with our earnings are exceeding our expectations for the first 9 months. Profitability in the quarter was driven by improving benefit ratios that we continue to see over the last several years. We have simultaneously pushed resources back into the business, and particularly, we are investing in an end-to-end system for the group platform that will provide the capabilities of all of our group constituents, including brokers who typically sell group products. While we are expanding our presence in the voluntary work site insurance market, we are also being very disciplined in the pricing of the business, especially as it relates to the profitability within the smaller case group space that includes employers 100 to 250 workers. 
Although sales in the quarter were lower than expected, I would remind you that, I said many times, that fourth quarter sales and particularly sales in the last 3 weeks of the year largely determine our annual sales results. Our efforts are focused on increasing the productivity of our career agents and brokers. I believe the measures that we rolled out over a 6-month period beginning in the fourth quarter of 2014 are the right approach, and as you'll recall, one major element of the changes we made, including compensation to better align incentives for the career agents with company sales results. We are continuing to fine-tune our compensation package for our top sales management to closely align pay with performance. With this superior incentive program, we're seeing our top sales management being paid extremely well and some of the poor-performing sales managers that decided that they'd rather concentrate on sales instead of management. While we would have liked to have seen the measures of more immediate impact on our sales results, we know that it can take some time. However, I want to point out that we are exceeding our profit target while implementing these changes. Most importantly, we continue to believe the changes that we've made to our sales infrastructure and compensation are in the best interest of the company to produce long-term results.
We also remained encouraged with the broker business. Over the last few years, our sales through the broker channel have grown. Our fourth quarter sales results have become more and more impactful as you saw in 2014 and 2015. This means it becomes more and more challenging to project full year sales, even though sales results for the first 7 -- 9 months we know. Although I am encouraged by the pipeline of business schedules for the fourth quarter, we are still enhancing our forecasting of how much of the pipeline materializes into actual sales results. Therefore, we believe Aflac U.S. will require particularly strong fourth quarter in order to meet the lower end of the 3% to 5% target increase for 2016. 
I would remind you that our brand is a key differentiator for Aflac, both in Japan and the United States. As a product innovator and trusted brand in both countries, we've experienced a tremendous amount of success leveraging the strength of our brand to drive sales. In both countries, 9 out of 10 consumers recognize the Aflac brand. But our brand is more than the Aflac Duck for the advertising initiatives, it's also about how we take excellent care of the policyholders. In Japan, it's our powerful brand that has propelled Aflac to ensure 1 out of 4 households. In the United States, we processed, approved and paying nearly 1.3 million [ph] One Day Pay claims in the first 9 months of 2016. And most importantly, 96% of the policyholders that use One Day Pay said they are likely to refer other people to Aflac. We believe this will result in more used new sales going forward. 
Our products are well suited in both Japan and the United States markets, and we are well positioned in the 2 largest insurance markets in the world. 
Turning to capital deployment. Let me just say that we continue to be growing the cash dividend and repurchasing our shares as the most attractive means for deploying capital, particular in the absence of any compelling alternatives. We are on target to repurchase about $1.4 billion of our shares, with the majority already repurchased during the first 9 months of the year. The Board of Directors action to increase the dividend by 4.9%, demonstrates our commitment to rewarding our shareholders. This marks the 34th consecutive year of increasing our cash dividend. We are proud of the achievement, and our objective is to grow the cash dividend rate in line with the increase in the operating earnings per diluted share before the impact of foreign currency translation.
We continue to manage the business for the long-term benefit of the shareholders, the policyholders and all the stakeholders. We believe we will continue to achieve more by building on these strategies and the foundations that have propelled our success. By doing this, I believe we will continue to enhance shareholder value while delivering on our promise to the policyholders. 
And now let me turn the program over to Fred, who will cover the financial results and outlook. Fred?"

Our third quarter performance continues the strong financial results recorded in the first half of 2016, and execution on key initiatives designed to drive long-term growth and effective allocation of our capital. Our results were driven b",994,"Thank you, Dan. Our third quarter performance continues the strong financial results recorded in the first half of 2016, and execution on key initiatives designed to drive long-term growth and effective allocation of our capital. Our results were driven by strong overall margins in both Japan and the U.S. Operating EPS increased 16.7% or $0.26 per share with a little over half the growth driven by the strengthening of the yen and the remaining from share repurchase and pure earnings growth. Excluding the impact of the yen, operating earnings increased 7% as compared to the previous year's quarter. 
Our Japan segment margins were solid. We concluded as part of our annual actuarial review process that it was appropriate to reduce the IBNR reserves for our cancer insurance block of business by approximately JPY 4.6 billion or $0.07 a share. This amount is very similar to the adjustment we made in the third quarter last year and reflects continued strong cancer claims experience. Expense ratios were generally in line with our guidance. 
In the U.S., benefit ratios continued their favorable trends for the year. Our expense ratio was favorable to our expectations for the quarter. Consistent with previous years, we fully expect our expenses to tick up in the fourth quarter as we make progress on certain strategic initiatives and increase our promotional and IT spend. Overall, our U.S. pretax profit margins are set to perform at or above the high end of our 2016 guidance range of 17% to 19% for the year.
Both Japan and the U.S., we will spend some time on our December outlook call discussing revenue trends, benefit ratio drivers and specific to expense ratios where we intend to invest in the platform throughout 2017. 
Turning to investments. Results were both the quarter and the year, and we're aligned -- year-to-date, we're aligned with our expectations as we continue to navigate the low-yield environment and further diversify our portfolio. As we discussed during our analyst briefing in Japan, we continue to execute on a comprehensive plan that includes curtailing interest-sensitive premium flows through actions to reduce the sale of first sector savings products; developing alternative high-quality yen investments, including a measured re-entry back into yen private placements; finally, executing on our U.S. dollar investment strategy where we can hedge market value effectively and optimize investment income consistent with risk, ALM and capital objectives. 
With respect to our U.S. dollar program and hedge costs, our reported third quarter costs were elevated, recognizing we currently isolate and report the full cost of forwards in the period we purchased. Consistent with the strategy we have outlined at our analyst briefing in Japan, we have successfully executed on covering approximately $3.3 billion of additional U.S. dollar assets under the hedge program and have proactively extended the duration of our forwards to better manage 2017 costs and associated volatility. Both of these actions will serve to exaggerate our reported costs in the period under our current reporting.
Amortizing the cost over the life of the forwards, the non-GAAP reporting convention we plan to adopt in 2017, our hedge cost for the entire book of hedges were $54 million pretax or $0.09 a share this quarter. Assuming no material change in hedging strategy and our current reporting method, our pretax hedge cost guidance remains in the $280 million to $300 million range for 2016. 
Moving to an amortized basis for reporting, tactically extending duration, continuing to refine the asset allocation and hedging strategy will serve to reduce the quarterly volatility as we incorporate hedge costs into our definition of operating earnings for 2017. We'll cover this approach and forecast in more detail at our outlook call in December. 
Turning to capital. We commented last quarter that hedging additional U.S. dollar asset classes would further strengthen our SMR. We ended the quarter with an estimated SMR above 900%, up significantly from last quarter. RBC is also preliminary at this point, but we expect it to remain Strong in the mid-800% range despite the strengthening of the yen impacting our ratio negatively throughout the year. This is a result of the Japan branch embedded in our U.S. statutory results. 
Overall, credit conditions are stable. Impairments in the quarter were modest and preliminary -- and primarily related to our Japan equity portfolios, where depressed market values have triggered impairments in accordance with our internal accounting policies. 
We continue to return capital to shareholders. Between dividends and repurchase, we have returned approximately $1.7 billion to our shareholders year-to-date. We continue to spend down excess capital held at the holding company, and expect to achieve our target of $1.4 billion in repurchase for the full year. As Dan highlighted, our board elected to increase the shareholder dividend to $0.43 per share per quarter, a 4.9% increase in marking our 34th consecutive year of dividend increases. 
Bolstered by U.S. segment earnings outperformance and solid results in Japan, we are comfortable increasing our 2016 earnings guidance to $6.40 a share to $6.60 per share on a currency neutral basis. We have provided in our press release an EPS range for the fourth quarter, assuming a yen to dollar exchange rate of $100 to $110.
As mentioned last quarter, we are conducting our normal actuarial review of interest-sensitive blocks of business in Japan. There are 2 smaller legacy blocks of interest-sensitive third sector business that may require strengthening as these blocks have been susceptible to strengthening in the past. In addition, from a corporate perspective, postretirement benefit liabilities are sensitive to long-term rate assumptions. And while not finalized, we anticipate an adjustment in fourth quarter and suspect this will be a common theme among many large corporate entities. 
Overall, we remain well positioned in terms of core margins and capital strength, and look forward to our December outlook call where we will expand on our strategic plans and 2017 outlook.

Jimmy, thank you for the questions. This is Fred. Really, the revision to our guidance is, as I mentioned in my comments, largely bolstered by outperformance relative to our expectations on the earnings front in the U.S. However, I would add that, year-to-date, both the U.S. and Japan had been traveling at generally favorable ends of our ranges for both benefit ratios and expense ratios. And so I made a point to say also or point out that Japan's solid results are contributing as well. But the true outperformance relative to our expectations was more pronounced in the U.S. earnings side. In terms of as we look forward, we will spend a big deal of time, not surprisingly, during our December outlook called Talking About the Trends As We Look at Next Year. So I'll spend more time there. I would say, in general, you would expect us in the fourth quarter, for example, to see some expenses pick up. This is not uncommon. If you follow the company over the last few years, you'll see that tick up. It has to do with the timing of promotional spend and the natural progression of initiatives as we go throughout the year. As we go into the next year, we will continue to be investing particularly in our U.S. platform, and we'll speak more about that. I don't know that I would suggest it to be material, but you would see a slightly elevated expense ratio as we invest in that platform. And then in terms of benefit ratios, we have been tracking, particularly in the U.S., at a favorable level. We would expect, to some degree, to see a continuation of that near-term eventually normalizing back towards our range. But we have seen some persistency, if you will, relative to the benefit ratio being favorably throughout the year. And based on what we're seeing right now, that should continue for a bit. But we'll talk more about it during the outlook call."

There is the really principal drivers of the hedge cost being up given how we reported, and that was really the tactical moves made in the quarter and it was a combination of extending duration as you mentioned. I would say over the past year, for example, we've pushed that duration of our hedge portfolio out for roughly 4 or 5 months to upwards now of 10 months. And that means, by definition, we're buying out into the 1-year 18-month time frame, in some cases, on the forward curve. This is in part not only to manage forward volatility, which we think is important for consistency and stability of our reported earnings and costs, but it's also because we've actually seen a flattening of the forward curve where it's more economic for us to go a little longer and lax some of that in. So we've been quite tactical on that front. The other piece that's contributing, of course, is just simply covering more assets and then particularly, covering assets that we have been building in the U.S. dollar portfolio, things like bank loans, commercial real estate and equities. We're covering those assets are important not only from a pure hedging perspective, but also you get the favorable capital treatment or really protect the favorable capital treatment that you need for SMR. So those have been the 2 areas of contribution. I would say about 35% or so of the cost related to duration extension in the quarter and about 40% of the cost increase or the cost you're seeing related to covering additional assets, just to give you some round numbers. Again, we'll be moving to an amortized basis, which is a more logical way of looking at the costs going forward. I tried to give you some color for what the quarter look like if you were to amortize costs today. We really believe in the tactical moves we're making. And during the outlook call, we'll give you a full rendering of how the year would look and how comparable years would look as we incorporated into our forecast for '17."

We also do some collaring on a small portion of the assets, which tends to be a much, much lower cost-type approach of hedging. The vast majority of our hedging is done using forwards, and that notional is traveling around $16 billion, up from around $12.7 billion in the second quarter, to give you an idea. And I think I'm going to anticipate where you may be going with this question from an understanding forward costs. And that is if you were to take our $16 billion in notional and just hold that constant, we're seeing costs traveling between 170 to 180 basis points. Actually, more recently, it's gotten a bit more favorable coming off of DOJ and Fed announcements, that's why we moved to accelerate locking in some of the costs. But we think it's more wise to be thinking in that 180 basis point range. And that gives you a sense of where we're traveling from an amortization perspective."

I would point this out however, it's not simply a matter of growth in the U.S. dollar program which I would anticipate to be gradual. It's also the mix of where we're investing. And what you've seen us do through bank loans for example, middle market lending and then more recently, exploring transitional real estate lending which is just a form of bridge loans on commercial real estate, these are all characterized as being floating-rate U.S. dollar investments. That's particularly advantageous for us because one, you will tend to hedge that using short-dated forwards where it's relatively less expensive forwards, but also from a duration matching perspective, you end up at the same pressure that's applied to hedge costs tend to result in increased LIBOR rates and returns or yields on the floating-rate securities. So one of the things we're working on is not just the notion of asset allocation and where the U.S. dollar program goes, but also refining our asset allocation in that portfolio to be more affective, as I mentioned in my comments, more efficient and effective in hedging and in the process, further managing volatility."

What we're seeing right now is, first of all, realize of course, benefit ratios will fluctuate each quarter and so there will be quarters where we're in our range and quarters where we move within the range or a little favorable. But what we've seen year-to-date, even somewhat last year, in the latter stages of last year, is a consistently favorable benefit ratio. And what we see going on there, we believe, relates to, somewhat to mix of business. And 2 particular types of business that are driving this, we believe, are: One, group business, where our group business is naturally is priced to and expected to travel at a lower benefit ratio than you would find, say on individual products in the way it's priced and that's just a function of how it's priced and structured as a product. And as group business grows and becomes more of our inforce and place more of an influence on our benefit ratios, you'll see a little bit more of that. The other dynamic though is really more guaranteed issue business where the actual building reserves tends to be slower and more moderate in the early years. And so as you start to sell more of that guaranteed issued business as a proportion of other business, you'll see just a slower ramp-up in reserves and a generally more favorable near-term benefit ratio. So that's what I mean when I say we would expect to see, as those types of business age, that they will age back into our expected long-term range of benefit ratio. But for a period here, it looks as if we're traveling at a, again, a persistently low benefit ratio relative to our expectations. And again, it's all on the margin. We're traveling, I think maybe 50 or 60 basis points better than our guidance in general, but we'll provide more of an update on this and some trends as we get to the outlook call."

Historically, banks have been the capital providers to those loan markets, to the lenders,  if you will, as well as risk indicating some of those loans. Because of Dodd Frank, the banks have removed themselves from that market, it's no longer capital-friendly for them. For an insurance company like us, we like to focus on credit risks and underwriting, where we can negotiate very tight covenant of a high predictability of procurement of loans, if you will, and our money, so it's an attractive asset class.

Sometimes that plays out, sometimes the good timing of that doesn't play out, but at the moment that's our forecast. And then again recall that I did, in fact, include some level of expense related to what I believe is an inevitable postretirement benefit adjustments related to interest rates. Now again, that's not finalized and you need to understand the final before you can book anything, but we know enough to know that there's probably a range kind of the amount in there. So that's a little bit of what's traveling through the number. And obviously, we'll continue to do our best to meet or exceed the forecast the best we can."

We not only factor in what I would call the gross yields we would expect on investing our money. But when it comes to the U.S. dollar program, we also are projecting a hedge costs environment into the net yields that we expect to support the product. So when we are pricing a product like WAYS, we're looking not only on the interest rate environment and mix of investments and associated credit spread,  if you will, but we also in our case, have to be factoring in hedge costs. So it's a very real part of how we think about the product. And so as a result, all of the repricing that we're doing is really having to take into account the low interest-rate environment, our asset allocation, hedge costs, and then most notably in Japan, there's also a recognition that the standard rate, if you will, or the discount rate assumption used for reserving practices, is going to come down materially in Japan at the end of March of next year. All of those things have been factored into pricing out our savings or intersensitive first sector products, namely WAYS and child endowment in making sure we can adhere to adhesive profitability."

But we'd just like to follow-up a little bit on Fred's comments before to put this in context, because your focus appropriately so is on a large increase this quarter. When we went into this program, we presume the long-term average of hedge costs is somewhere between 2 and 3/4 of 3. So we were very clear when we got into the program, hedge costs were historically little, and that was about 60 bps back in '12. They kept traveling down to 20. So what we're seeing now is more of a normalization. We could never know exactly when or where exactly macro dynamics that would make hedge cost a lot, but we always knew they would go up. So even though they were at 168 to 180 basis points today, that's about 50%, 60% of the way towards the long-term average. But then, if you think about that long-term average, it would take quite a huge amount of growth in the United States, for the federal reserve to raise interest rates so substantially to get to those numbers. It could happen someday, but we've got about a 2% margin to be precise on your question before we'd be saying, this is a breakeven trade."

And then of course, there's the how do we look at the hedge strategy itself which we continue to look at, and as Fred has mentioned, continue to lend in duration. So if we just, we're passive, that's the answer, but we would expect to continue to manage that with a fine-tune comb preserve as much of that margin, whether it's through higher income or better hedge costs management.

Let me begin by saying that I am pleased with the company's overall financial results for both the third quarter and the first 9 months of the year. As you no doubt saw from yesterday's press release, these strong results gave us confidence to upwardly revise our operating EPS outlook for this year to the range of $6.40 to $6.60. Fred will provide more color on earnings and our outlook during his comments. 
I'll lead off by providing an update of Aflac Japan, our largest earnings contributor. From a distribution perspective, our traditional agencies, which include individual agencies independent corporate agencies, affiliated corporate agencies, have historically been and remain today vital contributors to our success. Additionally, our alliance partners continued to advance our strong results. I am particularly pleased that just this month, Japan Post, there was 20,000-plus postal outlets began selling our new cancer insurance product designed exclusively for cancer survivors.  Our traditional agencies first began selling this product in March of this year. While we anticipate the sale of our cancer insurance for cancer survivors, we'll be slightly additive to our overall sales results. More importantly, it underscores our reputation and commitment to being there for Japanese consumers when they need us most. These various distribution outlets further our goal of having a presence in all the places people want to make their insurance decisions. 
From a product perspective, I am pleased with the progress we've made in limiting the sale of first sector savings products, which are inter-sensitive. First sector product sales decreased 54% in the quarter, putting us squarely on target to reduce first sector sales by at least 50% in the second half of the year compared to the second half of 2015. We have been aggressively and pulling product from select channels, conservatively repricing our ways in endowment products for the reality of a prolonged low interest rate environment. We are extremely encouraged with the significant progress we made in limiting the sale of the first sector products.
Turning to the third sector sales results, you'll recall that we upwardly revised our annual sales target for these products last month at the Tokyo Analyst Briefing, making this the second positive revision to our sales target this year. At the meeting, we announced a new third sector sales outlook to flat to up 5%. We are pleased that Aflac Japan generated a third sector sales increase of 2.5% for the quarter and 5% year-to-date. These strong sales results in the face of difficult comparisons reflect stronger-than-expected productivity across the majority of the distribution channels. This is even more notable when you consider the sales through the bank channels as they moderated significantly by restrictions on the sale of first sector products. I will remind you that fourth quarter still presents difficult third sector comparisons, particularly following the 2 years of extremely strong cancer and medical sales. 
Our third quarter sales results also benefited from the July introduction of a new third sector product called Income Support Insurance, which accounted for JPY 708 million or 3.3% of the third sector sales.  This product provides fixed benefit amounts in the event that a policy, although is unable to work due to the significant illness or injury. Additionally, this product was developed as supplement to disability coverage within Japan's Social Security System. Our Income Support Insurance product targets young to middle-aged consumers, ranging in age from 20 through their 40s, a segment of the population in which we believe were underpenetrated and represented. By focusing our efforts on this demographic, we believe that we're building relationships that lay the groundwork for the sale of cancer and medical insurance later in life. While it's still early, we are happy with the reception of the Income Support Insurance as received. We believe this product has the potential to gradually develop into a new Aflac pillar product over the long term. 
Turning to Aflac U.S, we are pleased with our earnings are exceeding our expectations for the first 9 months. Profitability in the quarter was driven by improving benefit ratios that we continue to see over the last several years. We have simultaneously pushed resources back into the business, and particularly, we are investing in an end-to-end system for the group platform that will provide the capabilities of all of our group constituents, including brokers who typically sell group products. While we are expanding our presence in the voluntary work site insurance market, we are also being very disciplined in the pricing of the business, especially as it relates to the profitability within the smaller case group space that includes employers 100 to 250 workers. 
Although sales in the quarter were lower than expected, I would remind you that, I said many times, that fourth quarter sales and particularly sales in the last 3 weeks of the year largely determine our annual sales results. Our efforts are focused on increasing the productivity of our career agents and brokers. I believe the measures that we rolled out over a 6-month period beginning in the fourth quarter of 2014 are the right approach, and as you'll recall, one major element of the changes we made, including compensation to better align incentives for the career agents with company sales results. We are continuing to fine-tune our compensation package for our top sales management to closely align pay with performance. With this superior incentive program, we're seeing our top sales management being paid extremely well and some of the poor-performing sales managers that decided that they'd rather concentrate on sales instead of management. While we would have liked to have seen the measures of more immediate impact on our sales results, we know that it can take some time. However, I want to point out that we are exceeding our profit target while implementing these changes. Most importantly, we continue to believe the changes that we've made to our sales infrastructure and compensation are in the best interest of the company to produce long-term results.
We also remained encouraged with the broker business. Over the last few years, our sales through the broker channel have grown. Our fourth quarter sales results have become more and more impactful as you saw in 2014 and 2015. This means it becomes more and more challenging to project full year sales, even though sales results for the first 7 -- 9 months we know. Although I am encouraged by the pipeline of business schedules for the fourth quarter, we are still enhancing our forecasting of how much of the pipeline materializes into actual sales results. Therefore, we believe Aflac U.S. will require particularly strong fourth quarter in order to meet the lower end of the 3% to 5% target increase for 2016. 
I would remind you that our brand is a key differentiator for Aflac, both in Japan and the United States. As a product innovator and trusted brand in both countries, we've experienced a tremendous amount of success leveraging the strength of our brand to drive sales. In both countries, 9 out of 10 consumers recognize the Aflac brand. But our brand is more than the Aflac Duck for the advertising initiatives, it's also about how we take excellent care of the policyholders. In Japan, it's our powerful brand that has propelled Aflac to ensure 1 out of 4 households. In the United States, we processed, approved and paying nearly $1.3 million One Day Pay claims in the first 9 months of 2016. And most importantly, 96% of the policyholders that use One Day Pay said they are likely to refer other people to Aflac. We believe this will result in more used new sales going forward. 
Our products are well suited in both Japan and the United States markets, and we are well positioned in the 2 largest insurance markets in the world. 
Turning to capital deployment. Let me just say that we continue to be growing the cash dividend and repurchasing our shares as the most attractive means for deploying capital, particular in the absence of any compelling alternatives. We are on target to repurchase about $1.4 billion of our shares, with the majority already repurchased during the first 9 months of the year. The Board of Directors action to increase the dividend by 4.9%, demonstrates our commitment to rewarding our shareholders. This marks the 34th consecutive year of increasing our cash dividend. We are proud of the achievement, and our objective is to grow the cash dividend rate in line with the increase in the operating earnings per diluted share before the impact of foreign currency translation.
We continue to manage the business for the long-term benefit of the shareholders, the policyholders and all the stakeholders. We believe we will continue to achieve more by building on these strategies and the foundations that have propelled our success. By doing this, I believe we will continue to enhance shareholder value while delivering on our promise to the policyholders. 
And now let me turn the program over to Fred, who will cover the financial results and outlook. Fred?"

Our third quarter performance continues the strong financial results recorded in the first half of 2016, and execution on key initiatives designed to drive long-term growth and effective allocation of our capital. Our results were driven b",994,"Thank you, Dan. Our third quarter performance continues the strong financial results recorded in the first half of 2016, and execution on key initiatives designed to drive long-term growth and effective allocation of our capital. Our results were driven by strong overall margins in both Japan and the U.S. Operating EPS increased 16.7% or $0.26 per share with a little over half the growth driven by the strengthening of the yen and the remaining from share repurchase and pure earnings growth. Excluding the impact of the yen, operating earnings increased 7% as compared to the previous year's quarter. 
Our Japan segment margins were solid. We concluded as part of our annual actuarial review process that it was appropriate to reduce the IBNR reserves for our cancer insurance block of business by approximately JPY 4.6 billion or $0.07 a share. This amount is very similar to the adjustment we made in the third quarter last year and reflects continued strong cancer claims experience. Expense ratios were generally in line with our guidance. 
In the U.S., benefit ratios continued their favorable trends for the year. Our expense ratio was favorable to our expectations for the quarter. Consistent with previous years, we fully expect our expenses to tick up in the fourth quarter as we make progress on certain strategic initiatives and increase our promotional and IT spend. Overall, our U.S. pretax profit margins are set to perform at or above the high end of our 2016 guidance range of 17% to 19% for the year.
Both Japan and the U.S., we will spend some time on our December outlook call discussing revenue trends, benefit ratio drivers and specific to expense ratios where we intend to invest in the platform throughout 2017. 
Turning to investments. Results were both the quarter and the year, and we're aligned -- year-to-date, we're aligned with our expectations as we continue to navigate the low-yield environment and further diversify our portfolio. As we discussed during our analyst briefing in Japan, we continue to execute on a comprehensive plan that includes curtailing interest-sensitive premium flows through actions to reduce the sale of first sector savings products; developing alternative high-quality yen investments, including a measured re-entry back into yen private placements; finally, executing on our U.S. dollar investment strategy where we can hedge market value effectively and optimize investment income consistent with risk, ALM and capital objectives. 
With respect to our U.S. dollar program and hedge costs, our reported third quarter costs were elevated, recognizing we currently isolate and report the full cost of forwards in the period we purchased. Consistent with the strategy we have outlined at our analyst briefing in Japan, we have successfully executed on covering approximately $3.3 billion of additional U.S. dollar assets under the hedge program and have proactively extended the duration of our forwards to better manage 2017 costs and associated volatility. Both of these actions will serve to exaggerate our reported costs in the period under our current reporting.
Amortizing the cost over the life of the forwards, the non-GAAP reporting convention we plan to adopt in 2017, our hedge cost for the entire book of hedges were $54 million pretax or $0.09 a share this quarter. Assuming no material change in hedging strategy and our current reporting method, our pretax hedge cost guidance remains in the $280 million to $300 million range for 2016. 
Moving to an amortized basis for reporting, tactically extending duration, continuing to refine the asset allocation and hedging strategy will serve to reduce the quarterly volatility as we incorporate hedge costs into our definition of operating earnings for 2017. We'll cover this approach and forecast in more detail at our outlook call in December. 
Turning to capital. We commented last quarter that hedging additional U.S. dollar asset classes would further strengthen our SMR. We ended the quarter with an estimated SMR above 900%, up significantly from last quarter. RBC is also preliminary at this point, but we expect it to remain Strong in the mid-800% range despite the strengthening of the yen impacting our ratio negatively throughout the year. This is a result of the Japan branch embedded in our U.S. statutory results. 
Overall, credit conditions are stable. Impairments in the quarter were modest and preliminary -- and primarily related to our Japan equity portfolios, where depressed market values have triggered impairments in accordance with our internal accounting policies. 
We continue to return capital to shareholders. Between dividends and repurchase, we have returned approximately $1.7 billion to our shareholders year-to-date. We continue to spend down excess capital held at the holding company, and expect to achieve our target of $1.4 billion in repurchase for the full year. As Dan highlighted, our board elected to increase the shareholder dividend to $0.43 per share per quarter, a 4.9% increase in marking our 34th consecutive year of dividend increases. 
Bolstered by U.S. segment earnings outperformance and solid results in Japan, we are comfortable increasing our 2016 earnings guidance to $6.40 a share to $6.60 per share on a currency neutral basis. We have provided in our press release an EPS range for the fourth quarter, assuming a yen to dollar exchange rate of $100 to $110.
As mentioned last quarter, we are conducting our normal actuarial review of interest-sensitive blocks of business in Japan. There are 2 smaller legacy blocks of interest-sensitive third sector business that may require strengthening as these blocks have been susceptible to strengthening in the past. In addition, from a corporate perspective, postretirement benefit liabilities are sensitive to long-term rate assumptions. And while not finalized, we anticipate an adjustment in fourth quarter and suspect this will be a common theme among many large corporate entities. 
Overall, we remain well positioned in terms of core margins and capital strength, and look forward to our December outlook call where we will expand on our strategic plans and 2017 outlook.

Jimmy, thank you for the questions. This is Fred. Really, the revision to our guidance is, as I mentioned in my comments, largely bolstered by outperformance relative to our expectations on the earnings front in the U.S. However, I would add that, year-to-date, both the U.S. and Japan had been traveling at generally favorable ends of our ranges for both benefit ratios and expense ratios. And so I made a point to say also or point out that Japan's solid results are contributing as well. But the true outperformance relative to our expectations was more pronounced in the U.S. earnings side. In terms of as we look forward, we will spend a big deal of time, not surprisingly, during our December outlook called Talking About the Trends As We Look at Next Year. So I'll spend more time there. I would say, in general, you would expect us in the fourth quarter, for example, to see some expenses pick up. This is not uncommon. If you follow the company over the last few years, you'll see that tick up. It has to do with the timing of promotional spend and the natural progression of initiatives as we go throughout the year. As we go into the next year, we will continue to be investing particularly in our U.S. platform, and we'll speak more about that. I don't know that I would suggest it to be material, but you would see a slightly elevated expense ratio as we invest in that platform. And then in terms of benefit ratios, we have been tracking, particularly in the U.S., at a favorable level. We would expect, to some degree, to see a continuation of that near-term eventually normalizing back towards our range. But we have seen some persistency, if you will, relative to the benefit ratio being favorably throughout the year. And based on what we're seeing right now, that should continue for a bit. But we'll talk more about it during the outlook call."

There is the really principal drivers of the hedge cost being up given how we reported, and that was really the tactical moves made in the quarter and it was a combination of extending duration as you mentioned. I would say over the past year, for example, we've pushed that duration of our hedge portfolio out for roughly 4 or 5 months to upwards now of 10 months. And that means, by definition, we're buying out into the 1-year 18-month time frame, in some cases, on the forward curve. This is in part not only to manage forward volatility, which we think is important for consistency and stability of our reported earnings and costs, but it's also because we've actually seen a flattening of the forward curve where it's more economic for us to go a little longer and lax some of that in. So we've been quite tactical on that front. The other piece that's contributing, of course, is just simply covering more assets and then particularly, covering assets that we have been building in the U.S. dollar portfolio, things like bank loans, commercial real estate and equities. We're covering those assets are important not only from a pure hedging perspective, but also you get the favorable capital treatment or really protect the favorable capital treatment that you need for SMR. So those have been the 2 areas of contribution. I would say about 35% or so of the cost related to duration extension in the quarter and about 40% of the cost increase or the cost you're seeing related to covering additional assets, just to give you some round numbers. Again, we'll be moving to an amortized basis, which is a more logical way of looking at the costs going forward. I tried to give you some color for what the quarter look like if you were to amortize costs today. We really believe in the tactical moves we're making. And during the outlook call, we'll give you a full rendering of how the year would look and how comparable years would look as we incorporated into our forecast for '17."

We also do some collaring on a small portion of the assets, which tends to be a much, much lower cost-type approach of hedging. The vast majority of our hedging is done using forwards, and that notional is traveling around $16 billion, up from around $12.7 billion in the second quarter, to give you an idea. And I think I'm going to anticipate where you may be going with this question from an understanding forward costs. And that is if you were to take our $16 billion in notional and just hold that constant, we're seeing costs traveling between 170 to 180 basis points. Actually, more recently, it's gotten a bit favorable coming off of DOJ and Fed announcements. That's why we've moved to accelerate locking in some of the costs. But we think it's more wise to be thinking in that 180 basis point range, and that gives you a sense of where we're traveling from an amortization perspective."

It's not simply a matter of growth in the U.S. dollar program, which I would anticipate to be gradual, it's also the mix of where we're investing. And what you've seen us do through bank loans for example, middle-market lending and then more recently, exploring transitional real estate lending, which is just a form of bridge loans on commercial real estate, these are all characterized as being floating-rate U.S. dollar investments. That's particularly advantageous for us because, one, you will tend to hedge that using short-dated forwards where it's relatively less expensive forwards. But also from a duration matching perspective, you end up at the same pressure that's applied to hedge costs tend to result in increased LIBOR rates and returns or yields on the floating-rate securities. So one of the things that we're working on is not just the notion of asset allocation and where the U.S. dollar program goes, but also refining our asset allocation in that portfolio to be more affective, as I mentioned in my comments, more efficient and effective in hedging, and in the process, further managing volatility."

The -- what we're seeing right now is, first of all, realized, of course. Benefit ratios will fluctuate each quarter, and so there'll be quarters where we're in our range and quarters where we move within the range or a little favorable. But what we've seen year-to-date, even somewhat last year, in the latter stages of last year, is a consistently favorable benefit ratio. And what we see going on there, we believe, relates to, somewhat to mix of business. And 2 particular types of business that are driving this, we believe, are: One, group business, where our group business naturally is priced to and expected to travel at a lower benefit ratio than you would find, say, on individual products in the way it's priced, and that's just a function of how it's priced and structured as a product. And as group business grows and becomes more of our in-force and place more of an influence on our benefit ratios, you'll see a little bit of that. The other dynamic though is really more guaranteed issue business where the actual building reserves tends to be slower and more moderate in the early years. And so as you start to sell more of that guaranteed issued business as a proportion of other business, you'll see just a slower ramp-up in reserves and a generally more favorable near-term benefit ratio. So that's what I mean when I say we would expect to see, as those types of business age, that they will age back into our expected long-term range of benefit ratio. But for a period here, it looks as if we're traveling at a, again, a persistently low benefit ratio relative to our expectations. And again, it's all on the margin. We're traveling, I think maybe 50 or so basis points better than our guidance in general, but we'll provide more of an update on this and some trends as we get to the outlook call."

It's a very, very large market, and it is attractive to insurance companies like ourselves. However, there's a trend of a shift that's capital available to the loan, middle market, loan market, even transitional real estate. And what I mean by that is there's hundreds, if not thousands of lenders, across the United States, lending to thousands of small middle market companies and in the real estate market. Historically, banks have been the capital providers to those loan markets, to the lenders, if you will, as well as risk indicating some of those loans. Because of Dodd Frank, the banks have removed themselves from that market. It's no longer capital-friendly for them. For an insurance company like us, we like to focus on credit risk and underwriting where we can negotiate very tight covenant of a high predictability of securement of loans, if you will, and our money. So it's an attractive asset class. So yes, it's true. There is a trend of insurance companies and other investors substituting for the banks. So in a way that there is some gain, I couldn't give you the exact specifics, but insurance companies are coming in where banks are leaving, providing that capital to the market. Now naturally, this supply and demand, so there may be more demand than there's been in the past and that might tighten spreads a bit, but you are getting paid with -- for taking the credit risk in those types of particular loans, companies, but you're also getting senior secured status, very tight negotiations to your favor to protect yourself in case there's any credit challenges with the company."

We not only factor in what I would call the gross yields we would expect on investing our money. But when it comes to the U.S. dollar program, we also are projecting a hedge cost environment into the net yields that we expect to support the product. So when we are pricing a product like WAYS, we're looking not only at the interest rate environment and mix of investments and associated credit spread, if you will, but we also, in our case, have to be factoring in hedge costs. So it's a very real part of how we think about the product. And so as a result, all of the repricing that we're doing is really having to take into account the low interest rate environment, our asset allocation, hedge costs. And then most notably in Japan, there's also a recognition that the standard rate, if you will, or the discount rate assumption used for reserving practices, is going to come down materially in Japan at the end of March of next year. All of those things have been factored in to pricing out our savings or intersensitive-related first sector products, namely WAYS and child endowment, in making sure that we can adhere to adhesive profitability."

But we just like to follow up a little bit on Fred's comments before to put this in context, because your focus appropriately so is on the large increase this quarter. When we went into this program, we presume the long-term average of hedge cost is somewhere between 2 and 3/4 of 3. So we were very clear when we got into the program, hedge costs were historically low, and that was about 60 bps back in '12. They kept traveling down to 20. So what we're seeing now is more of a normalization. We could never know exactly when or where this exact macro dynamics that would make hedge cost a lot, but we always knew they would go up. So even though they're at 168 to 180 basis points today, that's about 50%, 60% of the way towards the long-term average. But then if you think about that long-term average, it would take quite a huge amount of growth in the United States for the federal reserve to raise interest rates so substantially to get to those numbers. It could happen someday, but we've got about a 2% margin to be precise on your question before we'd be saying, Jesus, it's a breakeven trade."

We also look at the current composition of the portfolio, we made the site to lighten up on certain asset classes. And then, of course, there's the how do we look at the hedge strategy itself, which we continue to look at, and, as Fred has mentioned, continue to lend in duration. So if we just, we're passive. That's the answer. But we would expect to continue to manage that with a fine-tune comb to preserve as much of that margin, whether it's through higher income or better hedge cost management. So that would be dynamic over time, certainly."

Let me begin by saying that I am pleased with the company's overall financial results for both the third quarter and the first 9 months of the year. As you no doubt saw from yesterday's press release, these strong results gave us confidence to upwardly revise our operating EPS outlook for this year to the range of $6.40 to $6.60. Fred will provide more color on earnings and our outlook during his comments. 
I'll lead off by providing an update of Aflac Japan, our largest earnings contributor. From a distribution perspective, our traditional agencies, which include individual agencies independent corporate agencies, affiliated corporate agencies, have historically been and remain today vital contributors to our success. Additionally, our alliance partners continued to advance our strong results. I am particularly pleased that just this month, Japan Post, though its 20,000-plus postal outlets began selling our new cancer insurance product designed exclusively for cancer survivors.  Our traditional agencies first began selling this product in March of this year. While we anticipate the sale of our cancer insurance for cancer survivors, we'll be slightly additive to our overall sales results. More importantly, it underscores our reputation and commitment to being there for Japanese consumers when they need us most. These various distribution outlets further our goal of having a presence in all the places people want to make their insurance decisions. 
From a product perspective, I am pleased with the progress we've made in limiting the sale of first sector savings products, which are inter-sensitive. First sector product sales decreased 54% in the quarter, putting us squarely on target to reduce first sector sales by at least 50% in the second half of the year compared to the second half of 2015. We have been aggressively and pulling product from select channels, conservatively repricing our ways in endowment products for the reality of a prolonged low interest rate environment. We are extremely encouraged with the significant progress we made in limiting the sale of the first sector products.
Turning to the third sector sales results, you'll recall that we upwardly revised our annual sales target for these products last month at the Tokyo Analyst Briefing, making this the second positive revision to our sales target this year. At the meeting, we announced a new third sector sales outlook to flat to up 5%. We are pleased that Aflac Japan generated a third sector sales increase of 2.5% for the quarter and 5% year-to-date. These strong sales results in the face of difficult comparisons reflect stronger-than-expected productivity across the majority of the distribution channels. This is even more notable when you consider the sales through the bank channels had been moderated significantly by restrictions on the sale of first sector products. I will remind you that fourth quarter still presents difficult third sector comparisons, particularly following the 2 years of extremely strong cancer and medical sales. 
Our third quarter sales results also benefited from the July introduction of a new third sector product called Income Support Insurance, which accounted for JPY 708 million or 3.3% of the third sector sales.  This product provides fixed benefit amounts in the event that a policy holder is unable to work due to the significant illness or injury. Additionally, this product was developed as supplement to disability coverage within Japan's Social Security System. Our Income Support Insurance product targets young to middle-aged consumers, ranging in age from 20 through their 40s, a segment of the population in which we believe were underpenetrated and represented. By focusing our efforts on this demographic, we believe that we're building relationships that lay the groundwork for the sale of cancer and medical insurance later in life. While it's still early, we are happy with the reception of the Income Support Insurance as received. We believe this product has the potential to gradually develop into a new Aflac pillar product over the long term. 
Turning to Aflac U.S, we are pleased with our earnings are exceeding our expectations for the first 9 months. Profitability in the quarter was driven by improving benefit ratios that we continue to see over the last several years. We have simultaneously pushed resources back into the business, and particularly, we are investing in an end-to-end system for the group platform that will provide the capabilities of all of our group constituents, including brokers who typically sell group products. While we are expanding our presence in the voluntary work site insurance market, we are also being very disciplined in the pricing of the business, especially as it relates to the profitability within the smaller case group space that includes employers 100 to 250 workers. 
Although sales in the quarter were lower than expected, I would remind you that, I said many times, that fourth quarter sales and particularly sales in the last 3 weeks of the year largely determine our annual sales results. Our efforts are focused on increasing the productivity of our career agents and brokers. I believe the measures that we rolled out over a 6-month period beginning in the fourth quarter of 2014 are the right approach, and as you'll recall, one major element of the changes we made, included compensation to better align incentives for the career agents with company sales results. We are continuing to fine-tune our compensation package for our top sales management to closely align pay with performance. With this superior incentive program, we're seeing our top sales management being paid extremely well and some of the poor-performing sales managers that decided that they'd rather concentrate on sales instead of management. While we would have liked to have seen the measures have more immediate impact on our sales results, we know that it can take some time. However, I want to point out that we are exceeding our profit target while implementing these changes. Most importantly, we continue to believe the changes that we've made to our sales infrastructure and compensation are in the best interest of the company to produce long-term results.
We also remained encouraged with the broker business. Over the last few years, our sales through the broker channel have grown. Our fourth quarter sales results have become more and more impactful as you saw in 2014 and 2015. This means it becomes more and more challenging to project full year sales, even though sales results for the first 7 -- 9 months we know. Although I am encouraged by the pipeline of business schedules for the fourth quarter, we are still enhancing our forecasting of how much of the pipeline materializes into actual sales results. Therefore, we believe Aflac U.S. will require particularly strong fourth quarter in order to meet the lower end of the 3% to 5% target increase for 2016. 
I would remind you that our brand is a key differentiator for Aflac, both in Japan and the United States. As a product innovator and trusted brand in both countries, we've experienced a tremendous amount of success leveraging the strength of our brand to drive sales. In both countries, 9 out of 10 consumers recognize the Aflac brand. But our brand is more than the Aflac Duck or the advertising initiatives, it's also about how we take excellent care of the policyholders. In Japan, it's our powerful brand that has propelled Aflac to ensure 1 out of 4 households. In the United States, we processed, approved and paying nearly $1.3 million One Day Pay claims in the first 9 months of 2016. And most importantly, 96% of the policyholders that use One Day Pay said they are likely to refer other people to Aflac. We believe this will result in more -- new sales going forward. 
Our products are well suited in both Japan and the United States markets, and we are well positioned in the 2 largest insurance markets in the world. 
Turning to capital deployment. Let me just say that we continue to view growing the cash dividend and repurchasing our shares as the most attractive means for deploying capital, particular in the absence of any compelling alternatives. We are on target to repurchase about $1.4 billion of our shares, with the majority already repurchased during the first 9 months of the year. The Board of Directors action to increase the dividend by 4.9%, demonstrates our commitment to rewarding our shareholders. This marks the 34th consecutive year of increasing our cash dividend. We are proud of the achievement, and our objective is to grow the cash dividend rate in line with the increase in the operating earnings per diluted share before the impact of foreign currency translation.
We continue to manage the business for the long-term benefit of the shareholders, the policyholders and all stakeholders. We believe we will continue to achieve more by building on these strategies and the foundations that have propelled our success. By doing this, I believe we will continue to enhance shareholder value while delivering on our promise to the policyholders. 
And now let me turn the program over to Fred, who will cover the financial results and outlook. Fred?"

Our third quarter performance continues the strong financial results recorded in the first half of 2016, and execution on key initiatives designed to drive long-term growth and effective allocation of our capital. Our results were driven b",994,"Thank you, Dan. Our third quarter performance continues the strong financial results recorded in the first half of 2016, and execution on key initiatives designed to drive long-term growth and effective allocation of our capital. Our results were driven by strong overall margins in both Japan and the U.S. Operating EPS increased 16.7% or $0.26 per share with a little over half the growth driven by the strengthening of the yen and the remaining from share repurchase and pure earnings growth. Excluding the impact of the yen, operating earnings increased 7% as compared to the previous year's quarter. 
Our Japan segment margins were solid. We concluded as part of our annual actuarial review process that it was appropriate to reduce the IBNR reserves for our cancer insurance block of business by approximately JPY 4.6 billion or $0.07 a share. This amount is very similar to the adjustment we made in the third quarter last year and reflects continued strong cancer claims experience. Expense ratios were generally in line with our guidance. 
In the U.S., benefit ratios continued their favorable trends for the year. Our expense ratio was favorable to our expectations for the quarter. Consistent with previous years, we fully expect our expenses to tick up in the fourth quarter as we make progress on certain strategic initiatives and increase our promotional and IT spend. Overall, our U.S. pretax profit margins are set to perform at or above the high end of our 2016 guidance range of 17% to 19% for the year.
Both Japan and the U.S., we will spend some time on our December outlook call discussing revenue trends, benefit ratio drivers and specific to expense ratios where we intend to invest in the platform throughout 2017. 
Turning to investments. Results were both the quarter and the year, and we're aligned -- year-to-date, we're aligned with our expectations as we continue to navigate the low-yield environment and further diversify our portfolio. As we discussed during our analyst briefing in Japan, we continue to execute on a comprehensive plan that includes curtailing interest-sensitive premium flows through actions to reduce the sale of first sector savings products; developing alternative high-quality yen investments, including a measured re-entry back into yen private placements; finally, executing on our U.S. dollar investment strategy where we can hedge market value effectively and optimize investment income consistent with risk, ALM and capital objectives. 
With respect to our U.S. dollar program and hedge costs, our reported third quarter costs were elevated, recognizing we currently isolate and report the full cost of forwards in the period we purchased. Consistent with the strategy we have outlined at our analyst briefing in Japan, we have successfully executed on covering approximately $3.3 billion of additional U.S. dollar assets under the hedge program and have proactively extended the duration of our forwards to better manage 2017 costs and associated volatility. Both of these actions will serve to exaggerate our reported costs in the period under our current reporting.
Amortizing the cost over the life of the forwards, the non-GAAP reporting convention we plan to adopt in 2017, our hedge cost for the entire book of hedges were $54 million pretax or $0.09 a share this quarter. Assuming no material change in hedging strategy and our current reporting method, our pretax hedge cost guidance remains in the $280 million to $300 million range for 2016. 
Moving to an amortized basis for reporting, tactically extending duration, continuing to refine the asset allocation and hedging strategy will serve to reduce the quarterly volatility as we incorporate hedge costs into our definition of operating earnings for 2017. We'll cover this approach and forecast in more detail at our outlook call in December. 
Turning to capital. We commented last quarter that hedging additional U.S. dollar asset classes would further strengthen our SMR. We ended the quarter with an estimated SMR above 900%, up significantly from last quarter. RBC is also preliminary at this point, but we expect it to remain Strong in the mid-800% range despite the strengthening of the yen impacting our ratio negatively throughout the year. This is a result of the Japan branch embedded in our U.S. statutory results. 
Overall, credit conditions are stable. Impairments in the quarter were modest and preliminary -- and primarily related to our Japan equity portfolios, where depressed market values have triggered impairments in accordance with our internal accounting policies. 
We continue to return capital to shareholders. Between dividends and repurchase, we have returned approximately $1.7 billion to our shareholders year-to-date. We continue to spend down excess capital held at the holding company, and expect to achieve our target of $1.4 billion in repurchase for the full year. As Dan highlighted, our board elected to increase the shareholder dividend to $0.43 per share per quarter, a 4.9% increase in marking our 34th consecutive year of dividend increases. 
Bolstered by U.S. segment earnings outperformance and solid results in Japan, we are comfortable increasing our 2016 earnings guidance to $6.40 a share to $6.60 per share on a currency neutral basis. We have provided in our press release an EPS range for the fourth quarter, assuming a yen to dollar exchange rate of $100 to $110.
As mentioned last quarter, we are conducting our normal actuarial review of interest-sensitive blocks of business in Japan. There are 2 smaller legacy blocks of interest-sensitive third sector business that may require strengthening as these blocks have been susceptible to strengthening in the past. In addition, from a corporate perspective, postretirement benefit liabilities are sensitive to long-term rate assumptions. And while not finalized, we anticipate an adjustment in fourth quarter and suspect this will be a common theme among many large corporate entities. 
Overall, we remain well positioned in terms of core margins and capital strength, and look forward to our December outlook call where we will expand on our strategic plans and 2017 outlook. 
I'll now hand the call back to Robin to begin our Q&A session. Robin?"

Jimmy, thank you for the questions. This is Fred. Really, the revision to our guidance is, as I mentioned in my comments, largely bolstered by outperformance relative to our expectations on the earnings front in the U.S. However, I would add that, year-to-date, both the U.S. and Japan had been traveling at generally favorable ends of our ranges for both benefit ratios and expense ratios. And so I made a point to say also or point out that Japan's solid results are contributing as well. But the true outperformance relative to our expectations was more pronounced in the U.S. earnings side. In terms of as we look forward, we will spend a big deal of time, not surprisingly, during our December outlook call talking about the trends as we look at next year. So I'll spend more time there. I would say, in general, you would expect us in the fourth quarter, for example, to see some expenses pick up. This is not uncommon. If you follow the company over the last few years, you'll see that tick up. It has to do with the timing of promotional spend and the natural progression of initiatives as we go throughout the year. As we go into the next year, we will continue to be investing particularly in our U.S. platform, and we'll speak more about that. I don't know that I would suggest it to be material, but you would see a slightly elevated expense ratio as we invest in that platform. And then in terms of benefit ratios, we have been tracking, particularly in the U.S., at a favorable level. We would expect, to some degree, to see a continuation of that near-term eventually normalizing back towards our range. But we have seen some persistency, if you will, relative to the benefit ratio being favorably throughout the year. And based on what we're seeing right now, that should continue for a bit. But we'll talk more about it during the outlook call."

I would say over the past year, for ex",354,"Yes. There is the really principal drivers of the hedge cost being up given how we reported, and that was really the tactical moves made in the quarter and it was a combination of extending duration as you mentioned. I would say over the past year, for example, we've pushed that duration of our hedge portfolio out from roughly 4 or 5 months to upwards now of 10 months. And that means, by definition, we're buying out into the 1-year 18-month time frame, in some cases, on the forward curve. This is in part not only to manage forward volatility, which we think is important for consistency and stability of our reported earnings and costs, but it's also because we've actually seen a flattening of the forward curve where it's more economic for us to go a little longer and lax some of that in. So we've been quite tactical on that front. The other piece that's contributing, of course, is just simply covering more assets and in particularly, covering assets that we have been building in the U.S. dollar portfolio, things like bank loans, commercial real estate and equities. We're covering those assets are important not only from a pure hedging perspective, but also you get the favorable capital treatment or really protect the favorable capital treatment that you need for SMR. So those have been the 2 areas of contribution. I would say about 35% or so of the cost related to duration extension in the quarter and about 40% of the cost increase or the cost you're seeing related to covering additional assets, just to give you some round numbers. Again, we'll be moving to an amortized basis, which is a more logical way of looking at the costs going forward. I tried to give you some color for what the quarter look like if you were to amortize costs today. We really believe in the tactical moves we're making. And during the outlook call, we'll give you a full rendering of how the year would look and how comparable years would look as we incorporated into our forecast for '17."

We also do some collaring on a small portion of the assets, which tends to be a much, much lower cost-type approach of hedging. The vast majority of our hedging is done using forwards, and that notional is traveling around $16 billion, up from around $12.7 billion in the second quarter, to give you an idea. And I think I'm going to anticipate where you may be going with this question from an understanding forward costs. And that is if you were to take our $16 billion in notional and just hold that constant, we're seeing costs traveling between 170 to 180 basis points. Actually, more recently, it's gotten a bit favorable coming off of DOJ and Fed announcements. That's why we've moved to accelerate locking in some of the costs. But we think it's more wise to be thinking in that 180 basis point range, and that gives you a sense of where we're traveling from an amortization perspective."

It's not simply a matter of growth in the U.S. dollar program, which I would anticipate to be gradual, it's also the mix of where we're investing. And what you've seen us do through bank loans for example, middle-market lending and then more recently, exploring transitional real estate lending, which is just a form of bridge loans on commercial real estate, these are all characterized as being floating-rate U.S. dollar investments. That's particularly advantageous for us because, one, you will tend to hedge that using short-dated forwards where it's relatively less expensive forwards. But also from a duration matching perspective, you end up at the same pressure that's applied to hedge costs tend to result in increased LIBOR rates and returns or yields on the floating-rate securities. So one of the things that we're working on is not just the notion of asset allocation and where the U.S. dollar program goes, but also refining our asset allocation in that portfolio to be more affective, as I mentioned in my comments, more efficient and effective in hedging, and in the process, further managing volatility."

The -- what we're seeing right now is, first of all, realized, of course. Benefit ratios will fluctuate each quarter, and so there'll be quarters where we're in our range and quarters where we move within the range or a little favorable. But what we've seen year-to-date, even somewhat last year, in the latter stages of last year, is a consistently favorable benefit ratio. And what we see going on there, we believe, relates to, somewhat to mix of business. And 2 particular types of business that are driving this, we believe, are: One, group business, where our group business naturally is priced to and expected to travel at a lower benefit ratio than you would find, say, on individual products in the way it's priced, and that's just a function of how it's priced and structured as a product. And as group business grows and becomes more of our in-force and plays more of an influence on our benefit ratios, you'll see a little bit of that. The other dynamic though is really more guaranteed issue business where the actual building reserves tends to be slower and more moderate in the early years. And so as you start to sell more of that guaranteed issued business as a proportion of other business, you'll see just a slower ramp-up in reserves and a generally more favorable near-term benefit ratio. So that's what I mean when I say we would expect to see, as those types of business age, that they will age back into our expected long-term range of benefit ratio. But for a period here, it looks as if we're traveling at a, again, a persistently low benefit ratio relative to our expectations. And again, it's all on the margin. We're traveling, I think maybe 50 or so basis points better than our guidance in general, but we'll provide more of an update on this and some trends as we get to the outlook call."

Historically, banks have been the capital providers to those loan markets, to the lenders, if you will, as well as re-syndicating some of those loans. Because of Dodd Frank, the banks have removed themselves from that market. It's no longer capital-friendly for them.

And as a result, we have a greater level of confidence. There'll be something, and so we have set aside some money for that. In the case of our review of these blocks, legacy blocks of business I mentioned, that is not in the numbers because we really are too early in the process to know what might be the practical ranges or if there will be a reserve strengthening at all on those products. And so we do not have anything in the numbers for that."

In a sense of when we look at our putting new money to work, if you will, premium, and what new money assumptions, let's call it the new money curve, we need to achieve to achieve certain profitability levels. We not only factor in what I would call the gross yields we would expect on investing our money. But when it comes to the U.S. dollar program, we also are projecting a hedge cost environment into the net yields that we expect to support the product. So when we are pricing a product like WAYS, we're looking not only at the interest rate environment and mix of investments and associated credit spread, if you will, but we also, in our case, have to be factoring in hedge costs. So it's a very real part of how we think about the product. And so as a result, all of the repricing that we're doing is really having to take into account the low interest rate environment, our asset allocation, hedge costs. And then most notably in Japan, there's also a recognition that the standard rate, if you will, or the discount rate assumption used for reserving practices, is going to come down materially in Japan at the end of March of next year. All of those things have been factored in to pricing out our savings or intersensitive-related first sector products, namely WAYS and child endowment, in making sure that we can adhere to a decent profitability."

But we just like to follow up a little bit on Fred's comments before to put this in context, because your focus appropriately so is on the large increase this quarter. When we went into this program, we presume the long-term average of hedge cost is somewhere between 2 and 3/4 of 3. So we were very clear when we got into the program, hedge costs were historically low, and that was about 60 bps back in '12. They kept traveling down to 20. So what we're seeing now is more of a normalization. We could never know exactly when or where this exact macro dynamics that would make hedge cost go up, but we always knew they would go up. So even though they're at 168 to 180 basis points today, that's about 50%, 60% of the way towards the long-term average. But then if you think about that long-term average, it would take quite a huge amount of growth in the United States for the federal reserve to raise interest rates so substantially to get to those numbers. It could happen someday, but we've got about a 2% margin to be precise on your question before we'd be saying, Jesus, it's a breakeven trade."

We also look at the current composition of the portfolio, we may decide to lighten up on certain asset classes. And then, of course, there's the how do we look at the hedge strategy itself, which we continue to look at, and, as Fred has mentioned, continue to lend in duration. So if we just, we're passive. That's the answer. But we would expect to continue to manage that with a fine-toothed comb to preserve as much of that margin, whether it's through higher income or better hedge cost management.

Let me begin by saying that I am pleased with the company's overall financial results for both the third quarter and the first 9 months of the year. As you no doubt saw from yesterday's press release, these strong results gave us confidence to upwardly revise our operating EPS outlook for this year to the range of $6.40 to $6.60. Fred will provide more color on earnings and our outlook during his comments. 
I'll lead off by providing an update of Aflac Japan, our largest earnings contributor. From a distribution perspective, our traditional agencies, which include individual agencies independent corporate agencies, affiliated corporate agencies, have historically been and remain today vital contributors to our success. Additionally, our alliance partners continued to advance our strong results. I am particularly pleased that just this month, Japan Post, though its 20,000-plus postal outlets began selling our new cancer insurance product designed exclusively for cancer survivors.  Our traditional agencies first began selling this product in March of this year. While we anticipate the sale of our cancer insurance for cancer survivors, we'll be slightly additive to our overall sales results. More importantly, it underscores our reputation and commitment to being there for Japanese consumers when they need us most. These various distribution outlets further our goal of having a presence in all the places people want to make their insurance decisions. 
From a product perspective, I am pleased with the progress we've made in limiting the sale of first sector savings products, which are inter-sensitive. First sector product sales decreased 54% in the quarter, putting us squarely on target to reduce first sector sales by at least 50% in the second half of the year compared to the second half of 2015. We have been aggressively and pulling product from select channels, conservatively repricing our ways in endowment products for the reality of a prolonged low interest rate environment. We are extremely encouraged with the significant progress we made in limiting the sale of the first sector products.
Turning to the third sector sales results, you'll recall that we upwardly revised our annual sales target for these products last month at the Tokyo Analyst Briefing, making this the second positive revision to our sales target this year. At the meeting, we announced a new third sector sales outlook to flat to up 5%. We are pleased that Aflac Japan generated a third sector sales increase of 2.5% for the quarter and 5% year-to-date. These strong sales results in the face of difficult comparisons reflect stronger-than-expected productivity across the majority of the distribution channels. This is even more notable when you consider the sales through the bank channels had been moderated significantly by restrictions on the sale of first sector products. I will remind you that fourth quarter still presents difficult third sector comparisons, particularly following the 2 years of extremely strong cancer and medical sales. 
Our third quarter sales results also benefited from the July introduction of a new third sector product called Income Support Insurance, which accounted for JPY 708 million or 3.3% of the third sector sales.  This product provides fixed benefit amounts in the event that a policy holder is unable to work due to the significant illness or injury. Additionally, this product was developed as supplement to disability coverage within Japan's Social Security System. Our Income Support Insurance product targets young to middle-aged consumers, ranging in age from 20 through their 40s, a segment of the population in which we believe were underpenetrated and represented. By focusing our efforts on this demographic, we believe that we're building relationships that lay the groundwork for the sale of cancer and medical insurance later in life. While it's still early, we are happy with the reception of the Income Support Insurance as received. We believe this product has the potential to gradually develop into a new Aflac pillar product over the long term. 
Turning to Aflac U.S, we are pleased with our earnings are exceeding our expectations for the first 9 months. Profitability in the quarter was driven by improving benefit ratios that we continue to see over the last several years. We have simultaneously pushed resources back into the business, and particularly, we are investing in an end-to-end system for the group platform that will provide the capabilities of all of our group constituents, including brokers who typically sell group products. While we are expanding our presence in the voluntary work site insurance market, we are also being very disciplined in the pricing of the business, especially as it relates to the profitability within the smaller case group space that includes employers 100 to 250 workers. 
Although sales in the quarter were lower than expected, I would remind you that, I said many times, that fourth quarter sales and particularly sales in the last 3 weeks of the year largely determine our annual sales results. Our efforts are focused on increasing the productivity of our career agents and brokers. I believe the measures that we rolled out over a 6-month period beginning in the fourth quarter of 2014 are the right approach, and as you'll recall, one major element of the changes we made, included compensation to better align incentives for the career agents with company sales results. We are continuing to fine-tune our compensation package for our top sales management to closely align pay with performance. With this superior incentive program, we're seeing our top sales management being paid extremely well and some of the poor-performing sales managers that decided that they'd rather concentrate on sales instead of management. While we would have liked to have seen the measures have more immediate impact on our sales results, we know that it can take some time. However, I want to point out that we are exceeding our profit target while implementing these changes. Most importantly, we continue to believe the changes that we've made to our sales infrastructure and compensation are in the best interest of the company to produce long-term results.
We also remained encouraged with the broker business. Over the last few years, our sales through the broker channel have grown. Our fourth quarter sales results have become more and more impactful as you saw in 2014 and 2015. This means it becomes more and more challenging to project full year sales, even though sales results for the first 7 -- 9 months we know. Although I am encouraged by the pipeline of business schedules for the fourth quarter, we are still enhancing our forecasting of how much of the pipeline materializes into actual sales results. Therefore, we believe Aflac U.S. will require particularly strong fourth quarter in order to meet the lower end of the 3% to 5% target increase for 2016. 
I would remind you that our brand is a key differentiator for Aflac, both in Japan and the United States. As a product innovator and trusted brand in both countries, we've experienced a tremendous amount of success leveraging the strength of our brand to drive sales. In both countries, 9 out of 10 consumers recognize the Aflac brand. But our brand is more than the Aflac Duck or the advertising initiatives, it's also about how we take excellent care of the policyholders. In Japan, it's our powerful brand that has propelled Aflac to ensure 1 out of 4 households. In the United States, we processed, approved and paying nearly $1.3 million One Day Pay claims in the first 9 months of 2016. And most importantly, 96% of the policyholders that use One Day Pay said they are likely to refer other people to Aflac. We believe this will result in more -- new sales going forward. 
Our products are well suited in both Japan and the United States markets, and we are well positioned in the 2 largest insurance markets in the world. 
Turning to capital deployment. Let me just say that we continue to view growing the cash dividend and repurchasing our shares as the most attractive means for deploying capital, particular in the absence of any compelling alternatives. We are on target to repurchase about $1.4 billion of our shares, with the majority already repurchased during the first 9 months of the year. The Board of Directors action to increase the dividend by 4.9%, demonstrates our commitment to rewarding our shareholders. This marks the 34th consecutive year of increasing our cash dividend. We are proud of the achievement, and our objective is to grow the cash dividend rate in line with the increase in the operating earnings per diluted share before the impact of foreign currency translation.
We continue to manage the business for the long-term benefit of the shareholders, the policyholders and all stakeholders. We believe we will continue to achieve more by building on these strategies and the foundations that have propelled our success. By doing this, I believe we will continue to enhance shareholder value while delivering on our promise to the policyholders. 
And now let me turn the program over to Fred, who will cover the financial results and outlook. Fred?"

Our third quarter performance continues the strong financial results recorded in the first half of 2016, and execution on key initiatives designed to drive long-term growth and effective allocation of our capital. Our results were driven b",994,"Thank you, Dan. Our third quarter performance continues the strong financial results recorded in the first half of 2016, and execution on key initiatives designed to drive long-term growth and effective allocation of our capital. Our results were driven by strong overall margins in both Japan and the U.S. Operating EPS increased 16.7% or $0.26 per share with a little over half the growth driven by the strengthening of the yen and the remaining from share repurchase and pure earnings growth. Excluding the impact of the yen, operating earnings increased 7% as compared to the previous year's quarter. 
Our Japan segment margins were solid. We concluded as part of our annual actuarial review process that it was appropriate to reduce the IBNR reserves for our cancer insurance block of business by approximately JPY 4.6 billion or $0.07 a share. This amount is very similar to the adjustment we made in the third quarter last year and reflects continued strong cancer claims experience. Expense ratios were generally in line with our guidance. 
In the U.S., benefit ratios continued their favorable trends for the year. Our expense ratio was favorable to our expectations for the quarter. Consistent with previous years, we fully expect our expenses to tick up in the fourth quarter as we make progress on certain strategic initiatives and increase our promotional and IT spend. Overall, our U.S. pretax profit margins are set to perform at or above the high end of our 2016 guidance range of 17% to 19% for the year.
Both Japan and the U.S., we will spend some time on our December outlook call discussing revenue trends, benefit ratio drivers and specific to expense ratios where we intend to invest in the platform throughout 2017. 
Turning to investments. Results were both the quarter and the year, and we're aligned -- year-to-date, we're aligned with our expectations as we continue to navigate the low-yield environment and further diversify our portfolio. As we discussed during our analyst briefing in Japan, we continue to execute on a comprehensive plan that includes curtailing interest-sensitive premium flows through actions to reduce the sale of first sector savings products; developing alternative high-quality yen investments, including a measured re-entry back into yen private placements; finally, executing on our U.S. dollar investment strategy where we can hedge market value effectively and optimize investment income consistent with risk, ALM and capital objectives. 
With respect to our U.S. dollar program and hedge costs, our reported third quarter costs were elevated, recognizing we currently isolate and report the full cost of forwards in the period we purchased. Consistent with the strategy we have outlined at our analyst briefing in Japan, we have successfully executed on covering approximately $3.3 billion of additional U.S. dollar assets under the hedge program and have proactively extended the duration of our forwards to better manage 2017 costs and associated volatility. Both of these actions will serve to exaggerate our reported costs in the period under our current reporting.
Amortizing the cost over the life of the forwards, the non-GAAP reporting convention we plan to adopt in 2017, our hedge cost for the entire book of hedges were $54 million pretax or $0.09 a share this quarter. Assuming no material change in hedging strategy and our current reporting method, our pretax hedge cost guidance remains in the $280 million to $300 million range for 2016. 
Moving to an amortized basis for reporting, tactically extending duration, continuing to refine the asset allocation and hedging strategy will serve to reduce the quarterly volatility as we incorporate hedge costs into our definition of operating earnings for 2017. We'll cover this approach and forecast in more detail at our outlook call in December. 
Turning to capital. We commented last quarter that hedging additional U.S. dollar asset classes would further strengthen our SMR. We ended the quarter with an estimated SMR above 900%, up significantly from last quarter. RBC is also preliminary at this point, but we expect it to remain Strong in the mid-800% range despite the strengthening of the yen impacting our ratio negatively throughout the year. This is a result of the Japan branch embedded in our U.S. statutory results. 
Overall, credit conditions are stable. Impairments in the quarter were modest and preliminary -- and primarily related to our Japan equity portfolios, where depressed market values have triggered impairments in accordance with our internal accounting policies. 
We continue to return capital to shareholders. Between dividends and repurchase, we have returned approximately $1.7 billion to our shareholders year-to-date. We continue to spend down excess capital held at the holding company, and expect to achieve our target of $1.4 billion in repurchase for the full year. As Dan highlighted, our board elected to increase the shareholder dividend to $0.43 per share per quarter, a 4.9% increase in marking our 34th consecutive year of dividend increases. 
Bolstered by U.S. segment earnings outperformance and solid results in Japan, we are comfortable increasing our 2016 earnings guidance to $6.40 a share to $6.60 per share on a currency neutral basis. We have provided in our press release an EPS range for the fourth quarter, assuming a yen to dollar exchange rate of $100 to $110.
As mentioned last quarter, we are conducting our normal actuarial review of interest-sensitive blocks of business in Japan. There are 2 smaller legacy blocks of interest-sensitive third sector business that may require strengthening as these blocks have been susceptible to strengthening in the past. In addition, from a corporate perspective, postretirement benefit liabilities are sensitive to long-term rate assumptions. And while not finalized, we anticipate an adjustment in fourth quarter and suspect this will be a common theme among many large corporate entities. 
Overall, we remain well positioned in terms of core margins and capital strength, and look forward to our December outlook call where we will expand on our strategic plans and 2017 outlook. 
I'll now hand the call back to Robin to begin our Q&A session. Robin?"

Jimmy, thank you for the questions. This is Fred. Really, the revision to our guidance is, as I mentioned in my comments, largely bolstered by outperformance relative to our expectations on the earnings front in the U.S. However, I would add that, year-to-date, both the U.S. and Japan had been traveling at generally favorable ends of our ranges for both benefit ratios and expense ratios. And so I made a point to say also or point out that Japan's solid results are contributing as well. But the true outperformance relative to our expectations was more pronounced in the U.S. earnings side. In terms of as we look forward, we will spend a big deal of time, not surprisingly, during our December outlook call talking about the trends as we look at next year. So I'll spend more time there. I would say, in general, you would expect us in the fourth quarter, for example, to see some expenses pick up. This is not uncommon. If you follow the company over the last few years, you'll see that tick up. It has to do with the timing of promotional spend and the natural progression of initiatives as we go throughout the year. As we go into the next year, we will continue to be investing particularly in our U.S. platform, and we'll speak more about that. I don't know that I would suggest it to be material, but you would see a slightly elevated expense ratio as we invest in that platform. And then in terms of benefit ratios, we have been tracking, particularly in the U.S., at a favorable level. We would expect, to some degree, to see a continuation of that near-term eventually normalizing back towards our range. But we have seen some persistency, if you will, relative to the benefit ratio being favorably throughout the year. And based on what we're seeing right now, that should continue for a bit. But we'll talk more about it during the outlook call."

There is the really principal drivers of the hedge cost being up given how we reported, and that was really the tactical moves made in the quarter and it was a combination of extending duration as you mentioned. I would say over the past year, for example, we've pushed that duration of our hedge portfolio out from roughly 4 or 5 months to upwards now of 10 months. And that means, by definition, we're buying out into the 1-year 18-month time frame, in some cases, on the forward curve. This is in part not only to manage forward volatility, which we think is important for consistency and stability of our reported earnings and costs, but it's also because we've actually seen a flattening of the forward curve where it's more economic for us to go a little longer and lax some of that in. So we've been quite tactical on that front. The other piece that's contributing, of course, is just simply covering more assets and in particularly, covering assets that we have been building in the U.S. dollar portfolio, things like bank loans, commercial real estate and equities. We're covering those assets are important not only from a pure hedging perspective, but also you get the favorable capital treatment or really protect the favorable capital treatment that you need for SMR. So those have been the 2 areas of contribution. I would say about 35% or so of the cost related to duration extension in the quarter and about 40% of the cost increase or the cost you're seeing related to covering additional assets, just to give you some round numbers. Again, we'll be moving to an amortized basis, which is a more logical way of looking at the costs going forward. I tried to give you some color for what the quarter look like if you were to amortize costs today. We really believe in the tactical moves we're making. And during the outlook call, we'll give you a full rendering of how the year would look and how comparable years would look as we incorporated into our forecast for '17."

We also do some collaring on a small portion of the assets, which tends to be a much, much lower cost-type approach of hedging. The vast majority of our hedging is done using forwards, and that notional is traveling around $16 billion, up from around $12.7 billion in the second quarter, to give you an idea. And I think I'm going to anticipate where you may be going with this question from an understanding forward costs. And that is if you were to take our $16 billion in notional and just hold that constant, we're seeing costs traveling between 170 to 180 basis points. Actually, more recently, it's gotten a bit favorable coming off of DOJ and Fed announcements. That's why we've moved to accelerate locking in some of the costs. But we think it's more wise to be thinking in that 180 basis point range, and that gives you a sense of where we're traveling from an amortization perspective."

It's not simply a matter of growth in the U.S. dollar program, which I would anticipate to be gradual, it's also the mix of where we're investing. And what you've seen us do through bank loans for example, middle-market lending and then more recently, exploring transitional real estate lending, which is just a form of bridge loans on commercial real estate, these are all characterized as being floating-rate U.S. dollar investments. That's particularly advantageous for us because, one, you will tend to hedge that using short-dated forwards where it's relatively less expensive forwards. But also from a duration matching perspective, you end up at the same pressure that's applied to hedge costs tend to result in increased LIBOR rates and returns or yields on the floating-rate securities. So one of the things that we're working on is not just the notion of asset allocation and where the U.S. dollar program goes, but also refining our asset allocation in that portfolio to be more effective, as I mentioned in my comments, more efficient and effective in hedging, and in the process, further managing volatility."

But because of the way they enroll the accounts, the way it's working now wears me out. It's like a football game where you got to pull it out in the fourth quarter, but that numbers becoming larger and larger. And we're trying to shift it more to the third quarter, and it didn't work. They still want to turn it in, in the fourth quarter, and we had more control over the associates because they listen more. But when you deal with this broad-based broker, you just take it when -- so -- but we got this big pipeline.

The -- what we're seeing right now is, first of all, realized, of course. Benefit ratios will fluctuate each quarter, and so there'll be quarters where we're in our range and quarters where we move within the range or a little favorable. But what we've seen year-to-date, even somewhat last year, in the latter stages of last year, is a consistently favorable benefit ratio. And what we see going on there, we believe, relates to, somewhat to mix of business. And 2 particular types of business that are driving this, we believe, are: One, group business, where our group business naturally is priced to and expected to travel at a lower benefit ratio than you would find, say, on individual products in the way it's priced, and that's just a function of how it's priced and structured as a product. And as group business grows and becomes more of our in-force and plays more of an influence on our benefit ratios, you'll see a little bit of that. The other dynamic though is really more guaranteed issue business where the actual building reserves tends to be slower and more moderate in the early years. And so as you start to sell more of that guaranteed issued business as a proportion of other business, you'll see just a slower ramp-up in reserves and a generally more favorable near-term benefit ratio. So that's what I mean when I say we would expect to see, as those types of business age, that they will age back into our expected long-term range of benefit ratio. But for a period here, it looks as if we're traveling at a, again, a persistently low benefit ratio relative to our expectations. And again, it's all on the margin. We're traveling, I think maybe 50 or so basis points better than our guidance in general, but we'll provide more of an update on this and some trends as we get to the outlook call."

It's a very, very large market, and it is attractive to insurance companies like ourselves. However, there's a trend of a shift that's capital available to the loan, middle market, loan market, even transitional real estate. And what I mean by that is there's hundreds, if not thousands of lenders, across the United States, lending to thousands of small middle market companies and in the real estate market. Historically, banks have been the capital providers to those loan markets, to the lenders, if you will, as well as re-syndicating some of those loans. Because of Dodd-Frank, the banks have removed themselves from that market. It's no longer capital-friendly for them. For an insurance company like us, we like to focus on credit risk and underwriting where we can negotiate very tight covenant of a high predictability of securement of loans, if you will, and our money. So it's an attractive asset class. So yes, it's true. There is a trend of insurance companies and other investors substituting for the banks. So in a way it's a zero-sum gain, I couldn't give you the exact specifics, but insurance companies are coming in where banks are leaving, providing that capital to the market. Now naturally, it's supply and demand, so there may be more demand than there's been in the past and that might tighten spreads a bit, but you are getting paid with -- for taking the credit risk in those types of particular loans, companies, but you're also getting senior secured status, very tight negotiations to your favor to protect yourself in case there's any credit challenges with the company."

So Fred, if you factor in the cost of hedges currently and then you consider the impact on your first sector business like WAYS, are those products still going to be profitable when you factor in the cost of rollin",94,"Another question on the hedging program. So Fred, if you factor in the cost of hedges currently and then you consider the impact on your first sector business like WAYS, are those products still going to be profitable when you factor in the cost of rolling these hedges here? And is that the way you're thinking about it at a discrete product level in terms of profits? Or you're thinking about the hedge in a different way? Is that sort of corporate expense, it's discreet and not being factored in at the product level?"

In a sense of when we look at our putting new money to work, if you will, premium, and what new money assumptions, let's call it the new money curve, we need to achieve to achieve certain profitability levels. We not only factor in what I would call the gross yields we would expect on investing our money. But when it comes to the U.S. dollar program, we also are projecting a hedge cost environment into the net yields that we expect to support the product. So when we are pricing a product like WAYS, we're looking not only at the interest rate environment and mix of investments and associated credit spread, if you will, but we also, in our case, have to be factoring in hedge costs. So it's a very real part of how we think about the product. And so as a result, all of the repricing that we're doing is really having to take into account the low interest rate environment, our asset allocation, hedge costs. And then most notably in Japan, there's also a recognition that the standard rate, if you will, or the discount rate assumption used for reserving practices, is going to come down materially in Japan at the end of March of next year. All of those things have been factored in to pricing out our savings or intersensitive-related first sector products, namely WAYS and child endowment, in making sure that we can adhere to a decent profitability."

But we do the testing work on all of our products, both third sector and first sector in the fourth quarter. Not surprisingly, we will see the reserve margin squeeze on first sector savings products as it relates to the current environment, including hedge costs. But we have solid margins in those areas. And so at the moment, we don't see that as a risk. It's more this acute, what we are calling legacy smaller blocks that are actually third sector business to be technically correct."

And then just a follow-up for Eric. Can you comment on what's the breakeven of where hedge costs would have to go to, to the point where you would say, this has been a negative decision from an economic standpoint in terms of building out this U.S. dollar portfolio? Clearly, running at 180 basis points, I know it's high. Is that still -- is that a net positive, like when you factor that in and look at the yield and the risk related to building out this program?"

The approximate number is 2%, meaning our earnings are about 3.6%. If you look at the stock hedge costs, call it 160, 180. We got about a 2% margin built-in.

If you look at the stock hedge costs, call it 160, 180. We got about a 2% margin built-in. But we just like to follow up a little bit on Fred's comments before to put this in context, because your focus appropriately so is on the large increase this quarter. When we went into this program, we presume the long-term average of hedge cost is somewhere between 2 and 3/4 of 3. So we were very clear when we got into the program, hedge costs were historically low, and that was about 60 bps back in '12. They kept traveling down to 20. So what we're seeing now is more of a normalization. We could never know exactly when or where this exact macro dynamics that would make hedge cost go up, but we always knew they would go up. So even though they're at 168 to 180 basis points today, that's about 50%, 60% of the way towards the long-term average. But then if you think about that long-term average, it would take quite a huge amount of growth in the United States for the federal reserve to raise interest rates so substantially to get to those numbers. It could happen someday, but we've got about a 2% margin to be precise on your question before we'd be saying, Jesus, it's a breakeven trade."

And finally, I'll just, again, reiterate what Fred said earlier, that assumes were passive, and we do nothing. But again, we continue to look at asset allocation and changing the mix of the assets to set or match off against those hedge costs like the floating rate assets. We also look at the current composition of the portfolio, we may decide to lighten up on certain asset classes. And then, of course, there's the how do we look at the hedge strategy itself, which we continue to look at, and, as Fred has mentioned, continue to lend in duration. So if we just, we're passive. That's the answer. But we would expect to continue to manage that with a fine-toothed comb to preserve as much of that margin, whether it's through higher income or better hedge cost management. So that would be dynamic over time, certainly."

And once again, the dollar program has limits, and we're actually pretty close to those limits. We have some capacity. And as Fred said, we'll talk more in the December outlook call about future purchases. But in context of a large global portfolio, we like the diversification because if all we were buying were yen assets and we've got quite a large amount every year maturing, private placements, old assets of 2% and 3%, our reinvestment -- net investment income would go down pretty rapidly as well.
