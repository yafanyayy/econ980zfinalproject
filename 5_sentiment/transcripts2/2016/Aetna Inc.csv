This morning, Aetna reported full year 2015 operating EPS of $7.71, exceeding our previous projection and representing a record result for the company and year-over-year growth of 15%,",1119,"Good morning. Thank you, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. This morning, Aetna reported full year 2015 operating EPS of $7.71, exceeding our previous projection and representing a record result for the company and year-over-year growth of 15%, exceeding our long-term targeted range. 
Looking back on 2015, we generated record annual operating revenue of over $60 billion; achieved our high-single-digit operating margin target for the fifth consecutive year; achieved our targeted pretax operating margin in our Individual Medicare Advantage business 1 year ahead of our projections; exceeded our initial operating EPS projection by 12% despite headwinds in our ACA-related businesses and lower-than-projected share repurchases; increased our projected 2015 operating EPS 5x; and announced our agreement to acquire Humana, the largest transaction in the company's history. 
Aetna's strong 2015 results speak to our continued focus on discipline pricing and execution of our growth strategy. Underlying these full year results, we ended the year with nearly 23.5 million medical members, exceeding our previous year-end membership projections. We reported a 350 basis point year-over-year improvement in our government medical benefit ratio, driven by strong underwriting results in both our Medicare and Medicaid businesses. Our Large Group Commercial business had solid performance as aggregate commercial medical cost trends remain moderate, and we generated strong cash flow in 2015, which enabled us to return capital to shareholders through share repurchases and shareholder dividends and still build cash as we begin to position our balance sheet for the projected closing of the Humana acquisition in the second half of 2016. 
Based on our strong finish to 2015, this morning, we provided an initial 2016 operating EPS projection of at least $7.75. Consistent with past practice, this projection does not include any assumption in prior year's reserve development and represent significant growth over our 2015 operating EPS baseline of just over $7 per share. 
In a few moments, Shawn will discuss our 2015 results and 2016 guidance in greater detail, but first, I would like to provide a brief update on the Humana acquisition and discuss some of the operational highlights for the year. Beginning with the Humana acquisition. We continue to work diligently with the Department of Justice and with state regulators toward final approval of the transaction and continuing to advance our integration readiness plans. We have obtained 7 of the necessary state approvals required to close the transaction, and we believe we remain on track to close in the second half of 2016. 
Moving to operational highlights. The fourth quarter capped off an outstanding year for our Government business, which continues to be a key growth engine for Aetna. More specifically, we continued to expand our Medicare business where we grew membership by over 13% year-over-year consisting of: over 22% growth in Medicare Supplement membership, nearly 15% growth in Individual Medicare Advantage membership and 4% growth in our Group Medicare Advantage membership. This level of membership growth during the year in which we also improved our margin profile in this business is a testament to our focused execution of our strategy to deliver profitable growth. 
Additionally, we have another strong Medicare Advantage Annual Election Period and now project that we will grow our membership by over 6% in the first quarter of 2016, including 10% growth in our Individual Medicare Advantage membership. Our continued above-average growth directly speaks to the importance of our top-tier star ratings and continued investment in programs that our customers value. Finally, we also project that we will grow our PDP membership by over 450,000 members in the first quarter of 2016, strong growth in the business that generated strong solid margin performance for Aetna in 2015. 
Our Medicaid business also performed very well in 2015 despite a number of meaningful headwinds that included: exiting our Delaware Medicaid contract at the beginning of the year, absorbing a meaningful rate reset in our largest Medicaid contract and implementation delays in higher-than-projected opt-out rates in our various duals demonstration contracts. Despite these challenges, we grew Medicaid membership by 176,000 members, grew Medicaid revenues at double-digit rates and achieved underwriting margins that exceeded our initial 2015 projections. Looking forward, we continue to believe that the breadth of our platform will enable us to continue to drive long-term top and bottom line growth in our Medicaid businesses. 
Shifting to our Individual Commercial business. We ended 2015 with approximately 1 million Individual Commercial members both on- and off-exchange. Based on our most up-to-date view of open enrollment, we do not expect material growth in this business in the first quarter of 2016. Our Individual Commercial business ended the year with improved results over our most recent outlook. However, despite our improved finish, this business remained unprofitable in 2015, and we continue to have serious concerns about the sustainability of the public exchanges. Specifically, we remain concerned about: the overall stability of the risk pool, including enforcement of standards related to special election period enrollment where CMS has made some recent changes but more needs to be done; the lack of predictability and full transparency of the risk adjustment program, which is key to long-term program health, especially if the other 2 premium stabilization programs expire in 2017; and newly proposed CMS regulation on network adequacy and standardization of benefits that would limit our ability to offer affordable, innovative on-exchange products. 
We continue to work constructively with CMS and lawmakers to set this program on a more sustainable path and achieve the underlying goal of making health care more affordable and accessible. Finally, we made meaningful progress in furthering our consumer and provider engagement efforts during 2015 in that we: delivered approximately 37% of our medical cost through a value-based arrangement; and launched new consumer-centric products in select geographies, often backed by an ACO or value-based network agreement. The Humana acquisition will only accelerate our efforts to transform into a more consumer-centric company and achieve our mission to build a healthier world. 
In summary, we are pleased with our 2015 results, and as we enter 2016, we are focused on 2 main objectives: delivering on our 2016 operating EPS projections and executing a successful closing of the Humana acquisition. I want to thank our employees for their efforts in delivering yet another strong year for Aetna. I remain confident that: we have the right vision to be a leader in the changing health care marketplace, we can continue to execute on our differentiated strategy, we will close and successfully integrate the proposed Humana acquisition and we can achieve our 2016 operating earnings per share projection of at least $7.75. 
I will now turn the call over to Shawn, who will provide additional insight into our 2015 results and our 2016 outlook. Shawn?"
655542,322632286,924017,"Aetna Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 01, 2016",2016-02-01,"Earnings Calls","Aetna Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported full year 2015 operating earnings of $2.7 billion and operating earnings per share of $7.71, a 15% increase over 2014 and well in excess of our initial guidance for 2015. Aetna's oper",1551,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported full year 2015 operating earnings of $2.7 billion and operating earnings per share of $7.71, a 15% increase over 2014 and well in excess of our initial guidance for 2015. Aetna's operating results continued to be supported by strong cash flow and operating margins. 
I will begin with some comments on our full year 2015 performance. We ended the year with nearly 23.5 million medical members, approximately 200,000 members more than our previous projection, primarily driven by higher-than-projected Commercial Insured membership. We grew operating revenue to a record $60.3 billion, which included 9% premium growth in our Government businesses. Our full year commercial medical benefit ratio was 80.3%, a solid result that benefited from continued moderate medical cost trends and is consistent with our previous projections. Our full year government medical benefit ratio was 81.4%, an outstanding result that reflects the ongoing execution of our strategies to improve Medicare margins and continued strong performance in our Medicaid business. Finally, we generated $2.4 billion in net subsidiary dividends and returned $645 million to shareholders through share repurchases and shareholder dividends. 
Looking at our fourth quarter results. Our top line performance was steady for the quarter at $15 billion of operating revenue. Our pretax operating margin was 6% for the quarter, a 50 basis point year-over-year improvement. Our total health and medical benefit ratio was 81.9%, a 110 basis point year-over-year improvement. This strong result benefited from disciplined pricing, continued moderate medical cost trends and favorable reserve development. Our operating expense ratio was 21%, an 80 basis points increase over the fourth quarter of 2014 but consistent with our previous projections. 
From a balance sheet perspective, we remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves. We experienced favorable prior-period reserve development in the quarter across all of our core products, primarily attributable to third quarter 2015 dates of service. Our reserve growth exceeded our premium growth, and days and claims payable were 54.9 days at the end of the quarter, steady sequentially and up 5.7 days on a year-over-year basis. 
Turning to cash flow and capital. Operating cash flows remain strong. Our full year Health Care and Group Insurance operating cash flows were 1.6x operating earnings. Our ability to repurchase shares was constrained by the report proposed Humana acquisition, and we did not repurchase any shares during the fourth quarter. We did, however, distribute $87 million to our quarterly shareholder dividend. In summary, we are quite pleased with the strength of our full year results. 
I will now discuss the key drivers of our fourth quarter performance in greater detail. Beginning with our Commercial business. Our total Commercial Insured membership declined by 112,000 members during the quarter, largely driven by our Small Group and Individual businesses. Our commercial medical benefit ratio was 81.3% for the quarter, slightly better than our previous projections and a 70 basis point improvement over the same period last year. Our fourth quarter Commercial MBR was influenced by continued moderate medical cost trends, strong performance in our Large Group Commercial business and increased favorable prior-period reserve development, primarily related to our Individual Commercial business. Consistent with our Commercial MBR performance, Aetna's 2015 core commercial medical cost trend was approximately 6%, consistent with previous projections. 
With respect to the performance of our Individual Commercial business, we continue to take a prudent stance as we update our estimates related to certain ACA programs in advance of the 2016 reconciliation. The update of these estimates in the fourth quarter of 2015 resulted in better operating results than previously projected, driven by lower medical cost and the improved risk adjustment estimates. Based on these updated estimates, Aetna's Individual Commercial business generated full year 2015 pretax operating losses of approximately 3% to 4%, a disappointing result but one we are increasingly confident we can improve upon in 2016. 
Moving to our Government businesses. We grew by 114,000 members in the quarter led by: growth of 77,000 members in Medicaid, driven by in-state expansion and new program starts; and growth of 32,000 members in Medicare supplement. Our fourth quarter 2015 Government premiums grew to $5.8 billion, an 8% increase over the prior-year quarter. Our government medical benefit ratio was 82.6% in the quarter, a very strong result and a 180 basis point improvement over the same period last year, driven primarily by continued momentum in both our Medicare and Medicaid businesses. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Our financial position, capital structure and liquidity all continue to be very strong. At December 31, we had a debt-to-total-capitalization ratio of approximately 33%. 
Looking at cash and investments at the parent. We started the quarter with $180 million; net subsidiary dividends to the parent were $577 million; we paid a shareholder dividend of $87 million; and after other uses, we ended the quarter with approximately $420 million of cash at the parent. Our basic share count was 349.3 million at December 31. 
Shifting to 2016. This morning, we provided a stand-alone 2016 operating EPS projection of at least $7.75. As Mark mentioned earlier, our initial 2016 operating EPS projection excludes prior year's reserve development and assumes no share repurchases. As a result of the outperformance in 2015 relative to our previous projection, our view of Aetna's 2015 baseline operating EPS has improved to just over $7 per share. While there are many puts and takes in our initial outlook, our projected 2016 operating EPS growth off of our 2015 baseline reflects: margin improvement in our ACA-compliant businesses, which includes ACA-compliant Small Group and Individual businesses; operating earnings leverage as we continue to drive net productivity gains in excess of inflationary cost and appropriately position our infrastructure to be consistent with projected membership levels; and continued top line growth, particularly in our Government businesses. These opportunities are partially offset by: the full year impact of the Kentucky Medicaid rate reset, the impact of ASC customer losses on our Group Insurance business and the impact of the 2017 suspension of the health insurer fee as we begin to reflect this change in 2017 renewals with member months in 2016. 
Our 2016 operating EPS guidance is further influenced by the following drivers: based on our year-end 2015 medical membership results, we project that our first quarter 2016 membership will be in the range of 22.7 million to 22.8 million medical members. The primary drivers of this first quarter decline in medical membership are projected to be: Commercial AFC declines of approximately 750,000 members related to previously disclosed membership losses, including those associated with our assurance relationship; Group Commercial insurer declines of approximately 180,000 members, reflecting our continued pricing discipline, partially offset by continued growth in our Government businesses of approximately 170,000 members. We project 2016 total operating revenue to be approximately $62 billion. This top line projection is a result of continued strong growth in our Government businesses, partially offset by our group commercial blocks of business, reflecting our ongoing pricing discipline. We project our 2016 core commercial medical cost trend to be in the range of 6% to 7%, a 50 basis point increase over 2015 at the midpoint of this range. We project our full year total medical benefit ratio will be 81.6%, plus or minus 30 basis points. Our current view is that our full year operating expense ratio will be less than 18.5%, a result of continued productivity improvements and changes in mix. We project our pretax operating margin to be at least 8%, consistent with our high-single-digit target, with operating earnings of at least $2.7 billion. Finally, we expect that net subsidiary dividends for the year will be at least $2.3 billion and Aetna's parent cash balance will be at least $1.9 billion at year-end. We project that our 2016 weighted average diluted share count will be between 354 million and 355 million shares, reflecting our limited ability to repurchase shares as a result of the proposed Humana acquisition. Opportunities that could favorably impact our current 2016 operating EPS outlook include: the potential for 2015 reserves to develop favorably, and the potential for additional favorability as we complete the reconciliation of certain programs related to our ACA-compliant businesses in 2016. Potentially offsetting these opportunities are: the ever-present risk that medical cost trends could increase by more than we have projected, the risk that our projections of risk-adjusted revenue in our ACA-compliant businesses may not be achieved, and the risk that membership could be less than currently projected. Finally, to the extent that current analyst consensus for 2016 contemplates the same quarterly earnings progression Aetna experienced in 2015 especially as it pertains to the first quarter, we would remind investors that the first quarter of 2015 was materially impacted by prior year's reserve development, which we are not projecting to recur. 
In closing, I am very pleased with the strength of our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results, which meaningfully exceeded our initial projections despite the challenges we discussed earlier. As we begin 2016, the fundamentals of Aetna's business remains strong, and we rema committed and confident we can close the Humana transaction in the second half of 2016 and that we can achieve our 2016 operating EPS projection of at least $7.75.

It's something that's very important not only for the year-to-year financial elements and financial performance, but also sort of to continue to sort of generate the kinds of funds that we might need to invest in the business going forward and to put into potentially new categories of spending down the road. If you looked at the number in the bridge, that's probably on a net basis about 30 or 40 basis point improvement in the SG&A ratio. And obviously, it's something that we feel that we can achieve. On the Individual business, there's always a lot of parts, and what I would tell you is that if on the revenue side, which the biggest moving part tends to be the risk adjustment, that held steady actually. Our outlook improved a little bit on that one. Most of the improvement has been sort of in the underlying medical baseline, and as Mark mentioned, there's a number of things going on there. Just the claim development patterns when you think about reserve estimation and all of the membership churn and sort of the emerging seasonality patterns, we've sort of updated our estimates there, reinsurance, the cost-reduction payments, there's just a number of number of things there.

The changes made to date are necessary but not sufficient, and we need to do more over time to make this program stable and supportive. I mean, there are 2 ways this program can go. It can be a Medicaid plus kind of program with a high risk pool on a national basis versus a local basis to try and support a population of folks that are below 400% [ph] of the poverty level. Or we can shape the program to get a wider risk pool and a more stable risk pool that encourages healthier risk to come in and allows to have a broader range of population in the program.

And we're launching our own private exchange version, proprietary private exchange version in a number of markets. Small Group, this year, we started already, and we have some clients for '16 -- or actually '15, I'm sorry. And in '16, we have some clients that will be trying out our product, and we'll be launching a Medicare version of private exchange as well for '17. And so we see a lot of important in connecting the underlying networking cost structure of health care to the private exchange in order to provide the stability that employers need then the retail customers' needs in order to buy from us through their kind of model. And so that has not been proven yet, and so you're seeing it slow down to a degree and people start to help proof points that work. And so I think that is something that we need to be keeping our eye. Now if you look back at our guidance on the $10, there was not a lot of reliance on private exchange growth for that to happen. We see the government sector as a key driver of that growth opportunity as we continue to grow individual Medicare Advantage, continue to grow group, interestingly enough, year-over-year. And as we watch PDP, last year, profitable; this year, growth, in what we believe to be an appropriately priced segment. So we see the Government sector as a driver of that going forward.

This morning, Aetna reported full year 2015 operating EPS of $7.71, exceeding our previous projection and representing a record result for the company and year-over-year growth of 15%,",1119,"Good morning. Thank you, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. This morning, Aetna reported full year 2015 operating EPS of $7.71, exceeding our previous projection and representing a record result for the company and year-over-year growth of 15%, exceeding our long-term targeted range. 
Looking back on 2015, we generated record annual operating revenue of over $60 billion; achieved our high-single-digit operating margin target for the fifth consecutive year; achieved our targeted pretax operating margin in our Individual Medicare Advantage business 1 year ahead of our projections; exceeded our initial operating EPS projection by 12% despite headwinds in our ACA-related businesses and lower-than-projected share repurchases; increased our projected 2015 operating EPS 5x; and announced our agreement to acquire Humana, the largest transaction in the company's history. 
Aetna's strong 2015 results speak to our continued focus on disciplined pricing and execution of our growth strategy. Underlying these full year results, we ended the year with nearly 23.5 million medical members, exceeding our previous year-end membership projections. We reported a 350 basis point year-over-year improvement in our government medical benefit ratio, driven by strong underwriting results in both our Medicare and Medicaid businesses. Our Large Group Commercial business had solid performance as aggregate commercial medical cost trends remain moderate, and we generated strong cash flow in 2015, which enabled us to return capital to shareholders through share repurchases and shareholder dividends and still build cash as we begin to position our balance sheet for the projected closing of the Humana acquisition in the second half of 2016. 
Based on our strong finish to 2015, this morning, we provided an initial 2016 operating EPS projection of at least $7.75. Consistent with past practice, this projection does not include any assumption of prior year's reserve development and represent significant growth over our 2015 operating EPS baseline of just over $7 per share. 
In a few moments, Shawn will discuss our 2015 results and 2016 guidance in greater detail, but first, I would like to provide a brief update on the Humana acquisition and discuss some of the operational highlights for the year. Beginning with the Humana acquisition. We continue to work diligently with the Department of Justice and with state regulators toward final approval of the transaction and continue to advance our integration readiness plans. We have obtained 7 of the necessary state approvals required to close the transaction, and we believe we remain on track to close in the second half of 2016. 
Moving to operational highlights. The fourth quarter capped off an outstanding year for our Government business, which continues to be a key growth engine for Aetna. More specifically, we continued to expand our Medicare business where we grew membership by over 13% year-over-year consisting of: over 22% growth in Medicare Supplement membership, nearly 15% growth in Individual Medicare Advantage membership and 4% growth in our Group Medicare Advantage membership. This level of membership growth during the year in which we also improved our margin profile in this business is a testament to our focused execution of our strategy to deliver profitable growth. 
Additionally, we had another strong Medicare Advantage Annual Election Period and now project that we will grow our membership by over 6% in the first quarter of 2016, including 10% growth in our Individual Medicare Advantage membership. Our continued above-average growth directly speaks to the importance of our top-tier star ratings and continued investment in programs that our customers value. Finally, we also project that we will grow our PDP membership by over 450,000 members in the first quarter of 2016, strong growth in the business that generated strong solid margin performance for Aetna in 2015. 
Our Medicaid business also performed very well in 2015 despite a number of meaningful headwinds that included: exiting our Delaware Medicaid contract at the beginning of the year, absorbing a meaningful rate reset in our largest Medicaid contract and implementation delays in higher-than-projected opt-out rates in our various duals demonstration contracts. Despite these challenges, we grew Medicaid membership by 176,000 members, grew Medicaid revenues at double-digit rates and achieved underwriting margins that exceeded our initial 2015 projections. Looking forward, we continue to believe that the breadth of our platform will enable us to continue to drive long-term top and bottom line growth in our Medicaid businesses. 
Shifting to our Individual Commercial business. We ended 2015 with approximately 1 million Individual Commercial members both on- and off-exchange. Based on our most up-to-date view of open enrollment, we do not expect material growth in this business in the first quarter of 2016. Our Individual Commercial business ended the year with improved results over our most recent outlook. However, despite our improved finish, this business remained unprofitable in 2015, and we continue to have serious concerns about the sustainability of the public exchanges. Specifically, we remain concerned about: the overall stability of the risk pool, including enforcement of standards related to special election period enrollment where CMS has made some recent changes but more needs to be done; the lack of predictability and full transparency of the risk adjustment program, which is key to long-term program health, especially if the other 2 premium stabilization programs expire in 2017; and newly proposed CMS regulations on network adequacy and standardization of benefits that would limit our ability to offer affordable, innovative on-exchange products. 
We continue to work constructively with CMS and lawmakers to set this program on a more sustainable path and achieve the underlying goal of making health care more affordable and accessible. Finally, we made meaningful progress in furthering our consumer and provider engagement efforts during 2015 in that we: delivered approximately 37% of our medical cost through a value-based arrangement; and launched new consumer-centric products in select geographies, often backed by an ACO or value-based network agreement. The Humana acquisition will only accelerate our efforts to transform into a more consumer-centric company and achieve our mission to build a healthier world. 
In summary, we are pleased with our 2015 results, and as we enter 2016, we are focused on 2 main objectives: delivering on our 2016 operating EPS projections and executing a successful closing of the Humana acquisition. I want to thank our employees for their efforts in delivering yet another strong year for Aetna. I remain confident that: we have the right vision to be a leader in the changing health care marketplace, we can continue to execute on our differentiated strategy, we will close and successfully integrate the proposed Humana acquisition and we can achieve our 2016 operating earnings per share projection of at least $7.75. 
I will now turn the call over to Shawn, who will provide additional insight into our 2015 results and our 2016 outlook. Shawn?"

Earlier today, we reported full year 2015 operating earnings of $2.7 billion and operating earnings per share of $7.71, a 15% increase over 2014 and well in excess of our initial guidance for 2015. Aetna's oper",1547,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported full year 2015 operating earnings of $2.7 billion and operating earnings per share of $7.71, a 15% increase over 2014 and well in excess of our initial guidance for 2015. Aetna's operating results continued to be supported by strong cash flow and operating margins. 
I will begin with some comments on our full year 2015 performance. We ended the year with nearly 23.5 million medical members, approximately 200,000 members more than our previous projection, primarily driven by higher-than-projected Commercial Insured membership. We grew operating revenue to a record $60.3 billion, which included 9% premium growth in our Government businesses. Our full year commercial medical benefit ratio was 80.3%, a solid result that benefited from continued moderate medical cost trends and is consistent with our previous projections. Our full year government medical benefit ratio was 81.4%, an outstanding result that reflects the ongoing execution of our strategies to improve Medicare margins and continued strong performance in our Medicaid business. Finally, we generated $2.4 billion in net subsidiary dividends and returned $645 million to shareholders through share repurchases and shareholder dividends. 
Looking at our fourth quarter results. Our top line performance was steady for the quarter at $15 billion of operating revenue. Our pretax operating margin was 6% for the quarter, a 50 basis point year-over-year improvement. Our total health medical benefit ratio was 81.9%, a 110 basis point year-over-year improvement. This strong result benefited from disciplined pricing, continued moderate medical cost trends and favorable reserve development. Our operating expense ratio was 21%, an 80 basis point increase over the fourth quarter of 2014 but consistent with our previous projections. 
From a balance sheet perspective, we remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves. We experienced favorable prior-period reserve development in the quarter across all of our core products, primarily attributable to third quarter 2015 dates of service. Our reserve growth exceeded our premium growth, and days and claims payable were 54.9 days at the end of the quarter, steady sequentially and up 5.7 days on a year-over-year basis. 
Turning to cash flow and capital. Operating cash flows remain strong. Our full year Health Care and Group Insurance operating cash flows were 1.6x operating earnings. Our ability to repurchase shares was constrained by the proposed Humana acquisition, and we did not repurchase any shares during the quarter. We did, however, distribute $87 million through our quarterly shareholder dividend. In summary, we are quite pleased with the strength of our full year results. 
I will now discuss the key drivers of our fourth quarter performance in greater detail. Beginning with our Commercial business. Our total Commercial Insured membership declined by 112,000 members during the quarter, largely driven by our Small Group and Individual businesses. Our commercial medical benefit ratio was 81.3% for the quarter, slightly better than our previous projections and a 70 basis point improvement over the same period last year. Our fourth quarter Commercial MBR was influenced by continued moderate medical cost trends, strong performance in our Large Group Commercial business and increased favorable prior-period reserve development, primarily related to our Individual Commercial business. Consistent with our Commercial MBR performance, Aetna's 2015 core commercial medical cost trend was approximately 6%, consistent with previous projections. 
With respect to the performance of our Individual Commercial business, we continue to take a prudent stance as we update our estimates related to certain ACA programs in advance of the 2016 reconciliation. The update of these estimates in the fourth quarter of 2015 resulted in better operating results than previously projected, driven by lower medical cost and improved risk adjustment estimates. Based on these updated estimates, Aetna's Individual Commercial business generated full year 2015 pretax operating losses of approximately 3% to 4%, a disappointing result but one we are increasingly confident we can improve upon in 2016. 
Moving to our Government businesses. We grew by 114,000 members in the quarter led by: growth of 77,000 members in Medicaid, driven by in-state expansion and new program starts; and growth of 32,000 members in Medicare supplement. Our fourth quarter 2015 Government premiums grew to $5.8 billion, an 8% increase over the prior-year quarter. Our government medical benefit ratio was 82.6% in the quarter, a very strong result and a 180 basis point improvement over the same period last year, driven primarily by continued momentum in both our Medicare and Medicaid businesses. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Our financial position, capital structure and liquidity all continue to be very strong. At December 31, we had a debt-to-total-capitalization ratio of approximately 33%. 
Looking at cash and investments at the parent. We started the quarter with $180 million; net subsidiary dividends to the parent were $577 million; we paid a shareholder dividend of $87 million; and after other uses, we ended the quarter with approximately $420 million of cash at the parent. Our basic share count was 349.3 million at December 31. 
Shifting to 2016. This morning, we provided a stand-alone 2016 operating EPS projection of at least $7.75. As Mark mentioned earlier, our initial 2016 operating EPS projection excludes prior year's reserve development and assumes no share repurchases. As a result of the outperformance in 2015 relative to our previous projection, our view of Aetna's 2015 baseline operating EPS has improved to just over $7 per share. While there are many puts and takes in our initial outlook, our projected 2016 operating EPS growth off of our 2015 baseline reflects: margin improvement in our ACA-compliant businesses, which includes ACA-compliant Small Group and Individual businesses; operating earnings leverage as we continue to drive net productivity gains in excess of inflationary costs and appropriately position our infrastructure to be consistent with projected membership levels; and continued top line growth, particularly in our Government businesses. These opportunities are partially offset by: the full year impact of the Kentucky Medicaid rate reset, the impact of ASC customer losses on our Group Insurance business and the impact of the 2017 suspension of the health insurer fee as we begin to reflect this change in 2017 renewals with member months in 2016. 
Our 2016 operating EPS guidance is further influenced by the following drivers: based on our year-end 2015 medical membership results, we project that our first quarter 2016 membership will be in the range of 22.7 million to 22.8 million medical members. The primary drivers of this first quarter decline in medical membership are projected to be: Commercial AFC declines of approximately 750,000 members related to previously disclosed membership losses, including those associated with our assurance relationship; Group Commercial insurer declines of approximately 180,000 members, reflecting our continued pricing discipline, partially offset by continued growth in our Government businesses of approximately 170,000 members. We project 2016 total operating revenue to be approximately $62 billion. This top line projection is a result of continued strong growth in our Government businesses, partially offset by our group commercial blocks of business, reflecting our ongoing pricing discipline. We project our 2016 core commercial medical cost trend to be in the range of 6% to 7%, a 50 basis point increase over 2015 at the midpoint of this range. We project our full year total medical benefit ratio will be 81.6%, plus or minus 30 basis points. Our current view is that our full year operating expense ratio will be less than 18.5%, a result of continued productivity improvements and changes in mix. We project our pretax operating margin to be at least 8%, consistent with our high-single-digit target, with operating earnings of at least $2.7 billion. Finally, we expect that net subsidiary dividends for the year will be at least $2.3 billion and Aetna's parent cash balance will be at least $1.9 billion at year-end. We project that our 2016 weighted average diluted share count will be between 354 million and 355 million shares, reflecting our limited ability to repurchase shares as a result of the proposed Humana acquisition. Opportunities that could favorably impact our current 2016 operating EPS outlook include: the potential for 2015 reserves to develop favorably, and the potential for additional favorability as we complete the reconciliation of certain programs related to our ACA-compliant businesses in 2016. Potentially offsetting these opportunities are: the ever-present risk that medical cost trends could increase by more than we have projected, the risk that our projections of risk-adjusted revenue in our ACA-compliant businesses may not be achieved, and the risk that membership could be less than currently projected. Finally, to the extent that current analyst consensus for 2016 contemplates the same quarterly earnings progression Aetna experienced in 2015 especially as it pertains to the first quarter, we would remind investors that the first quarter of 2015 was materially impacted by prior year's reserve development, which we are not projecting to recur. 
In closing, I am very pleased with the strength of our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results, which meaningfully exceeded our initial projections despite the challenges we discussed earlier. As we begin 2016, the fundamentals of Aetna's business remains strong, and we remain committed and confident we can close the Humana transaction in the second half of 2016 and that we can achieve our 2016 operating EPS projection of at least $7.75.

And that's been our goal all along, and we continue to work toward that. And I think the last couple of years have demonstrated a better partnership in coming to conclusion around that. Part of the noise that you'll see in this as you had the earlier release from the actuaries, which is just one input, then you'll have the February notice, which will be another set of what I would call the smorgasbord of issues that we want to talk about as we come forward with an ultimate solution that will make itself readily apparent in April. I think the industry both through AHP and better Medicare alliance is focused on making sure that all the issues are understood, that everybody is sensitized to the impact on the beneficiary ultimately and we come to a conclusion that allows the program to continue to grow. Because we believe that Medicare Advantage in the long run at the right rate structure is the appropriate solution for solving some of our entitlement programs, particularly around the Medicare population."

And we're launching our own private exchange version, proprietary private exchange version in a number of markets. Small Group, this year, we started already, and we have some clients for '16 -- or actually '15, I'm sorry. And in '16, we have some clients that will be trying out our product, and we'll be launching a Medicare version of private exchange as well for '17. And so we see a lot of importance in connecting the underlying networking cost structure of health care to the private exchange in order to provide the stability that employers need and retail customers' needs in order to buy from us through that kind of model. And so that has not been proven yet, and so you're seeing it slow down to a degree until people start to put proof points out there that work. And so I think that is something that we need to be keeping our eye. Now if you look back at our guidance on the $10, there was not a lot of reliance on private exchange growth for that to happen. We see the Government sector as a key driver of that growth opportunity as we continue to grow individual Medicare Advantage, continue to grow group, interestingly enough, year-over-year. And as we watch PDP, last year, profitable; this year, growth, in what we believe to be an appropriately priced segment. So we see the Government sector as a driver of that going forward. And we believe that if we get the HIX right that, that will be a contributor going forward as well."

This morning, Aetna reported full year 2015 operating EPS of $7.71, exceeding our previous projection and representing a record result for the company and year-over-year growth of 15%,",1119,"Good morning. Thank you, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. This morning, Aetna reported full year 2015 operating EPS of $7.71, exceeding our previous projection and representing a record result for the company and year-over-year growth of 15%, exceeding our long-term targeted range. 
Looking back on 2015, we generated record annual operating revenue of over $60 billion; achieved our high-single-digit operating margin target for the fifth consecutive year; achieved our targeted pretax operating margin in our Individual Medicare Advantage business 1 year ahead of our projections; exceeded our initial operating EPS projection by 12% despite headwinds in our ACA-related businesses and lower-than-projected share repurchases; increased our projected 2015 operating EPS 5x; and announced our agreement to acquire Humana, the largest transaction in the company's history. 
Aetna's strong 2015 results speak to our continued focus on disciplined pricing and execution of our growth strategy. Underlying these full year results, we ended the year with nearly 23.5 million medical members, exceeding our previous year-end membership projections. We reported a 350 basis point year-over-year improvement in our government medical benefit ratio, driven by strong underwriting results in both our Medicare and Medicaid businesses. Our Large Group Commercial business had solid performance as aggregate commercial medical cost trends remain moderate, and we generated strong cash flow in 2015, which enabled us to return capital to shareholders through share repurchases and shareholder dividends and still build cash as we begin to position our balance sheet for the projected closing of the Humana acquisition in the second half of 2016. 
Based on our strong finish to 2015, this morning, we provided an initial 2016 operating EPS projection of at least $7.75. Consistent with past practice, this projection does not include any assumption of prior year's reserve development and represents significant growth over our 2015 operating EPS baseline of just over $7 per share. 
In a few moments, Shawn will discuss our 2015 results and 2016 guidance in greater detail, but first, I would like to provide a brief update on the Humana acquisition and discuss some of the operational highlights for the year. Beginning with the Humana acquisition. We continue to work diligently with the Department of Justice and with state regulators toward final approval of the transaction and continue to advance our integration readiness plans. We have obtained 7 of the necessary state approvals required to close the transaction, and we believe we remain on track to close in the second half of 2016. 
Moving to operational highlights. The fourth quarter capped off an outstanding year for our Government business, which continues to be a key growth engine for Aetna. More specifically, we continued to expand our Medicare business where we grew membership by over 13% year-over-year consisting of: over 22% growth in Medicare Supplement membership, nearly 15% growth in Individual Medicare Advantage membership and 4% growth in our Group Medicare Advantage membership. This level of membership growth during the year in which we also improved our margin profile in this business is a testament to our focused execution of our strategy to deliver profitable growth. 
Additionally, we had another strong Medicare Advantage Annual Election Period and now project that we will grow our membership by over 6% in the first quarter of 2016, including 10% growth in our Individual Medicare Advantage membership. Our continued above-average growth directly speaks to the importance of our top-tier star ratings and continued investment in programs that our customers value. Finally, we also project that we will grow our PDP membership by over 450,000 members in the first quarter of 2016, strong growth in the business that generated strong solid margin performance for Aetna in 2015. 
Our Medicaid business also performed very well in 2015 despite a number of meaningful headwinds that included: exiting our Delaware Medicaid contract at the beginning of the year, absorbing a meaningful rate reset in our largest Medicaid contract and implementation delays in higher-than-projected opt-out rates in our various duals demonstration contracts. Despite these challenges, we grew Medicaid membership by 176,000 members, grew Medicaid revenues at double-digit rates and achieved underwriting margins that exceeded our initial 2015 projections. Looking forward, we continue to believe that the breadth of our platform will enable us to continue to drive long-term top and bottom line growth in our Medicaid businesses. 
Shifting to our Individual Commercial business. We ended 2015 with approximately 1 million Individual Commercial members both on- and off-exchange. Based on our most up-to-date view of open enrollment, we do not expect material growth in this business in the first quarter of 2016. Our Individual Commercial business ended the year with improved results over our most recent outlook. However, despite our improved finish, this business remained unprofitable in 2015, and we continue to have serious concerns about the sustainability of the public exchanges. Specifically, we remain concerned about: the overall stability of the risk pool, including enforcement of standards related to special election period enrollment where CMS has made some recent changes but more needs to be done; the lack of predictability and full transparency of the risk adjustment program, which is key to long-term program health, especially as the other 2 premium stabilization programs expire in 2017; and newly proposed CMS regulations on network adequacy and standardization of benefits that would limit our ability to offer affordable, innovative on-exchange products. 
We continue to work constructively with CMS and lawmakers to set this program on a more sustainable path and achieve the underlying goal of making health care more affordable and accessible. Finally, we made meaningful progress in furthering our consumer and provider engagement efforts during 2015 in that we delivered approximately 37% of our medical cost through a value-based arrangement and launched new consumer-centric products in select geographies, often backed by an ACO or value-based network agreement. The Humana acquisition will only accelerate our efforts to transform into a more consumer-centric company and achieve our mission to build a healthier world. 
In summary, we are pleased with our 2015 results, and as we enter 2016, we are focused on 2 main objectives: delivering on our 2016 operating EPS projections and executing a successful closing of the Humana acquisition. I want to thank our employees for their efforts in delivering yet another strong year for Aetna. I remain confident that we have the right vision to be a leader in the changing health care marketplace; we can continue to execute on our differentiated strategy; we will close and successfully integrate the proposed Humana acquisition and we can achieve our 2016 operating earnings per share projection of at least $7.75. 
I will now turn the call over to Shawn, who will provide additional insight into our 2015 results and our 2016 outlook. Shawn?"

Earlier today, we reported full year 2015 operating earnings of $2.7 billion and operating earnings per share of $7.71, a 15% increase over 2014 and well in excess of our initial guidance for 2015. Aetna's operating results continued to be supported by strong cash flow and operating margins. 
I will begin with some comments on our full year 2015 performance. We ended the year with nearly 23.5 million medical members, approximately 200,000 members more than our previous projection, primarily driven by higher-than-projected Commercial Insured membership. We grew operating revenue to a record $60.3 billion, which included 9% premium growth in our Government businesses. Our full year commercial medical benefit ratio was 80.3%, a solid result that benefited from continued moderate medical cost trends and is consistent with our previous projections. Our full year government medical benefit ratio was 81.4%, an outstanding result that reflects the ongoing execution of our strategies to improve Medicare margins and continued strong performance in our Medicaid business. Finally, we generated $2.4 billion in net subsidiary dividends and returned $645 million to shareholders through share repurchases and shareholder dividends. 
Looking at our fourth quarter results. Our top line performance was steady for the quarter at $15 billion of operating revenue. Our pretax operating margin was 6% for the quarter, a 50 basis point year-over-year improvement. Our total health medical benefit ratio was 81.9%, a 110 basis point year-over-year improvement. This strong result benefited from disciplined pricing, continued moderate medical cost trends and favorable reserve development. Our operating expense ratio was 21%, an 80 basis point increase over the fourth quarter of 2014 but consistent with our previous projections. 
From a balance sheet perspective, we remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves. We experienced favorable prior-period reserve development in the quarter across all of our core products, primarily attributable to third quarter 2015 dates of service. Our reserve growth exceeded our premium growth, and days and claims payable were 54.9 days at the end of the quarter, steady sequentially and up 5.7 days on a year-over-year basis. 
Turning to cash flow and capital. Operating cash flows remain strong. Our full year Health Care and Group Insurance operating cash flows were 1.6x operating earnings. Our ability to repurchase shares was constrained by the proposed Humana acquisition, and we did not repurchase any shares during the quarter. We did, however, distribute $87 million through our quarterly shareholder dividend. In summary, we are quite pleased with the strength of our full year results. 
I will now discuss the key drivers of our fourth quarter performance in greater detail. Beginning with our Commercial business. Our total Commercial Insured membership declined by 112,000 members during the quarter, largely driven by our Small Group and Individual businesses. Our commercial medical benefit ratio was 81.3% for the quarter, slightly better than our previous projections and a 70 basis point improvement over the same period last year. Our fourth quarter Commercial MBR was influenced by continued moderate medical cost trends, strong performance in our Large Group Commercial business and increased favorable prior-period reserve development, primarily related to our Individual Commercial business. Consistent with our Commercial MBR performance, Aetna's 2015 core commercial medical cost trend was approximately 6%, consistent with previous projections. 
With respect to the performance of our Individual Commercial business, we continue to take a prudent stance as we update our estimates related to certain ACA programs in advance of the 2016 reconciliation. The update of these estimates in the fourth quarter of 2015 resulted in better operating results than previously projected, driven by lower medical cost and improved risk adjustment estimates. Based on these updated estimates, Aetna's Individual Commercial business generated full year 2015 pretax operating losses of approximately 3% to 4%, a disappointing result but one we are increasingly confident we can improve upon in 2016. 
Moving to our Government businesses. We grew by 114,000 members in the quarter led by growth of 77,000 members in Medicaid, driven by in-state expansion and new program starts and growth of 32,000 members in Medicare supplement. Our fourth quarter 2015 Government premiums grew to $5.8 billion, an 8% increase over the prior-year quarter. Our government medical benefit ratio was 82.6% in the quarter, a very strong result and a 180 basis point improvement over the same period last year, driven primarily by continued momentum in both our Medicare and Medicaid businesses. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Our financial position, capital structure and liquidity all continue to be very strong. At December 31, we had a debt-to-total-capitalization ratio of approximately 33%. 
Looking at cash and investments at the parent. We started the quarter with $180 million; net subsidiary dividends to the parent were $577 million; we paid a shareholder dividend of $87 million and after other uses, we ended the quarter with approximately $420 million of cash at the parent. Our basic share count was 349.3 million at December 31. 
Shifting to 2016. This morning, we provided a stand-alone 2016 operating EPS projection of at least $7.75. As Mark mentioned earlier, our initial 2016 operating EPS projection excludes prior year's reserve development and assumes no share repurchases. As a result of the outperformance in 2015 relative to our previous projection, our view of Aetna's 2015 baseline operating EPS has improved to just over $7 per share. While there are many puts and takes in our initial outlook, our projected 2016 operating EPS growth off of our 2015 baseline reflects: margin improvement in our ACA-compliant businesses, which includes ACA-compliant Small Group and Individual businesses; operating earnings leverage as we continue to drive net productivity gains in excess of inflationary costs and appropriately position our infrastructure to be consistent with projected membership levels; and continued top line growth, particularly in our Government businesses. These opportunities are partially offset by: the full year impact of the Kentucky Medicaid rate reset, the impact of ASC customer losses on our Group Insurance business and the impact of the 2017 suspension of the health insurer fee as we begin to reflect this change in 2017 renewals with member months in 2016. 
Our 2016 operating EPS guidance is further influenced by the following drivers: based on our year-end 2015 medical membership results, we project that our first quarter 2016 membership will be in the range of 22.7 million to 22.8 million medical members. The primary drivers of this first quarter decline in medical membership are projected to be: Commercial ASC declines of approximately 750,000 members related to previously disclosed membership losses, including those associated with our assurance relationship; Group Commercial insurer declines of approximately 180,000 members, reflecting our continued pricing discipline, partially offset by continued growth in our Government businesses of approximately 170,000 members. We project 2016 total operating revenue to be approximately $62 billion. This top line projection is a result of continued strong growth in our Government businesses, partially offset by our group commercial blocks of business, reflecting our ongoing pricing discipline. 
We project our 2016 core commercial medical cost trend to be in the range of 6% to 7%, a 50 basis point increase over 2015 at the midpoint of this range. We project our full year total medical benefit ratio will be 81.6%, plus or minus 30 basis points. Our current view is that our full year operating expense ratio will be less than 18.5%, a result of continued productivity improvements and changes in mix. We project our pretax operating margin to be at least 8%, consistent with our high-single-digit target, with operating earnings of at least $2.7 billion. Finally, we expect that net subsidiary dividends for the year will be at least $2.3 billion and Aetna's parent cash balance will be at least $1.9 billion at year-end. 
We project that our 2016 weighted average diluted share count will be between 354 million and 355 million shares, reflecting our limited ability to repurchase shares as a result of the proposed Humana acquisition. Opportunities that could favorably impact our current 2016 operating EPS outlook include: the potential for 2015 reserves to develop favorably, and the potential for additional favorability as we complete the reconciliation of certain programs related to our ACA-compliant businesses in 2016. 
Potentially offsetting these opportunities are: the ever-present risk that medical cost trends could increase by more than we have projected, the risk that our projections of risk-adjusted revenue in our ACA-compliant businesses may not be achieved, and the risk that membership could be less than currently projected. Finally, to the extent that current analyst consensus for 2016 contemplates the same quarterly earnings progression Aetna experienced in 2015 especially as it pertains to the first quarter, we would remind investors that the first quarter of 2015 was materially impacted by prior year's reserve development, which we are not projecting to recur. 
In closing, I am very pleased with the strength of our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results, which meaningfully exceeded our initial projections despite the challenges we discussed earlier. As we begin 2016, the fundamentals of Aetna's business remains strong, and we remain committed and confident we can close the Humana transaction in the second half of 2016 and that we can achieve our 2016 operating EPS projection of at least $7.75.

And then you talk about positive -- separately positive prior-year development impacting the Individual business.

And we're launching our own private exchange version, proprietary private exchange version in a number of markets. Small Group, this year, we started already, and we have some clients for '16 -- or actually '15, I'm sorry. And in '16, we have some clients that will be trying out our product, and we'll be launching a Medicare version of private exchange as well for '17. And so we see a lot of importance in connecting the underlying networking cost structure of health care to the private exchange in order to provide the stability that employers need and retail customers' needs in order to buy from us through that kind of model. And so that has not been proven yet, and so you're seeing it slow down to a degree until people start to put proof points out there that work. And so I think that is something that we need to be keeping our eye. Now if you look back at our guidance on the $10, there was not a lot of reliance on private exchange growth for that to happen. We see the Government sector as a key driver of that growth opportunity as we continue to grow individual Medicare Advantage, continue to grow group, interestingly enough, year-over-year. And as we watch PDP, last year, profitable; this year, growth, in what we believe to be an appropriately priced segment. So we see the Government sector as a driver of that going forward. And we believe that if we get the HIX right that, that will be a contributor going forward as well."

This morning, Aetna reported full year 2015 operating EPS of $7.71, exceeding our previous projection and representing a record result for the company and year-over-year growth of 15%,",1119,"Good morning. Thank you, Tom, and thank you all for joining us today. This morning, Aetna reported full year 2015 operating EPS of $7.71, exceeding our previous projection and representing a record result for the company and year-over-year growth of 15%, exceeding our long-term targeted range. 
Looking back on 2015, we generated record annual operating revenue of over $60 billion; achieved our high-single-digit operating margin target for the fifth consecutive year; achieved our targeted pretax operating margin in our Individual Medicare Advantage business 1 year ahead of our projections; exceeded our initial operating EPS projection by 12% despite headwinds in our ACA-related businesses and lower-than-projected share repurchases; increased our projected 2015 operating EPS 5x; and announced our agreement to acquire Humana, the largest transaction in the company's history. 
Aetna's strong 2015 results speak to our continued focus on disciplined pricing and execution of our growth strategy. Underlying these full year results, we ended the year with nearly 23.5 million medical members, exceeding our previous year-end membership projections. We reported a 350 basis point year-over-year improvement in our government medical benefit ratio, driven by strong underwriting results in both our Medicare and Medicaid businesses. Our Large Group Commercial business had solid performance as aggregate commercial medical cost trends remain moderate, and we generated strong cash flow in 2015, which enabled us to return capital to shareholders through share repurchases and shareholder dividends and still build cash as we begin to position our balance sheet for the projected closing of the Humana acquisition in the second half of 2016. 
Based on our strong finish to 2015, this morning, we provided an initial 2016 operating EPS projection of at least $7.75. Consistent with past practice, this projection does not include any assumption of prior year's reserve development and represents significant growth over our 2015 operating EPS baseline of just over $7 per share. 
In a few moments, Shawn will discuss our 2015 results and 2016 guidance in greater detail, but first, I would like to provide a brief update on the Humana acquisition and discuss some of the operational highlights for the year. Beginning with the Humana acquisition. We continue to work diligently with the Department of Justice and with state regulators toward final approval of the transaction and continue to advance our integration readiness plans. We have obtained 7 of the necessary state approvals required to close the transaction, and we believe we remain on track to close in the second half of 2016. 
Moving to operational highlights. The fourth quarter capped off an outstanding year for our Government business, which continues to be a key growth engine for Aetna. More specifically, we continued to expand our Medicare business where we grew membership by over 13% year-over-year consisting of: over 22% growth in Medicare Supplement membership, nearly 15% growth in Individual Medicare Advantage membership and 4% growth in our Group Medicare Advantage membership. This level of membership growth during the year in which we also improved our margin profile in this business is a testament to our focused execution of our strategy to deliver profitable growth. 
Additionally, we had another strong Medicare Advantage Annual Election Period and now project that we will grow our membership by over 6% in the first quarter of 2016, including 10% growth in our Individual Medicare Advantage membership. Our continued above-average growth directly speaks to the importance of our top-tier star ratings and continued investment in programs that our customers value. Finally, we also project that we will grow our PDP membership by over 450,000 members in the first quarter of 2016, strong growth in the business that generated strong solid margin performance for Aetna in 2015. 
Our Medicaid business also performed very well in 2015 despite a number of meaningful headwinds that included: exiting our Delaware Medicaid contract at the beginning of the year, absorbing a meaningful rate reset in our largest Medicaid contract and implementation delays in higher-than-projected opt-out rates in our various duals demonstration contracts. Despite these challenges, we grew Medicaid membership by 176,000 members, grew Medicaid revenues at double-digit rates and achieved underwriting margins that exceeded our initial 2015 projections. Looking forward, we continue to believe that the breadth of our platform will enable us to continue to drive long-term top and bottom line growth in our Medicaid businesses. 
Shifting to our Individual Commercial business. We ended 2015 with approximately 1 million Individual Commercial members both on- and off-exchange. Based on our most up-to-date view of open enrollment, we do not expect material growth in this business in the first quarter of 2016. Our Individual Commercial business ended the year with improved results over our most recent outlook. However, despite our improved finish, this business remained unprofitable in 2015, and we continue to have serious concerns about the sustainability of the public exchanges. Specifically, we remain concerned about: the overall stability of the risk pool, including enforcement of standards related to special election period enrollment where CMS has made some recent changes but more needs to be done; the lack of predictability and full transparency of the risk adjustment program, which is key to long-term program health, especially as the other 2 premium stabilization programs expire in 2017; and newly proposed CMS regulations on network adequacy and standardization of benefits that would limit our ability to offer affordable, innovative on-exchange products. 
We continue to work constructively with CMS and lawmakers to set this program on a more sustainable path and achieve the underlying goal of making health care more affordable and accessible. Finally, we made meaningful progress in furthering our consumer and provider engagement efforts during 2015 in that we delivered approximately 37% of our medical cost through a value-based arrangement and launched new consumer-centric products in select geographies, often backed by an ACO or value-based network agreement. The Humana acquisition will only accelerate our efforts to transform into a more consumer-centric company and achieve our mission to build a healthier world. 
In summary, we are pleased with our 2015 results, and as we enter 2016, we are focused on 2 main objectives: delivering on our 2016 operating EPS projections and executing a successful closing of the Humana acquisition. I want to thank our employees for their efforts in delivering yet another strong year for Aetna. I remain confident that we have the right vision to be a leader in the changing health care marketplace; we can continue to execute on our differentiated strategy; we will close and successfully integrate the proposed Humana acquisition and we can achieve our 2016 operating earnings per share projection of at least $7.75. 
I will now turn the call over to Shawn, who will provide additional insight into our 2015 results and our 2016 outlook. Shawn?"
655542,322632286,924339,"Aetna Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 01, 2016",2016-02-01,"Earnings Calls","Aetna Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone.

Aetna's oper",1547,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported full year 2015 operating earnings of $2.7 billion and operating earnings per share of $7.71, a 15% increase over 2014 and well in excess of our initial guidance for 2015. Aetna's operating results continued to be supported by strong cash flow and operating margins. 
I will begin with some comments on our full year 2015 performance. We ended the year with nearly 23.5 million medical members, approximately 200,000 members more than our previous projection, primarily driven by higher-than-projected Commercial Insured membership. We grew operating revenue to a record $60.3 billion, which included 9% premium growth in our Government businesses. Our full year commercial medical benefit ratio was 80.3%, a solid result that benefited from continued moderate medical cost trends and is consistent with our previous projections. Our full year government medical benefit ratio was 81.4%, an outstanding result that reflects the ongoing execution of our strategies to improve Medicare margins and continued strong performance in our Medicaid business. Finally, we generated $2.4 billion in net subsidiary dividends and returned $645 million to shareholders through share repurchases and shareholder dividends. 
Looking at our fourth quarter results. Our top line performance was steady for the quarter at $15 billion of operating revenue. Our pretax operating margin was 6% for the quarter, a 50 basis point year-over-year improvement. Our total health medical benefit ratio was 81.9%, a 110 basis point year-over-year improvement. This strong result benefited from disciplined pricing, continued moderate medical cost trends and favorable reserve development. Our operating expense ratio was 21%, an 80 basis point increase over the fourth quarter of 2014 but consistent with our previous projections. 
From a balance sheet perspective, we remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves. We experienced favorable prior-period reserve development in the quarter across all of our core products, primarily attributable to third quarter 2015 dates of service. Our reserve growth exceeded our premium growth, and days and claims payable were 54.9 days at the end of the quarter, steady sequentially and up 5.7 days on a year-over-year basis. 
Turning to cash flow and capital. Operating cash flows remain strong. Our full year Health Care and Group Insurance operating cash flows were 1.6x operating earnings. Our ability to repurchase shares was constrained by the proposed Humana acquisition, and we did not repurchase any shares during the quarter. We did, however, distribute $87 million through our quarterly shareholder dividend. In summary, we are quite pleased with the strength of our full year results. 
I will now discuss the key drivers of our fourth quarter performance in greater detail. Beginning with our Commercial business. Our total Commercial Insured membership declined by 112,000 members during the quarter, largely driven by our Small Group and Individual businesses. Our commercial medical benefit ratio was 81.3% for the quarter, slightly better than our previous projections and a 70 basis point improvement over the same period last year. Our fourth quarter Commercial MBR was influenced by continued moderate medical cost trends, strong performance in our Large Group Commercial business and increased favorable prior-period reserve development, primarily related to our Individual Commercial business. Consistent with our Commercial MBR performance, Aetna's 2015 core commercial medical cost trend was approximately 6%, consistent with previous projections. 
With respect to the performance of our Individual Commercial business, we continue to take a prudent stance as we update our estimates related to certain ACA programs in advance of the 2016 reconciliation. The update of these estimates in the fourth quarter of 2015 resulted in better operating results than previously projected, driven by lower medical cost and improved risk adjustment estimates. Based on these updated estimates, Aetna's Individual Commercial business generated full year 2015 pretax operating losses of approximately 3% to 4%, a disappointing result but one we are increasingly confident we can improve upon in 2016. 
Moving to our Government businesses. We grew by 114,000 members in the quarter led by growth of 77,000 members in Medicaid, driven by in-state expansion and new program starts and growth of 32,000 members in Medicare supplement. Our fourth quarter 2015 Government premiums grew to $5.8 billion, an 8% increase over the prior-year quarter. Our government medical benefit ratio was 82.6% in the quarter, a very strong result and a 180 basis point improvement over the same period last year, driven primarily by continued momentum in both our Medicare and Medicaid businesses. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Our financial position, capital structure and liquidity all continue to be very strong. At December 31, we had a debt-to-total-capitalization ratio of approximately 33%. 
Looking at cash and investments at the parent. We started the quarter with $180 million; net subsidiary dividends to the parent were $577 million; we paid a shareholder dividend of $87 million and after other uses, we ended the quarter with approximately $420 million of cash at the parent. Our basic share count was 349.3 million at December 31. 
Shifting to 2016. This morning, we provided a stand-alone 2016 operating EPS projection of at least $7.75. As Mark mentioned earlier, our initial 2016 operating EPS projection excludes prior year's reserve development and assumes no share repurchases. As a result of the outperformance in 2015 relative to our previous projection, our view of Aetna's 2015 baseline operating EPS has improved to just over $7 per share. While there are many puts and takes in our initial outlook, our projected 2016 operating EPS growth off of our 2015 baseline reflects: margin improvement in our ACA-compliant businesses, which includes ACA-compliant Small Group and Individual businesses; operating earnings leverage as we continue to drive net productivity gains in excess of inflationary costs and appropriately position our infrastructure to be consistent with projected membership levels; and continued top line growth, particularly in our Government businesses. These opportunities are partially offset by: the full year impact of the Kentucky Medicaid rate reset, the impact of ASC customer losses on our Group Insurance business and the impact of the 2017 suspension of the health insurer fee as we begin to reflect this change in 2017 renewals with member months in 2016. 
Our 2016 operating EPS guidance is further influenced by the following drivers: based on our year-end 2015 medical membership results, we project that our first quarter 2016 membership will be in the range of 22.7 million to 22.8 million medical members. The primary drivers of this first quarter decline in medical membership are projected to be: Commercial ASC declines of approximately 750,000 members related to previously disclosed membership losses, including those associated with our assurance relationship; Group Commercial insurer declines of approximately 180,000 members, reflecting our continued pricing discipline, partially offset by continued growth in our Government businesses of approximately 170,000 members. We project 2016 total operating revenue to be approximately $62 billion. This top line projection is a result of continued strong growth in our Government businesses, partially offset by our group commercial blocks of business, reflecting our ongoing pricing discipline. 
We project our 2016 core commercial medical cost trend to be in the range of 6% to 7%, a 50 basis point increase over 2015 at the midpoint of this range. We project our full year total medical benefit ratio will be 81.6%, plus or minus 30 basis points. Our current view is that our full year operating expense ratio will be less than 18.5%, a result of continued productivity improvements and changes in mix. We project our pretax operating margin to be at least 8%, consistent with our high-single-digit target, with operating earnings of at least $2.7 billion. Finally, we expect that net subsidiary dividends for the year will be at least $2.3 billion and Aetna's parent cash balance will be at least $1.9 billion at year-end. 
We project that our 2016 weighted average diluted share count will be between 354 million and 355 million shares, reflecting our limited ability to repurchase shares as a result of the proposed Humana acquisition. Opportunities that could favorably impact our current 2016 operating EPS outlook include: the potential for 2015 reserves to develop favorably, and the potential for additional favorability as we complete the reconciliation of certain programs related to our ACA-compliant businesses in 2016. 
Potentially offsetting these opportunities are: the ever-present risk that medical cost trends could increase by more than we have projected, the risk that our projections of risk-adjusted revenue in our ACA-compliant businesses may not be achieved, and the risk that membership could be less than currently projected. Finally, to the extent that current analyst consensus for 2016 contemplates the same quarterly earnings progression Aetna experienced in 2015 especially as it pertains to the first quarter, we would remind investors that the first quarter of 2015 was materially impacted by prior year's reserve development, which we are not projecting to recur. 
In closing, I am very pleased with the strength of our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results, which meaningfully exceeded our initial projections despite the challenges we discussed earlier. As we begin 2016, the fundamentals of Aetna's business remains strong, and we remain committed and confident we can close the Humana transaction in the second half of 2016 and that we can achieve our 2016 operating EPS projection of at least $7.75.

It can be a Medicaid plus kind of program with a high risk pool on a national basis versus a local basis to try and support a population of folks that are below 400% [ph] of the Federal poverty level.

And we're launching our own private exchange version, proprietary private exchange version in a number of markets. Small Group, this year, we started already, and we have some clients for '16 -- or actually '15, I'm sorry. And in '16, we have some clients that will be trying out our product, and we'll be launching a Medicare version of private exchange as well for '17. And so we see a lot of importance in connecting the underlying networking cost structure of health care to the private exchange in order to provide the stability that employers need and retail customers' needs in order to buy from us through that kind of model. And so that has not been proven yet, and so you're seeing it slow down to a degree until people start to put proof points out there that work. And so I think that is something that we need to be keeping our eye. Now if you look back at our guidance on the $10, there was not a lot of reliance on private exchange growth for that to happen. We see the Government sector as a key driver of that growth opportunity as we continue to grow individual Medicare Advantage, continue to grow group, interestingly enough, year-over-year. And as we watch PDP, last year, profitable; this year, growth, in what we believe to be an appropriately priced segment. So we see the Government sector as a driver of that going forward. And we believe that if we get the HIX right that, that will be a contributor going forward as well."

Thank you, Joe, and thank you all for joining us today. This morning, Aetna reported first quarter operating earnings of $2.30 per share, a good start to the year and a continuation of the strong momentum from 2015 where we generated record annual operating revenue and operating earnings. Underlying our first quarter performance, we exceeded our previous membership projections and in the quarter with approximately 23 million medical members. We grew operating revenue to a quarterly record of $15.7 billion. We achieved pretax operating margins at the high end of our targeted range, and we generated approximately $1.8 billion in operating cash flow. 
Given our strong start to 2016, today, we made several adjustments to our full year 2016 guidance. We established a year-end medical membership projection of approximately 23 million members. We now project we will generate up to $63 billion of operating revenue, up from our previous projection of approximately $62 billion. And we increased our operating EPS projection to a range of $7.90 to $8.10 per share, up from our previous projection of at least $7.75. 
In a few moments, Shawn will discuss our first quarter results and updated 2016 guidance in greater detail. But first, I would like to provide a brief update on the Humana acquisition and discuss some of the operational highlights for the quarter. 
Beginning with the Humana acquisition. Our integration teams are thoughtfully planning for a combined organization that delivers on our synergy and accretion goals and maximizes the transformational combination. We continued to cooperate with the Department of Justice and work with state regulators and now have approvals in 6 states remaining. Based on our progress to date, we believe we remain on track to close in the second half of 2016. 
Moving on to first quarter operational highlights. We had another strong quarter of growth in our Medicare business with membership growth across all products. Our compelling product design and industry-leading star ratings continue to resonate with Medicare consumers as evidenced by our 9% sequential Individual and A membership growth, which once again exceeded overall Medicare Advantage program growth. In total, including Medicare Supplement, we have grown to serve 127,000 additional Medicare medical members in the first quarter, capping another strong annual election period for the company. 
Medicare Advantage remains an important growth lever for Aetna, and we are encouraged by the relative stability and funding for the 2017 plan year. However, we are concerned with a few of the changes outlined in the 2017 final rate notice, including the rate cuts to the employer group waiver program and the potential disruption and benefits for the millions of beneficiaries who rely on this important programs. This is particularly concerning in 2018 when the rate cuts are fully phased in. We will continue to work with CMS to refine the employer group payment methodology for 2018 to appropriately reflect the differences between employer group and individual plans. Additionally, CMS changes to the MA star ratings program and risk adjustment mechanism for dual-eligible beneficiaries add unnecessary complexity to star ratings and instability in the risk adjustment program. Despite the challenges posed by the group MA payment changes, we remain committed to providing value to our employer customers by delivering high-quality affordable options for their retirees. 
Continuing on with our Government business. Our Medicaid franchise delivered another quarter of solid revenue growth and underwriting margin performance. Aetna now serves over 2.3 million Medicaid members, an increase of nearly 230,000 from the same period a year ago. This steady growth has been driven by a combination of new contract wins, county expansions in existing states and ACA-related expansion membership. Looking to the future, we are confident that Aetna is well positioned to take advantage of the strong growth dynamics of the Medicaid business as more states seek to partner with the private sector to manage the health of the Medicaid beneficiaries. 
Let me take a moment to discuss public exchanges in our Individual business. From a regulatory perspective, we welcome the efforts of CMS to work with the industry to stabilize the individual public exchange program. While we are encouraged by these regulatory efforts, there is still much work to be done to ensure the long-term future of this program. As we entered the third year of the public exchange program, we are committed to working constructively with the administration and the lawmakers to find solutions that can improve this program, stabilize the risk pool and expand product flexibility, all with the goal of creating a sustainable program that makes health care more affordable and accessible for all consumers. 
Turning to our first quarter Individual Commercial results. We ended the first quarter with approximately 1.2 million total individual members, exceeding our previous membership projection. The overall demographic composition of our membership is largely consistent with last year and our expectations. While it's still early, we are encouraged by our year-to-date performance and believe we remain on track to achieve our 2016 operating margin improvement goals in these products. 
Finally, our stated mission is to create a healthier world. Our strategy to achieve this mission in part involves working to transform the health care system model to one in which hospitals and doctors are rewarded for delivering real value to patients and consumers. Our differentiated approach focuses on meeting providers where they are in terms of their readiness for varying levels of coordinated care and risk. We are applying our proven framework to support the advancing of value-based care models and move providers up the continuum from simple pay-per-performance models to ACOs and even joint ventures. We've made good progress in the first quarter and now have 77 ACO agreements and approximately 40% of our claims payments running through some form of value-based care model. Based on our progress to date, we believe we will remain on track to achieve our 2020 goal of 75% of claims in value-based care models in our broad mission of creating a healthier world. 
In summary, we are off to a good start to 2016. I want to thank our employees for their efforts in delivering another strong quarter for Aetna and our shareholders. With the momentum from the first quarter, I am confident we have the right vision to lead in the changing health care marketplace. We can continue to execute on our differentiated strategy. We will successfully close and integrate the proposed Humana acquisition, and we can achieve our 2016 operating EPS projection of $7.90 to $8.10. 
I will now turn the call over to Shawn, who'll provide additional insight into our first quarter results and our updated 2016 outlook. Shawn?"
655542,331146749,965513,"Aetna Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Aetna Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported first quarter 2016 operating earnings of $811 million and operating earnings per share of $2.30.

Earlier today, we reported first quarter 2016 operating earnings of $811 million and operating earnings per share of $2.30. Aetna's operating results continue to be supported by strong cash flow and operating margins. 
I'll begin with some comments on overall performance. Our medical membership of 23 million is approximately 200,000 higher than the top end of our previously projected range, driven by lower ASC losses and higher individual membership growth. We grew operating revenue by 4% over the prior year to a record quarterly level of $15.7 billion, driven by higher health care premium yields and membership growth in our Government business, partially offset by membership declines in our group Commercial Insured products. From an operating margin perspective, our businesses are performing quite well. Our pretax operating margin was 9.5%, a very strong result and consistent with the high end of our target operating margin range. Our first quarter total health medical benefit ratio was 80.5%, a strong result that benefited from continued moderate medical cost trends and favorable prior years' reserve development. Our operating expense ratio was 18%, a 40 basis point improvement over the first quarter of 2015 and a good start to achieving our operating cost goals for the year. From a balance sheet perspective, we remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves. We experienced favorable prior years' reserve development in the quarter across all of our core products, primarily attributable to fourth quarter 2015 dates of service. Our reserve growth exceeded our premium growth, and days claims payable were 57 days at the end of the quarter, a sequential increase of approximately 2 days. The increase in days claims payable was primarily a result of increased processing times, which we expect will normalize over the remainder of the year. 
Turning to cash flow and capital. Operating cash flows in the first quarter were strong. Health Care and Group Insurance operating cash flows were approximately 2.3x operating earnings, driven by strong operating results and the timing of certain ACA-related payments in the quarter. We did not repurchase any shares during the quarter due to the proposed Humana acquisition. However, we did return $87 million to shareholders through our quarterly shareholder dividend. In short, we are pleased with our first quarter results and the continued successful execution of our growth strategy. 
I will now discuss the key drivers of our first quarter performance in greater detail. Beginning with our Commercial business. Our Commercial ASC membership declined by approximately 660,000 members during the quarter, a disappointing result in absolute terms but an improvement relative to our previous projections. This improvement was driven by increased sales and higher retention rates, a testament to the actions taken to mitigate known customer losses. From an operating earnings perspective, first quarter Commercial ASC results were a continuation of the strong momentum from 2015, primarily due to strong fee yields. In our Commercial Insured business, we grew membership modestly in the quarter, largely the result of higher Individual membership, partially offset by lower Small Group and International membership. Our Commercial medical benefit ratio was 77.8% for the quarter, a good result that benefited from moderate medical cost trends and favorable prior years' reserve development. Based on first quarter results, we continue to project that our 2016 core Commercial medical cost trends will be in the range of 6% to 7%. 
With respect to our Individual Commercial business, we are off to a solid start to the year. At 1.2 million members, our first quarter medical membership exceeded our previous projections, primarily related to on-exchange membership growth, and underwriting margins were largely consistent with our expectations, driven by favorable reserve development and stable estimates of 3R accruals. 
Looking ahead to the balance of 2016. We expect that our first quarter will market the high for our Individual membership as we project material attrition through the remainder of the year and a lower level of special election period enrollment compared to prior years. Based on our first quarter results, including updated reconciliation estimates for ACA programs, we believe we are on track to achieve our projected 2016 margin improvement goals for these products. 
Shifting to our Government business, which continues to be a key source of growth for the company. We grew medical membership by nearly 150,000 members in the quarter, including growth of 81,000 in Medicare Advantage, 46,000 in Medicare Supplement and 22,000 in Medicaid members. Additionally, we grew Medicare PDP membership sequentially by over 470,000 members. As a result of the strong medical membership growth, we grew our first quarter 2016 Government premiums by over 13% compared to the prior year period, achieving a record $6.5 billion. Government premiums now represent nearly 50% of our total health care premiums. Our Government medical benefit ratio was 83.4%, a continuation of the outstanding result achieved in this business in 2015 and a very good start to the year. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Our financial position, capital structure and liquidity all continue to be very strong. At March 31, we had a debt-to-total-capitalization ratio of approximately 32% as we continue to build cash ahead of closing the Humana acquisition. Looking at cash and investments at the parent. We started the quarter with approximately $420 million. Net subsidiary dividends to the parent were $715 million. We paid a shareholder dividend of $87 million. And after other uses, we ended the quarter with approximately $970 million of cash at the parent. Our basic share count was approximately 351 million at March 31. As a result of our first quarter performance, we are increasing our 2016 operating earnings per share guidance to our range $7.90 to $8.10 per share. The top end of this range represents a $0.35 increase relative to our previous projection of at least $7.75 per share and reflects our favorable first quarter operating performance, including the effect of favorable prior years' reserve development and improved results in our fee-based businesses. However, certain risks remain that temper our outlook at this point in the calendar, including the ever present concern that medical cost trends could increase more than we have projected and low visibility at this juncture of the year into our ability to achieve our margin improvement goals in our ACA-compliant products, particularly the uncertainty related to accruals associated with the 3Rs. Our updated 2016 guidance is influenced by the following additional drivers. Based on our first quarter membership results, we project that our year-end medical membership will be approximately 23 million members as growth in Government membership over the remainder of the year is largely offset by declines in Commercial Insured membership, including attrition in our Individual products. As we consider the stronger-than-projected start to the year in our current membership view, we are increasing our operating revenue projection for the year and now project that we will deliver up to $63 billion in 2016 operating revenue. We continue to project that our full year total medical benefit ratio will be in the range of 81.6%, plus or minus 30 basis points. We continue to project that our operating expense ratio will be less than 18.5% for the full year. We now project pretax operating margin to be 8% to 8.5%, consistent with our high single-digit target. We now project operating earnings of approximately $2.8 billion, and we now project excess cash flow to the parent of up to $2.4 billion, reflecting our vitality [indiscernible] reinsurance transaction, partially offset by increased capital requirements as a result of our higher premium growth projections. Finally, as we consider the progression of earnings for the remainder of the year, we expect our operating EPS to be more evenly balanced between the first and second half of the year as compared to 2015. 
In closing, we are encouraged by the strength of our first quarter results and our improved 2016 outlook, particularly at this early stage in the year. Further, we continue to believe we are on track to close the Humana acquisition in the second half of 2016 and achieve our 2018 combined company operating EPS goal of at least $11.

We intend on looking forward to the next administration to improve the product as we move ahead. Let me just give you a different sort of basis to think about our registration and exchanges. We have 911,000 members on the public exchanges Individual. We have 1.2 million members that are exchanged or ACA-compliant. If we were to go out and buy those members, it will cost us somewhere around $1.2 billion to acquire them. If we were to build out 15 markets, it will cost somewhere between $600 million to $750 million to enter those markets and build-out the capabilities necessary to grow that membership. So in the brand broad scheme of things, we are well, well below any of those numbers from the standpoint of losses we've incurred in the first 2.5 years of this program. And so we see this is a good investment, hoping that we have an administration and a Congress that will allow us to change the product like we change Medicare every year and we change Medicaid every year.

This morning, Aetna reported first quarter operating earnings of $2.30 per share, a good start to the year and a continuation of the strong momentum from 2015, where we generated record annual operating revenue and operating earnings. Underlying our first quarter performance, we exceeded our previous membership projections and in the quarter with approximately 23 million medical members. We grew operating revenue to a quarterly record of $15.7 billion. We achieved pretax operating margins at the high end of our targeted range, and we generated approximately $1.8 billion in operating cash flow. 
Given our strong start to 2016, today, we made several adjustments to our full year 2016 guidance. We established a year-end medical membership projection of approximately 23 million members. We now project we will generate up to $63 billion of operating revenue, up from our previous projection of approximately $62 billion. And we increased our operating EPS projection to a range of $7.90 to $8.10 per share, up from our previous projection of at least $7.75. 
In a few moments, Shawn will discuss our first quarter results and updated 2016 guidance in greater detail. But first, I would like to provide a brief update on the Humana acquisition and discuss some of the operational highlights for the quarter. 
Beginning with the Humana acquisition. Our integration teams are thoughtfully planning for a combined organization that delivers on our synergy and accretion goals and maximizes the transformational nature of this combination. We continued to cooperate with the Department of Justice and work with state regulators and now have approvals in 6 states remaining. Based on our progress to date, we believe we remain on track to close in the second half of 2016. 
Moving on to first quarter operational highlights. We had another strong quarter of growth in our Medicare business with membership growth across all products. Our compelling product design and industry-leading star ratings continue to resonate with Medicare consumers, as evidenced by our 9% sequential Individual and A membership growth, which once again exceeded overall Medicare Advantage program growth. In total, including Medicare Supplement, we have grown to serve 127,000 additional Medicare medical members in the first quarter, capping another strong annual election period for the company. 
Medicare Advantage remains an important growth lever for Aetna, and we are encouraged by the relative stability and funding for the 2017 plan year. However, we are concerned with a few of the changes outlined in the 2017 final rate notice, including the rate cuts to the employer group waiver program and the potential disruption and benefits for the millions of beneficiaries who rely on this important program. This is particularly concerning in 2018 when the rate cuts are fully phased in. We will continue to work with CMS to refine the employer group payment methodology for 2018 to appropriately reflect the differences between employer group and individual plans. Additionally, CMS changes to the MA star ratings program and risk adjustment mechanism for dual-eligible beneficiaries add unnecessary complexity to star ratings and instability in the risk adjustment program. Despite the challenges posed by the group MA payment changes, we remain committed to providing value to our employer customers by delivering high-quality affordable options for their retirees. 
Continuing on with our Government business. Our Medicaid franchise delivered another quarter of solid revenue growth and underwriting margin performance. Aetna now serves over 2.3 million Medicaid members, an increase of nearly 230,000 from the same period a year ago. This steady growth has been driven by a combination of new contract wins, county expansions in existing states and ACA-related expansion membership. Looking to the future, we are confident that Aetna is well positioned to take advantage of the strong growth dynamics of the Medicaid business as more states seek to partner with the private sector to manage the health of the Medicaid beneficiaries. 
Let me take a moment to discuss public exchanges in our Individual business. From a regulatory perspective, we welcome the efforts of CMS to work with the industry to stabilize the individual public exchange program. While we are encouraged by these regulatory efforts, there is still much work to be done to ensure the long-term future of this program. As we entered the third year of the public exchange program, we are committed to working constructively with the administration and lawmakers to find solutions that can improve this program, stabilize the risk pool and expand product flexibility, all with the goal of creating a sustainable program that makes health care more affordable and accessible for all consumers. 
Turning to our first quarter Individual Commercial results. We ended the first quarter with approximately 1.2 million total individual members, exceeding our previous membership projection. The overall demographic composition of our membership is largely consistent with last year and our expectations. While it's still early, we are encouraged by our year-to-date performance and believe we remain on track to achieve our 2016 operating margin improvement goals in these products. 
Finally, our stated mission is to create a healthier world. Our strategy to achieve this mission in part involves working to transform the health care system model to one in which hospitals and doctors are rewarded for delivering real value to patients and consumers. Our differentiated approach focuses on meeting providers where they are in terms of their readiness for varying levels of coordinated care and risk. We are applying our proven framework to support the advancing of value-based care models and move providers up the continuum from simple pay-for-performance models to ACOs and even joint ventures. We've made good progress in the first quarter and now have 77 ACO agreements and approximately 40% of our claims payments running through some form of value-based care model. Based on our progress to date, we believe we will remain on track to achieve our 2020 goal of 75% of claims in value-based care models in our broad mission of creating a healthier world. 
In summary, we are off to a good start to 2016. I want to thank our employees for their efforts in delivering another strong quarter for Aetna and our shareholders. With the momentum from the first quarter, I am confident, we have the right vision to lead in the changing health care marketplace. We can continue to execute on our differentiated strategy. We will successfully close and integrate the proposed Humana acquisition, and we can achieve our 2016 operating EPS projection of $7.90 to $8.10. 
I will now turn the call over to Shawn, who'll provide additional insight into our first quarter results and our updated 2016 outlook. Shawn?"

Earlier today, we reported first quarter 2016 operating earnings of $811 million and operating earnings per share of $2.30. Aetna's operating results continue to be supported by strong cash flow and operating margins. 
I'll begin with some comments on overall performance. Our medical membership of 23 million is approximately 200,000 higher than the top end of our previously projected range, driven by lower ASC losses and higher individual membership growth. We grew operating revenue by 4% over the prior year to a record quarterly level of $15.7 billion, driven by higher health care premium yields and membership growth in our Government business, partially offset by membership declines in our group Commercial Insured products. From an operating margin perspective, our businesses are performing quite well. Our pretax operating margin was 9.5%, a very strong result and consistent with the high end of our target operating margin range. Our first quarter total health medical benefit ratio was 80.5%, a strong result that benefited from continued moderate medical cost trends and favorable prior years' reserve development. Our operating expense ratio was 18%, a 40 basis point improvement over the first quarter of 2015 and a good start to achieving our operating cost goals for the year. From a balance sheet perspective, we remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves. We experienced favorable prior years' reserve development in the quarter across all of our core products, primarily attributable to fourth quarter 2015 dates of service. Our reserve growth exceeded our premium growth, and days claims payable were 57 days at the end of the quarter, a sequential increase of approximately 2 days. The increase in days claims payable was primarily a result of increased processing times, which we expect will normalize over the remainder of the year. 
Turning to cash flow and capital. Operating cash flows in the first quarter were strong. Health Care and Group Insurance operating cash flows were approximately 2.3x operating earnings, driven by strong operating results and the timing of certain ACA-related payments in the quarter. We did not repurchase any shares during the quarter due to the proposed Humana acquisition. However, we did return $87 million to shareholders through our quarterly shareholder dividend. In short, we are pleased with our first quarter results and the continued successful execution of our growth strategy. 
I will now discuss the key drivers of our first quarter performance in greater detail. Beginning with our Commercial business. Our Commercial ASC membership declined by approximately 660,000 members during the quarter, a disappointing result in absolute terms, but an improvement relative to our previous projections. This improvement was driven by increased sales and higher retention rates, a testament to the actions taken to mitigate known customer losses. From an operating earnings perspective, first quarter Commercial ASC results were a continuation of the strong momentum from 2015, primarily due to strong fee yields. In our Commercial Insured business, we grew membership modestly in the quarter, largely the result of higher Individual membership, partially offset by lower Small Group and International membership. Our Commercial medical benefit ratio was 77.8% for the quarter, a good result that benefited from moderate medical cost trends and favorable prior years' reserve development. Based on first quarter results, we continued to project that our 2016 core Commercial medical cost trends will be in the range of 6% to 7%. 
With respect to our Individual Commercial business, we are off to a solid start to the year. At 1.2 million members, our first quarter medical membership exceeded our previous projections, primarily related to on-exchange membership growth, and underwriting margins were largely consistent with our expectations, driven by favorable reserve development and stable estimates of 3R accruals. 
Looking ahead to the balance of 2016. We expect that our first quarter will mark the high for our Individual membership as we project material attrition through the remainder of the year and a lower level of special election period enrollment compared to prior years. Based on our first quarter results, including updated reconciliation estimates for ACA programs, we believe we are on track to achieve our projected 2016 margin improvement goals for these products. 
Shifting to our Government business, which continues to be a key source of growth for the company. We grew medical membership by nearly 150,000 members in the quarter, including growth of 81,000 in Medicare Advantage, 46,000 in Medicare Supplement and 22,000 in Medicaid members. Additionally, we grew Medicare PDP membership sequentially by over 470,000 members. As a result of the strong medical membership growth, we grew our first quarter 2016 Government premiums by over 13% compared to the prior year period, achieving a record $6.5 billion. Government premiums now represent nearly 50% of our total health care premiums. Our Government medical benefit ratio was 83.4%, a continuation of the outstanding results achieved in this business in 2015 and a very good start to the year. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Our financial position, capital structure and liquidity, all continued to be very strong. At March 31, we had a debt-to-total-capitalization ratio of approximately 32% as we continued to build the cash ahead of closing the Humana acquisition. Looking at cash and investments at the parent. We started the quarter with approximately $420 million. Net subsidiary dividends to the parent were $715 million. We paid a shareholder dividend of $87 million. And after other uses, we ended the quarter with approximately $970 million of cash at the parent. Our basic share count was approximately 351 million at March 31. As a result of our first quarter performance, we are increasing our 2016 operating earnings per share guidance to a range of $7.90 to $8.10 per share. The top end of this range represents a $0.35 increase relative to our previous projection of at least $7.75 per share and reflects our favorable first quarter operating performance, including the effect of favorable prior years' reserve development and improved results in our fee-based businesses. However, certain risks remain that temper our outlook at this point in the calendar, including the ever present concern that medical cost trends could increase more than we have projected and low visibility at this juncture of the year into our ability to achieve our margin improvement goals in our ACA-compliant products, particularly the uncertainty related to accruals associated with the 3Rs. Our updated 2016 guidance is influenced by the following additional drivers. Based on our first quarter membership results, we project that our year-end medical membership will be approximately 23 million members as growth in Government membership over the remainder of the year is largely offset by declines in Commercial Insured membership, including attrition in our Individual products. As we consider the stronger-than-projected start to the year in our current membership view, we are increasing our operating revenue projection for the year and now project that we will deliver up to $63 billion in 2016 operating revenue. We continue to project that our full year total medical benefit ratio will be in the range of 81.6%, plus or minus 30 basis points. We continue to project that our operating expense ratio will be less than 18.5% for the full year. We now project pretax operating margin to be 8% to 8.5%, consistent with our high single-digit target. We now project operating earnings of approximately $2.8 billion, and we now project excess cash flow to the parent of up to $2.4 billion, reflecting our Vitality Re VII reinsurance transaction, partially offset by increased capital requirements as a result of our higher premium growth projections. Finally, as we consider the progression of earnings for the remainder of the year, we expect our operating EPS to be more evenly balanced between the first and second half of the year as compared to 2015. 
In closing, we are encouraged by the strength of our first quarter results and our improved 2016 outlook, particularly at this early stage in the year. Further, we continue to believe we are on track to close the Humana acquisition in the second half of 2016 and achieve our 2018 combined company operating EPS goal of at least $11.

I think it's a pretty general definition. And so they go everywhere from contracts that pay for better performance without any downside risk to all the way to contracts we're actually sharing risk top and bottom with providers. And I would say the closer we get to the latter kind of structure, the more impact we have on utilization. And so in our relationships where we have that we see definite impacts on underlying trend and utilization where the provider actually wins by providing a more focused quality of care and generates margin out of the contract based on it. Now also, I would also give another factor, which is between Commercial and Government, the numbers obviously in Government are much larger from a standpoint of premium, so there is more to share there, and so, therefore, you have a lot more opportunity in the Government sector. So we always like to lead with Medicare. Medicaid duals is still sort of a fuzzier area we're still working through and understanding what the dynamics are there. In Commercial, is generally lower on the total [indiscernible] from the standpoint of risk share opportunity as we move into those contracts."

We have 911,000 members on the public exchanges Individual. We have 1.2 million members that are exchanged or ACA-compliant. If we were to go out and buy those members, it will cost us somewhere around $1.2 billion to acquire them. If we were to build out 15 markets, it will cost us somewhere between $600 million to $750 million to enter those markets and build-out the capabilities necessary to grow that membership.

Thank you, Joe, and thank you all for joining us today. This morning, Aetna reported first quarter operating earnings of $2.30 per share, a good start to the year and a continuation of the strong momentum from 2015, where we generated record annual operating revenue and operating earnings. Underlying our first quarter performance, we exceeded our previous membership projections, ending the quarter with approximately 23 million medical members. We grew operating revenue to a quarterly record of $15.7 billion. We achieved pretax operating margins at the high end of our targeted range, and we generated approximately $1.8 billion in operating cash flow. 
Given our strong start to 2016, today, we made several adjustments to our full year 2016 guidance. We established a year-end medical membership projection of approximately 23 million members. We now project we will generate up to $63 billion of operating revenue, up from our previous projection of approximately $62 billion. And we increased our operating EPS projection to a range of $7.90 to $8.10 per share, up from our previous projection of at least $7.75. 
In a few moments, Shawn will discuss our first quarter results and updated 2016 guidance in greater detail. But first, I would like to provide a brief update on the Humana acquisition and discuss some of the operational highlights for the quarter. 
Beginning with the Humana acquisition. Our integration teams are thoughtfully planning for a combined organization that delivers on our synergy and accretion goals and maximizes the transformational nature of this combination. We continued to cooperate with the Department of Justice and work with state regulators and now have approvals in 6 states remaining. Based on our progress to date, we believe we remain on track to close in the second half of 2016. 
Moving on to first quarter operational highlights. We had another strong quarter of growth in our Medicare business with membership growth across all products. Our compelling product design and industry-leading star ratings continue to resonate with Medicare consumers, as evidenced by our 9% sequential Individual MA membership growth, which once again exceeded overall Medicare Advantage program growth. In total, including Medicare Supplement, we have grown to serve 127,000 additional Medicare medical members in the first quarter, capping another strong annual election period for the company. 
Medicare Advantage remains an important growth lever for Aetna, and we are encouraged by the relative stability and funding for the 2017 plan year. However, we are concerned with a few of the changes outlined in the 2017 final rate notice, including the rate cuts to the employer group waiver program and the potential disruption in benefits for the millions of beneficiaries who rely on this important program. This is particularly concerning in 2018 when the rate cuts are fully phased in. We will continue to work with CMS to refine the employer group payment methodology for 2018 to appropriately reflect the differences between employer group and individual plans. Additionally, CMS changes to the MA star ratings program and risk adjustment mechanism for dual-eligible beneficiaries add unnecessary complexity to star ratings and instability in the risk adjustment program. Despite the challenges posed by the group MA payment changes, we remain committed to providing value to our employer customers by delivering high-quality affordable options for their retirees. 
Continuing on with our Government business. Our Medicaid franchise delivered another quarter of solid revenue growth and underwriting margin performance. Aetna now serves over 2.3 million Medicaid members, an increase of nearly 230,000 from the same period a year ago. This steady growth has been driven by a combination of new contract wins, county expansions in existing states and ACA-related expansion membership. Looking to the future, we are confident that Aetna is well positioned to take advantage of the strong growth dynamics of the Medicaid business as more states seek to partner with the private sector to manage the health of the Medicaid beneficiaries. 
Let me take a moment to discuss public exchanges in our Individual business. From a regulatory perspective, we welcome the efforts of CMS to work with the industry to stabilize the individual public exchange program. While we are encouraged by these regulatory efforts, there is still much work to be done to ensure the long-term future of this program. As we entered the third year of the public exchange program, we are committed to working constructively with the administration and lawmakers to find solutions that can improve this program, stabilize the risk pool and expand product flexibility, all with the goal of creating a sustainable program that makes health care more affordable and accessible for all consumers. 
Turning to our first quarter Individual Commercial results. We ended the first quarter with approximately 1.2 million total individual members, exceeding our previous membership projection. The overall demographic composition of our membership is largely consistent with last year and our expectations. While it's still early, we are encouraged by our year-to-date performance and believe we remain on track to achieve our 2016 operating margin improvement goals in these products. 
Finally, our stated mission is to create a healthier world. Our strategy to achieve this mission in part involves working to transform the health care system model to one in which hospitals and doctors are rewarded for delivering real value to patients and consumers. Our differentiated approach focuses on meeting providers where they are in terms of their readiness for varying levels of coordinated care and risk. We are applying our proven framework to support the advancing of value-based care models and move providers up the continuum from simple pay-for-performance models to ACOs and even joint ventures. We've made good progress in the first quarter and now have 77 ACO agreements and approximately 40% of our claims payments running through some form of value-based care model. Based on our progress to date, we believe we will remain on track to achieve our 2020 goal of 75% of claims in value-based care models in our broad mission of creating a healthier world. 
In summary, we are off to a good start to 2016. I want to thank our employees for their efforts in delivering another strong quarter for Aetna and our shareholders. With the momentum from the first quarter, I am confident, we have the right vision to lead in the changing health care marketplace. We can continue to execute on our differentiated strategy. We will successfully close and integrate the proposed Humana acquisition, and we can achieve our 2016 operating EPS projection of $7.90 to $8.10. 
I will now turn the call over to Shawn, who'll provide additional insight into our first quarter results and our updated 2016 outlook. Shawn?"
655542,331146749,966038,"Aetna Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Aetna Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported first quarter 2016 operating earnings of $811 million and operating earnings per share of $2.30.

Earlier today, we reported first quarter 2016 operating earnings of $811 million and operating earnings per share of $2.30. Aetna's operating results continue to be supported by strong cash flow and operating margins. 
I'll begin with some comments on overall performance. Our medical membership of 23 million is approximately 200,000 higher than the top end of our previously projected range, driven by lower ASC losses and higher individual membership growth. We grew operating revenue by 4% over the prior year to a record quarterly level of $15.7 billion, driven by higher health care premium yields and membership growth in our Government business, partially offset by membership declines in our group Commercial Insured products. From an operating margin perspective, our businesses are performing quite well. Our pretax operating margin was 9.5%, a very strong result and consistent with the high end of our target operating margin range. Our first quarter total health medical benefit ratio was 80.5%, a strong result that benefited from continued moderate medical cost trends and favorable prior years' reserve development. Our operating expense ratio was 18%, a 40 basis point improvement over the first quarter of 2015 and a good start to achieving our operating cost goals for the year. From a balance sheet perspective, we remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves. We experienced favorable prior years' reserve development in the quarter across all of our core products, primarily attributable to fourth quarter 2015 dates of service. Our reserve growth exceeded our premium growth, and days claims payable were 57 days at the end of the quarter, a sequential increase of approximately 2 days. The increase in days claims payable was primarily a result of increased processing times, which we expect will normalize over the remainder of the year. 
Turning to cash flow and capital. Operating cash flows in the first quarter were strong. Health Care and Group Insurance operating cash flows were approximately 2.3x operating earnings, driven by strong operating results and the timing of certain ACA-related payments in the quarter. We did not repurchase any shares during the quarter due to the proposed Humana acquisition. However, we did return $87 million to shareholders through our quarterly shareholder dividend. In short, we are pleased with our first quarter results and the continued successful execution of our growth strategy. 
I will now discuss the key drivers of our first quarter performance in greater detail. Beginning with our Commercial business. Our Commercial ASC membership declined by approximately 660,000 members during the quarter, a disappointing result in absolute terms, but an improvement relative to our previous projections. This improvement was driven by increased sales and higher retention rates, a testament to the actions taken to mitigate known customer losses. From an operating earnings perspective, first quarter Commercial ASC results were a continuation of the strong momentum from 2015, primarily due to strong fee yields. In our Commercial Insured business, we grew membership modestly in the quarter, largely the result of higher Individual membership, partially offset by lower Small Group and International membership. Our Commercial medical benefit ratio was 77.8% for the quarter, a good result that benefited from moderate medical cost trends and favorable prior years' reserve development. Based on first quarter results, we continued to project that our 2016 core Commercial medical cost trends will be in the range of 6% to 7%. 
With respect to our Individual Commercial business, we are off to a solid start to the year. At 1.2 million members, our first quarter medical membership exceeded our previous projections, primarily related to on-exchange membership growth, and underwriting margins were largely consistent with our expectations, driven by favorable reserve development and stable estimates of 3R accruals. 
Looking ahead to the balance of 2016. We expect that our first quarter will mark the high for our Individual membership as we project material attrition through the remainder of the year and a lower level of special election period enrollment compared to prior years. Based on our first quarter results, including updated reconciliation estimates for ACA programs, we believe we are on track to achieve our projected 2016 margin improvement goals for these products. 
Shifting to our Government business, which continues to be a key source of growth for the company. We grew medical membership by nearly 150,000 members in the quarter, including growth of 81,000 in Medicare Advantage, 46,000 in Medicare Supplement and 22,000 in Medicaid members. Additionally, we grew Medicare PDP membership sequentially by over 470,000 members. As a result of the strong medical membership growth, we grew our first quarter 2016 Government premiums by over 13% compared to the prior year period, achieving a record $6.5 billion. Government premiums now represent nearly 50% of our total health care premiums. Our Government medical benefit ratio was 83.4%, a continuation of the outstanding results achieved in this business in 2015 and a very good start to the year. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Our financial position, capital structure and liquidity, all continued to be very strong. At March 31, we had a debt-to-total-capitalization ratio of approximately 32% as we continued to build the cash ahead of closing the Humana acquisition. Looking at cash and investments at the parent. We started the quarter with approximately $420 million. Net subsidiary dividends to the parent were $715 million. We paid a shareholder dividend of $87 million. And after other uses, we ended the quarter with approximately $970 million of cash at the parent. Our basic share count was approximately 351 million at March 31. As a result of our first quarter performance, we are increasing our 2016 operating earnings per share guidance to a range of $7.90 to $8.10 per share. The top end of this range represents a $0.35 increase relative to our previous projection of at least $7.75 per share and reflects our favorable first quarter operating performance, including the effect of favorable prior years' reserve development and improved results in our fee-based businesses. However, certain risks remain that temper our outlook at this point in the calendar, including the ever present concern that medical cost trends could increase more than we have projected and low visibility at this juncture of the year into our ability to achieve our margin improvement goals in our ACA-compliant products, particularly the uncertainty related to accruals associated with the 3Rs. Our updated 2016 guidance is influenced by the following additional drivers. Based on our first quarter membership results, we project that our year-end medical membership will be approximately 23 million members as growth in Government membership over the remainder of the year is largely offset by declines in Commercial Insured membership, including attrition in our Individual products. As we consider the stronger-than-projected start to the year in our current membership view, we are increasing our operating revenue projection for the year and now project that we will deliver up to $63 billion in 2016 operating revenue. We continue to project that our full year total medical benefit ratio will be in the range of 81.6%, plus or minus 30 basis points. We continue to project that our operating expense ratio will be less than 18.5% for the full year. We now project pretax operating margin to be 8% to 8.5%, consistent with our high single-digit target. We now project operating earnings of approximately $2.8 billion, and we now project excess cash flow to the parent of up to $2.4 billion, reflecting our Vitality Re VII reinsurance transaction, partially offset by increased capital requirements as a result of our higher premium growth projections. Finally, as we consider the progression of earnings for the remainder of the year, we expect our operating EPS to be more evenly balanced between the first and second half of the year as compared to 2015. 
In closing, we are encouraged by the strength of our first quarter results and our improved 2016 outlook, particularly at this early stage in the year. Further, we continue to believe we are on track to close the Humana acquisition in the second half of 2016 and achieve our 2018 combined company operating EPS goal of at least $11.

More importantly, to cover our contingency on that, we will be launching for 1/1/17, our own Medicare Individual exchange, which will allow employers to make a choice between continuing to offer coverage as a group or putting their employees into the Individual product and we have a lot of interest in that as well, as we move into the year.

We intend on -- we're looking forward to the next administration to improve the product as we move ahead. Let me just give you a different sort of basis to think about our participation in exchanges. We have 911,000 members on the public exchanges Individual. We have 1.2 million members that are exchanged or ACA-compliant. If we were to go out and buy those members, it will cost us somewhere around $1.2 billion to acquire them. If we were to build out 15 markets, it will cost us somewhere between $600 million to $750 million to enter those markets and build-out the capabilities necessary to grow that membership. So in the brand -- broad scheme of things, we are well, well below any of those numbers from the standpoint of losses we've incurred in the first 2.5 years of this program. And so we see this as a good investment, hoping that we have an administration and a Congress that will allow us to change the product like we change Medicare every year and we change Medicaid every year.

But there are bigger structural changes that need to be made around product flexibility, rating flexibility, pooling. We need different pools not one pool. And cross-subsidizing at the premium level across a large swath of the population doesn't work. It needs to be on multiple pools with specific products for each pool. All of that requires legislative response, and that's not going to happen in the near term here. We will see the dynamics of the market get tougher as we go forward if we don't get those kind of structural changes. How it affects us versus others? Quite frankly, we've been very careful to choose the markets we're in. As Karen noted earlier, we look for the right cost structure.

This morning, Aetna reported second quarter operating earnings of $2.21 per share, an 8% increase over the second quarter of 2015. Underlying our solid second quarter performance, we grew operating revenue by 5% to nearly $16 billion. Our non-ACA Commercial Insured products performed consistent with our expectations. Our Commercial fee-based businesses remain strong and exceeded our previous projections. Operating results in our Government business continue to be robust and perform better than projected. We have continued to drive operating efficiencies as evidenced by our 17.1% adjusted operating expense ratio. We achieved high single-digit pretax operating margins, consistent with our long-term target, and we grew operating earnings by 8%. The strong performance in our core business more than offset the significant pressure in our ACA Individual products. In short, we are pleased with our second quarter and first half results. They are representative of the rigor with which we operate our businesses and the value of a diversified portfolio in delivering solid bottom line results. As we look forward to the remainder of 2016, we continue to expect strong operating performance despite pressure from ACA products. Based on our results year-to-date, we remain confident in our operating EPS projection of $7.90 to $8.10 per share. In a few moments, Shawn will provide a more detailed review of our second quarter results and current outlook. But first, I would like to provide an update on our proposed acquisition of Humana as well as share with you some of our second quarter highlights. 
Beginning with Humana. The combination of Aetna and Humana will benefit consumers, particularly those eligible for Medicare. We believe that the combination of these 2 complementary companies will meaningfully benefit the people we serve by: enabling us to create more attractive and affordable products and services, enhancing our ability to help expand value-based care delivery where providers are paid for the quality of the care they provide and not just the quantity of services performed, and accelerating our evolution to a more consumer-centric company that can provide simpler solutions and engaging tools to help people achieve their individual health goals.
As most of you are aware, we are in the process of defending the Justice Department lawsuit to block our proposed acquisition of Humana. The DOJ action ignores the simple fact of that there is robust competition in Medicare as evidenced by: all Medicare eligibles are free to choose between traditional fee-for-service and Medicare Advantage, and approximately 70% of the Medicare-eligible population chooses traditional Medicare. A total of 178 Medicare Advantage organizations offer plans with 28 new organizations entering MA in the last 3 years alone. 91% of Medicare beneficiaries have access to at least 5 Medicare Advantage options, and health care is delivered locally and regulators in 18 of 20 states have already approved the transaction. Finally, as the Justice Department states in its complaint, Congress created Medicare Advantage in 1997 to offer seniors a market-based alternative to traditional Medicare. This is consistent with a market definition that includes both traditional Medicare and Medicaid Advantage and the presentation on the government's medicare.gov website of options available to newly eligible beneficiaries. Consequently, we don't believe divestitures should be required at all. However, after reviewing bids from significant industry players, this morning, we announced that we and Humana have executed agreements with Molina to sell certain of our respective Medicare Advantage assets. We believe that taken together, these divestitures would address the DOJ's perceived competitive concerns regarding Medicare Advantage. 
Shifting to our second quarter highlights. Our Commercial fee-based businesses performed well in the second quarter. Fee yields remained healthy, and pharmacy results were strong, driving better-than-projected operating earnings. As we look forward to the 2017 selling season for large ASC accounts, the RFP pipeline looks more modest than last year with fewer cases out-to-bid. While we expect our 2017 new sales to reflect this pipeline, we are encouraged by our retention efforts this year and project better retention in our Commercial ASC membership in 2017 compared to this year.
In our Commercial Insured business, our large group products are performing generally consistent with our pricing assumptions. However, as Shawn will discuss in more detail, our ACA Small Group and Individual products continue to be challenged by deterioration of the risk pool and an ineffective risk adjustment mechanism. As it relates to these challenges, let me take a few moments to provide an update on our public exchange strategy. Our strategy has always been to participate on the exchanges in a manner that will allow us to gain enough membership to learn how best to provide affordable health care coverage for previously uninsured Americans. At the same time, we are committed to being good stewards of our balance sheet in managing the financial risk and level of investment associated with this opportunity. In light of the disappointing year-to-date performance and updated 2016 projections for our Individual on- and off-exchange products, combined with a significant structural challenges facing the public exchanges, we believe it is only prudent to reassess our level of participation on the public exchanges. Our initial action will be to withdraw our 2017 public exchange expansion plans. Additionally, given the deadline to attest to our final rate filings for 2017, we are also undertaking a complete evaluation of our current exchange footprint as the poor performance of these products warrant such an analysis.
Moving on to our Government business. Our Government business is having another strong year. We grew to serve nearly 0.5 million additional medical members over the past 12 months. We generated over 15% year-over-year growth in government premiums for the quarter, and we generated operating margins consistent with our targeted range. More specifically, our Medicare business is currently on pace to have another solid year of operating performance, driven by strong membership growth. The investments we have made in our value-based care models for Medicare Advantage beneficiaries helped to drive this strong financial performance. These type of value-based care models have demonstrated performance improvements for the Medicare beneficiaries we serve. For example, for calendar year 2015, beneficiaries in our value-based models achieved improvements in clinical quality, including breast and colorectal cancer screening rates and diabetes control. In all, members in these arrangements outperformed populations in non-value-based models on the majority of clinical quality measures. Encouraged by these results, we are pursuing a robust pipeline of additional value-based provider contracts in conjunction with our broader population health strategy. 
Additionally, we made good progress during the quarter toward our goal of helping the people we serve achieve more healthy days through our broader provider collaboration strategy. Specifically, in May, we announced the creation of a jointly-owned health plan company in partnership with Texas Health Resources, one of the leading health care provider systems in Texas. The combination of Texas Health high-quality providers and investment in population health management with Aetna's health plan expertise, care management capabilities and analytical insights will provide the people of Northern Texas with more affordable, high-quality and better coordinated care.
This joint venture is just one of the provider collaborations we entered into in the quarter across a spectrum of value-based care model. With over 40% of our medical cost now flowing through these value-based care models, we are well positioned to achieve our goal of 75% by 2020. In summary, we are pleased with our first half 2016 performance. I want to thank our employees for their efforts in delivering another strong quarter for Aetna and our shareholders as well as all those employees at both Aetna and Humana who have been working tirelessly to close our transaction and deliver a successful integration. With our second quarter results, I am confident we have the right vision to lead in a changing health care marketplace, we can continue to execute in our differentiated strategy and we can achieve our 2016 operating EPS projection of $7.90 to $8.10. 
I will now turn the call over to Shawn, who will provide additional insight into our second quarter results and our current 2016 outlook. Shawn?"

Earlier today, we reported second quarter 2016 operating earnings of $783 million and operating earnings per share of $2.21. Aetna's operating results continue to be supported by strong top line growth, cash fl",1542,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported second quarter 2016 operating earnings of $783 million and operating earnings per share of $2.21. Aetna's operating results continue to be supported by strong top line growth, cash flow and operating margins. I'll begin with some comments on overall performance. We ended the quarter with 23 million medical members, essentially flat with the first quarter of the year. We grew operating revenue by 5% over the prior year to a record quarterly level of nearly $16 billion, driven by higher Health Care premium yields and membership growth in our Government business, partially offset by membership declines in our Commercial Insured products. From an operating margin perspective, our businesses are performing quite well. Our pretax operating margin was 8.9%, a very strong result and consistent with the high end of our target operating margin range. Our second quarter total health medical benefit ratio was 82.4%, a 130 basis point year-over-year increase, driven primarily by performance in our Individual Commercial products and lower favorable development of prior-period health care cost estimates in our Government business. 
Our adjusted operating expense ratio was 17.1%, a 120 basis point improvement over the second quarter of 2015. This year-over-year improvement speaks to our strong commitment to drive productivity improvements and our disciplined focus on managing our operating cost as we continue to grow our top line. From a balance sheet perspective, we remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves. We experienced favorable prior-period reserve development in the quarter across all of our core products primarily attributable to first quarter 2016 dates of service. Our reserve growth exceeded our premium growth in the quarter and on a year-over-year basis. Additionally, days claims payable remained at a healthy level, standing at 56 days at the end of the quarter. The sequential decline of approximately 1 day is consistent with the expected improvement in claim processing speeds as processing times improved from the elevated levels of the first quarter. Note that our days claims payables has increased by over 4 days as compared to prior year quarter. 
Turning to cash flow and capital. Year-to-date operating cash flows have been strong. Health Care and Group Insurance operating cash flows were approximately 1.5x operating earnings. We did not repurchase any shares during the quarter due to the proposed Humana acquisition. However, we did return $88 million to shareholders through our quarterly shareholder dividend. In short, we are pleased with our second quarter results and the continued successful execution of our growth strategy. I will now discuss the key drivers of our second quarter performance in greater detail.
Beginning with our Government business, where we continue to experience strong momentum. Our Government medical benefit ratio was 81.4%, an excellent result and favorable to our previous projections. We grew medical membership by nearly 100,000 members in the quarter, including growth of: 12,000 in Medicare Advantage; 25,000 in Medicare Supplement; and 61,000 in Medicaid. As a result of the strong medical membership growth, we grew our second quarter 2016 Government premiums by over 15% compared to the prior year period, achieving a record $6.6 billion. Government premiums now represent nearly 50% of our total Health Care premiums, and this business continues to perform at a very high level. 
Turning to our Commercial business. Our Commercial fee-based businesses are performing well. We grew our fee revenue in the quarter as compared to the same period last year, and margins remained healthy, driving year-over-year operating earnings growth that exceeded our previous projections. In our Commercial Insured products, membership declined by roughly 125,000 members in the quarter, driven by attrition in our Individual and Small Group membership, largely consistent with our expectations. Our Commercial medical benefit ratio was 83.4% for the quarter. This result was higher than expected as a result of the performance of our ACA Individual products. The performance of our non-ACA Commercial products was consistent with our previous expectations. 
Looking more deeply at our ACA Individual products. We can now see that our 2016 population, of which roughly 1/2 our new members, has a distinctly higher level of morbidity than our 2015 population. This resulted in higher medical cost in the quarter than previously projected. Our second quarter performance was also negatively impacted by updated estimates related to the 3Rs, including amounts related to the prior year dates of service. As a result of these 2 items, we no longer project we will achieve breakeven in our Individual products in 2016 and have established a premium deficiency reserve in the second quarter of $65 million related to second half 2016 projected performance. The combination of all of these factors contributed to an approximate $200 million pretax operating loss in the second quarter in our Individual products. As Mark mentioned earlier, in response to our updated view of these products, we are reassessing our public exchange approach for 2017 as part of our broader action plan to improve the financial performance of our Individual ACA products. 
Moving on to our Small Group insured products. Pretax operating earnings in the quarter were largely in line with our previous projections. However, this result reflects a favorable risk adjustment update from CMS related to 2015 that largely offset higher-than-projected medical costs. The higher-than-projected medical costs were almost entirely driven by our ACA Small Group products and are a function of the continued degradation of the risk pool in certain states. As you know, our previous projections incorporated improvement in pretax operating margins in our Small Group products in 2016, particularly in our ACA products. While we continue to believe we will improve our Small Group pretax operating margins in 2016, we project the underlying pressure on medical costs in our ACA Small Group products will persist for the full year, limiting our ability to achieve all of the 2016 targeted improvement. For 2016, our non-ACA Commercial pricing incorporated a moderate increase to medical cost trend. Based on year-to-date results, we believe that our non-ACA Commercial Insured products are performing consistent with this expectation. As a result, we continue to project that our 2016 non-ACA Commercial medical cost trend will be in the range of 6% to 7%. While disappointed by the performance of our ACA products in the quarter, the strong performance of our core business more than offset these ACA results.
Moving on to the balance sheet. Our financial position, capital structure and liquidity all continue to be very strong. At June 30, we had a debt-to-total-capitalization ratio of approximately 54%, which reflects the debt financing that we completed in June to fund a portion of our pending Humana acquisition. 
Looking at cash and investments at the parent. We started the quarter with approximately $970 million. Net subsidiary dividends to the parent were $1.2 billion. We paid a shareholder dividend of approximately $88 million. And after other uses and excluding the funds raised from our debt financing in June, we ended the quarter with approximately $2.1 billion of cash at the parent. Including the funds from the June debt financing, we ended the quarter with approximately $15 billion at the parent. Our basic share count was approximately $351 million at June 30. Based on our year-to-date performance, we are affirming our 2016 operating earnings per share guidance of $7.90 to $8.10 per share. This reflects the strong performance in our core business, particularly our Government business and our continued focus on operating cost, offset by our updated underwriting margin projections for our ACA products. Our current 2016 guidance is influenced by the following additional drivers. Based on our second quarter membership results, we continue to project that our year-end medical membership will be approximately 23 million members as growth in Government membership over the remainder of the year is largely offset by declines in Commercial Insured membership, including continued attrition within our Individual products. We now project that operating revenue will be approximately $63 billion in 2016. We now project that our full year total health medical benefit ratio will be in the range of 82% to 82.5%. The increase from our previous projections is driven by our updated view of our ACA products. Based on our improved outlook and adjusted operating revenue and continued cost control initiatives, we now project that our operating expense ratio will be approximately 18%. We continue to project pretax operating margin to be at least 8%, consistent with our high single-digit target. We continue to project operating earnings of approximately $2.8 billion. Finally, we continue to project excess cash flow to the parent of up $2.4 billion. In closing, we are encouraged that the strength of results in our core businesses has been powerful enough to absorb the disappointing performance in our ACA products. Specifically, our Medicare business in both group and Individual continues to deliver strong top line and bottom line results and is performing ahead of our previous projections.
Our fee-based businesses continue to produce strong margin and operating profit growth. Our core non-ACA Commercial Insured business remain healthy and is performing consistent with expectations. And finally, our strong focus on expenses is delivering operating cost efficiencies that are tracking ahead of our initial projections for the year.

We expect the year to have a loss on ACA business of in excess of $300 million. We are evaluating our footprint as it exists today to understand what solutions we can put forward to either fix the business or exit the business, and so we're going to that analysis now. As you know, there's a short window to divestitures. But the simple -- the solutions here are really 2. First, let me make the comment that the people that are seeking care through these exchange products need this care, so these aren't people are running off to get services that they don't need. These are people that need the care that they're getting. What we're seeing in the exchanges is double-digit trend year-over-year overall. You can double that when you talk about pharmacy, and you can triple that initial number when you talk about specialty pharmacy. So we have 2 very important things going on in the exchanges here. First, we now believe we have third parties paying premiums for special interest groups both in a Small Group and Individual that are supporting people getting access to these services. And because of that, we have -- while we have the same demographic mix in this population, we have a much higher intensity and morbidity in that population largely around specialty pharmacy. So given that the current risk adjustment mechanism does not include pharmacy, we're not actually -- nobody's getting adequately reimbursed. And given that adjustment mechanism is a zero-sum game, there is no way to fix this unless we include pharmacy, we deal with the eligibility requirements third-party payers paying premium, and we find a way to cover these individuals. Again, these people need this care, and it's appropriate that they get it, but it's really about how the system works."

The number Mark mentioned, north of $300 million pretax, that is our outlook for the year for the Individual ACA business for the full year. So that was obviously a business that we had been trying to get closer to breakeven, so you can really think about that total swing as a swing from where we've been. Small Group, Small Group continues to be profitable overall, and we had wanted to see some improvement there particularly in the ACA business. So we are better year-over-year from an earnings perspective in Small Group but just not as much as we had originally incorporated into our thinking for this year."

This morning, Aetna reported second quarter operating earnings of $2.21 per share, an 8% increase over the second quarter of 2015. Underlying our solid second quarter performance, we grew operating revenue by 5% to nearly $16 billion. Our non-ACA Commercial Insured products performed consistent with our expectations. Our Commercial fee-based businesses remained strong and exceeded our previous projections. Operating results in our Government business continue to be robust and performed better than projected. We have continued to drive operating efficiencies as evidenced by our 17.1% adjusted operating expense ratio. We achieved high single-digit pretax operating margins, consistent with our long-term target, and we grew operating earnings by 8%. The strong performance in our core business more than offset the significant pressure in our ACA Individual products. In short, we are pleased with our second quarter and first half results. They are representative of the rigor with which we operate our businesses and the value of a diversified portfolio in delivering solid bottom line results. As we look forward to the remainder of 2016, we continue to expect strong operating performance despite pressure from ACA products. Based on our results year-to-date, we remain confident in our operating EPS projection of $7.90 to $8.10 per share. In a few moments, Shawn will provide a more detailed review of our second quarter results and current outlook. But first, I would like to provide an update on our proposed acquisition of Humana as well as share with you some of our second quarter highlights. 
Beginning with Humana. The combination of Aetna and Humana will benefit consumers, particularly those eligible for Medicare. We believe that the combination of these 2 complementary companies will meaningfully benefit the people we serve by: enabling us to create more attractive and affordable products and services, enhancing our ability to help expand value-based care delivery where providers are paid for the quality of the care they provide and not just the quantity of services performed, and accelerating our evolution to a more consumer-centric company that can provide simpler solutions and engaging tools to help people achieve their individual health goals.
As most of you are aware, we are in the process of defending the Justice Department lawsuit to block our proposed acquisition of Humana. The DOJ action ignores the simple fact that there was robust competition in Medicare as evidenced by: all Medicare eligibles are free to choose between traditional fee-for-service and Medicare Advantage, and approximately 70% of the Medicare-eligible population chooses traditional Medicare. A total of 178 Medicare Advantage organizations offer plans with 28 new organizations entering MA in the last 3 years alone. 91% of Medicare beneficiaries have access to at least 5 Medicare Advantage options, and health care is delivered locally and regulators in 18 of 20 states have already approved the transaction. Finally, as the Justice Department states in its complaint, Congress created Medicare Advantage in 1997 to offer seniors a market-based alternative to traditional Medicare. This is consistent with, a market definition that includes both traditional Medicare and Medicare Advantage and the presentation on the government's medicare.gov website of options available to newly eligible beneficiaries. Consequently, we don't believe divestitures should be required at all. However, after reviewing bids from significant industry players, this morning, we announced that we and Humana have executed agreements with Molina to sell certain of our respective Medicare Advantage assets. We believe that taken together, these divestitures would address the DOJ's perceived competitive concerns regarding Medicare Advantage. 
Shifting to our second quarter highlights. Our Commercial fee-based businesses performed well in the second quarter. Fee yields remained healthy, and pharmacy results were strong, driving better-than-projected operating earnings. As we look forward to the 2017 selling season for large ASC accounts, the RFP pipeline looks more modest than last year with fewer cases out to bid. While we expect our 2017 new sales to reflect this pipeline, we are encouraged by our retention efforts this year and project better retention in our Commercial ASC membership in 2017 compared to this year.
In our Commercial Insured business, our large group products are performing generally consistent with our pricing assumptions. However, as Shawn will discuss in more detail, our ACA Small Group and Individual products continue to be challenged by deterioration of the risk pool and an ineffective risk adjustment mechanism. As it relates to these challenges, let me take a few moments to provide an update on our public exchange strategy. Our strategy has always been to participate on the exchanges in a manner that will allow us to gain enough membership to learn how best to provide affordable health care coverage for previously uninsured Americans. At the same time, we are committed to being good stewards of our balance sheet in managing the financial risk and level of investment associated with this opportunity. In light of the disappointing year-to-date performance and updated 2016 projections for our Individual on- and off-exchange products, combined with a significant structural challenges facing the public exchanges, we believe it is only prudent to reassess our level of participation on the public exchanges. Our initial action will be to withdraw our 2017 public exchange expansion plans. Additionally, given the deadline to attest to our final rate filings for 2017, we are also undertaking a complete evaluation of our current exchange footprint as the poor performance of these products warrant such an analysis.
Moving on to our Government business. Our Government business is having another strong year. We grew to serve nearly 0.5 million additional medical members over the past 12 months. We generated over 15% year-over-year growth in government premiums for the quarter, and we generated operating margins consistent with our targeted range. More specifically, our Medicare business is currently on pace to have another solid year of operating performance, driven by strong membership growth. The investments we have made in our value-based care models for Medicare Advantage beneficiaries helped to drive this strong financial performance. These type of value-based care models have demonstrated performance improvements for the Medicare beneficiaries we serve. For example, for calendar year 2015, beneficiaries in our value-based models achieved improvements in clinical quality, including breast and colorectal cancer screening rates and diabetes control. In all, members in these arrangements outperformed populations in non-value-based models on the majority of clinical quality measures. Encouraged by these results, we are pursuing a robust pipeline of additional value-based provider contracts in conjunction with our broader population health strategy. 
Additionally, we made good progress during the quarter toward our goal of helping the people we serve achieve more healthy days through our broader provider collaboration strategy. Specifically, in May, we announced the creation of a jointly-owned health plan company in partnership with Texas Health Resources, one of the leading health care provider systems in Texas. The combination of Texas Health high-quality providers and investment in population health management with Aetna's health plan expertise, care management capabilities and analytical insights will provide the people of Northern Texas with more affordable, high-quality and better coordinated care.
This joint venture is just one of the provider collaborations we entered into in the quarter across a spectrum of value-based care models. With over 40% of our medical costs now flowing through these value-based care models, we are well positioned to achieve our goal of 75% by 2020. In summary, we are pleased with our first half 2016 performance. I want to thank our employees for their efforts in delivering another strong quarter for Aetna and our shareholders as well as all those employees at both Aetna and Humana, who have been working tirelessly to close our transaction and deliver a successful integration. With our second quarter results, I am confident we have the right vision to lead in a changing health care marketplace, we can continue to execute on our differentiated strategy and we can achieve our 2016 operating EPS projection of $7.90 to $8.10. 
I will now turn the call over to Shawn, who will provide additional insight into our second quarter results and our current 2016 outlook. Shawn?"

Earlier today, we reported second quarter 2016 operating earnings of $783 million and operating earnings per share of $2.21.

Earlier today, we reported second quarter 2016 operating earnings of $783 million and operating earnings per share of $2.21. Aetna's operating results continued to be supported by strong top line growth, cash flow and operating margins. I'll begin with some comments on overall performance. We ended the quarter with 23 million medical members, essentially flat with the first quarter of the year. We grew operating revenue by 5% over the prior year to a record quarterly level of nearly $16 billion, driven by higher health care premium yields and membership growth in our Government business, partially offset by membership declines in our Commercial Insured products. From an operating margin perspective, our businesses are performing quite well. Our pretax operating margin was 8.9%, a very strong result and consistent with the high end of our target operating margin range. Our second quarter total health medical benefit ratio was 82.4%, a 130 basis point year-over-year increase, driven primarily by performance in our Individual Commercial products and lower favorable development of prior-period health care cost estimates in our Government business. 
Our adjusted operating expense ratio was 17.1%, a 120 basis point improvement over the second quarter of 2015. This year-over-year improvement speaks to our strong commitment to drive productivity improvements and our disciplined focus on managing our operating costs as we continued to grow our top line. From a balance sheet perspective, we remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves. We experienced favorable prior-period reserve development in the quarter across all of our core products, primarily attributable to first quarter 2016 dates of service. Our reserve growth exceeded our premium growth in the quarter and on a year-over-year basis. Additionally, days claims payable remained at a healthy level, standing at 56 days at the end of the quarter. The sequential decline of approximately 1 day is consistent with the expected improvement in claim processing speeds as processing times improved from the elevated levels of the first quarter. Note that our days claims payables has increased by over 4 days as compared to the prior year quarter. 
Turning to cash flow and capital. Year-to-date operating cash flows have been strong. Health Care and Group Insurance operating cash flows were approximately 1.5x operating earnings. We did not repurchase any shares during the quarter due to the proposed Humana acquisition. However, we did return $88 million to shareholders through our quarterly shareholder dividend. In short, we are pleased with our second quarter results and the continued successful execution of our growth strategy. I will now discuss the key drivers of our second quarter performance in greater detail.
Beginning with our Government business, where we continued to experience strong momentum. Our Government medical benefit ratio was 81.4%, an excellent result and favorable to our previous projections. We grew medical membership by nearly 100,000 members in the quarter, including growth of: 12,000 in Medicare Advantage; 25,000 in Medicare Supplement; and 61,000 in Medicaid. As a result of the strong medical membership growth, we grew our second quarter 2016 Government premiums by over 15% compared to the prior year period, achieving a record $6.6 billion. Government premiums now represent nearly 50% of our total health care premiums, and this business continues to perform at a very high level. 
Turning to our Commercial business. Our Commercial fee-based businesses are performing well. We grew our fee revenue in the quarter as compared to the same period last year, and margins remained healthy, driving year-over-year operating earnings growth that exceeded our previous projections. In our Commercial Insured products, membership declined by roughly 125,000 members in the quarter, driven by attrition in our Individual and Small Group membership, largely consistent with our expectations. Our Commercial medical benefit ratio was 83.4% for the quarter. This result was higher than expected as a result of the performance of our ACA Individual products. The performance of our non-ACA Commercial products was consistent with our previous expectations. 
Looking more deeply at our ACA Individual products. We can now see that our 2016 population, of which roughly 1/2 are new members, has a distinctly higher level of morbidity than our 2015 population. This resulted in higher medical costs in the quarter than previously projected. Our second quarter performance was also negatively impacted by updated estimates related to the 3Rs, including amounts related to prior year dates of service. As a result of these 2 items, we no longer project we will achieve breakeven in our Individual products in 2016 and have established a premium deficiency reserve in the second quarter of $65 million related to second half 2016 projected performance. The combination of all of these factors contributed to an approximate $200 million pretax operating loss in the second quarter in our Individual products. As Mark mentioned earlier, in response to our updated view of these products, we are reassessing our public exchange approach for 2017 as part of our broader action plan to improve the financial performance of our Individual ACA products. 
Moving on to our Small Group insured products. Pretax operating earnings in the quarter were largely in line with our previous projections. However, this result reflects a favorable risk adjustment update from CMS related to 2015 that largely offset higher-than-projected medical costs. The higher-than-projected medical costs were almost entirely driven by our ACA Small Group products and are a function of the continued degradation of the risk pool in certain states. As you know, our previous projections incorporated improvement in pretax operating margins in our Small Group products in 2016, particularly in our ACA products. While we continued to believe we will improve our Small Group pretax operating margins in 2016, we project the underlying pressure on medical costs in our ACA Small Group products will persist for the full year, limiting our ability to achieve all of the 2016 targeted improvement. For 2016, our non-ACA Commercial pricing incorporated a moderate increase to medical cost trend. Based on year-to-date results, we believe that our non-ACA Commercial Insured products are performing consistent with this expectation. As a result, we continue to project that our 2016 non-ACA Commercial medical cost trend will be in the range of 6% to 7%. While disappointed by the performance of our ACA products in the quarter, the strong performance of our core business more than offset these ACA results.
Moving on to the balance sheet. Our financial position, capital structure and liquidity all continued to be very strong. At June 30, we had a debt-to-total-capitalization ratio of approximately 54%, which reflects the debt financing that we completed in June to fund a portion of our pending Humana acquisition. 
Looking at cash and investments at the parent. We started the quarter with approximately $970 million. Net subsidiary dividends to the parent were $1.2 billion. We paid a shareholder dividend of approximately $88 million. And after other uses and excluding the funds raised from our debt financing in June, we ended the quarter with approximately $2.1 billion of cash at the parent. Including the funds from the June debt financing, we ended the quarter with approximately $15 billion at the parent. Our basic share count was approximately $351 million at June 30. Based on our year-to-date performance, we are affirming our 2016 operating earnings per share guidance of $7.90 to $8.10 per share. This reflects the strong performance in our core business, particularly our Government business and our continued focus on operating costs, offset by our updated underwriting margin projections for our ACA products. Our current 2016 guidance is influenced by the following additional drivers. Based on our second quarter membership results, we continued to project that our year-end medical membership will be approximately 23 million members as growth in Government membership over the remainder of the year is largely offset by declines in Commercial Insured membership, including continued attrition within our Individual products. We now project that operating revenue will be approximately $63 billion in 2016. We now project that our full year total health medical benefit ratio will be in the range of 82% to 82.5%. The increase from our previous projection is driven by our updated view of our ACA products. Based on our improved outlook and adjusted operating revenue and continued cost control initiatives, we now project that our operating expense ratio will be approximately 18%. We continue to project pretax operating margin to be at least 8%, consistent with our high single-digit target. We continued to project operating earnings of approximately $2.8 billion. Finally, we continue to project excess cash flow to the parent of up $2.4 billion. In closing, we are encouraged that the strength of results in our core businesses has been powerful enough to absorb the disappointing performance in our ACA products. Specifically, our Medicare business in both group and Individual continues to deliver strong top line and bottom line results and is performing ahead of our previous projections.
Our fee-based businesses continued to produce strong margin and operating profit growth. Our core non-ACA Commercial Insured business remains healthy and is performing consistent with expectations. And finally, our strong focus on expenses is delivering operating cost efficiencies that are tracking ahead of our initial projections for the year.

As you know, there's a short window to divestitures. But the simple -- the solutions here are really 2. First, let me make the comment that the people that are seeking care through these exchange products need this care, so these aren't people running off to get services that they don't need, these are people that need the care that they're getting. What we're seeing in the exchanges is double-digit trend year-over-year overall. You can double that when you talk about pharmacy, and you can triple that initial number when you talk about specialty pharmacy. So we have 2 very important things going on in the exchanges here. First, we now believe we have third parties paying premiums for special interest groups, both in a Small Group and Individual, that are supporting people getting access to these services. And because of that, we have -- while we have the same demographic mix in this population, we have a much higher intensity and morbidity in that population largely around specialty pharmacy. So given that the current risk adjustment mechanism does not include pharmacy, we're not actually -- nobody's getting adequately reimbursed. And given that the risk adjustment mechanism is a zero-sum game, there is no way to fix this unless we include pharmacy, we deal with the eligibility requirements of third-party payers paying premium, and we find a way to cover these individuals. Again, these people need this care, and it's appropriate that they get it, but it's really about how the system works."

As I mentioned in my remarks, on Individual ACA, we booked a pretax loss of about $200 million for the second quarter. The number Mark mentioned, north of $300 million pretax, that is our outlook for the year for the Individual ACA business for the full year. So that was obviously a business that we had been trying to get closer to breakeven, so you can really think about that, total swing as a swing from where we've been. Small Group, Small Group continues to be profitable overall, and we had wanted to see some improvement there, particularly in the ACA business. So we are better year-over-year from an earnings perspective in Small Group, but just not as much as we had originally incorporated into our thinking for this year."

This morning, Aetna reported second quarter operating earnings of $2.21 per share, an 8% increase over the second quarter of 2015. Underlying our solid second quarter performance, we grew operating revenue by 5% to nearly $16 billion. Our non-ACA Commercial Insured products performed consistent with our expectations. Our Commercial fee-based businesses remained strong and exceeded our previous projections. Operating results in our Government business continue to be robust and performed better than projected. We have continued to drive operating efficiencies as evidenced by our 17.1% adjusted operating expense ratio. We achieved high single-digit pretax operating margins, consistent with our long-term target, and we grew operating earnings by 8%. The strong performance in our core business more than offset the significant pressure in our ACA Individual products. In short, we are pleased with our second quarter and first half results. They are representative of the rigor with which we operate our businesses and the value of a diversified portfolio in delivering solid bottom line results. As we look forward to the remainder of 2016, we continue to expect strong operating performance despite pressure from ACA products. Based on our results year-to-date, we remain confident in our operating EPS projection of $7.90 to $8.10 per share. In a few moments, Shawn will provide a more detailed review of our second quarter results and current outlook. But first, I would like to provide an update on our proposed acquisition of Humana as well as share with you some of our second quarter highlights. 
Beginning with Humana. The combination of Aetna and Humana will benefit consumers, particularly those eligible for Medicare. We believe that the combination of these 2 complementary companies will meaningfully benefit the people we serve by: enabling us to create more attractive and affordable products and services, enhancing our ability to help expand value-based care delivery where providers are paid for the quality of the care they provide and not just the quantity of services performed, and accelerating our evolution to a more consumer-centric company that can provide simpler solutions and engaging tools to help people achieve their individual health goals.
As most of you are aware, we are in the process of defending the Justice Department lawsuit to block our proposed acquisition of Humana. The DOJ action ignores the simple fact that there was robust competition in Medicare as evidenced by: all Medicare eligibles are free to choose between traditional fee-for-service and Medicare Advantage, and approximately 70% of the Medicare-eligible population chooses traditional Medicare. A total of 178 Medicare Advantage organizations offer plans with 28 new organizations entering MA in the last 3 years alone. 91% of Medicare beneficiaries have access to at least 5 Medicare Advantage options, and health care is delivered locally and regulators in 18 of 20 states have already approved the transaction. Finally, as the Justice Department states in its complaint, Congress created Medicare Advantage in 1997 to offer seniors a market-based alternative to traditional Medicare. This is consistent with, a market definition that includes both traditional Medicare and Medicare Advantage and the presentation on the government's medicare.gov website of options available to newly eligible beneficiaries. Consequently, we don't believe divestitures should be required at all. However, after reviewing bids from significant industry players, this morning, we announced that we and Humana have executed agreements with Molina to sell certain of our respective Medicare Advantage assets. We believe that taken together, these divestitures would address the DOJ's perceived competitive concerns regarding Medicare Advantage. 
Shifting to our second quarter highlights. Our Commercial fee-based businesses performed well in the second quarter. Fee yields remained healthy, and pharmacy results were strong, driving better-than-projected operating earnings. As we look forward to the 2017 selling season for large ASC accounts, the RFP pipeline looks more modest than last year with fewer cases out to bid. While we expect our 2017 new sales to reflect this pipeline, we are encouraged by our retention efforts this year and project better retention in our Commercial ASC membership in 2017 compared to this year.
In our Commercial Insured business, our large group products are performing generally consistent with our pricing assumptions. However, as Shawn will discuss in more detail, our ACA Small Group and Individual products continue to be challenged by deterioration of the risk pool and an ineffective risk adjustment mechanism. As it relates to these challenges, let me take a few moments to provide an update on our public exchange strategy. Our strategy has always been to participate on the exchanges in a manner that will allow us to gain enough membership to learn how best to provide affordable health care coverage for previously uninsured Americans. At the same time, we are committed to being good stewards of our balance sheet in managing the financial risk and level of investment associated with this opportunity. In light of the disappointing year-to-date performance and updated 2016 projections for our Individual on- and off-exchange products, combined with a significant structural challenges facing the public exchanges, we believe it is only prudent to reassess our level of participation on the public exchanges. Our initial action will be to withdraw our 2017 public exchange expansion plans. Additionally, given the deadline to attest to our final rate filings for 2017, we are also undertaking a complete evaluation of our current exchange footprint as the poor performance of these products warrant such an analysis.
Moving on to our Government business. Our Government business is having another strong year. We grew to serve nearly 0.5 million additional medical members over the past 12 months. We generated over 15% year-over-year growth in government premiums for the quarter, and we generated operating margins consistent with our targeted range. More specifically, our Medicare business is currently on pace to have another solid year of operating performance, driven by strong membership growth. The investments we have made in our value-based care models for Medicare Advantage beneficiaries helped to drive this strong financial performance. These type of value-based care models have demonstrated performance improvements for the Medicare beneficiaries we serve. For example, for calendar year 2015, beneficiaries in our value-based models achieved improvements in clinical quality, including breast and colorectal cancer screening rates and diabetes control. In all, members in these arrangements outperformed populations in non-value-based models on the majority of clinical quality measures. Encouraged by these results, we are pursuing a robust pipeline of additional value-based provider contracts in conjunction with our broader population health strategy. 
Additionally, we made good progress during the quarter toward our goal of helping the people we serve achieve more healthy days through our broader provider collaboration strategy. Specifically, in May, we announced the creation of a jointly-owned health plan company in partnership with Texas Health Resources, one of the leading health care provider systems in Texas. The combination of Texas Health high-quality providers and investment in population health management with Aetna's health plan expertise, care management capabilities and analytical insights will provide the people of Northern Texas with more affordable, high-quality and better coordinated care.
This joint venture is just one of the provider collaborations we entered into in the quarter across a spectrum of value-based care models. With over 40% of our medical costs now flowing through these value-based care models, we are well positioned to achieve our goal of 75% by 2020. In summary, we are pleased with our first half 2016 performance. I want to thank our employees for their efforts in delivering another strong quarter for Aetna and our shareholders as well as all those employees at both Aetna and Humana, who have been working tirelessly to close our transaction and deliver a successful integration. With our second quarter results, I am confident we have the right vision to lead in a changing health care marketplace, we can continue to execute on our differentiated strategy and we can achieve our 2016 operating EPS projection of $7.90 to $8.10. 
I will now turn the call over to Shawn, who will provide additional insight into our second quarter results and our current 2016 outlook. Shawn?"

Earlier today, we reported second quarter 2016 operating earnings of $783 million and operating earnings per share of $2.21.

Earlier today, we reported second quarter 2016 operating earnings of $783 million and operating earnings per share of $2.21. Aetna's operating results continued to be supported by strong top line growth, cash flow and operating margins. I'll begin with some comments on overall performance. We ended the quarter with 23 million medical members, essentially flat with the first quarter of the year. We grew operating revenue by 5% over the prior year to a record quarterly level of nearly $16 billion, driven by higher health care premium yields and membership growth in our Government business, partially offset by membership declines in our Commercial Insured products. From an operating margin perspective, our businesses are performing quite well. Our pretax operating margin was 8.9%, a very strong result and consistent with the high end of our target operating margin range. Our second quarter total health medical benefit ratio was 82.4%, a 130 basis point year-over-year increase, driven primarily by performance in our Individual Commercial products and lower favorable development of prior-period health care cost estimates in our Government business. 
Our adjusted operating expense ratio was 17.1%, a 120 basis point improvement over the second quarter of 2015. This year-over-year improvement speaks to our strong commitment to drive productivity improvements and our disciplined focus on managing our operating costs as we continued to grow our top line. From a balance sheet perspective, we remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves. We experienced favorable prior-period reserve development in the quarter across all of our core products, primarily attributable to first quarter 2016 dates of service. Our reserve growth exceeded our premium growth in the quarter and on a year-over-year basis. Additionally, days claims payable remained at a healthy level, standing at 56 days at the end of the quarter. The sequential decline of approximately 1 day is consistent with the expected improvement in claim processing speeds as processing times improved from the elevated levels of the first quarter. Note that our days claims payables has increased by over 4 days as compared to the prior year quarter. 
Turning to cash flow and capital. Year-to-date operating cash flows have been strong. Health Care and Group Insurance operating cash flows were approximately 1.5x operating earnings. We did not repurchase any shares during the quarter due to the proposed Humana acquisition. However, we did return $88 million to shareholders through our quarterly shareholder dividend. In short, we are pleased with our second quarter results and the continued successful execution of our growth strategy. I will now discuss the key drivers of our second quarter performance in greater detail.
Beginning with our Government business, where we continued to experience strong momentum. Our Government medical benefit ratio was 81.4%, an excellent result and favorable to our previous projections. We grew medical membership by nearly 100,000 members in the quarter, including growth of: 12,000 in Medicare Advantage; 25,000 in Medicare Supplement; and 61,000 in Medicaid. As a result of the strong medical membership growth, we grew our second quarter 2016 Government premiums by over 15% compared to the prior year period, achieving a record $6.6 billion. Government premiums now represent nearly 50% of our total health care premiums, and this business continues to perform at a very high level. 
Turning to our Commercial business. Our Commercial fee-based businesses are performing well. We grew our fee revenue in the quarter as compared to the same period last year, and margins remained healthy, driving year-over-year operating earnings growth that exceeded our previous projections. In our Commercial Insured products, membership declined by roughly 125,000 members in the quarter, driven by attrition in our Individual and Small Group membership, largely consistent with our expectations. Our Commercial medical benefit ratio was 83.4% for the quarter. This result was higher than expected as a result of the performance of our ACA Individual products. The performance of our non-ACA Commercial products was consistent with our previous expectations. 
Looking more deeply at our ACA Individual products. We can now see that our 2016 population, of which roughly 1/2 are new members, has a distinctly higher level of morbidity than our 2015 population. This resulted in higher medical costs in the quarter than previously projected. Our second quarter performance was also negatively impacted by updated estimates related to the 3Rs, including amounts related to prior year dates of service. As a result of these 2 items, we no longer project we will achieve breakeven in our Individual products in 2016 and have established a premium deficiency reserve in the second quarter of $65 million related to second half 2016 projected performance. The combination of all of these factors contributed to an approximate $200 million pretax operating loss in the second quarter in our Individual products. As Mark mentioned earlier, in response to our updated view of these products, we are reassessing our public exchange approach for 2017 as part of our broader action plan to improve the financial performance of our Individual ACA products. 
Moving on to our Small Group insured products. Pretax operating earnings in the quarter were largely in line with our previous projections. However, this result reflects a favorable risk adjustment update from CMS related to 2015 that largely offset higher-than-projected medical costs. The higher-than-projected medical costs were almost entirely driven by our ACA Small Group products and are a function of the continued degradation of the risk pool in certain states. As you know, our previous projections incorporated improvement in pretax operating margins in our Small Group products in 2016, particularly in our ACA products. While we continued to believe we will improve our Small Group pretax operating margins in 2016, we project the underlying pressure on medical costs in our ACA Small Group products will persist for the full year, limiting our ability to achieve all of the 2016 targeted improvement. For 2016, our non-ACA Commercial pricing incorporated a moderate increase to medical cost trend. Based on year-to-date results, we believe that our non-ACA Commercial Insured products are performing consistent with this expectation. As a result, we continue to project that our 2016 non-ACA Commercial medical cost trend will be in the range of 6% to 7%. While disappointed by the performance of our ACA products in the quarter, the strong performance of our core business more than offset these ACA results.
Moving on to the balance sheet. Our financial position, capital structure and liquidity all continued to be very strong. At June 30, we had a debt-to-total-capitalization ratio of approximately 54%, which reflects the debt financing that we completed in June to fund a portion of our pending Humana acquisition. 
Looking at cash and investments at the parent. We started the quarter with approximately $970 million. Net subsidiary dividends to the parent were $1.2 billion. We paid a shareholder dividend of approximately $88 million. And after other uses and excluding the funds raised from our debt financing in June, we ended the quarter with approximately $2.1 billion of cash at the parent. Including the funds from the June debt financing, we ended the quarter with approximately $15 billion at the parent. Our basic share count was approximately $351 million at June 30. Based on our year-to-date performance, we are affirming our 2016 operating earnings per share guidance of $7.90 to $8.10 per share. This reflects the strong performance in our core business, particularly our Government business and our continued focus on operating costs, offset by our updated underwriting margin projections for our ACA products. Our current 2016 guidance is influenced by the following additional drivers. Based on our second quarter membership results, we continued to project that our year-end medical membership will be approximately 23 million members as growth in Government membership over the remainder of the year is largely offset by declines in Commercial Insured membership, including continued attrition within our Individual products. We now project that operating revenue will be approximately $63 billion in 2016. We now project that our full year total health medical benefit ratio will be in the range of 82% to 82.5%. The increase from our previous projection is driven by our updated view of our ACA products. Based on our improved outlook on adjusted operating revenue and continued cost control initiatives, we now project that our operating expense ratio will be approximately 18%. We continue to project pretax operating margin to be at least 8%, consistent with our high single-digit target. We continued to project operating earnings of approximately $2.8 billion. Finally, we continue to project excess cash flow to the parent of up $2.4 billion. In closing, we are encouraged that the strength of results in our core businesses has been powerful enough to absorb the disappointing performance in our ACA products. Specifically, our Medicare business in both group and Individual continues to deliver strong top line and bottom line results and is performing ahead of our previous projections.
Our fee-based businesses continued to produce strong margin and operating profit growth. Our core non-ACA Commercial Insured business remains healthy and is performing consistent with expectations. And finally, our strong focus on expenses is delivering operating cost efficiencies that are tracking ahead of our initial projections for the year.

We expect the year to have a loss on ACA business of in excess of $300 million. We are evaluating our footprint as it exists today to understand what solutions we can put forward to either fix the business or exit the business, and so we're going through that analysis now. As you know, there's a short window to divestitures. But the simple -- the solutions here are really 2. First, let me make the comment that the people that are seeking care through these exchange products need this care, so these aren't people running off to get services that they don't need, these are people that need the care that they're getting. What we're seeing in the exchanges is double-digit trend year-over-year overall. You can double that when you talk about pharmacy, and you can triple that initial number when you talk about specialty pharmacy. So we have 2 very important things going on in the exchanges here. First, we now believe we have third parties paying premiums for special interest groups, both in a Small Group and Individual, that are supporting people getting access to these services. And because of that, we have -- while we have the same demographic mix in this population, we have a much higher intensity and morbidity in that population largely around specialty pharmacy. So given that the current risk adjustment mechanism does not include pharmacy, we're not actually -- nobody's getting adequately reimbursed. And given that the risk adjustment mechanism is a zero-sum game, there is no way to fix this unless we include pharmacy, we deal with the eligibility requirements of third-party payers paying premium, and we find a way to cover these individuals. Again, these people need this care, and it's appropriate that they get it, but it's really about how the system works."

Following the prepared portion of the remarks, we will answer your questions. Karen Lynch, Aetna's President, will also join us for the Q&A session. 
As a reminder, during this call, we will make forward-looking statements. Risk factors that may impact those statements and could cause actual future results to differ materially from current projected results are described in this morning's press release and the reports we filed with the SEC. We have also provided reconciliations of certain non-GAAP measures in our guidance summary, which is available on the Investor Information section of aetna.com. 
Finally, as you know, our ability to respond to certain inquiries from investors and analysts in nonpublic forums is limited, so we invite you to ask all questions of a material nature on this call. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Mark Bertolini. Mark?"

This morning, Aetna reported second quarter operating earnings of $2.21 per share, an 8% increase over the second quarter of 2015. Underlying our solid second quarter performance, we grew operating revenue by 5% to nearly $16 billion. Our non-ACA Commercial Insured products performed consistent with our expectations. Our Commercial fee-based businesses remained strong and exceeded our previous projections. Operating results in our Government business continue to be robust and performed better than projected. We have continued to drive operating efficiencies as evidenced by our 17.1% adjusted operating expense ratio. We achieved high single-digit pretax operating margins, consistent with our long-term target, and we grew operating earnings by 8%. The strong performance in our core business more than offset the significant pressure in our ACA Individual products. In short, we are pleased with our second quarter and first half results. They are representative of the rigor with which we operate our businesses and the value of a diversified portfolio in delivering solid bottom line results. As we look forward to the remainder of 2016, we continue to expect strong operating performance despite pressure from ACA products. Based on our results year-to-date, we remain confident in our operating EPS projection of $7.90 to $8.10 per share. In a few moments, Shawn will provide a more detailed review of our second quarter results and current outlook. But first, I would like to provide an update on our proposed acquisition of Humana as well as share with you some of our second quarter highlights. 
Beginning with Humana. The combination of Aetna and Humana will benefit consumers, particularly those eligible for Medicare. We believe that the combination of these 2 complementary companies will meaningfully benefit the people we serve by: enabling us to create more attractive and affordable products and services, enhancing our ability to help expand value-based care delivery where providers are paid for the quality of the care they provide and not just the quantity of services performed, and accelerating our evolution to a more consumer-centric company that can provide simpler solutions and engaging tools to help people achieve their individual health goals.
As most of you are aware, we are in the process of defending the Justice Department lawsuit to block our proposed acquisition of Humana. The DOJ action ignores the simple fact that there was robust competition in Medicare as evidenced by: all Medicare eligibles are free to choose between traditional fee-for-service and Medicare Advantage, and approximately 70% of the Medicare-eligible population chooses traditional Medicare. A total of 178 Medicare Advantage organizations offer plans with 28 new organizations entering MA in the last 3 years alone. 91% of Medicare beneficiaries have access to at least 5 Medicare Advantage options, and health care is delivered locally and regulators in 18 of 20 states have already approved the transaction. Finally, as the Justice Department states in its complaint, Congress created Medicare Advantage in 1997 to offer seniors a market-based alternative to traditional Medicare. This is consistent with, a market definition that includes both traditional Medicare and Medicare Advantage and the presentation on the government's medicare.gov website of options available to newly eligible beneficiaries. Consequently, we don't believe divestitures should be required at all. However, after reviewing bids from significant industry players, this morning, we announced that we and Humana have executed agreements with Molina to sell certain of our respective Medicare Advantage assets. We believe that taken together, these divestitures would address the DOJ's perceived competitive concerns regarding Medicare Advantage. 
Shifting to our second quarter highlights. Our Commercial fee-based businesses performed well in the second quarter. Fee yields remained healthy, and pharmacy results were strong, driving better-than-projected operating earnings. As we look forward to the 2017 selling season for large ASC accounts, the RFP pipeline looks more modest than last year with fewer cases out to bid. While we expect our 2017 new sales to reflect this pipeline, we are encouraged by our retention efforts this year and project better retention in our Commercial ASC membership in 2017 compared to this year.
In our Commercial Insured business, our large group products are performing generally consistent with our pricing assumptions. However, as Shawn will discuss in more detail, our ACA Small Group and Individual products continue to be challenged by deterioration of the risk pool and an ineffective risk adjustment mechanism. As it relates to these challenges, let me take a few moments to provide an update on our public exchange strategy. Our strategy has always been to participate on the exchanges in a manner that will allow us to gain enough membership to learn how best to provide affordable health care coverage for previously uninsured Americans. At the same time, we are committed to being good stewards of our balance sheet in managing the financial risk and level of investment associated with this opportunity. In light of the disappointing year-to-date performance and updated 2016 projections for our Individual on- and off-exchange products, combined with a significant structural challenges facing the public exchanges, we believe it is only prudent to reassess our level of participation on the public exchanges. Our initial action will be to withdraw our 2017 public exchange expansion plans. Additionally, given the deadline to attest to our final rate filings for 2017, we are also undertaking a complete evaluation of our current exchange footprint as the poor performance of these products warrant such an analysis.
Moving on to our Government business. Our Government business is having another strong year. We grew to serve nearly 0.5 million additional medical members over the past 12 months. We generated over 15% year-over-year growth in government premiums for the quarter, and we generated operating margins consistent with our targeted range. More specifically, our Medicare business is currently on pace to have another solid year of operating performance, driven by strong membership growth. The investments we have made in our value-based care models for Medicare Advantage beneficiaries helped to drive this strong financial performance. These type of value-based care models have demonstrated performance improvements for the Medicare beneficiaries we serve. For example, for calendar year 2015, beneficiaries in our value-based models achieved improvements in clinical quality, including breast and colorectal cancer screening rates and diabetes control. In all, members in these arrangements outperformed populations in non-value-based models on the majority of clinical quality measures. Encouraged by these results, we are pursuing a robust pipeline of additional value-based provider contracts in conjunction with our broader population health strategy. 
Additionally, we made good progress during the quarter toward our goal of helping the people we serve achieve more healthy days through our broader provider collaboration strategy. Specifically, in May, we announced the creation of a jointly-owned health plan company in partnership with Texas Health Resources, one of the leading health care provider systems in Texas. The combination of Texas Health high-quality providers and investment in population health management with Aetna's health plan expertise, care management capabilities and analytical insights will provide the people of Northern Texas with more affordable, high-quality and better coordinated care.
This joint venture is just one of the provider collaborations we entered into in the quarter across a spectrum of value-based care models. With over 40% of our medical costs now flowing through these value-based care models, we are well positioned to achieve our goal of 75% by 2020. In summary, we are pleased with our first half 2016 performance. I want to thank our employees for their efforts in delivering another strong quarter for Aetna and our shareholders as well as all those employees at both Aetna and Humana, who have been working tirelessly to close our transaction and deliver a successful integration. With our second quarter results, I am confident we have the right vision to lead in a changing health care marketplace, we can continue to execute on our differentiated strategy and we can achieve our 2016 operating EPS projection of $7.90 to $8.10. 
I will now turn the call over to Shawn, who will provide additional insight into our second quarter results and our current 2016 outlook. Shawn?"
655542,370648800,1022400,"Aetna Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 02, 2016",2016-08-02,"Earnings Calls","Aetna Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported second quarter 2016 operating earnings of $783 million and operating earnings per share of $2.21.

Earlier today, we reported second quarter 2016 operating earnings of $783 million and operating earnings per share of $2.21. Aetna's operating results continued to be supported by strong top line growth, cash flow and operating margins. I'll begin with some comments on overall performance. We ended the quarter with 23 million medical members, essentially flat with the first quarter of the year. We grew operating revenue by 5% over the prior year to a record quarterly level of nearly $16 billion, driven by higher health care premium yields and membership growth in our Government business, partially offset by membership declines in our Commercial Insured products. From an operating margin perspective, our businesses are performing quite well. Our pretax operating margin was 8.9%, a very strong result and consistent with the high end of our target operating margin range. Our second quarter total health medical benefit ratio was 82.4%, a 130 basis point year-over-year increase, driven primarily by performance in our Individual Commercial products and lower favorable development of prior-period health care cost estimates in our Government business. 
Our adjusted operating expense ratio was 17.1%, a 120 basis point improvement over the second quarter of 2015. This year-over-year improvement speaks to our strong commitment to drive productivity improvements and our disciplined focus on managing our operating costs as we continued to grow our top line. From a balance sheet perspective, we remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves. We experienced favorable prior-period reserve development in the quarter across all of our core products, primarily attributable to first quarter 2016 dates of service. Our reserve growth exceeded our premium growth in the quarter and on a year-over-year basis. Additionally, days claims payable remained at a healthy level, standing at 56 days at the end of the quarter. The sequential decline of approximately 1 day is consistent with the expected improvement in claim processing speeds as processing times improved from the elevated levels of the first quarter. Note that our days claims payables has increased by over 4 days as compared to the prior year quarter. 
Turning to cash flow and capital. Year-to-date operating cash flows have been strong. Health Care and Group Insurance operating cash flows were approximately 1.5x operating earnings. We did not repurchase any shares during the quarter due to the proposed Humana acquisition. However, we did return $88 million to shareholders through our quarterly shareholder dividend. In short, we are pleased with our second quarter results and the continued successful execution of our growth strategy. I will now discuss the key drivers of our second quarter performance in greater detail.
Beginning with our Government business, where we continued to experience strong momentum. Our Government medical benefit ratio was 81.4%, an excellent result and favorable to our previous projections. We grew medical membership by nearly 100,000 members in the quarter, including growth of: 12,000 in Medicare Advantage; 25,000 in Medicare Supplement; and 61,000 in Medicaid. As a result of the strong medical membership growth, we grew our second quarter 2016 Government premiums by over 15% compared to the prior year period, achieving a record $6.6 billion. Government premiums now represent nearly 50% of our total health care premiums, and this business continues to perform at a very high level. 
Turning to our Commercial business. Our Commercial fee-based businesses are performing well. We grew our fee revenue in the quarter as compared to the same period last year, and margins remained healthy, driving year-over-year operating earnings growth that exceeded our previous projections. In our Commercial Insured products, membership declined by roughly 125,000 members in the quarter, driven by attrition in our Individual and Small Group membership, largely consistent with our expectations. Our Commercial medical benefit ratio was 83.4% for the quarter. This result was higher than expected as a result of the performance of our ACA Individual products. The performance of our non-ACA Commercial products was consistent with our previous expectations. 
Looking more deeply at our ACA Individual products. We can now see that our 2016 population, of which roughly 1/2 are new members, has a distinctly higher level of morbidity than our 2015 population. This resulted in higher medical costs in the quarter than previously projected. Our second quarter performance was also negatively impacted by updated estimates related to the 3Rs, including amounts related to prior year dates of service. As a result of these 2 items, we no longer project we will achieve breakeven in our Individual products in 2016 and have established a premium deficiency reserve in the second quarter of $65 million related to second half 2016 projected performance. The combination of all of these factors contributed to an approximate $200 million pretax operating loss in the second quarter in our Individual products. As Mark mentioned earlier, in response to our updated view of these products, we are reassessing our public exchange approach for 2017 as part of our broader action plan to improve the financial performance of our Individual ACA products. 
Moving on to our Small Group insured products. Pretax operating earnings in the quarter were largely in line with our previous projections. However, this result reflects a favorable risk adjustment update from CMS related to 2015 that largely offset higher-than-projected medical costs. The higher-than-projected medical costs were almost entirely driven by our ACA Small Group products and are a function of the continued degradation of the risk pool in certain states. As you know, our previous projections incorporated improvement in pretax operating margins in our Small Group products in 2016, particularly in our ACA products. While we continued to believe we will improve our Small Group pretax operating margins in 2016, we project the underlying pressure on medical costs in our ACA Small Group products will persist for the full year, limiting our ability to achieve all of the 2016 targeted improvement. For 2016, our non-ACA Commercial pricing incorporated a moderate increase to medical cost trend. Based on year-to-date results, we believe that our non-ACA Commercial Insured products are performing consistent with this expectation. As a result, we continue to project that our 2016 non-ACA Commercial medical cost trend will be in the range of 6% to 7%. While disappointed by the performance of our ACA products in the quarter, the strong performance of our core business more than offset these ACA results.
Moving on to the balance sheet. Our financial position, capital structure and liquidity all continued to be very strong. At June 30, we had a debt-to-total-capitalization ratio of approximately 54%, which reflects the debt financing that we completed in June to fund a portion of our pending Humana acquisition. 
Looking at cash and investments at the parent. We started the quarter with approximately $970 million. Net subsidiary dividends to the parent were $1.2 billion. We paid a shareholder dividend of approximately $88 million. And after other uses and excluding the funds raised from our debt financing in June, we ended the quarter with approximately $2.1 billion of cash at the parent. Including the funds from the June debt financing, we ended the quarter with approximately $15 billion at the parent. Our basic share count was approximately $351 million at June 30. Based on our year-to-date performance, we are affirming our 2016 operating earnings per share guidance of $7.90 to $8.10 per share. This reflects the strong performance in our core business, particularly our Government business and our continued focus on operating costs, offset by our updated underwriting margin projections for our ACA products. Our current 2016 guidance is influenced by the following additional drivers. Based on our second quarter membership results, we continued to project that our year-end medical membership will be approximately 23 million members as growth in Government membership over the remainder of the year is largely offset by declines in Commercial Insured membership, including continued attrition within our Individual products. We now project that operating revenue will be approximately $63 billion in 2016. We now project that our full year total health medical benefit ratio will be in the range of 82% to 82.5%. The increase from our previous projection is driven by our updated view of our ACA products. Based on our improved outlook on adjusted operating revenue and continued cost control initiatives, we now project that our operating expense ratio will be approximately 18%. We continue to project pretax operating margin to be at least 8%, consistent with our high single-digit target. We continued to project operating earnings of approximately $2.8 billion. Finally, we continue to project excess cash flow to the parent of up $2.4 billion. In closing, we are encouraged that the strength of results in our core businesses has been powerful enough to absorb the disappointing performance in our ACA products. Specifically, our Medicare business in both group and Individual continues to deliver strong top line and bottom line results and is performing ahead of our previous projections.
Our fee-based businesses continued to produce strong margin and operating profit growth. Our core non-ACA Commercial Insured business remains healthy and is performing consistent with expectations. And finally, our strong focus on expenses is delivering operating cost efficiencies that are tracking ahead of our initial projections for the year.

We expect the year to have a loss on ACA business of in excess of $300 million. We are evaluating our footprint as it exists today to understand what solutions we can put forward to either fix the business or exit the business, and so we're going through that analysis now. As you know, there's a short window to divestitures. But the simple -- the solutions here are really 2. First, let me make the comment that the people that are seeking care through these exchange products need this care, so these aren't people running off to get services that they don't need, these are people that need the care that they're getting. What we're seeing in the exchanges is double-digit trend year-over-year overall. You can double that when you talk about pharmacy, and you can triple that initial number when you talk about specialty pharmacy. So we have 2 very important things going on in the exchanges here. First, we now believe we have third parties paying premiums for special interest groups, both in a Small Group and Individual, that are supporting people getting access to these services. And because of that, we have -- while we have the same demographic mix in this population, we have a much higher intensity and morbidity in that population largely around specialty pharmacy. So given that the current risk adjustment mechanism does not include pharmacy, we're not actually -- nobody's getting adequately reimbursed. And given that the risk adjustment mechanism is a zero-sum game, there is no way to fix this unless we include pharmacy, we deal with the eligibility requirements of third-party payers paying premium, and we find a way to cover these individuals. Again, these people need this care, and it's appropriate that they get it, but it's really about how the system works."

So you have that clearly creating pressure. And as I mentioned, the Government MBR, though, is helping and is better. The fee-based businesses are helping, and they are better. Our non-ACA Commercial business is consistent with expectations sort of through the rest of the year."

The main pillars of the strategy are: positioning Aetna to participate in key industry growth drivers, particularly in government-sponsored programs; leading the evolution of the provider model from volume- to value-based care; and transforming Aetna into a consumer-centric company. While the Humana acquisition enhances these efforts, let me spend a few minutes discussing the progress we have made year-to-date delivering on these strategic pillars. 
Beginning with growing our Government business. The performance of our Medicare business continues to be very strong. During the quarter, we grew medical membership by nearly 50,000 members sequentially; drove year-over-year quarterly premium growth of more than 17%; and produced solid operating margins, consistent with our targeted range. We have also positioned the company to continue to grow in Medicare by: expanding our geographic footprint, providing over 4 million additional eligible Medicare beneficiaries access to Aetna MA products beginning with this annual election period; improving our star's performance for the third consecutive year, achieving over 90% of membership in 4 star or greater plans, best-in-class among our publicly-traded peers; and introducing proprietary group MA exchange solutions that produced multiple group contract wins for January 2017. Our strong membership growth in Medicare Advantage speaks to the execution of our growth strategy in Medicare. Looking forward, we believe we are well positioned to carry this momentum throughout this current annual election period and beyond. 
Shifting to our Medicaid business. From a financial performance perspective, our Medicaid business is having another good year. More specifically, in the third quarter, we added nearly 50,000 members; we grew quarterly premiums by nearly 13% compared to the same period last year; and we are on track to achieve our pretax operating margin target for the year. From a longer-term perspective, we continue to see opportunities for Aetna to grow in Medicaid. While disappointed by the results of our procurement efforts in a number of important Medicaid contracts this year, we have taken what we have learned from these experiences to develop a refreshed approach to our procurement process. Combined with our already strong capabilities in managing Medicaid members, particularly high-acuity populations, we are confident in our ability to grow our Medicaid business. Our recent selection to participate in Virginia's managed LTSS and Nevada's managed Medicaid program speaks to Aetna's underlying capabilities to effectively serve these populations. 
We also continue to advance our efforts to help transform the health care system. Over 40% of Aetna's medical spend currently runs through some form of value-based care model today, and we are making solid progress to achieving our 2020 goal of 75%. Our collaborations with health care providers span a wide spectrum of value-based care models, including joint ventures. Our value-based care efforts are not limited to collaborations with the physicians and hospital systems. Earlier this month, we announced that Merck will be among the first companies to participate in AetnaCare, an innovative approach which uses predictive analytics to identify target populations and proactively curate various health and wellness services that are available. In coordination with the patient's physicians and caregivers, the program will aim to support treatment adherence, ensure that critical support needs are met and reinforce healthy lifestyle behaviors. We are also collaborating with Merck in a previously disclosed value-based contract for the treatment of diabetes. Through this value-based contract, Merck and Aetna will work to advance our common goal of helping patients with Type 2 diabetes effectively manage their condition to enable them to maximize their number of healthy days. 
Shifting to our consumer engagement efforts. We made meaningful progress in the quarter and year-to-date to transform Aetna into a consumer-centric company. Specifically, we continue to use our bswift platform to enhance the consumer shopping and enrollment experience. For 2017, members in [ph] many of our group Medicare Advantage and Small Group plans will have access to bswift's decision support tools and intuitive user interface, creating a more user-friendly and analytically-driven enrollment experience. We also announced a collaboration with Apple, combining the power of iOS apps and the unmatched consumer experience of Apple with Aetna's strong expertise in database wellness and care management programs. With support from Apple, we plan to develop several health initiatives starting with apps that engage consumers. We are excited by this opportunity as we continue to drive Aetna's consumer-centric transformation. 
Before I turn the call over to Shawn to discuss our third quarter results in more detail, I would like to say a few words about the proposed Humana acquisition. We began this journey over 18 months ago, and despite Humana's Medicare star ratings performance, we remain convinced to the strategic and financial merits of the acquisition. The Humana acquisition will accelerate our 3 main strategic pillars, enabling the combined company to provide more competitive products with a more engaging consumer experience to help people we serve achieve their personal health goals. We remain committed to defending our acquisition in court, and we are confident that we will close the transaction. 
In summary, we are pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date performance. I want to thank our employees for their efforts in delivering another strong quarter for Aetna and our shareholders, as well as those employees at both Aetna and Humana who continue to work tirelessly to plan a successful integration. 
I will now turn the call over to Shawn, who will provide additional insight into our third quarter results, our updated 2016 outlook and provide some preliminary thoughts on 2017. Shawn?"
655542,404212568,1062872,"Aetna Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Aetna Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported third quarter 2016 operating earnings of $734 million, a 10% increase over the prior year quarter and operating earnings per share of $2.07. Aetna's operating results continue to be s",1416,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported third quarter 2016 operating earnings of $734 million, a 10% increase over the prior year quarter and operating earnings per share of $2.07. Aetna's operating results continue to be supported by solid top line growth, cash flow and operating margins. 
I'll begin with some comments on overall performance. From a top line perspective, we grew medical membership sequentially by 143,000 to over 23.1 million, and we grew operating revenue by 5% over the prior year to $15.7 billion, driven by higher health care premium yields and membership growth in our Government business, partially offset by membership attrition in our Individual and Small Group Commercial products.
From an operating margin perspective, our portfolio of businesses is performing quite well. Our pretax operating margin was 8.5%, a very strong result and consistent with our target operating margin range. Our third quarter total health medical benefit ratio was 82%, a good result overall, but one that continues to be impacted by the performance of our ACA-compliant Small Group and Individual products. Our adjusted operating expense ratio was 17.6%, a 100 basis point improvement over the third quarter of 2015. This year-over-year improvement speaks to our disciplined focus on managing our operating costs as we continue to grow our top line. 
From a balance sheet perspective, we remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves. We experienced favorable prior period reserve development in the quarter across all of our core products, primarily attributable to second quarter dates of service. Our reserve growth exceeded our premium growth and days claims payable were 57 days at the end of the quarter, a sequential increase of about 1 day and a year-over-year increase of almost 3 days. 
Turning to cash flow and capital. Year-to-date operating cash flow had been strong. Health Care and Group Insurance operating cash flows were approximately 2.1x operating earnings, driven by strong operating results and the timing of Medicare premium receipts, as we received an advance payment in the quarter associated with October 2016. We did not repurchase any shares during the quarter. However, we did return $88 million to shareholders through our quarterly shareholder dividend. In short, we are pleased with our third quarter results and the continued successful execution of our growth strategy. 
I will now discuss the key drivers of our third quarter performance in greater detail, beginning with our Commercial fee-based business, which continues to perform well. We added 117,000 ASC members in the quarter, driven by several new public and labor customers. This added membership, combined with fee yields, drove solid year-over-year fee revenue growth of 4%. Pretax operating margins also remained healthy, continuing the trend from the first half of the year. 
In our Commercial Insured business, our membership declined by roughly 70,000 members in the quarter, primarily the result of attrition in our Individual and Small Group membership, directionally consistent with our expectations. Our Commercial medical benefit ratio was 83.8% for the quarter. This result reflects the continuation of medical cost pressure in our ACA-compliant Individual and Small Group products. 
Let me spend a few moments quantifying the impact of our ACA-compliant products in more detail. Beginning with our Individual products. Our third quarter Commercial MBR reflects ongoing challenges with these products as well as an increase in the premium deficiency reserve to $85 million from $65 million at the end of the second quarter. Based on our third quarter results, our full year pretax operating loss in our Individual Commercial products is now projected to be approximately $350 million, further validating our decision to reduce our 2017 exposure to these products. 
Moving on to our ACA-compliant Small Group insured products. Our underwriting results in the third quarter were pressured by the previously disclosed higher morbidity of this population, combined with our updated estimate of 2016 risk adjustment payables, which further pressured our Commercial MBR in the quarter. While our ACA-compliant products continue to weigh on 2016 results, we are confident that our strategic decision to reduce our footprint will reduce our financial exposure to these products in 2017. Based on year-to-date results, the majority of our Group Commercial products are performing largely consistent with our expectation for moderately increasing medical trend. As a result, we continue to project that our 2016 non-ACA core commercial medical cost trends will be in the 6% to 7% range. 
Shifting to our Government business. Our strong first half momentum extended into the third quarter. We grew medical membership by nearly 100,000 members in the quarter, including growth of: 20,000 Medicare Advantage, 30,000 Medicare Supplement and 47,000 Medicaid members. As a result of the strong medical membership growth, we grew our third quarter 2016 Government premiums by nearly 16% compared to the prior year period to $6.6 billion. Government premiums now represent nearly 50% of our total Health Care premiums. Our Government medical benefit ratio was 80.1%, a very strong result, driven by year-over-year improvement in both Medicare and Medicaid. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Our financial position, capital structure and liquidity all continued to be very strong. At September 30, we had a debt to total capitalization ratio of approximately 53%, which reflects the debt financing that we completed in June to fund the pending Humana acquisition. 
Looking at cash and investments at the parent. We started the quarter with approximately $2.1 billion. Net subsidiary dividends to the parent were $317 million. We paid a shareholder dividend of $88 million. And excluding the funds raised from our debt financing in June, we ended the quarter with approximately $2.3 billion of cash at the parent. Including the funds from the June debt financing, we ended the quarter with approximately $15.2 billion. Our basic share count was approximately 351 million at September 30. Based on our year-to-date performance, we are refining our 2016 operating earnings per share guidance to a range of $7.95 to $8.05 per share. This reflects continued strong performance in our Government business and continued focus on operating costs, offset by our updated margin projections for our ACA-compliant products. Our updated 2016 guidance also reflects our year-end membership projection of approximately 23 million members, with ACA-compliant Small Group and Individual membership attrition projected to be the largest driver of membership movement in the fourth quarter. The balance of our 2016 guidance metrics remain unchanged and can be found on our guidance summary. 
Looking beyond 2016. With the DOJ trial date set for December, we are now planning for a 2017 closing of the Humana acquisition. We believe the strategic underpinnings of the combination and the financial case remains strong. While developments since we announced the transaction have altered some of the specific parts, the sum of these parts is still within our set of initial assumptions. We don't typically provide forward year guidance on our third quarter call and will not do so today. However, with the potential for a 2017 closing of the Humana acquisition, I want to provide directional commentary on some of the notable moving pieces that are likely to influence our initial projections for Aetna's 2017 baseline earnings. While we are still early in the forecasting process, we see a number of challenges in 2017. From an operating revenue perspective, these include: the previously disclosed reduction in our Individual public exchange footprint, the projected impact of the suspension of the health insurer fee, the projected impact of known [ph] Medicaid contract losses and the projected impact of our continued strategy to improve margins in our Small Group ACA products. We project these top line challenges will pressure our ability to grow operating revenue in 2017. However, we believe the Humana acquisition has the potential to mitigate these top line challenges. 
We also see opportunities in 2017, including: the projection for continued above-industry growth in our Individual Medicare Advantage products, driven by our industry-leading stars position; the projection that our reduced Individual public exchange footprint will improve the financial performance of these products in 2017 as compared to 2016; and the projection for year-over-year improvement in the financial performance of our Small Group ACA products.
In closing, as we begin the final quarter of 2016 and continue our planning for 2017, we remain encouraged by the strength of our third quarter and year-to-date results despite some meaningful challenges. We also remain confident that we can close the Humana transaction and are committed to realizing our long-term growth objectives.

In terms of the capital deployment, you are right in the event that we will have some capital. Whether that capital goes to the Humana deal or other uses is to be determined. The allocation of that capital is something that we still need to determine. As you recall, our first priority always with capital is to do something to sort of grow the business and add long-term value, and then we consider some of the other uses like share repurchase and the shareholder dividend. The final comment I'd make on the Individual business is, I would not get so bullish to think that we are eliminating all the loss in that business next year. I think we have taken steps to improve that outcome. But from where we've come on this site, I do not think that, that is something that one should assume at this point."

That allows us the capability should the regulations and the law get right in order to re-enter exchanges, but that probably won't be much -- it won't be before 2019, more likely 2020. What needs to change is largely around the risk adjustment mechanism. Right now, we have a risk adjustment mechanism that has a centering point on the average population in the pool. The population in the pool is largely people who are too young for Medicare, chronically ill and older. And until that changes, the center point is probably 10% to 15% below breakeven. So if you look at industry losses, based on the revenue associated with it, they pretty much tractor that number. So what we have in a zero-sum risk adjustment mechanism is a mechanism that takes people who are losing less money and taking that money and giving it to people who are losing more money, so everybody loses the same money. And until that mechanism changes or until the pool subsequently changes, we're going to find ourselves in a premium spiral that's going to continue to drive rates up, good risk out and ultimately create a very bad risk pool for the overall mechanism."

The thing I would say is, behind our decision making here, this was really about risk management, and we wanted to reduce the capital commitment behind this business. We wanted to reduce the losses, and frankly, we wanted to reduce the variability and outcome of those losses in terms of sort of establishing that footprint and what the planned offerings are. So if you were to look at our off-exchange footprint, the reason we had to announce by August 15 was that the off-exchange markets we were withdrawing from, particularly the types of products, would presage our inability to maintain on-exchange presence.

Proportionate to the membership, it is a bit more disproportional to the off-exchange on a per member basis, but both sides of that equation are making up large components of the $350 million loss. Obviously, it's our intent to decrease the loss on that off-exchange business. The variable on that, though, is still to be played out through sort of the enrollment process in terms of what levels of volume we get or don't get on that business. We used 4 factors to try and size our participation for next year. One was the amount of capital at risk in any given market. We have seen in some states a fairly significant shift from '15 to '16 in the financial performance of those businesses. Secondly, we used the competitive frame, how many people are in the market. When you're the last one left in the market, you can all the risk and there isn't any risk to share. The third was whether or not we can continue to offer broad enough product offering without putting that much capital at risk, including the size of the loss in any one given market.

This morning, Aetna reported third quarter operating EPS of $2.07, driven by 10% year-over-year growth in operating earnings. Underlying our solid third quarter performance, we grew membership sequentially by 143,000 members across Large Group Commercial, Medicare and Medicaid. We grew operating revenue by 5% to $15.7 billion. Operating results in our Government business remain robust. We continue to drive operating efficiencies, as evidenced by our 17.6% adjusted operating expense ratio, and we achieved high single-digit pretax operating margins, consistent with our long-term target. 
We are pleased with our third quarter results, which continue to reflect the solid performance of our core businesses. As we look to the final quarter of 2016, we continue to expect strong operating performance in our core businesses and have refined our operating EPS projection to $7.95 to $8.05 per share. Our performance in the quarter and year-to-date reflects many elements of our growth strategy. The main pillars of the strategy are: positioning Aetna to participate in key industry growth drivers, particularly in government-sponsored programs; leading the evolution of the provider model from volume- to value-based care; and transforming Aetna into a consumer-centric company. While the Humana acquisition enhances these efforts, let me spend a few minutes discussing the progress we have made year-to-date delivering on these strategic pillars. 
Beginning with growing our Government business. The performance of our Medicare business continues to be very strong. During the quarter, we grew medical membership by nearly 50,000 members sequentially; drove year-over-year quarterly premium growth of more than 17%; and produced solid operating margins, consistent with our targeted range. We have also positioned the company to continue to grow in Medicare by: expanding our geographic footprint, providing over 4 million additional eligible Medicare beneficiaries access to Aetna MA products beginning with this annual election period; improving our star's performance for the third consecutive year, achieving over 90% of membership in 4 star or greater plans, best-in-class among our publicly-traded peers; and introducing proprietary group MA exchange solutions that produced multiple group contract wins for January 2017. Our strong membership growth in Medicare Advantage speaks to the execution of our growth strategy in Medicare. Looking forward, we believe we are well positioned to carry this momentum throughout this current annual election period and beyond. 
Shifting to our Medicaid business. From a financial performance perspective, our Medicaid business is having another good year. More specifically, in the third quarter, we added nearly 50,000 members; we grew quarterly premiums by nearly 13% compared to the same period last year; and we are on track to achieve our pretax operating margin target for the year. From a longer-term perspective, we continue to see opportunities for Aetna to grow in Medicaid. While disappointed by the results of our procurement efforts in a number of important Medicaid contracts this year, we have taken what we have learned from these experiences to develop a refreshed approach to our procurement process. Combined with our already strong capabilities in managing Medicaid members, particularly high-acuity populations, we are confident in our ability to grow our Medicaid business. Our recent selection to participate in Virginia's managed LTSS and Nevada's managed Medicaid program speaks to Aetna's underlying capabilities to effectively serve these populations. 
We also continue to advance our efforts to help transform the health care system. Over 40% of Aetna's medical spend currently runs through some form of value-based care model today, and we are making solid progress to achieving our 2020 goal of 75%. Our collaborations with health care providers span a wide spectrum of value-based care models, including joint ventures. Our value-based care efforts are not limited to collaborations with the physicians and hospital systems. Earlier this month, we announced that Merck will be among the first companies to participate in AetnaCare, an innovative approach which uses predictive analytics to identify target populations and proactively curate various health and wellness services that are available. In coordination with the patient's physicians and caregivers, the program will aim to support treatment adherence, ensure that critical support needs are met and reinforce healthy lifestyle behaviors. We are also collaborating with Merck in a previously disclosed value-based contract for the treatment of diabetes. Through this value-based contract, Merck and Aetna will work to advance our common goal of helping patients with Type 2 diabetes effectively manage their condition to enable them to maximize their number of healthy days. 
Shifting to our consumer engagement efforts. We made meaningful progress in the quarter and year-to-date to transform Aetna into a consumer-centric company. Specifically, we continue to use our bswift platform to enhance the consumer shopping and enrollment experience. For 2017, members in many of our group Medicare Advantage and Small Group plans will have access to bswift's decision support tools and intuitive user interface, creating a more user-friendly and analytically-driven enrollment experience. We also announced a collaboration with Apple, combining the power of iOS apps and the unmatched consumer experience of Apple with Aetna's strong expertise in database wellness and care management programs. With support from Apple, we plan to develop several health initiatives starting with apps that engage consumers. We are excited by this opportunity as we continue to drive Aetna's consumer-centric transformation. 
Before I turn the call over to Shawn to discuss our third quarter results in more detail, I would like to say a few words about the proposed Humana acquisition. We began this journey over 18 months ago, and despite Humana's Medicare star ratings performance, we remain convinced to the strategic and financial merits of the acquisition. The Humana acquisition will accelerate our 3 main strategic pillars, enabling the combined company to provide more competitive products with a more engaging consumer experience to help people we serve achieve their personal health goals. We remain committed to defending our acquisition in court, and we are confident that we will close the transaction. 
In summary, we are pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date performance. I want to thank our employees for their efforts in delivering another strong quarter for Aetna and our shareholders, as well as those employees at both Aetna and Humana who continue to work tirelessly to plan a successful integration. 
I will now turn the call over to Shawn, who will provide additional insight into our third quarter results, our updated 2016 outlook and provide some preliminary thoughts on 2017. Shawn?"

Earlier today, we reported third quarter 2016 operating earnings of $734 million, a 10% increase over the prior year quarter and operating earnings per share of $2.07. Aetna's operating results continue to be s",1415,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported third quarter 2016 operating earnings of $734 million, a 10% increase over the prior year quarter and operating earnings per share of $2.07. Aetna's operating results continue to be supported by solid top line growth, cash flow and operating margins. 
I'll begin with some comments on overall performance. From a top line perspective, we grew medical membership sequentially by 143,000 to over 23.1 million, and we grew operating revenue by 5% over the prior year to $15.7 billion, driven by higher health care premium yields and membership growth in our Government business, partially offset by membership attrition in our Individual and Small Group Commercial products.
From an operating margin perspective, our portfolio of businesses is performing quite well. Our pretax operating margin was 8.5%, a very strong result and consistent with our target operating margin range. Our third quarter total health medical benefit ratio was 82%, a good result overall, but one that continues to be impacted by the performance of our ACA-compliant Small Group and Individual products. Our adjusted operating expense ratio was 17.6%, a 100 basis point improvement over the third quarter of 2015. This year-over-year improvement speaks to our disciplined focus on managing our operating costs as we continue to grow our top line. 
From a balance sheet perspective, we remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves. We experienced favorable prior period reserve development in the quarter across all of our core products, primarily attributable to second quarter dates of service. Our reserve growth exceeded our premium growth and days claims payable were 57 days at the end of the quarter, a sequential increase of about 1 day and a year-over-year increase of almost 3 days. 
Turning to cash flow and capital. Year-to-date operating cash flow had been strong. Health Care and Group Insurance operating cash flows were approximately 2.1x operating earnings, driven by strong operating results and the timing of Medicare premium receipts, as we received an advance payment in the quarter associated with October 2016. We did not repurchase any shares during the quarter. However, we did return $88 million to shareholders through our quarterly shareholder dividend. In short, we are pleased with our third quarter results and the continued successful execution of our growth strategy. 
I will now discuss the key drivers of our third quarter performance in greater detail, beginning with our Commercial fee-based business, which continues to perform well. We added 117,000 ASC members in the quarter, driven by several new public and labor customers. This added membership, combined with fee yields, drove solid year-over-year fee revenue growth of 4%. Pretax operating margins also remained healthy, continuing the trend from the first half of the year. 
In our Commercial Insured business, our membership declined by roughly 70,000 members in the quarter, primarily the result of attrition in our Individual and Small Group membership, directionally consistent with our expectations. Our Commercial medical benefit ratio was 83.8% for the quarter. This result reflects the continuation of medical cost pressure in our ACA-compliant Individual and Small Group products. 
Let me spend a few moments quantifying the impact of our ACA-compliant products in more detail. Beginning with our Individual products. Our third quarter Commercial MBR reflects ongoing challenges with these products as well as an increase in the premium deficiency reserve to $85 million from $65 million at the end of the second quarter. Based on our third quarter results, our full year pretax operating loss in our Individual Commercial products is now projected to be approximately $350 million, further validating our decision to reduce our 2017 exposure to these products. 
Moving on to our ACA-compliant Small Group insured products. Our underwriting results in the third quarter were pressured by the previously disclosed higher morbidity of this population, combined with our updated estimate of 2016 risk adjustment payables, which further pressured our Commercial MBR in the quarter. While our ACA-compliant products continue to weigh on 2016 results, we are confident that our strategic decision to reduce our footprint will reduce our financial exposure to these products in 2017. Based on year-to-date results, the majority of our Group Commercial products are performing largely consistent with our expectation for moderately increasing medical trend. As a result, we continue to project that our 2016 non-ACA core commercial medical cost trends will be in the 6% to 7% range. 
Shifting to our Government business. Our strong first half momentum extended into the third quarter. We grew medical membership by nearly 100,000 members in the quarter, including growth of: 20,000 Medicare Advantage, 30,000 Medicare Supplement and 47,000 Medicaid members. As a result of the strong medical membership growth, we grew our third quarter 2016 Government premiums by nearly 16% compared to the prior year period to $6.6 billion. Government premiums now represent nearly 50% of our total Health Care premiums. Our Government medical benefit ratio was 80.1%, a very strong result, driven by year-over-year improvement in both Medicare and Medicaid. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Our financial position, capital structure and liquidity all continued to be very strong. At September 30, we had a debt to total capitalization ratio of approximately 53%, which reflects the debt financing that we completed in June to fund the pending Humana acquisition. 
Looking at cash and investments at the parent. We started the quarter with approximately $2.1 billion. Net subsidiary dividends to the parent were $317 million. We paid a shareholder dividend of $88 million. And excluding the funds raised from our debt financing in June, we ended the quarter with approximately $2.3 billion of cash at the parent. Including the funds from the June debt financing, we ended the quarter with approximately $15.2 billion. Our basic share count was approximately 351 million at September 30. Based on our year-to-date performance, we are refining our 2016 operating earnings per share guidance to a range of $7.95 to $8.05 per share. This reflects continued strong performance in our Government business and continued focus on operating costs, offset by our updated margin projections for our ACA-compliant products. Our updated 2016 guidance also reflects our year-end membership projection of approximately 23 million members, with ACA-compliant Small Group and Individual membership attrition projected to be the largest driver of membership movement in the fourth quarter. The balance of our 2016 guidance metrics remain unchanged and can be found on our guidance summary. 
Looking beyond 2016. With the DOJ trial date set for December, we are now planning for a 2017 closing of the Humana acquisition. We believe the strategic underpinnings of the combination and the financial case remains strong. While developments since we announced the transaction have altered some of the specific parts, the sum of these parts is still within our set of initial assumptions. We don't typically provide forward year guidance on our third quarter call and will not do so today. However, with the potential for a 2017 closing of the Humana acquisition, I want to provide directional commentary on some of the notable moving pieces that are likely to influence our initial projections for Aetna's 2017 baseline earnings. While we are still early in the forecasting process, we see a number of challenges in 2017. From an operating revenue perspective, these include: the previously disclosed reduction in our Individual public exchange footprint, the projected impact of the suspension of the health insurer fee, the projected impact of known Medicaid contract losses and the projected impact of our continued strategy to improve margins in our Small Group ACA products. We project these top line challenges will pressure our ability to grow operating revenue in 2017. However, we believe the Humana acquisition has the potential to mitigate these top line challenges. 
We also see opportunities in 2017, including: the projection for continued above-industry growth in our Individual Medicare Advantage products, driven by our industry-leading stars position; the projection that our reduced Individual public exchange footprint will improve the financial performance of these products in 2017 as compared to 2016; and the projection for year-over-year improvement in the financial performance of our Small Group ACA products.
In closing, as we begin the final quarter of 2016 and continue our planning for 2017, we remain encouraged by the strength of our third quarter and year-to-date results despite some meaningful challenges. We also remain confident that we can close the Humana transaction and are committed to realizing our long-term growth objectives.

That allows us the capability should the regulations and the law get right in order to reenter exchanges. But that probably won't be much before -- it won't be before 2019, more likely 2020. What needs to change is largely around the risk adjustment mechanism. Right now, we have a risk adjustment mechanism that has a centering point on the average population in the pool. The population in the pool is largely people who are too young for Medicare, chronically ill and older. And until that changes, the center point is probably 10% to 15% below breakeven. So if you look at industry losses, based on the revenue associated with it, they pretty much track to that number. So what we have in a zero-sum risk adjustment mechanism is a mechanism that takes people who are losing less money and taking that money and giving it to people who are losing more money, so everybody loses the same money. And until that mechanism changes or until the pool subsequently changes, we're going to find ourselves in a premium spiral that's going to continue to drive rates up, good risk out and ultimately create a very bad risk pool for the overall mechanism."

Conceptually, in any given market, could there be more anti-selection to hit that book? Of course. I mean, that's -- this book is proven difficult to predict over the last 3 years. The thing I would say is, behind our decision-making here, this was really about risk management, and we wanted to reduce the capital commitment behind this business. We wanted to reduce the losses, and frankly, we wanted to reduce the variability and outcome of those losses in terms of sort of establishing that footprint and what the plan offerings are. So if you were to look at our off-exchange footprint, the reason we had to announce by August 15 was that the off-exchange markets we were withdrawing from, particularly the types of products, would presage our inability to maintain on-exchange presence.

The work we're doing is value stream Six Sigma level work, where we're taking each business process and the employees in that process to evaluate and develop a better customer experience. And we've seen a lot of that happening in Medicare already, which is yielding a high outcome on our stars ratings. And we continue to move that across the business. We are not fully embedded. As it relates to the Humana transaction, there are a number of opportunities that we view as earlier wins for us in expanding to more markets. However, that is not putting our own expansion efforts on hold. We continue to do the work that we expected to do in anticipation of our plan as it was before we did the Humana transaction, and we are looking at some systems investments as opportunities with Humana, but you get the trade-off. We may get some benefits out of Humana acquisition in the way of technology investments, in the way of program investments, but we're also going to have make investments in the company, in Humana in fixing things like the large Commercial business, et cetera. So all of that trade-off is really a deployment of capital discussion, and quite frankly, in the end, we're continuing to move ahead with our plan as if the Humana acquisition didn't happen."

This morning, Aetna reported third quarter operating EPS of $2.07, driven by 10% year-over-year growth in operating earnings. Underlying our solid third quarter performance, we grew membership sequentially by 143,000 members across Large Group Commercial, Medicare and Medicaid. We grew operating revenue by 5% to $15.7 billion. Operating results in our Government business remain robust. We continue to drive operating efficiencies, as evidenced by our 17.6% adjusted operating expense ratio, and we achieved high single-digit pretax operating margins, consistent with our long-term target. 
We are pleased with our third quarter results, which continue to reflect the solid performance of our core businesses. As we look to the final quarter of 2016, we continue to expect strong operating performance in our core businesses and have refined our operating EPS projection to $7.95 to $8.05 per share. Our performance in the quarter and year-to-date reflects many elements of our growth strategy. The main pillars of the strategy are: positioning Aetna to participate in key industry growth drivers, particularly in government-sponsored programs; leading the evolution of the provider model from volume- to value-based care; and transforming Aetna into a consumer-centric company. While the Humana acquisition enhances these efforts, let me spend a few minutes discussing the progress we have made year-to-date delivering on these strategic pillars. 
Beginning with growing our Government business. The performance of our Medicare business continues to be very strong. During the quarter, we grew medical membership by nearly 50,000 members sequentially; drove year-over-year quarterly premium growth of more than 17%; and produced solid operating margins, consistent with our targeted range. We have also positioned the company to continue to grow in Medicare by: expanding our geographic footprint, providing over 4 million additional eligible Medicare beneficiaries access to Aetna MA products beginning with this annual election period; improving our star's performance for the third consecutive year, achieving over 90% of membership in 4 star or greater plans, best-in-class among our publicly-traded peers; and introducing proprietary group MA exchange solutions that produced multiple group contract wins for January 2017. Our strong membership growth in Medicare Advantage speaks to the execution of our growth strategy in Medicare. Looking forward, we believe we are well positioned to carry this momentum throughout this current annual election period and beyond. 
Shifting to our Medicaid business. From a financial performance perspective, our Medicaid business is having another good year. More specifically, in the third quarter, we added nearly 50,000 members; we grew quarterly premiums by nearly 13% compared to the same period last year; and we are on track to achieve our pretax operating margin target for the year. From a longer-term perspective, we continue to see opportunities for Aetna to grow in Medicaid. While disappointed by the results of our procurement efforts in a number of important Medicaid contracts this year, we have taken what we have learned from these experiences to develop a refreshed approach to our procurement process. Combined with our already strong capabilities in managing Medicaid members, particularly high-acuity populations, we are confident in our ability to grow our Medicaid business. Our recent selection to participate in Virginia's managed LTSS and Nevada's managed Medicaid program speaks to Aetna's underlying capabilities to effectively serve these populations. 
We also continue to advance our efforts to help transform the health care system. Over 40% of Aetna's medical spend currently runs through some form of value-based care model today, and we are making solid progress to achieving our 2020 goal of 75%. Our collaborations with health care providers span a wide spectrum of value-based care models, including joint ventures. Our value-based care efforts are not limited to collaborations with the physicians and hospital systems. Earlier this month, we announced that Merck will be among the first companies to participate in AetnaCare, an innovative approach which uses predictive analytics to identify target populations and proactively curate various health and wellness services that are available. In coordination with the patient's physicians and caregivers, the program will aim to support treatment adherence, ensure that critical support needs are met and reinforce healthy lifestyle behaviors. We are also collaborating with Merck in a previously disclosed value-based contract for the treatment of diabetes. Through this value-based contract, Merck and Aetna will work to advance our common goal of helping patients with Type 2 diabetes effectively manage their condition to enable them to maximize their number of healthy days. 
Shifting to our consumer engagement efforts. We made meaningful progress in the quarter and year-to-date to transform Aetna into a consumer-centric company. Specifically, we continue to use our bswift platform to enhance the consumer shopping and enrollment experience. For 2017, members in many of our group Medicare Advantage and Small Group plans will have access to bswift's decision support tools and intuitive user interface, creating a more user-friendly and analytically-driven enrollment experience. We also announced a collaboration with Apple, combining the power of iOS apps and the unmatched consumer experience of Apple with Aetna's strong expertise in database wellness and care management programs. With support from Apple, we plan to develop several health initiatives starting with apps that engage consumers. We are excited by this opportunity as we continue to drive Aetna's consumer-centric transformation. 
Before I turn the call over to Shawn to discuss our third quarter results in more detail, I would like to say a few words about the proposed Humana acquisition. We began this journey over 18 months ago, and despite Humana's Medicare star ratings performance, we remain convinced to the strategic and financial merits of the acquisition. The Humana acquisition will accelerate our 3 main strategic pillars, enabling the combined company to provide more competitive products with a more engaging consumer experience to help people we serve achieve their personal health goals. We remain committed to defending our acquisition in court, and we are confident that we will close the transaction. 
In summary, we are pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date performance. I want to thank our employees for their efforts in delivering another strong quarter for Aetna and our shareholders, as well as those employees at both Aetna and Humana who continue to work tirelessly to plan a successful integration. 
I will now turn the call over to Shawn, who will provide additional insight into our third quarter results, our updated 2016 outlook and provide some preliminary thoughts on 2017. Shawn?"
655542,404212568,1063421,"Aetna Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Aetna Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported third quarter 2016 operating earnings of $734 million, a 10% increase over the prior year quarter and operating earnings per share of $2.07. Aetna's operating results continue to be s",1415,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported third quarter 2016 operating earnings of $734 million, a 10% increase over the prior year quarter and operating earnings per share of $2.07. Aetna's operating results continue to be supported by solid top line growth, cash flow and operating margins. 
I'll begin with some comments on overall performance. From a top line perspective, we grew medical membership sequentially by 143,000 to over 23.1 million, and we grew operating revenue by 5% over the prior year to $15.7 billion, driven by higher health care premium yields and membership growth in our Government business, partially offset by membership attrition in our Individual and Small Group Commercial products.
From an operating margin perspective, our portfolio of businesses is performing quite well. Our pretax operating margin was 8.5%, a very strong result and consistent with our target operating margin range. Our third quarter total health medical benefit ratio was 82%, a good result overall, but one that continues to be impacted by the performance of our ACA-compliant Small Group and Individual products. Our adjusted operating expense ratio was 17.6%, a 100 basis point improvement over the third quarter of 2015. This year-over-year improvement speaks to our disciplined focus on managing our operating costs as we continue to grow our top line. 
From a balance sheet perspective, we remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves. We experienced favorable prior period reserve development in the quarter across all of our core products, primarily attributable to second quarter dates of service. Our reserve growth exceeded our premium growth and days claims payable were 57 days at the end of the quarter, a sequential increase of about 1 day and a year-over-year increase of almost 3 days. 
Turning to cash flow and capital. Year-to-date operating cash flow had been strong. Health Care and Group Insurance operating cash flows were approximately 2.1x operating earnings, driven by strong operating results and the timing of Medicare premium receipts, as we received an advance payment in the quarter associated with October 2016. We did not repurchase any shares during the quarter. However, we did return $88 million to shareholders through our quarterly shareholder dividend. In short, we are pleased with our third quarter results and the continued successful execution of our growth strategy. 
I will now discuss the key drivers of our third quarter performance in greater detail, beginning with our Commercial fee-based business, which continues to perform well. We added 117,000 ASC members in the quarter, driven by several new public and labor customers. This added membership, combined with fee yields, drove solid year-over-year fee revenue growth of 4%. Pretax operating margins also remained healthy, continuing the trend from the first half of the year. 
In our Commercial Insured business, our membership declined by roughly 70,000 members in the quarter, primarily the result of attrition in our Individual and Small Group membership, directionally consistent with our expectations. Our Commercial medical benefit ratio was 83.8% for the quarter. This result reflects the continuation of medical cost pressure in our ACA-compliant Individual and Small Group products. 
Let me spend a few moments quantifying the impact of our ACA-compliant products in more detail. Beginning with our Individual products. Our third quarter Commercial MBR reflects ongoing challenges with these products as well as an increase in the premium deficiency reserve to $85 million from $65 million at the end of the second quarter. Based on our third quarter results, our full year pretax operating loss in our Individual Commercial products is now projected to be approximately $350 million, further validating our decision to reduce our 2017 exposure to these products. 
Moving on to our ACA-compliant Small Group insured products. Our underwriting results in the third quarter were pressured by the previously disclosed higher morbidity of this population, combined with our updated estimate of 2016 risk adjustment payables, which further pressured our Commercial MBR in the quarter. While our ACA-compliant products continue to weigh on 2016 results, we are confident that our strategic decision to reduce our footprint will reduce our financial exposure to these products in 2017. Based on year-to-date results, the majority of our Group Commercial products are performing largely consistent with our expectation for moderately increasing medical trend. As a result, we continue to project that our 2016 non-ACA core commercial medical cost trends will be in the 6% to 7% range. 
Shifting to our Government business. Our strong first half momentum extended into the third quarter. We grew medical membership by nearly 100,000 members in the quarter, including growth of: 20,000 Medicare Advantage, 30,000 Medicare Supplement and 47,000 Medicaid members. As a result of the strong medical membership growth, we grew our third quarter 2016 Government premiums by nearly 16% compared to the prior year period to $6.6 billion. Government premiums now represent nearly 50% of our total Health Care premiums. Our Government medical benefit ratio was 80.1%, a very strong result, driven by year-over-year improvement in both Medicare and Medicaid. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Our financial position, capital structure and liquidity all continued to be very strong. At September 30, we had a debt to total capitalization ratio of approximately 53%, which reflects the debt financing that we completed in June to fund the pending Humana acquisition. 
Looking at cash and investments at the parent. We started the quarter with approximately $2.1 billion. Net subsidiary dividends to the parent were $317 million. We paid a shareholder dividend of $88 million. And excluding the funds raised from our debt financing in June, we ended the quarter with approximately $2.3 billion of cash at the parent. Including the funds from the June debt financing, we ended the quarter with approximately $15.2 billion. Our basic share count was approximately 351 million at September 30. Based on our year-to-date performance, we are refining our 2016 operating earnings per share guidance to a range of $7.95 to $8.05 per share. This reflects continued strong performance in our Government business and continued focus on operating costs, offset by our updated margin projections for our ACA-compliant products. Our updated 2016 guidance also reflects our year-end membership projection of approximately 23 million members, with ACA-compliant Small Group and Individual membership attrition projected to be the largest driver of membership movement in the fourth quarter. The balance of our 2016 guidance metrics remain unchanged and can be found on our guidance summary. 
Looking beyond 2016. With the DOJ trial date set for December, we are now planning for a 2017 closing of the Humana acquisition. We believe the strategic underpinnings of the combination and the financial case remains strong. While developments since we announced the transaction have altered some of the specific parts, the sum of these parts is still within our set of initial assumptions. We don't typically provide forward year guidance on our third quarter call and will not do so today. However, with the potential for a 2017 closing of the Humana acquisition, I want to provide directional commentary on some of the notable moving pieces that are likely to influence our initial projections for Aetna's 2017 baseline earnings. While we are still early in the forecasting process, we see a number of challenges in 2017. From an operating revenue perspective, these include: the previously disclosed reduction in our Individual public exchange footprint, the projected impact of the suspension of the health insurer fee, the projected impact of known Medicaid contract losses and the projected impact of our continued strategy to improve margins in our Small Group ACA products. We project these top line challenges will pressure our ability to grow operating revenue in 2017. However, we believe the Humana acquisition has the potential to mitigate these top line challenges. 
We also see opportunities in 2017, including: the projection for continued above-industry growth in our Individual Medicare Advantage products, driven by our industry-leading stars position; the projection that our reduced Individual public exchange footprint will improve the financial performance of these products in 2017 as compared to 2016; and the projection for year-over-year improvement in the financial performance of our Small Group ACA products.
In closing, as we begin the final quarter of 2016 and continue our planning for 2017, we remain encouraged by the strength of our third quarter and year-to-date results despite some meaningful challenges. We also remain confident that we can close the Humana transaction and are committed to realizing our long-term growth objectives.

If you were to think about it from an operating income standpoint, it seems to me you've got some positive things happening, like the elimination of your exchange losses and the potential for capital deployment, either in buying Humana or restarting your share repurchase program.

I will just offer some comments, though, on what you said.

That adjustment would be between $0.40 and $0.45 for this year. And at this point, we have no intention to change that convention. In terms of the capital deployment, you are right in the event that we will have some capital. Whether that capital goes to the Humana deal or other uses is to be determined. The allocation of that capital is something that we still need to determine. As you recall, our first priority always with capital is to do something to sort of grow the business and add long-term value, and then we consider some of the other uses like share repurchase and the shareholder dividend. The final comment I'd make on the Individual business is, I would not get so bullish to think that we are eliminating all the loss in that business next year. I think we have taken steps to improve that outcome. But from where we've come on this site, I do not think that, that is something that one should assume at this point."

And then, Mark, do you have any idea of how we could fix the ACA? What you need to see to get back in?"

That allows us the capability should the regulations and the law get right in order to reenter exchanges. But that probably won't be much before -- it won't be before 2019, more likely 2020. What needs to change is largely around the risk adjustment mechanism. Right now, we have a risk adjustment mechanism that has a centering point on the average population in the pool. The population in the pool is largely people who are too young for Medicare, chronically ill and older. And until that changes, the center point is probably 10% to 15% below breakeven. So if you look at industry losses, based on the revenue associated with it, they pretty much track to that number. So what we have in a zero-sum risk adjustment mechanism is a mechanism that takes people who are losing less money and taking that money and giving it to people who are losing more money, so everybody loses the same money. And until that mechanism changes or until the pool subsequently changes, we're going to find ourselves in a premium spiral that's going to continue to drive rates up, good risk out and ultimately create a very bad risk pool for the overall mechanism."

So we expect that, that will serve to mitigate the pressure that -- some of the pressure that we've had there this year. Conceptually, in any given market, could there be more anti-selection to hit that book? Of course. I mean, that's -- this book is proven difficult to predict over the last 3 years. The thing I would say is, behind our decision-making here, this was really about risk management, and we wanted to reduce the capital commitment behind this business. We wanted to reduce the losses, and frankly, we wanted to reduce the variability and outcome of those losses in terms of sort of establishing that footprint and what the plan offerings are. So if you were to look at our off-exchange footprint, the reason we had to announce by August 15 was that the off-exchange markets we were withdrawing from, particularly the types of products, would presage our inability to maintain on-exchange presence. So that's sort of the way to look at it. Our off-exchange product offerings and markets sort of gave a heads up to everybody who's calling the insurance department every month that we were going to be pulling off of on-exchange markets by September 23."

This morning, Aetna reported third quarter operating EPS of $2.07, driven by 10% year-over-year growth in operating earnings. Underlying our solid third quarter performance, we grew membership sequentially by 143,000 members across Large Group Commercial, Medicare and Medicaid. We grew operating revenue by 5% to $15.7 billion. Operating results in our Government business remain robust. We continue to drive operating efficiencies, as evidenced by our 17.6% adjusted operating expense ratio, and we achieved high single-digit pretax operating margins, consistent with our long-term target. 
We are pleased with our third quarter results, which continue to reflect the solid performance of our core businesses. As we look to the final quarter of 2016, we continue to expect strong operating performance in our core businesses and have refined our operating EPS projection to $7.95 to $8.05 per share. Our performance in the quarter and year-to-date reflects many elements of our growth strategy. The main pillars of the strategy are: positioning Aetna to participate in key industry growth drivers, particularly in government-sponsored programs; leading the evolution of the provider model from volume- to value-based care; and transforming Aetna into a consumer-centric company. While the Humana acquisition enhances these efforts, let me spend a few minutes discussing the progress we have made year-to-date delivering on these strategic pillars. 
Beginning with growing our Government business. The performance of our Medicare business continues to be very strong. During the quarter, we grew medical membership by nearly 50,000 members sequentially; drove year-over-year quarterly premium growth of more than 17%; and produced solid operating margins, consistent with our targeted range. We have also positioned the company to continue to grow in Medicare by: expanding our geographic footprint, providing over 4 million additional eligible Medicare beneficiaries access to Aetna MA products beginning with this annual election period; improving our star's performance for the third consecutive year, achieving over 90% of membership in 4 star or greater plans, best-in-class among our publicly-traded peers; and introducing proprietary group MA exchange solutions that produced multiple group contract wins for January 2017. Our strong membership growth in Medicare Advantage speaks to the execution of our growth strategy in Medicare. Looking forward, we believe we are well positioned to carry this momentum throughout this current annual election period and beyond. 
Shifting to our Medicaid business. From a financial performance perspective, our Medicaid business is having another good year. More specifically, in the third quarter, we added nearly 50,000 members; we grew quarterly premiums by nearly 13% compared to the same period last year; and we are on track to achieve our pretax operating margin target for the year. From a longer-term perspective, we continue to see opportunities for Aetna to grow in Medicaid. While disappointed by the results of our procurement efforts in a number of important Medicaid contracts this year, we have taken what we have learned from these experiences to develop a refreshed approach to our procurement process. Combined with our already strong capabilities in managing Medicaid members, particularly high-acuity populations, we are confident in our ability to grow our Medicaid business. Our recent selection to participate in Virginia's managed LTSS and Nevada's managed Medicaid program speaks to Aetna's underlying capabilities to effectively serve these populations. 
We also continue to advance our efforts to help transform the health care system. Over 40% of Aetna's medical spend currently runs through some form of value-based care model today, and we are making solid progress to achieving our 2020 goal of 75%. Our collaborations with health care providers span a wide spectrum of value-based care models, including joint ventures. Our value-based care efforts are not limited to collaborations with the physicians and hospital systems. Earlier this month, we announced that Merck will be among the first companies to participate in AetnaCare, an innovative approach which uses predictive analytics to identify target populations and proactively curate various health and wellness services that are available. In coordination with the patient's physicians and caregivers, the program will aim to support treatment adherence, ensure that critical support needs are met and reinforce healthy lifestyle behaviors. We are also collaborating with Merck in a previously disclosed value-based contract for the treatment of diabetes. Through this value-based contract, Merck and Aetna will work to advance our common goal of helping patients with Type 2 diabetes effectively manage their condition to enable them to maximize their number of healthy days. 
Shifting to our consumer engagement efforts. We made meaningful progress in the quarter and year-to-date to transform Aetna into a consumer-centric company. Specifically, we continue to use our bswift platform to enhance the consumer shopping and enrollment experience. For 2017, members in many of our group Medicare Advantage and Small Group plans will have access to bswift's decision support tools and intuitive user interface, creating a more user-friendly and analytically-driven enrollment experience. We also announced a collaboration with Apple, combining the power of iOS apps and the unmatched consumer experience of Apple with Aetna's strong expertise in database wellness and care management programs. With support from Apple, we plan to develop several health initiatives starting with apps that engage consumers. We are excited by this opportunity as we continue to drive Aetna's consumer-centric transformation. 
Before I turn the call over to Shawn to discuss our third quarter results in more detail, I would like to say a few words about the proposed Humana acquisition. We began this journey over 18 months ago, and despite Humana's Medicare star ratings performance, we remain convinced to the strategic and financial merits of the acquisition. The Humana acquisition will accelerate our 3 main strategic pillars, enabling the combined company to provide more competitive products with a more engaging consumer experience to help people we serve achieve their personal health goals. We remain committed to defending our acquisition in court, and we are confident that we will close the transaction. 
In summary, we are pleased with our third quarter and year-to-date performance. I want to thank our employees for their efforts in delivering another strong quarter for Aetna and our shareholders, as well as those employees at both Aetna and Humana who continue to work tirelessly to plan a successful integration. 
I will now turn the call over to Shawn, who will provide additional insight into our third quarter results, our updated 2016 outlook and provide some preliminary thoughts on 2017. Shawn?"
655542,404212568,1064505,"Aetna Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Aetna Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported third quarter 2016 operating earnings of $734 million, a 10% increase over the prior year quarter and operating earnings per share of $2.07. Aetna's operating results continue to be s",1415,"Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported third quarter 2016 operating earnings of $734 million, a 10% increase over the prior year quarter and operating earnings per share of $2.07. Aetna's operating results continue to be supported by solid top line growth, cash flow and operating margins. 
I'll begin with some comments on overall performance. From a top line perspective, we grew medical membership sequentially by 143,000 to over 23.1 million, and we grew operating revenue by 5% over the prior year to $15.7 billion, driven by higher health care premium yields and membership growth in our Government business, partially offset by membership attrition in our Individual and Small Group Commercial products.
From an operating margin perspective, our portfolio of businesses is performing quite well. Our pretax operating margin was 8.5%, a very strong result and consistent with our target operating margin range. Our third quarter total health medical benefit ratio was 82%, a good result overall, but one that continues to be impacted by the performance of our ACA-compliant Small Group and Individual products. Our adjusted operating expense ratio was 17.6%, a 100 basis point improvement over the third quarter of 2015. This year-over-year improvement speaks to our disciplined focus on managing our operating costs as we continue to grow our top line. 
From a balance sheet perspective, we remain confident in the adequacy of our reserves. We experienced favorable prior period reserve development in the quarter across all of our core products, primarily attributable to second quarter dates of service. Our reserve growth exceeded our premium growth and days claims payable were 57 days at the end of the quarter, a sequential increase of about 1 day and a year-over-year increase of almost 3 days. 
Turning to cash flow and capital. Year-to-date operating cash flow had been strong. Health Care and Group Insurance operating cash flows were approximately 2.1x operating earnings, driven by strong operating results and the timing of Medicare premium receipts, as we received an advance payment in the quarter associated with October 2016. We did not repurchase any shares during the quarter. However, we did return $88 million to shareholders through our quarterly shareholder dividend. In short, we are pleased with our third quarter results and the continued successful execution of our growth strategy. 
I will now discuss the key drivers of our third quarter performance in greater detail, beginning with our Commercial fee-based business, which continues to perform well. We added 117,000 ASC members in the quarter, driven by several new public and labor customers. This added membership, combined with fee yields, drove solid year-over-year fee revenue growth of 4%. Pretax operating margins also remained healthy, continuing the trend from the first half of the year. 
In our Commercial Insured business, our membership declined by roughly 70,000 members in the quarter, primarily the result of attrition in our Individual and Small Group membership, directionally consistent with our expectations. Our Commercial medical benefit ratio was 83.8% for the quarter. This result reflects the continuation of medical cost pressure in our ACA-compliant Individual and Small Group products. 
Let me spend a few moments quantifying the impact of our ACA-compliant products in more detail. Beginning with our Individual products. Our third quarter Commercial MBR reflects ongoing challenges with these products as well as an increase in the premium deficiency reserve to $85 million from $65 million at the end of the second quarter. Based on our third quarter results, our full year pretax operating loss in our Individual Commercial products is now projected to be approximately $350 million, further validating our decision to reduce our 2017 exposure to these products. 
Moving on to our ACA-compliant Small Group insured products. Our underwriting results in the third quarter were pressured by the previously disclosed higher morbidity of this population, combined with our updated estimate of 2016 risk adjustment payables, which further pressured our Commercial MBR in the quarter. While our ACA-compliant products continue to weigh on 2016 results, we are confident that our strategic decision to reduce our footprint will reduce our financial exposure to these products in 2017. Based on year-to-date results, the majority of our Group Commercial products are performing largely consistent with our expectation for moderately increasing medical trend. As a result, we continue to project that our 2016 non-ACA core commercial medical cost trends will be in the 6% to 7% range. 
Shifting to our Government business. Our strong first half momentum extended into the third quarter. We grew medical membership by nearly 100,000 members in the quarter, including growth of: 20,000 Medicare Advantage, 30,000 Medicare Supplement and 47,000 Medicaid members. As a result of the strong medical membership growth, we grew our third quarter 2016 Government premiums by nearly 16% compared to the prior year period to $6.6 billion. Government premiums now represent nearly 50% of our total Health Care premiums. Our Government medical benefit ratio was 80.1%, a very strong result, driven by year-over-year improvement in both Medicare and Medicaid. 
Moving on to the balance sheet. Our financial position, capital structure and liquidity all continued to be very strong. At September 30, we had a debt to total capitalization ratio of approximately 53%, which reflects the debt financing that we completed in June to fund the pending Humana acquisition. 
Looking at cash and investments at the parent. We started the quarter with approximately $2.1 billion. Net subsidiary dividends to the parent were $317 million. We paid a shareholder dividend of $88 million. And excluding the funds raised from our debt financing in June, we ended the quarter with approximately $2.3 billion of cash at the parent. Including the funds from the June debt financing, we ended the quarter with approximately $15.2 billion. Our basic share count was approximately 351 million at September 30. Based on our year-to-date performance, we are refining our 2016 operating earnings per share guidance to a range of $7.95 to $8.05 per share. This reflects continued strong performance in our Government business and continued focus on operating costs, offset by our updated margin projections for our ACA-compliant products. Our updated 2016 guidance also reflects our year-end membership projection of approximately 23 million members, with ACA-compliant Small Group and Individual membership attrition projected to be the largest driver of membership movement in the fourth quarter. The balance of our 2016 guidance metrics remain unchanged and can be found on our guidance summary. 
Looking beyond 2016. With the DOJ trial date set for December, we are now planning for a 2017 closing of the Humana acquisition. We believe the strategic underpinnings of the combination and the financial case remains strong. While developments since we announced the transaction have altered some of the specific parts, the sum of these parts is still within our set of initial assumptions. We don't typically provide forward year guidance on our third quarter call and will not do so today. However, with the potential for a 2017 closing of the Humana acquisition, I want to provide directional commentary on some of the notable moving pieces that are likely to influence our initial projections for Aetna's 2017 baseline earnings. While we are still early in the forecasting process, we see a number of challenges in 2017. From an operating revenue perspective, these include: the previously disclosed reduction in our Individual public exchange footprint, the projected impact of the suspension of the health insurer fee, the projected impact of known Medicaid contract losses and the projected impact of our continued strategy to improve margins in our Small Group ACA products. We project these top line challenges will pressure our ability to grow operating revenue in 2017. However, we believe the Humana acquisition has the potential to mitigate these top line challenges. 
We also see opportunities in 2017, including: the projection for continued above-industry growth in our Individual Medicare Advantage products, driven by our industry-leading stars position; the projection that our reduced Individual public exchange footprint will improve the financial performance of these products in 2017 as compared to 2016; and the projection for year-over-year improvement in the financial performance of our Small Group ACA products.
In closing, as we begin the final quarter of 2016 and continue our planning for 2017, we remain encouraged by the strength of our third quarter and year-to-date results despite some meaningful challenges. We also remain confident that we can close the Humana transaction and are committed to realizing our long-term growth objectives.

I will just offer some comments, though, on what you said. You are correct, it's been our long-held convention that our initial guidance for any calendar year excludes the effect of prior year development. That adjustment would be between $0.40 and $0.45 for this year. And at this point, we have no intention to change that convention. In terms of the capital deployment, you are right in the event that we will have some capital. Whether that capital goes to the Humana deal or other uses is to be determined. The allocation of that capital is something that we still need to determine. As you recall, our first priority always with capital is to do something to sort of grow the business and add long-term value, and then we consider some of the other uses like share repurchase and the shareholder dividend. The final comment I'd make on the Individual business is, I would not get so bullish to think that we are eliminating all the loss in that business next year. I think we have taken steps to improve that outcome. But from where we've come on this site, I do not think that, that is something that one should assume at this point."

That allows us the capability should the regulations and the law get right in order to reenter exchanges. But that probably won't be much before -- it won't be before 2019, more likely 2020. What needs to change is largely around the risk adjustment mechanism. Right now, we have a risk adjustment mechanism that has a centering point on the average population in the pool. The population in the pool is largely people who are too young for Medicare, chronically ill and older. And until that changes, the center point is probably 10% to 15% below breakeven. So if you look at industry losses, based on the revenue associated with it, they pretty much track to that number. So what we have in a zero-sum risk adjustment mechanism is a mechanism that takes people who are losing less money and taking that money and giving it to people who are losing more money, so everybody loses the same money. And until that mechanism changes or until the pool subsequently changes, we're going to find ourselves in a premium spiral that's going to continue to drive rates up, good risk out and ultimately create a very bad risk pool for the overall mechanism."

We wanted to reduce the losses, and frankly, we wanted to reduce the variability and outcome of those losses in terms of sort of establishing that footprint and what the plan offerings are. So if you were to look at our off-exchange footprint, the reason we had to announce by August 15 was that the off-exchange markets we were withdrawing from, particularly the types of products, would presage our inability to maintain on-exchange presence.

We made estimates off of the current book of business, which, by the way, turned over almost 55% this last year. We had a certain frame of competitors in each market, which has already changed. More people have left the exchanges since we have. And so until we get a look at what the membership looks like, we're not going to really be able to nail the number with any degree of certainty. We certainly did it to reduce fairly dramatically the amount of capital we had at risk and the amount of losses we would sustain. Negative returns on invested capital are not sustainable over the long term, and so we try to reduce both."

Throughout the year, it sounds like the Government business has made up for the fact that there's some pressure on the ACA-compliant businesses throughout the year. You still -- although characterize both Medicaid and Medicare as kind of in your target margin ranges, would it be fair to say they're kind of now at the higher end of that range? I guess trying to think about, directionally, would we expect maybe reversion of the Government book next year? Or are we kind of where you would expect?"

So we were able to give those more in benefits and to preserve margins in the business. But there are only so far you can go, so that should help our growth come January 1. There are other markets where we were not necessarily performing up to oil and we had to correct those. But all in all, what we tried to do was make sure that we weren't having to pay rebates that we made sure that we gave those back in benefits to seniors. We preserved margins and we kept as many 0 premium plans as possible."
