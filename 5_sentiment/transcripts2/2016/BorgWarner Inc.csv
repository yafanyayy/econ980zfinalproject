Thank you for joining us this morning for the call. As Ken alluded to, I'm going to provide some high-level commentary around both the industry and around BorgWarner.

As Ken alluded to, I'm going to provide some high-level commentary around both the industry and around BorgWarner. I'll give a brief recap of some of our financial numbers and then Ron will go through the details around those numbers. 
So I'm now on Slide 1, for those of you following along with the deck, and I'm just going to provide a few overview comments about the macro and industry. Let me just start at a general high-level. And I think what we're experiencing in BorgWarner, just like everybody else, in general, there's a lot of uncertainty out in the world, and whether that's reflected in oil prices, strength of the dollar, Middle Eastern challenges, we do see a lot of uncertainty out there. But I think what we also see is a pretty solid, solid auto industry. Now I'll provide more color and detail around that as I go through my comments here, but my message really is in spite of all of that macro uncertainty, we see strength in the auto sector. 
The other comment I'd like to just proactively talk a little bit about is China. And as you know, China's a really critical market for the growth of BorgWarner. So I want to spend a moment and just provide some overview there. So as we go into the year, we see GDP levels for China in the mid-single digit type of our range. We see auto production in a likely a quarter of [ph] production in about a 3% to 5% growth environment. We do see the incentive programs and initiatives that were enacted towards the end of last year. Our assumption is that they will continue on through the majority if not all of this year and you'll see later in our numbers that it provides some benefit for us. So our view on China is we see a decent level of stability around GDP and auto production, and that gives us encouragement with such a lot of growth for the business in China. 
I'll make a couple of comments specifically around the markets. I will start with saying our views on production numbers for light vehicle and commercial vehicle are pretty much aligned with IHS. And what that means for us, we see North America now starting to plateau or peak type numbers in the 17.5-ish range. We see China, as I alluded to earlier, about a 3% to 5% growth for light vehicle. And Europe, there environment for Europe is somewhere between a 1% and 2% growth environment for light vehicle production. Commercial vehicle, we see still remains quite challenged. We are going into a year where on an aggregate basis, globally, we see little or no growth in commercial vehicle. As you go around the regions in the segments, there is a little bit of differentiation, but fundamentally, we see still pretty challenged commercial vehicle space. 
I wanted to share with you what I would describe the areas of watch that we at BorgWarner are paying close attention to as the year evolves, and I would say the 3 major areas that we're paying a lot of attention to are commercial vehicle, as I mentioned, can there be some upside there. Could it deteriorate a lot worse. So we're paying a lot of attention to that. We're paying close attention to the China incentives and how that will play out through the year. And clearly, for us, our biggest customers remains Volkswagens. So we pay a lot of attention to what's going on at Volkswagen. But I would say, to summarize on the market outlook, I would say in summary, things are playing out as we expected as we came into the year, and that's what we're seeing reflected through the first 6 weeks of the year as we've gone forward. 
Let let me switch a moment and provide a couple of comments on the regulatory and technology environment. I would say very importantly for us, we still see a very strong drive for fuel economy and emissions regulations. We have seen no slippage in drive and interest from our customers around CAFE and other programs. In fact, I think the latest example we saw in Europe with the real driving emission standards, for us, points to further evidence of strong drive for enacting greater fuel economy and emission standards. We've also seen the pace of a transition to increase electrification of the Powertrain continues to go in momentum, and importantly, for everybody on the call to know, we're very aware of that because we are right in the middle of it as BorgWarner. We're meeting and discussing with multiple customers. Many different architectures involving our products on 12-volt, 48-volt, mild hybrids, pure electrics, the whole spectrum of electrified power trends. We're right in the middle of that, and that's what's driving and building our growth for the long term. I thought it would be good to share though the electrification effort for BorgWarner is not just a long-term phenomenon. As we look here, right now in the year of 2016, I just want to give you an example, we're on pace to ship about 15,000 single speed transmissions for pure electric vehicles in China this year. So it's both a now story and a future story. 
Last comment around diesel. At this point, we're not seeing any real shift in mix between gas and diesel in the short run. We do know, as we've talked about in prior calls, there will be a transition to more gas engines from diesel overtime and we feel BorgWarner's very well positioned to take advantage of that trend. 
Let me now switch and give a few high-level comments about BorgWarner specifically. I'll start with a recap of 2015, and again, Ron will provide a lot more detail and color around these numbers after myself. So from a Q4 perspective, it was really good finish to the year for us. I think from a growth perspective and an operating performance, we ended the year strongly. We were $2.1 billion of sales for the quarter, which is up 7% when we exclude both currency and Remy. And our EPS performance on a comparable basis is about 75% with strong performance and also the operating margins reported a 12.6, but significantly when we exclude Remy, that was an impressive 13.2%. If I break Q4 up by segment, Engine sales were about $1.4 billion, which is a growth of 1% on a reported basis, but 10% when we exclude currency. That was primarily driven by very strong turbocharger sales. On the Drivetrain side, for the quarter, $735 million. That's up 20%, but clearly Remy is a big influence there. When you strip out Remy, it was about 1% growth. 2 things impacted the growth on the oil -- on the Drivetrain side with very strong oil drive growth in North America, and that was offset by lower growth on transmissions in Europe. 
For the full year, sales reported $8 billion. That's down 3% from 2014. But when we exclude Remy and FX [indiscernible], it was up 4.3%. EPS $2.70. When we exclude non-comparables and Remy, it was $3.02 per share. Operating margin for the full year 13%, again, when we exclude Remy, an impressive 13.2%. And I thank key for the business is we continue to drive investment further growth for the future of the company. And then the 2 key metrics I focus on for to make sure we're driving that growth CapEx, CapEx came in at 7.2% for the year; and R&D was about 4% when we exclude Remy. Both of those give me strong confidence that we're investing for the future. 
Now 2015's behind us and we're into 2016. So let me move and give some comments on 2016. I would say as we've started into the year and as we've gone into the year, we have an optimistic view on the year. We feel good about the year ahead of us. And today we're reiterating our guidance, both for the Q1 and the full year that we're announced in Detroit last month, and again, Ron will provide detailed commentary around that in a moment. I'm also pleased that we've largely got the restructuring efforts that we've put a lot of work into over the last 18 months behind us. So we can get that benefit as we go into the year. And we're heading into the year on pace to deliver mid-single digit growth and strong operating performance. 
The last thing I'd like to address is just some highlights around growth for the company. Let me just start to make a few comments about Remy. We're very, very pleased with the acquisition. I think from a strategic perspective, this is a really critical transaction for BorgWarner, and we're going to talk more about that through the year. The integration on a pragmatic basis has gone very well. But from an operating perspective and a financial perspective. But I think I want to comment positive we are on the technology. And as I mentioned earlier, we've got multiple customers engaged in discussions around the combination of the Remy product line and the BorgWarner product line, particularly a lot of discussion around the combination of Remy's rotating electric motor machine and our clutch technology around hybrid vehicles. A lot of emphasis and a lot of momentum we're gaining. A couple of other recent growth announcements that we've made. We did announce the GEN 5 electrohydraulic all wheel drive coupling that will be on the Volvo XE 90 vehicle and we also announced Engine timing and VCT product lines on the Hyundai V6 gas engines. I would say that I quote in our booking cadence remains strong and solid and is in line with our growth expectations. And as I mentioned earlier, the drive on electrification around the Powertrain momentum continues for us. 
So I would summarize it this way. 2015, we had some challenges in 2015. We acknowledge that and we're now going forward into 2016 with a lot of confidence. The business is operating very well. We're heavily focused on driving the growth that we need through the adoption of our technology. And I think last and most importantly, we're upbeat and we're very positive about delivering on the guidance that Ron is going to take you through right now. 
So with that, I'll turn the call over to Ron. Thank you."

Before I begin reviewing the financials, I would like to commend all of our employees for their hard work in the quarter, and more specifically, a great finish to the year. Also, as Ken mentioned, I will be referring to the supplemental financial slide deck that is posted on our IR website. I encourage you to follow along. 
Now on to our financials. Let's start on Slide 3. Sales on a reported basis were up 6.6%. However, to get a clearer picture of how the core business performed, we exclude impact of FX and Remy, and excluding those items, sales were up 7.1%. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 21% in the quarter or 21.4%, excluding Remy, up 70 basis points from a year ago. SG&A as a percentage of sales was 8.4%, again, excluding Remy, SG&A was 8.2% of sales, a 30 basis points improvement from a year ago. R&D spending, which has included in SG&A, was 3.6% of sales. I would like to point out, Remy did impact that number by 20 basis points. It was probably 3.8% without Remy. 
Now looks -- now let's look at the year-over-year comparison for operating income, which can be found on page -- on Slide 4. Starting on the right. Fourth quarter 2015 operating income adjusted for noncomparable items, including Remy, was $269 million or 12.6% of sales. Excluding Remy's $8 million of net contribution to operating income, operating income was $261 million or 13.2% of sales up 80 basis points from a year ago. Excluding noncomparable items, Remy and FX, operating income was up $34 million or $141 million of higher sales. That gives us an incremental margin of 25% -- 24% in the quarter. A reconciliation of the reported operating income to operating income adjusted for noncomparable items plus Remy can be found in the appendix on page -- Slide 9. For full year, our income [indiscernible] margin, excluding noncomparable margins, Remy and impact of foreign currency was 19%. Very good performance despite some operational efficiencies related to the drivetrain restructuring activities earlier in the year. 
As you look further down the income statement, equity and affiliate earnings was about $12 million in the quarter, in line with last year. Interest expense and finance charges were $18 million in the quarter, up from $10 million a year ago. The increase is primarily related to the $1 billion and the EUR 500 million fixed rate senior notes issued in the first and third quarters of 2015, respectively. Provision for income taxes for the quarter on a reported basis was $61 million. However, this included $12 million of net tax benefits associated with the noncomparable charges and an $8 million favorable tax adjustment. You can read about these items in our 10-K, which will be filed later today. But excluding these items, the provision for income taxes was $81 million or an effective tax rate of 30.7% in the quarter. Our effective tax rate for the full year was 29.8% or 30 basis points above our estimate. Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest was about $10 million in the quarter, up slightly from $8 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. That brings us back to net earnings, which were $125 million in the quarter. Net earnings, excluding the noncomparable items, but including Remy, was $173 million or $0.77 per diluted share. Now for comparisons with prior periods, net earnings, excluding noncomparable items and Remy, were $168 million or $0.75 per diluted share. 
Now let's take a closer look at the operating segments in the quarter. So beginning on Slide 5 of the deck. As James said earlier, reported Engine segment net sales were about $1.4 billion in the quarter. Sales growth for the Engine segment, excluding currency was 9.8% compared with the same period a year ago. 
Turning to Slide 6. Adjusted EBIT was $230 million for the Engine segment or 16.5% of sales. Excluding currency, the Engine segment's adjusted EBIT was up $19 million on $136 million of higher sales for an incremental margin of 14%. 
Turning to Slide 7 and starting with the right side. Drivetrain segment net sales were $735 million in the quarter. Excluding Remy and FX, sales growth in the Drivetrain segment was 1.3% compared with the same period a year ago. As James said earlier, higher all-wheel drive sales in North America were offset by lower transmission components sales in Europe. 
On Slide 8, adjusted EBIT was $81 million for the Drivetrain segment while 11% of sales. Excluding Remy, adjusted EBIT was 12.5% of sales, an impressive 180 basis point from a year ago. Excluding Remy and FX, the Drivetrain segments' adjusted EBIT was up $12 million on $8 million of higher sales for an incremental margin of 156%. I'd like to remind you that in Q4 2014, we incurred about a $5 million to $6 million headwind rate restructuring inefficiencies, which are behind us now. Drivetrain's 12.5% adjusted EBIT margin matches its best quarter performance ever. It was just 3 years ago that Drivetrain margins were running around 9%. At that time, we commenced improving the margins in the segment, and we are pleased with its progress. 
Now let's take a look at the balance sheet and cash flow. We generated $868 million of net cash from operating activities in 2015, up $66 million from a year ago. We had a very strong finish to the year generating nearly $400 million of cash in the fourth quarter driven by exceptional working capital management. Capital spending was $577 million in 2015, up $14 million from a year ago. As James said earlier, capital spending in 2014 and '15 was above our trend. We expect to return to normal spending levels beginning in 2016. Free cash flow, which we define as net cash from operating activities less capital spending, was $290 million in 2015, up $52 million from 2014 and $41 million above the high end of our guidance range provided in October. This positive trend is expected to continue. We expect to generate between $400 million and $475 million of free cash flow in 2016. At the midpoint, that is up 50% from 2015. $200 million to $300 million of free cash flow will be used to repurchase shares in 2016. 
Looking at the balance sheet itself. Balance sheet debt increased by $1.23 billion and cash decreased by $220 million. In 2015, compared with the end of 2014, the $1.45 billion increase in net debt was primarily driven due to Remy acquisition, capital expenditures, dividend payments to shareholders and share repurchases. We spent $350 million repurchasing 8.1 million shares in 2015, and that's on schedule for executing our $1 billion share repurchase program by the first quarter of 2018. Our net debt-to-capital ratio was 35.4% at the end of 2015, up from 12.8% at the end of 2014. Net debt-to-EBITDA at the end of the year on a trailing 12-month basis was 1.4x. 
Now I'd like to spend some time on our 2016 guidance, which is unchanged from our initial announcement. I'm going to go through the same numbers presented at the Deutsche Bank Global Auto Industry Conference that we did a couple of weeks ago. I would ask, please bear with me. I think in -- as a management team, we think it's really important to go through this and it will be very detailed, but nonetheless, we think it's very important that I do this. So let's start with sales growth guidance for the full year. 
I want to remind everybody, the baseline for 2015 net sales, excluding Remy, which was just under 7.9. So starting point is without Remy. So net new business pricing the market rate grow that are expected to drive 2.5 to 5.5 sales growth. Currency is expected to reduce sales growth within a range of 230 basis points at the low end and 80 basis points at the high end of the range. Those 2 items combined to equal 0.2% to 4.7% of expected sales growth for our base business in 2016. The Remy acquisition should add 13% to 13.5% growth leading to a 13.2% to 18.3% growth for the total company. From an operating performance perspective, we're expecting an 18% to 20% incremental margin on our core business sales growth. Included in this are $15 million to $25 million of tailwinds from the Drivetrain restructuring and increased efficiency related to the completion of that activity. These tailwinds will be partially offset by about $5 million of higher compliance and other corporate expenses. On a comparable basis, we expect our operating income margin to be greater than 13%, up from the prior year for the seventh year in a row. The Remy business is expected to deliver mid-single-digit margins this year. It's net contribution to operating income includes cost synergies and purchase accounting adjustments. So our consolidated operating income margin is expected to be above 12%. We expect earnings of $3.11 to $3.32 per share on a consolidated basis, which includes about $0.13 per share from Remy. Excluding Remy, we expect earnings to be $2.98 to $3.18 per share. 
So now let's review the first quarter guidance starting with sales growth. And again, this has been unchanged from what we gave guidance a little while ago. We expect net new business, pricing and market related growth of about a negative 3% to a positive 2.7%. As we said in January, we do expect higher light truck related volumes in North America, but this will be partially offset by 2 European transmission programs that began phasing out in the fourth quarter. We're also layer risk associated with the market volatility in China. Currency, is expected to reduce sales growth between 380 points -- basis points at the low end and to 240 basis points at the high end of the range. In 2015, the euro was at its highest point during the first quarter. If our currency assumptions for 2016 are correct, the impact on currency will be relatively severe in the first quarter, but less throughout the year. Those 2 items combined equal minus 4.1% at the low end and 0.3% at the high end of our core business. The Remy acquisition should add 12.4% to 13% growth leading to an 8.3% to 13.3% growth for the total company. We expect earnings of $0.75 to $0.79 per share on a consolidated basis, which does include about $0.03 per share from Remy. Excluding Remy, we expect earnings to be $0.72 to $0.75 per share. 
So let me summarize 2015. 2015 was a good year for BorgWarner. We grew mid-single-digits. We expanded our operating margins. We also completed the Remy acquisition. We completed the Drivetrain restructuring and we made capital investments to set the stage for continued growth and improved operating performance going forward. Now as we look into 2016 and beyond, we see improvements in a number of key areas. First and most important is the intensity around new product development to support impending electrification trend James mentioned earlier. I've never seen this intensity higher in this company since I've been here. There's no question in my mind that this will drive growth for many years. Second, operating income and cash flow will go higher. And finally, the future is bright for BorgWarner. 
So with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Ken."

That's behind us. So what you're getting is you're getting $6 million of flow through that we didn't have a headwind on in the fourth quarter this year versus last year. So that $12 million, half of it is just one area right here. Then as we go forward into '16, if you recall, if you go back in our notes, Q1 of '15 was about a $9 million headwind [ph] -- a $3 million headwind. And then we had another headwind in the second quarter as well. So obviously we're going to have those headwinds behind us in the first half of the year and we'll get tailwinds there. They'll have strong incrementals. And then we level out like I think you said in the back half of the year to more normalized margins. Hopefully, that helps."

So of that $12 million increase in operating income, half of it alone was just on having those inefficiencies in our phase, quite frankly. The other half I would just say is that business is improving. That was the whole point of the restructuring. And as we go forward, remember, we had Q1 and Q2 of last year, we still had these headwinds coming. It wasn't until 3 and 4 that the headwinds [indiscernible] and the margins, that incremental margins started returning. So the first half of '16 should have good tailwinds because we don't have those inefficiencies in front of us anymore and then they'll level out in the second half to more normal incremental margins."

I think what we've alluded to so far is we feel comfortable as we look out into the next couple of years that Remy's going to deliver good mid-single digit type growth for us. As you can imagine, that's primarily driven off the existing portfolio of products into new channels. So what I mean by that is this 2 primary channels of growth for us with the current product portfolio. One is customers. They have a relatively narrow band of customers and with BorgWarner's breadth of coverage on customers, that's going to drive content with our existing products. The second growth driver for us is a regional play where they have a strong position in North America. They're well positioned in China, but historically been quite weak in Europe. So that's going to be a series of opportunities for us to solve current portfolio products and that will drive the content growth over the next 2 or 3 years. Then to your point, in parallel to that, there's a lot of discussions that we're having with customers around combination products of the Remy architecture and the BorgWarner architecture. I would say there's a number of areas that we can talk more about this offline, but the most prevalent area of discussion right now is the notion of the P 2 [ph] hybrid architecture. So combining our clutching know-how together with their motor know-how. And we've got a lot of interest in that. That's likely to be a revenue stream that's probably 4 to 5 years out, but it's very active and driving it. So hopefully that gives you a sense of both the shorter-term growth levers in the longer term growth levers."

Thank you for joining us this morning for the call. As Ken alluded to, I'm going to provide some high-level commentary around both the industry and around BorgWarner.

As Ken alluded to, I'm going to provide some high-level commentary around both the industry and around BorgWarner. I'll give a brief recap of some of our financial numbers, and then Ron will go through the details around those numbers. 
So I'm now on Slide 1, for those of you following along with the deck, and I'm going to just provide a few overview comments about the macro and industry. Let me just start at a general high level. And I think what -- we're experiencing in BorgWarner, just like everybody else, in general, there's a lot of uncertainty out in the world, and whether that's reflected in oil prices, strength of the dollar, Middle Eastern challenges, we do see a lot of uncertainty out there. But I think what we also see is a pretty solid, solid auto industry. Now -- and I'll provide more color and detail around that as I go through my comments here, but my message really is in spite of all of that macro uncertainty, we see strength in the auto sector. 
The other comment I'd like to just proactively talk a little bit about is China. And as you know, China's a really critical market for the growth of BorgWarner. So I want to spend a moment and just provide some overview there. So as we go into the year, we see GDP levels for China in the mid-single digit type of a range. We see auto production -- light vehicle auto production in about a 3% to 5% growth environment. We do see this -- the incentive programs and initiatives that were enacted towards the end of last year, our assumption is that they will continue on through the majority, if not all, of this year and you'll see later in our numbers that did provide some benefit for us. So our view on China is we see a decent level of stability around GDP and auto production, and that gives us encouragement with such a lot of growth for the business in China. 
I'll make a couple of comments specifically around the markets. I would start with saying our views on production numbers for light vehicle and commercial vehicle are pretty much aligned with IHS. And what that means for us, we see North America now starting to plateau or peak-type numbers in the 17.5-ish range. We see China, as I alluded to earlier, at about a 3% to 5% growth for light vehicle. And Europe, the environment for Europe is somewhere between a 1% and 2% growth environment for light vehicle production. Commercial vehicle, we see, still remains quite challenged. We are going into a year where on an aggregate basis, globally, we see little or no growth in commercial vehicle. As you go around the regions in the segments, there is a little bit of differentiation, but fundamentally, we see still a pretty challenged commercial vehicle space. 
I wanted to share with you what I would describe the areas of watch that we, at BorgWarner, are paying close attention to as the year evolves, and I would say the 3 major areas that we're paying a lot of attention to are commercial vehicle, as I mentioned, can there be some upside there? Could it deteriorate a little worse? So we're paying a lot of attention to that. We're paying close attention to the China incentives and how that will play out through the year. And clearly, for us, our biggest customer remains Volkswagen. So we pay a lot of attention to what's going on at Volkswagen. But I would say -- to summarize on the market outlook, I would say, in summary, things are playing out as we had expected as we came into the year, and that's what we're seeing reflected through the first 6 weeks of the year as we've gone forward. 
Let me switch a moment and provide a couple of comments on the regulatory and technology environment. I would say very importantly for us, we still see a very strong drive for fuel economy and emissions regulations. We have seen no slippage in drive and interest from our customers around CAFE and other programs. In fact, I think the latest example we saw in Europe with the real driving emission standards, for us, points to further evidence of strong drive for enacting greater fuel economy and emission standards. We've also seen the pace of the transition to increased electrification of the powertrain continues to gain momentum, and importantly, for everybody on the call to know, we're very aware of that because we're right in the middle of it as BorgWarner. We are meeting and discussing with multiple customers, many different architectures involving our products on 12 volt, 48 volt, mild hybrids, pure electrics, the whole spectrum of electrified powertrains. We're right in the middle of that, and that's what's driving and building our growth for the long term. I thought it'd be good to share though the electrification effort for BorgWarner is not just a long-term phenomenon. As we look here, right now in the year of 2016, I just want to give you an example. We're on pace to ship about 15,000 single-speed transmissions for pure electric vehicles in China this year. So it's both a now story and a future story. 
Last comment around diesel. At this point, we're not seeing any real shift in mix between gas and diesel in the short run. We do know, as we've talked about in prior calls, there will be a transition to more gas engines from diesel over time and we feel BorgWarner's very well positioned to take advantage of that trend. 
Let me now switch and give a few high-level comments about BorgWarner, specifically. I'll start with a recap of 2015, and again, Ron will provide a lot more detail and color around these numbers after myself. So from a Q4 perspective, it was a really good finish to the year for us. I think, from a growth perspective and an operating performance, we ended the year strongly. We were $2.1 billion of sales for the quarter, which is up 7% when we exclude both currency and Remy. And our EPS performance on a comparable basis is about 75% with strong performance and also the operating margins reported a 12.6, but significantly, when we exclude Remy, that was an impressive 13.2%. If I break Q4 up by segment, Engine sales were about $1.4 billion, which is a growth of 1% on a reported basis, but 10% when we exclude currency. That was primarily driven by very strong turbocharger sales. On the Drivetrain side, for the quarter, $735 million. That's up 20%, but clearly Remy is a big influence there. When you strip out Remy, it was about 1% growth. 2 things impacted the growth on the Drivetrain side. We had very strong all-wheel drive growth in North America, and that was offset by lower growth on transmissions in Europe. 
For the full year, sales reported $8 billion. That's down 3% from 2014. But when we exclude Remy and FX and Wahler, it was up 4.3%. EPS $2.70. When we exclude noncomparables and Remy, it was $3.02 per share. Operating margin for the full year at 13%; again, when we exclude Remy, an impressive 13.2%. And I think key for the business is we continue to drive investment for the growth for the future of the company. And the 2 key metrics I focus on for -- to make sure we're driving that growth, CapEx. CapEx came in at 7.2% for the year; and R&D was about 4%, when we exclude Remy. Both of those give me strong confidence that we're investing for the future. 
Now 2015's behind us, and we're into 2016. So let me move and give some comments on 2016. I would say as we've started into the year and as we've gone into the year, we have an optimistic view on the year. We feel good about the year ahead of us. Today, we're reiterating our guidance, both for the Q1 and the full year that we announced in Detroit last month, and again, Ron will provide detailed commentary around that in a moment. I'm also pleased that we've largely got the restructuring efforts that we put a lot of work into over the last 18 months behind us. So we can get that benefit as we go into the year. And we're heading into the year on pace to deliver mid-single-digit growth and strong operating performance. 
The last thing I'd like to address is just some highlights around growth for the company. Let me just start and make a few comments about Remy. We're very, very pleased with the acquisition. I think from a strategic perspective, this was a really critical transaction for BorgWarner, and we're going to talk more about that through the year. The integration on a pragmatic basis has gone very well, both from an operating perspective and a financial perspective. But I think I want to comment how positive we are about the technology. And as I mentioned earlier, we've got multiple customers engaged in discussions around the combination of the Remy product line and the BorgWarner product line, particularly a lot of discussion around the combination of Remy's rotating electric motor machines and our clutch technology around hybrid vehicles, a lot of emphasis and a lot of momentum we're gaining. A couple of other recent growth announcements that we made. We did announce the GenV electrohydraulic all-wheel drive coupling that will be on the Volvo XC90 vehicle, and we also announced Engine timing and VCT product lines on the Hyundai V6 gas engines. I would say that I quote and our booking cadence remains strong and solid and is in line with our growth expectations. And as I mentioned earlier, the drive on electrification around the powertrain momentum continues for us. 
So I would summarize it this way. 2015, we had some challenges in 2015. We acknowledge that, and we're now going forward into 2016 with a lot of confidence. The business is operating very well. We're heavily focused on driving the growth that we need through the adoption of our technology. And I think last and most importantly, we're upbeat and we're very positive about delivering on the guidance that Ron's going to take you through right now. 
So with that, I'll turn the call over to Ron. Thank you."
25708,322094117,931701,"BorgWarner Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 11, 2016",2016-02-11,"Earnings Calls","BorgWarner Inc.","Executives","Thank you, James, and good day, everyone.

Before I begin reviewing the financials, I would like to commend all of our employees for their hard work in the quarter, and more specifically, a great finish to the year. Also, as Ken mentioned, I will be referring to the supplemental financial slide deck that is posted on our IR website. I encourage you to follow along. 
Now on to our financials. Let's start on Slide 3. Sales on a reported basis were up 6.6%. However, to get a clear picture of how the core business performed, we exclude impact of FX and Remy, and excluding those items, sales were up 7.1%. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 21% in the quarter or 21.4%, excluding Remy, up 70 basis points from a year ago. SG&A as a percentage of sales was 8.4%. Again, excluding Remy, SG&A was 8.2% of sales, a 30 basis points improvement from a year ago. R&D spending, which is included in SG&A, was 3.6% of sales. I would like to point out, Remy did impact that number by 20 basis points. It was probably 3.8% without Remy. 
Now looks -- now let's look at the year-over-year comparison for operating income, which can be found on page -- on Slide 4. Starting on the right. Fourth quarter 2015 operating income adjusted for noncomparable items, including Remy, was $269 million or 12.6% of sales. Excluding Remy's $8 million of net contribution to operating income, operating income was $261 million or 13.2% of sales, up 80 basis points from a year ago. Excluding noncomparable items, Remy and FX, operating income was up $34 million or $141 million of higher sales. That gives us an incremental margin of 25% -- 24% in the quarter. A reconciliation of the reported operating income to operating income adjusted for noncomparable items plus Remy can be found in the appendix on page -- Slide 9. For full year, our incremental margin, excluding noncomparable items, Remy and impact of foreign currency was 19%. Very good performance despite some operational efficiencies related to the Drivetrain restructuring activities earlier in the year. 
As you look further down the income statement, equity and affiliate earnings was about $12 million in the quarter, in line with last year. Interest expense and finance charges were $18 million in the quarter, up from $10 million a year ago. The increase is primarily related to the $1 billion and the EUR 500 million fixed rate senior notes issued in the first and third quarters of 2015, respectively. Provision for income taxes in the quarter on a reported basis was $61 million. However, this included $12 million of net tax benefits associated with the noncomparable charges and an $8 million favorable tax adjustment. You can read about these items in our 10-K, which will be filed later today. But excluding these items, the provision for income taxes was $81 million or an effective tax rate of 30.7% in the quarter. Our effective tax rate for the full year was 29.8% or 30 basis points above our estimate. Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest was about $10 million in the quarter, up slightly from $8 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. That brings us back to net earnings, which were $125 million in the quarter. Net earnings, excluding the noncomparable items, but including Remy, was $173 million or $0.77 per diluted share. Now for comparisons with prior periods, net earnings, excluding noncomparable items and Remy, were $168 million or $0.75 per diluted share. 
Now let's take a closer look at the operating segments in the quarter. So beginning on Slide 5 of the deck. As James said earlier, reported Engine segment net sales were about $1.4 billion in the quarter. Sales growth for the Engine segment, excluding currency was 9.8% compared with the same period a year ago. 
Turning to Slide 6. Adjusted EBIT was $230 million for the Engine segment or 16.5% of sales. Excluding currency, the Engine segment's adjusted EBIT was up $19 million on $136 million of higher sales for an incremental margin of 14%. 
Turning to Slide 7 and starting with the right side. Drivetrain segment net sales were $735 million in the quarter. Excluding Remy and FX, sales growth for the Drivetrain segment was 1.3% compared with the same period a year ago. As James said earlier, higher all-wheel drive sales in North America were offset by lower transmission component sales in Europe. 
On Slide 8, adjusted EBIT was $81 million for the Drivetrain segment or 11% of sales. Excluding Remy, adjusted EBIT was 12.5% of sales, an impressive 180 basis point from a year ago. Excluding Remy and FX, the Drivetrain segments' adjusted EBIT was up $12 million on $8 million of higher sales for an incremental margin of 156%. I'd like to remind you that in Q4 2014, we incurred about a $5 million to $6 million headwind related to restructuring inefficiencies, which are behind us now. Drivetrain's 12.5% adjusted EBIT margin matches its best quarter performance ever. It was just 3 years ago that Drivetrain margins were running around 9%. At that time, we committed to improving the margins in the segment, and we are pleased with its progress. 
Now let's take a look at the balance sheet and cash flow. We generated $868 million of net cash from operating activities in 2015, up $66 million from a year ago. We had a very strong finish to the year generating nearly $400 million of cash in the fourth quarter, driven by exceptional working capital management. Capital spending was $577 million in 2015, up $14 million from a year ago. As James said earlier, capital spending in 2014 and '15 was above our trend. We expect to return to normal spending levels beginning in 2016. Free cash flow, which we define as net cash from operating activities less capital spending, was $290 million in 2015, up $52 million from 2014 and $41 million above the high end of our guidance range provided in October. This positive trend is expected to continue. We expect to generate between $400 million and $475 million of free cash flow in 2016. At the midpoint, that is up 50% from 2015. $200 million to $300 million of free cash flow will be used to repurchase shares in 2016. 
Looking at the balance sheet itself. Balance sheet debt increased by $1.23 billion, and cash decreased by $220 million in 2015 compared with the end of 2014. The $1.45 billion increase in net debt was primarily driven due to the Remy acquisition, capital expenditures, dividend payments to shareholders and share repurchases. We spent $350 million repurchasing 8.1 million shares in 2015, and that's on schedule for executing our $1 billion share repurchase program by the first quarter of 2018. Our net debt-to-capital ratio was 35.4% at the end of 2015, up from 12.8% at the end of 2014. Net debt to EBITDA at the end of the year on a trailing 12-month basis was 1.4x. 
Now I'd like to spend some time on our 2016 guidance, which is unchanged from our initial announcement. I'm going to go through the same numbers presented at the Deutsche Bank Global Auto Industry Conference that we did a couple of weeks ago. I would ask, please bear with me. I think as a management team, we feel this is really important to go through this and it will be very detailed, but nonetheless, we think it's very important that I do this. So let's start with sales growth guidance for the full year. 
I want to remind everybody, the baseline for 2015 net sales, excluded Remy, which was just under 7.9. So starting point is without Remy. So net new business pricing, a market-related growth, are expected to drive 2.5 to 5.5 sales growth. Currency is expected to reduce sales growth within a range of 230 basis points at the low end and 80 basis points at the high end of the range. Those 2 items combine to equal 0.2% to 4.7% of expected sales growth for our base business in 2016. The Remy acquisition should add 13% to 13.5% growth leading to a 13.2% to 18.3% growth for the total company. From an operating performance perspective, we're expecting an 18% to 20% incremental margin on our core business sales growth. Included in this are $15 million to $25 million of tailwinds from the Drivetrain restructuring and increased efficiency related to the completion of that activity. These tailwinds will be partially offset by about $5 million of higher compliance and other corporate expenses. On a comparable basis, we expect our operating income margin to be greater than 13%, up from the prior year for the seventh year in a row. The Remy business is expected to deliver mid-single-digit margins this year. It's net contribution to operating income includes cost synergies and purchase accounting adjustments. So our consolidated operating income margin is expected to be above 12%. We expect earnings of $3.11 to $3.32 per share on a consolidated basis, which includes about $0.13 per share from Remy. Excluding Remy, we expect earnings to be $2.98 to $3.18 per share. 
So now let's review the first quarter guidance starting with sales growth. And again, this has been unchanged from what we gave guidance a little while ago. We expect net new business, pricing and market related growth of about a negative 3% to a positive 2.7%. As we said in January, we do expect higher light truck-related volumes in North America, but this will be partially offset by 2 European transmission programs that began phasing out in the fourth quarter. We're also layered in risk associated with the market volatility in China. Currency is expected to reduce sales growth between 380 points -- basis points at the low end and to 240 basis points at the high end of the range. In 2015, the euro was at its highest point during the first quarter. If our currency assumptions for 2016 are correct, the impact on currency will be relatively severe in the first quarter, but less throughout the year. Those 2 items combined equal minus 4.1% at the low end and 0.3% at the high end of our core business. The Remy acquisition should add 12.4% to 13% growth leading to an 8.3% to 13.3% growth for the total company. We expect earnings of $0.75 to $0.79 per share on a consolidated basis, which does include about $0.03 per share from Remy. Excluding Remy, we expect earnings to be $0.72 to $0.75 per share. 
So let me summarize 2015. 2015 was a good year for BorgWarner. We grew mid-single digits. We expanded our operating margins. We also completed the Remy acquisition. We completed the Drivetrain restructuring, and we made capital investments to set the stage for continued growth and improved operating performance going forward. Now as we look into 2016 and beyond, we see improvements in a number of key areas. First and most important is the intensity around new product development to support impending electrification trend James mentioned earlier. I have never seen this intensity higher in this company since I've been here. There's no question in my mind that this will drive growth for many years. Second, operating income and cash flow will go higher. And finally, the future is bright for BorgWarner. 
So with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Ken."

In my script, I pointed out that in Q4 of '14, if you go back to transcript, you'll see there's about a $5 million to $6 million headwind and you would have saw that actually sales were up and incremental margins were down a year ago. That's behind us. So what you're getting is you're getting $6 million of flow through that. We didn't have a headwind on,  in the fourth quarter this year versus last year. So that $12 million, half of it's this one area right here. Then as we go forward into '16, if you recall, if you go back in our notes, Q1 of '15 was about a $9 million headwind -- a $3 million headwind. And then we had another headwind in the second quarter as well. So obviously, we're going to have those headwinds behind us in the first half of the year and we'll get tailwinds there. They'll have strong incrementals. And then we level out,  like, I think you said, in the back half of the year to more normalized margins. Hopefully, that helps."

The other half I would just say is that business is improving. That was the whole point of the restructuring. And as we go forward, remember, we had Q1 and Q2 of last year, we still had these headwinds coming. It wasn't until 3 and 4 that the headwinds dissipated and the margins -- the incremental margins started returning. So the first half of '16 should have good tailwinds because we don't have those inefficiencies in front of us anymore, and then they'll level out in the second half to more normal incremental margins."

I think what we've alluded to so far is we feel comfortable as we look out into the next couple of years that Remy's going to deliver good mid-single-digit type growth for us. As you can imagine, that's primarily driven off the existing portfolio of products into new channels. So what I mean by that is there's 2 primary channels of growth for us with the current product portfolio. One is customers. They have a relatively narrow band of customers and with BorgWarner's breadth of coverage on customers, that's going to drive content with our existing products. The second growth driver for us is a regional play where they have a strong position in North America. They're well positioned in China, but they historically have been quite weak in Europe. So that's going to be a series of opportunities for us to sell current portfolio of products, and that will drive the content growth over the next 2 or 3 years. Then to your point, in parallel to that, there's a lot of discussions that we're having with customers around combination products of the Remy architecture and the BorgWarner architecture. I would say there's a number of areas and we can talk more about this offline, but the most prevalent area of discussion right now is the notion of a P2 hybrid architecture, so combining our clutching know-how together with their motor know-how. And we've got a lot of interest in that. That's likely to be a revenue stream that's probably 4 to 5 years out, but it's very active and driving it. So hopefully that gives you a sense of both the shorter-term growth levers and then the longer-term growth levers."

Thank you for joining us this morning for the call. As Ken alluded to, I'm going to provide some high-level commentary around both the industry and around BorgWarner. I'll give a brief recap of some of our financi",1762,"Thank you, Ken, and welcome to everybody. Thank you for joining us this morning for the call. As Ken alluded to, I'm going to provide some high-level commentary around both the industry and around BorgWarner. I'll give a brief recap of some of our financial numbers, and then Ron will go through the details around those numbers. 
So I'm now on Slide 1, for those of you following along with the deck, and I'm going to just provide a few overview comments about the macro and industry. Let me just start at a general high level. And I think what we're experiencing in BorgWarner, just like everybody else, in general, there's a lot of uncertainty out in the world, and whether that's reflected in oil prices, strength of the dollar, Middle Eastern challenges, we do see a lot of uncertainty out there. But I think what we also see is a pretty solid, solid auto industry. Now -- and I'll provide more color and detail around that as I go through my comments here, but my message really is in spite of all of that macro uncertainty, we see strength in the auto sector. 
The other comment I'd like to just proactively talk a little bit about is China. And as you know, China's a really critical market for the growth of BorgWarner. So I want to spend a moment and just provide some overview there. So as we go into the year, we see GDP levels for China in the mid-single digit type of a range. We see auto production -- light vehicle auto production in about a 3% to 5% growth environment. We do see this -- the incentive programs and initiatives that were enacted towards the end of last year, our assumption is that they will continue on through the majority if not all of this year and you'll see later in our numbers that did provide some benefit for us. So our view on China is we see a decent level of stability around GDP and auto production, and that gives us encouragement with such a lot of growth for the business in China. 
I'll make a couple of comments specifically around the markets. I would start with saying our views on production numbers for light vehicle and commercial vehicle are pretty much aligned with IHS. And what that means for us, we see North America now starting to plateau or peak-type numbers in the 17.5-ish range. We see China, as I alluded to earlier, at about a 3% to 5% growth for light vehicle. And Europe, the environment for Europe is somewhere between a 1% and 2% growth environment for light vehicle production. Commercial vehicle, we see, still remains quite challenged. We are going into a year where on an aggregate basis, globally, we see little or no growth in commercial vehicle. As you go around the regions in the segments, there is a little bit of differentiation, but fundamentally, we see still a pretty challenged commercial vehicle space. 
I wanted to share with you what I would describe the areas of watch that we, at BorgWarner, are paying close attention to as the year evolves, and I would say the 3 major areas that we're paying a lot of attention to are commercial vehicle, as I mentioned, can there be some upside there? Could it deteriorate a little worse? So we're paying a lot of attention to that. We're paying close attention to the China incentives and how that will play out through the year. And clearly, for us, our biggest customer remains Volkswagen. So we pay a lot of attention to what's going on at Volkswagen. But I would say -- to summarize on the market outlook, I would say, in summary, things are playing out as we had expected as we came into the year, and that's what we're seeing reflected through the first 6 weeks of the year as we've gone forward. 
Let me switch a moment and provide a couple of comments on the regulatory and technology environment. I would say very importantly for us, we still see a very strong drive for fuel economy and emissions regulations. We have seen no slippage in drive and interest from our customers around CAFE and other programs. In fact, I think the latest example we saw in Europe with the Real Driving Emissions standards, for us, points to further evidence of strong drive for enacting greater fuel economy and emission standards. We've also seen the pace of the transition to increased electrification of the powertrain continues to gain momentum, and importantly, for everybody on the call to know, we're very aware of that because we're right in the middle of it as BorgWarner. We are meeting and discussing with multiple customers, many different architectures involving our products on 12 volt, 48 volt, mild hybrids, pure electrics, the whole spectrum of electrified powertrains. We're right in the middle of that, and that's what's driving and building our growth for the long term. I thought it'd be good to share, though, the electrification effort for BorgWarner is not just a long-term phenomenon. As we look here, right now in the year of 2016, I just want to give you an example. We're on pace to ship about 15,000 single-speed transmissions for pure electric vehicles in China this year. So it's both a now story and a future story. 
Last comment around diesel. At this point, we're not seeing any real shift in mix between gas and diesel in the short run. We do know, as we've talked about in prior calls, there will be a transition to more gas engines from diesel over time and we feel BorgWarner's very well positioned to take advantage of that trend. 
Let me now switch and give a few high-level comments about BorgWarner, specifically. I'll start with a recap of 2015, and again, Ron will provide a lot more detail and color around these numbers after myself. So from a Q4 perspective, it was a really good finish to the year for us. I think, from a growth perspective and an operating performance, we ended the year strongly. We were $2.1 billion of sales for the quarter, which is up 7% when we exclude both currency and Remy. And our EPS performance on a comparable basis is about $0.75 with strong performance and also the operating margins reported a 12.6, but significantly, when we exclude Remy, that was an impressive 13.2%. 
If I break Q4 up by segment, Engine sales were about $1.4 billion, which is a growth of 1% on a reported basis, but 10% when we exclude currency. That was primarily driven by very strong turbocharger sales. On the Drivetrain side, for the quarter, $735 million. That's up 20%, but clearly Remy is a big influence there. When you strip out Remy, it was about 1% growth. Two things impacted the growth on the Drivetrain side. We had very strong all-wheel drive growth in North America, and that was offset by lower growth on transmissions in Europe. 
For the full year, sales reported $8 billion. That's down 3% from 2014. But when we exclude Remy and FX and Wahler, it was up 4.3%. EPS $2.70. When we exclude noncomparables and Remy, it was $3.02 per share. Operating margin for the full year at 13%; again, when we exclude Remy, an impressive 13.2%. And I think key for the business is we continue to drive investment for the growth for the future of the company. And the 2 key metrics I focus on for -- to make sure we're driving that growth, CapEx. CapEx came in at 7.2% for the year; and R&D was about 4%, when we exclude Remy. Both of those give me strong confidence that we're investing for the future. 
Now 2015's behind us, and we're into 2016. So let me move and give some comments on 2016. I would say as we've started into the year and as we've gone into the year, we have an optimistic view on the year. We feel good about the year ahead of us. Today, we're reiterating our guidance, both for the Q1 and the full year that we announced in Detroit last month, and again, Ron will provide detailed commentary around that in a moment. I'm also pleased that we've largely got the restructuring efforts that we put a lot of work into over the last 18 months behind us. So we can get that benefit as we go into the year. And we're heading into the year on pace to deliver mid-single-digit growth and strong operating performance. 
The last thing I'd like to address is just some highlights around growth for the company. Let me just start and make a few comments about Remy. We're very, very pleased with the acquisition. I think from a strategic perspective, this was a really critical transaction for BorgWarner, and we're going to talk more about that through the year. The integration on a pragmatic basis has gone very well, both from an operating perspective and a financial perspective. But I think I want to comment how positive we are about the technology. And as I mentioned earlier, we've got multiple customers engaged in discussions around the combination of the Remy product line and the BorgWarner product line, particularly a lot of discussion around the combination of Remy's rotating electric motor machines and our clutch technology around hybrid vehicles, a lot of emphasis and a lot of momentum we're gaining. 
A couple of other recent growth announcements that we made. We did announce the GenV electrohydraulic all-wheel drive coupling that will be on the Volvo XC90 vehicle, and we also announced Engine timing and VCT product lines on the Hyundai V6 gas engines. I would say that I quote and our booking cadence remains strong and solid and is in line with our growth expectations. And as I mentioned earlier, the drive on electrification around the powertrain momentum continues for us. 
So I would summarize it this way. 2015, we had some challenges in 2015. We acknowledge that, and we're now going forward into 2016 with a lot of confidence. The business is operating very well. We're heavily focused on driving the growth that we need through the adoption of our technology. And I think last and most importantly, we're upbeat and we're very positive about delivering on the guidance that Ron's going to take you through right now. 
So with that, I'll turn the call over to Ron. Thank you."

Before I begin reviewing the financials, I would like to commend all of our employees for their hard work in the quarter, and more specifically, a great finish to the year. Also, as Ken mentioned, I will be referring to the supplemental financial slide deck that is posted on our IR website. I encourage you to follow along. 
Now on to our financials. Let's start on Slide 3. Sales on a reported basis were up 6.6%. However, to get a clear picture of how the core business performed, we exclude impact of FX and Remy, and excluding those items, sales were up 7.1%. Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 21% in the quarter or 21.4%, excluding Remy, up 70 basis points from a year ago. SG&A as a percentage of sales was 8.4%. Again, excluding Remy, SG&A was 8.2% of sales, a 30 basis points improvement from a year ago. R&D spending, which is included in SG&A, was 3.6% of sales. I would like to point out, Remy did impact that number by 20 basis points. It was probably 3.8% without Remy. 
Now looks -- now let's look at the year-over-year comparison for operating income, which can be found on page -- on Slide 4. Starting on the right. Fourth quarter 2015 operating income adjusted for noncomparable items, including Remy, was $269 million or 12.6% of sales. Excluding Remy's $8 million of net contribution to operating income, operating income was $261 million or 13.2% of sales, up 80 basis points from a year ago. Excluding noncomparable items, Remy and FX, operating income was up $34 million or $141 million of higher sales. That gives us an incremental margin of 25% -- 24% in the quarter. A reconciliation of the reported operating income to operating income adjusted for noncomparable items plus Remy can be found in the appendix on page -- Slide 9. For full year, our incremental margin, excluding noncomparable items, Remy and impact of foreign currency was 19%. Very good performance despite some operational efficiencies related to the Drivetrain restructuring activities earlier in the year. 
As you look further down the income statement, equity and affiliate earnings was about $12 million in the quarter, in line with last year. Interest expense and finance charges were $18 million in the quarter, up from $10 million a year ago. The increase is primarily related to the $1 billion and the EUR 500 million fixed rate senior notes issued in the first and third quarters of 2015, respectively. Provision for income taxes in the quarter on a reported basis was $61 million. However, this included $12 million of net tax benefits associated with the noncomparable charges and an $8 million favorable tax adjustment. You can read about these items in our 10-K, which will be filed later today. But excluding these items, the provision for income taxes was $81 million or an effective tax rate of 30.7% in the quarter. Our effective tax rate for the full year was 29.8% or 30 basis points above our estimate. Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest was about $10 million in the quarter, up slightly from $8 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. That brings us back to net earnings, which were $125 million in the quarter. Net earnings, excluding the noncomparable items, but including Remy, was $173 million or $0.77 per diluted share. Now for comparisons with prior periods, net earnings, excluding noncomparable items and Remy, were $168 million or $0.75 per diluted share. 
Now let's take a closer look at the operating segments in the quarter. So beginning on Slide 5 of the deck. As James said earlier, reported Engine segment net sales were about $1.4 billion in the quarter. Sales growth for the Engine segment, excluding currency was 9.8% compared with the same period a year ago. 
Turning to Slide 6. Adjusted EBIT was $230 million for the Engine segment or 16.5% of sales. Excluding currency, the Engine segment's adjusted EBIT was up $19 million on $136 million of higher sales for an incremental margin of 14%. 
Turning to Slide 7 and starting with the right side. Drivetrain segment net sales were $735 million in the quarter. Excluding Remy and FX, sales growth for the Drivetrain segment was 1.3% compared with the same period a year ago. As James said earlier, higher all-wheel drive sales in North America were offset by lower transmission component sales in Europe. 
On Slide 8, adjusted EBIT was $81 million for the Drivetrain segment or 11% of sales. Excluding Remy, adjusted EBIT was 12.5% of sales, an impressive 180 basis point from a year ago. Excluding Remy and FX, the Drivetrain segments' adjusted EBIT was up $12 million on $8 million of higher sales for an incremental margin of 156%. I'd like to remind you that in Q4 2014, we incurred about a $5 million to $6 million headwind related to restructuring inefficiencies, which are behind us now. Drivetrain's 12.5% adjusted EBIT margin matches its best quarter performance ever. It was just 3 years ago that Drivetrain margins were running around 9%. At that time, we committed to improving the margins in the segment, and we are pleased with its progress. 
Now let's take a look at the balance sheet and cash flow. We generated $868 million of net cash from operating activities in 2015, up $66 million from a year ago. We had a very strong finish to the year generating nearly $400 million of cash in the fourth quarter, driven by exceptional working capital management. Capital spending was $577 million in 2015, up $14 million from a year ago. As James said earlier, capital spending in 2014 and '15 was above our trend. We expect to return to normal spending levels beginning in 2016. Free cash flow, which we define as net cash from operating activities less capital spending, was $290 million in 2015, up $52 million from 2014 and $41 million above the high end of our guidance range provided in October. This positive trend is expected to continue. We expect to generate between $400 million and $475 million of free cash flow in 2016. At the midpoint, that is up 50% from 2015. $200 million to $300 million of free cash flow will be used to repurchase shares in 2016. 
Looking at the balance sheet itself. Balance sheet debt increased by $1.23 billion, and cash decreased by $220 million in 2015 compared with the end of 2014. The $1.45 billion increase in net debt was primarily driven due to the Remy acquisition, capital expenditures, dividend payments to shareholders and share repurchases. We spent $350 million repurchasing 8.1 million shares in 2015, and that's on schedule for executing our $1 billion share repurchase program by the first quarter of 2018. Our net debt-to-capital ratio was 35.4% at the end of 2015, up from 12.8% at the end of 2014. Net debt to EBITDA at the end of the year on a trailing 12-month basis was 1.4x. 
Now I'd like to spend some time on our 2016 guidance, which is unchanged from our initial announcement. I'm going to go through the same numbers presented at the Deutsche Bank Global Auto Industry Conference that we did a couple of weeks ago. I would ask, please bear with me. I think as a management team, we feel this is really important to go through this and it will be very detailed, but nonetheless, we think it's very important that I do this. So let's start with sales growth guidance for the full year. 
I want to remind everybody, the baseline for 2015 net sales, excluded Remy, which was just under 7.9. So the starting point is without Remy. So net new business, pricing and market-related growth, are expected to drive 2.5 to 5.5 sales growth. Currency is expected to reduce sales growth within a range of 230 basis points at the low end and 80 basis points at the high end of the range. Those 2 items combine to equal 0.2% to 4.7% of expected sales growth for our base business in 2016. The Remy acquisition should add 13% to 13.5% growth leading to a 13.2% to 18.3% growth for the total company. From an operating performance perspective, we're expecting an 18% to 20% incremental margin on our core business sales growth. Included in this are $15 million to $25 million of tailwinds from the Drivetrain restructuring and increased efficiency related to the completion of that activity. These tailwinds will be partially offset by about $5 million of higher compliance and other corporate expenses. 
On a comparable basis, we expect our operating income margin to be greater than 13%, up from the prior year for the seventh year in a row. The Remy business is expected to deliver mid-single-digit margins this year. Its net contribution to operating income includes cost synergies and purchase accounting adjustments. So our consolidated operating income margin is expected to be above 12%. We expect earnings of $3.11 to $3.32 per share on a consolidated basis, which includes about $0.13 per share from Remy. Excluding Remy, we expect earnings to be $2.98 to $3.18 per share. 
So now let's review the first quarter guidance starting with sales growth. And again, this has been unchanged from what we gave guidance a little while ago. We expect net new business, pricing and market related growth of about a negative 3% to a positive 2.7%. As we said in January, we do expect higher light truck-related volumes in North America, but this will be partially offset by 2 European transmission programs that began phasing out in the fourth quarter. We're also layering in risk associated with the market volatility in China. Currency is expected to reduce sales growth between 380 points -- basis points at the low end and to 240 basis points at the high end of the range. In 2015, the euro was at its highest point during the first quarter. If our currency assumptions for 2016 are correct, the impact on currency will be relatively severe in the first quarter, but less throughout the year. Those 2 items combined equal minus 4.1% at the low end and 0.3% at the high end of our core business. The Remy acquisition should add 12.4% to 13% growth leading to an 8.3% to 13.3% growth for the total company. We expect earnings of $0.75 to $0.79 per share on a consolidated basis, which does include about $0.03 per share from Remy. Excluding Remy, we expect earnings to be $0.72 to $0.75 per share. 
So let me summarize 2015. 2015 was a good year for BorgWarner. We grew mid-single digits. We expanded our operating margins. We also completed the Remy acquisition. We completed the Drivetrain restructuring, and we made capital investments to set the stage for continued growth and improved operating performance going forward. Now as we look into 2016 and beyond, we see improvements in a number of key areas. First and most important is the intensity around new product development to support impending electrification trend James mentioned earlier. I have never seen this intensity higher in this company since I've been here. There's no question in my mind that this will drive growth for many years. Second, operating income and cash flow will go higher. And finally, the future is bright for BorgWarner. 
So with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Ken."

In my script, I pointed out that in Q4 of '14, if you go back to transcript, you'll see there's about a $5 million to $6 million headwind and you would have saw that actually sales were up and incremental margins were down a year ago. That's behind us. So what you're getting is you're getting $6 million of flow through that we didn't have a headwind on, in the fourth quarter this year versus last year. So that $12 million, half of it's this one area right here. Then as we go forward into '16, if you recall, if you go back in our notes, Q1 of '15 was about a $9 million headwind -- a $3 million headwind. And then we had another headwind in the second quarter as well. So obviously, we're going to have those headwinds behind us in the first half of the year and we'll get tailwinds there. They'll have strong incrementals. And then we level out, like, I think you said, in the back half of the year to more normalized margins. Hopefully, that helps."

Europe, I think we have more progressive agreements in place than we had before. So I feel comfortable on the labor side that we can adjust. And I think the other area that we've got pretty proficient in is if we need to flex some discretionary spend, we know how to do that from prior cycles. So those are probably the 2 dials that you would move pretty quickly, all leading to targeting decremental sales at around the 20% rate is where we look to manage the business to.

Although we had 14%, 15% in Engine, I would say that there's about $6 million or $5 million last year of headwinds that we didn't see. So of that $12 million increase in operating income, half of it alone was just not having those inefficiencies in our face, quite frankly. The other half I would just say is that business is improving. That was the whole point of the restructuring. And as we go forward, remember, we had Q1 and Q2 of last year, we still had these headwinds coming. It wasn't until 3 and 4 that the headwinds dissipated and the margins -- the incremental margins started returning. So the first half of '16 should have good tailwinds because we don't have those inefficiencies in front of us anymore, and then they'll level out in the second half to more normal incremental margins."

I think what we've alluded to so far is we feel comfortable as we look out into the next couple of years that Remy's going to deliver good mid-single-digit type growth for us. As you can imagine, that's primarily driven off the existing portfolio of products into new channels. So what I mean by that is there's 2 primary channels of growth for us with the current product portfolio. One is customers. They have a relatively narrow band of customers and with BorgWarner's breadth of coverage on customers, that's going to drive content with our existing products. The second growth driver for us is a regional play where they have a strong position in North America. They're well positioned in China, but they historically have been quite weak in Europe. So that's going to be a series of opportunities for us to sell current portfolio of products, and that will drive the content growth over the next 2 or 3 years. Then to your point, in parallel to that, there's a lot of discussions that we're having with customers around combination products of the Remy architecture and the BorgWarner architecture. I would say there's a number of areas and we can talk more about this offline, but the most prevalent area of discussion right now is the notion of a P2 hybrid architecture, so combining our clutching know-how together with their motor know-how. And we've got a lot of interest in that. That's likely to be a revenue stream that's probably 4 to 5 years out, but it's very active and driving it. So hopefully that gives you a sense of both the shorter-term growth levers and then the longer-term growth levers."

But yet we see strong push for pure electrics, which we're right in the middle of and hybrids as well in the many different configurations of hybrids.

Thanks for joining the call today.

Thanks for joining the call today. Ron and I will spend a little bit of time here with you going through Q1 of 2016, and obviously, we'll get in and share with you some of our thoughts around the outlook for the rest of the year. 
So you can see on Slide 2, let's start there and let me give you some of our perspective on some of the bigger picture issues, a little bit around the macro environment and then the industry in general. 
I think the headline for us as we look at the macro and the industry, this -- as we all know, there's a lot of uncertainty out there in the world, whether that's Federal Reserve issues, China monetary policy, oil, Middle East, the list is pretty extensive, and we do see a general tone of uncertainty in the general macro environment. 
That said, our view is auto is relatively stable, and I'll get into more color on that. So we see an unstable macro, but auto is in pretty good shape actually. 
If I take that down a little further and talk more specifically about our view on the market, I'll start with the light vehicle view. And we will continue to remain pretty closely aligned with IHS, as we've done through out the year, actually. So that points out projection for 2016, light vehicle growth in Europe of about 2%, North America around 4%, China, somewhere around 5% to 6%. So we continue to share a similar set of views to those of IHS. 
If I switch over to commercial vehicle, which is obviously a key market for BorgWarner, we still see that very challenged. We're not seeing a lot of uplift in news, frankly, speaking on the environment around commercial vehicle. 
On a macro global level growth, these really very little, if any. And one of the evolution, I would say, in the commercial vehicle space is we do see some of the new programs that were targeted for the out years coming into a little bit of question and review, and so we're paying a lot of attention to that. 
As we look out into 2016 from a higher level perspective, on the last call, I wanted to alert you to the areas of watch that we are paying attention to as we continue to move forward in the year. And we -- I'd like to refresh what we're watching and paying a lot of attention to. 
Commercial vehicle, I already alluded to. The secondary we're watching and paying a lot of attention to is China. And particularly, what we mean by China is I think we've all benefited from some good tailwinds around the incentives that were put in place at the end of 2015 and we're paying attention to how that evolves, particularly into the second half of the year. So what that means is are we seeing any pull forward in the first half of the year or do we see continued strength of the incentives, and I would say there's some questions there. 
Specifically, from a BorgWarner point of view, we're paying attention to, I would say, China and Europe relative to our biggest German-based customer and how that might play out to -- as the year unfolds. 
And then I think like all of us, we're going to pay a lot of attention to inventory builds and inventory building schedules in North America. So those are just some of the areas. 
With that said, things have gone well for us so far. And we're optimistic and positive about our guidance for the year, but there are some watch points and I think it's prudent of us to at least share with you why those watch points are from our viewpoint. 
Still on the same slide, let me reference some of the areas that may be of interest for you around the regulatory and technology trend area. 
We continue to see a strong drive for fuel economy and emissions regulations that are pulling our powertrain technology programs. I would articulate to the group here on the call the intensity we see around product development activity, innovation activity, is at least at the same level and potentially probably a little higher than it was several months ago around technology for fuel economy and emissions. 
So I just wanted to point that out. We're not seeing any slowdown. If anything, we've seen a little bit more work around meeting fuel economy and emissions standards to powertrain technology. 
We've engaged in some meaningful dialogue in the last quarter with -- directly with the EPA. And our view of the world is that we are not anticipating meaningful change to the 2025 CAFE standards. That's not to say that maybe some minor adjustments, and clearly, the process has to play out with further discussions. But our view at this stage is we are not seeing meaningful change. 
Just like other supplies in the space and the OEMs that you talked to, the transition to electrification of the powertrain continues to evolve and I would say accelerate. We know this a couple of years ago and we've seen that trend playing out, and we continue to see that intensify. 
Clearly, for BorgWarner, we're right in the middle of that electrification evolution. And whether that's 12 volt, 48 volt, hybrid CVs, we see a lot of activity around very -- many different architectures. And I would say to the group and not just for the long term, 7 or 8 years out, but we're seeing meaningful evolution in that space in the next 2 to 3 years. 
So more to come on that in my later comments. 
I also wanted just to anecdotally mention as this electrification trend continues, I know one of the hot buttons for the company, how does that play out for you from electric vehicles. We talked last -- on the last call that we were very proud of our EV transmission program with that will run up somewhere around 15,000 [ph] units in 2016. 
I can tell you, we've been awarded 2 additional electric vehicle programs from the company. I'm not in a position to announce the details today. We need to work with our customers to get that, but those announcements will be coming out in the next few months, and we view them as significant in how we will play in that space. 
Finally around the regulatory or technology area, let me make a couple of comment around diesel. I know that's on people's minds. I would say just similar story to what I share with you in February. We're not really seeing any meaningful mix shifts at this point. We do know and we believe that the diesel gas mix will slowly evolve and shift a little more to gas over the next couple of years. 
I think that's consistent with others viewing the space. And we see that as somewhat neutral event for BorgWarner as that technology continues to get adopted to the gasoline products at a similar level to diesel. 
Let me shift from the macro and the industry perspective and give you a little bit of a snapshot -- from our BorgWarner viewpoint. 
First of all, let me start with Q1, and obviously, Ron will give you a lot more color and details in his commentary. 
But I would tell you from my seat, I was very pleased with our Q1. I think we delivered some good growth, a little bit above expectation, which was good to see. And as you'll see in the details, very strong operating performance across the segment. 
So I went into the quarter feeling good, I come out of the quarter feeling very good. It was a good solid quarter for us. 
Versus our expectations, the revenue, I would say,, on a regional basis, China was -- China played out about as we'd expected overall. Europe, a little lower than what we'd expected. And in fact, I can give a little bit of commentary on that later. And North America and Korea, a little better than we've expected. 
But no meaningful big shifts. It was just a little bit of new ones in. And overall, that led to a good quarter. That quarter totaled up to $2.3 billion in sales, which when we exclude FX and Remy, that's about 4.5% growth. EPS of $0.80, which includes the noncomparables. It does, of course, include Remy. 
And our operating margin of 12.2% again for comparable thoughts, when we exclude Remy on the core business for BorgWarner was 13.2%. Strong performance. 
In fact, if I break that down a little further by segment, Engine came in at $1.4 billion, which is -- which grew at 1% as reported or 4.5% when you exclude currency. 
Our primary drivers of the growth, a good growth in Engine with turbo and VCT, variable cam timing on the engine timing side of our business. 
Our Drivetrain sales, $879 million, that's up an impressive 44%, but obviously, we get the benefit of Remy. When exclude Remy and currency, we grew at 5% in the Drivetrain segment. That was primarily driven by very good oil drive sales in North America and also in Europe. So again, good quarter. 
As we look out to 2016, you'll see that we did tweak our guidance just a little for the full year, but generally, it's pretty much unchanged, and I'll let Ron give the necessary detail around that. 
I did want to comment on the broader restructuring because you see that in some of our walks as it comes up. I want to say this. I think the transaction we did strategically we feel very positive about still. It was -- we're very comfortable with technology, we're comfortable with the customer reaction. We're customer -- we're pleased with the growth. 
The restructuring element, obviously, is taking longer than that we'd anticipated, and that's a little frustrating from a BorgWarner viewpoint. 
And let me just let me give you a high-level summary of why that is so you have a sense. What it really is is it centers around our European facilities. The Asia, South America and North America are doing great them actually. The European piece, we're in the process of having to making a lot of product moves. We're closing the plant, we're opening up on, we are building a plant up. And those multiple moves of products as part of the restructuring with our customers is taking a longer than we'd anticipated, but we're going to come through it and get back on track with Wahler. 
So just a guidance. Those reflect a less tailwind than expected for Wahler. But as you can see, we didn't change the total company margin or EPS guidance. 
I also want to share my view a little bit as we look to the second half of the year and maybe some -- I think what I would say to you is we have opportunities and we have risks. I would say the risks a little outweigh the opportunities as we see the world at this point. And let me maybe sure what I see those as. 
I mentioned earlier the China, second half of the year, we do have a little bit of angst that some of that incentive benefits that we get in has been potentially pulled into the first half. 
And as you know, our backup for the year is very heavily weighted to a lot of launches, particularly in Q3 and some of those are very significant, and we see a little bit of risk there. 
And commercial vehicle is kind of a little bit hard to read. It's hard to imagine and getting much worse than what it is, but we do pay attention to that. 
And I think the last comment I would make relative to the risk to the second half is our largest German-based customer and it's their additional risk their in China and Europe from a market share pressure point of view. 
So we've reflected that into our guidance. We believe that's the right thing to do, that's the prudent thing to do. But I do want to be very clear. I'm very comfortable and I'm very confident about our reiterating our ability to achieve our full year guidance. We're off to a good start and we'll deliver in our full year guidance. 
And that guidance, of course, is a good mid-single-digit growth and strong operating performance. 
Let me just share a couple of highlights around growth that you can see on the screen. First of all, the Remy deal, I would say at a high level, the integration is actually going well for us. And I say to you financially and operationally, it's performing about as expected, which is pretty good. 
So reaction from our customers around the technology is very positive. We have multiple customers already engaged in discussion around not just the call Remy business, starters, started systems, but a lot of activity, a lot of discussion, a lot of quoting activity around the combination products. And I would point you to the largest part of that is our activity about a combination of the former Remy motor, the BorgWarner clutching systems for hybrid vehicles. Some of you on the call may know that it's at P2 [ph] hybrid architecture. We feel very positive about where we stand on that position and more to come on that. 
Away from the Remy integration, I would tell you the coats in our booking activity remains strong and solid, very much in line with our growth expectations. So we feel good about our win rates. We feel good about the actual overall coating activity and all of that building up nicely for our future growth. 
And as I said earlier, the intensity around electrification continues and BorgWarner is right in the middle of that. 
So if I wrap all of that up and summarize before I turn it of to Ron, we're off to a good start to the year. Really good solid Q1. The business is running well. We continue to be heavily focused on driving our growth through adoption of technology. And we're upbeat and confident about our delivery and full year guidance. 
So with that, let me turn the call over to Ron who can provide more color in detail around the financials."

So before I review the financial details, I'd like to provide you some of the financial highlights as I see them for the quarter. As James said, we have experienced very expected sales growth for the quarter.",1779,"Thank you, James, and good day, everyone. 
So before I review the financial details, I'd like to provide you some of the financial highlights as I see them for the quarter. 
As James said, we have experienced very expected sales growth for the quarter. We also expanded our operating margins on a comparable basis and we pull through that additional sales. 
But more importantly, for me, on the cash side, we saw a return to a number of capital spending. 
So now, as Ken mentioned, I will be referring to supplemental financial slide deck as we posted on the IR website. So I do encourage you to follow along. 
So let's start on Slide 3. On a reported basis, which includes the change in sales due to market growth, price, net new business, FX and Remy, that's a mouthful, by the way, sales were up 14.3%. However, to get a clearer picture how the core business performed, we have to exclude the impact of FX and Remy. So when you exclude those items, sales were up 4.5%, which was above our high end of our guidance range. 
Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 20.5% in the quarter. 
On a comparable basis or excluding Remy, gross margin was 20.9%, which is down 70 basis points from last year caused by the plant startups and borrow restructuring inefficiencies, as James was talking about earlier. 
SG&A as a percentage of sales was 8.3%, but on a comparable basis, SG&A was 7.8% of sales or 70 basis points improvement from a year ago. 
The company did a good job executing cost controls to offset the gross margin decline. 
R&D spending, which has included SG&A, was flat from a year ago at 3.8% of sales. However, if you do exclude Remy, engineering was at 4.2% or actually a 30% [ph] increase in absolute spend. 
Now, let's look at the year-over-year comparison for operating income, which can be found on Slide 4. 
Starting on the right, first quarter 2016 operating income adjusted for noncomparable items, but including Remy, was $276 million or 12.2% of sales. 
Excluding Remy's $11 million of net contribution to operating income, operating income was $266 million or 13.2% [ph] of sales, and that's up 10 basis points from a year ago. 
Excluding noncomparable items, Remy and FX, operating income was up $14 million on $90 [ph] million in higher sales, and that gives us an incremental margin of 15% in the quarter. 
Now I'd like to pause for a second and point out that there is a reconciliation of reported operating income or GAAP basis to operating income adjusted for noncomparable items, plus Remy, that can be found on Slide 15. This is very important, so you understand GAAP reported differences here. 
Now I can move on. As we look further down the income statement, equity and [indiscernible] earnings was about $9 million in the quarter, which is up slightly from last year. 
Interest expense and finance charges were $21 million in the quarter, up from $10 million a year ago, and this is -- increases primarily due to the $1 billion and EUR 500 million fixed-rate senior notes issued in the first and third quarters of 2015, respectively. 
Provision for income taxes in the quarter on a reported basis was $80 million. However, this included a $1 million tax benefit associated with our noncomparable charges, plus an additional $1 million favorable tax adjustment. 
You can read about each of these adjustments in our 10-Q, which will be filed later today. 
So if we exclude those items, the provision for income taxes was $82 million for an effective tax rate of 31%, and I should note, this is up from our guidance of 30%. 
Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest were about $9 million in line with the first quarter of 2015. 
Let's take a look at our diluted earnings per share on Slide 5. Net earnings, excluding noncomparable items, but including Remy, was $0.80 per diluted share. 
For comparison -- comparisons with prior periods, net earnings, excluding noncomparable items and Remy was $0.77 per diluted share. 
Now let's take a closer look at our operating segments in the quarter, beginning on Slide 6 of the deck. 
Reported income for the -- I'm sorry, reported Engine segment net sales were just under $1.4 billion in the quarter. 
Sales growth for the Engine segment, excluding currency, was 4.5% compared with the same period a year ago, primarily due to higher turbocharger and variable cam timing systems. 
Turning to Slide 7. Adjusted EBIT was $233 million for the Engine segment or 16.7% of sales. 
Excluding currency, the Engine segment adjusted EBIT was up $10 million on $63 million higher sales for an incremental margin of 15%. 
Turning to Slide 8. And starting from the right, Drivetrain segment net sales were $879 million for the quarter. 
Excluding Remy and FX, sales growth for the Drivetrain segment was 4.8% compared to the same period a year ago, primarily due to higher all-wheel-drive sales. 
Now on Slide 9. Adjusted EBIT was $84 million for Drivetrain segment or 9.5% of sales reported, but if exclude Remy, adjusted EBIT was 11.7% of sales, which is up 10 basis points from the prior year. 
Excluding Remy and FX, the Drivetrain segment's adjusted EBIT was up $5 million on $30 million of higher sales for an incremental margin of 15%. 
Now let's take a look at our balance sheet and cash flow. We generated $35 million of net cash from operating activities in the first quarter, which is typically our lowest quarter for cash flow. 
Our investment and working capital ramps up for the first quarter to match higher levels of business activity compared with the end of the year. 
Capital spending was $104 million in the first quarter, down from $140 million a year ago. 
Capital spending was above the trend in 2015, but we are returning to normal spending levels of 5% to 6% of sales this year. 
Free cash flow, which we defined as net cash from operating activities, less capital spending, was an outflow of $69 million in the first quarter. That's a $38 million improvement from a year ago. Again, this is a typical seasonal occurrence. 
We still expect to generate between $400 million and $475 million of free cash flow in 2016. 
At the midpoint, that's up 50% from 2015. $200 million to $300 million of this free cash flow will be used to repurchase shares in 2016. 
Looking at the balance sheet itself. Balance sheet debt increased by $48 million and cash decreased by $185 million in the first quarter compared with the end of 2015. 
The $233 million increase in net debt was primarily due to investments in working capital and share repurchases. 
We spent $80 million repurchasing 2.1 million shares in the first quarter and have scheduled for executing an expected $200 million to $300 million of share repurchases this year. 
Our net debt to net capital ratio was 37% at the end of the first quarter, that's up from 35.2% at the end of 2015. 
The net debt-to-EBITDA at the end of the year on a trailing 12-month basis was 1.5x. 
Now I'd like to discuss our 2016 guidance, which is slightly modified from our initial announcement. 
Returning to the slide deck, let's start with our sales growth guidance for the full year on Slide 10. 
Note that the baseline of 2015 net sales, excluding Remy, which was just under $7.9 billion. All in, we expect growth between 12.7% and 17.5%, which is down slightly from 13.2% to 18.3% [ph]. This change is primarily due to lower growth expectations from Remy's commercial vehicle business. We've seen the same effect in Remy and commercial vehicle we've seen in our core business. 
Currency is unchanged and net new business, pricing and market-related growth is also unchanged at 2.5% to 5.5%. 
Looking at our operating income guidance on Slide 11. From an operating performance perspective, we are expecting 16% [ph] to 18% [ph] incremental margins on our core business sales growth, which is slightly down from our previous guide of 18% to 20%. The change is due to slower progress of the Wahler restructuring, as James mentioned earlier in his remarks. Our previous guide included an $8 million tailwind from Wahler restructuring this year, which is -- has been reduced to $3 million. 
On a comparable basis, we still expect our operating income margin to be 13% [ph] or greater. And including Remy, our operating income margin still expected to be around to 12% range. 
Now on Slide 12. We have our EPS guidance. We still expect earnings of $3.11 to $3.32 [ph] per share on consolidated basis, which includes about $0.12 per share from Remy. 
Excluding Remy, we now expect earnings to be $2.99 [ph] to $3.19 per share. 
Now let's review our second quarter guidance issued this morning, starting with the sales growth on Slide 13. 
All in, we expect to grow between 10.6% and 16% in the quarter, including about 12 percentage points due to Remy. 
Excluding Remy, our growth in the quarter is expected to be between minus 1.5% to positive 3.8%, but this includes the negative impact of currency. 
Currency is expected to lower sales by 290 basis points at the low end and 100 basis points on the high end. So if it exclude Remy in currency, the impact of net new business, pricing and market-related growth will drive growth between 1.5% to 4.5% in Q2. 
Turning to Slide 14. We expect earnings of $0.78 to $0.83 per share on a consolidated basis in the second quarter, which includes about $0.03 per share from Remy. 
Excluding Remy, we expect earnings to be $0.75 to $0.80 per share. 
I'd like to make a few concluding remarks. We had a good first quarter. Sales growth exceeded our expectations and we full this through to operating income. But more importantly, the first half of 2015 was a challenging year for us and we were having a difficult time setting our sales guidance because of the market index that we have in BorgWarner. And as a result, this impacted earnings expectations last year. 
However, over the last 3 quarters, we have settled this down and we've achieved our sales and earnings expectations. 
So as we look at the rest of the year, we expect to continue on this path, solid sales growth, strong operating margins and improve cash flow for the year. 
I remain confident we will deliver our 2016 guidance similar to what James expressed earlier. 
And with that, I'd like to that the call over to Ken."

Clearly, we have the Volkswagen business with China, particularly and Europe from a market share this point of view. And just on that one, Rich, as an example, we saw some of that way on us in the first quarter with China in -- Volkswagen in China. You can see the numbers, right?

Thanks for joining the call today.

Thanks for joining the call today. Ron and I will spend a little bit of time here with you going through Q1 of 2016, and then obviously, we'll get in and share with you some of our thoughts around the outlook for the rest of the year. 
So you can see on Slide 2, let's start there and let me give you some of our perspective on some of the bigger picture issues, a little bit around the macro environment and then the industry in general. 
I think the headline for us as we look at the macro and the industry, this -- as we all know, there's a lot of uncertainty out there in the world, whether that's Federal Reserve issues, China monetary policy, oil, Middle East. The list is pretty extensive, and we do see a general tone of uncertainty in the general macro environment. 
That said, our view is that auto is relatively stable, and I'll get into more color on that. So we see an unstable macro, but auto is in pretty good shape actually. 
If I take that down a little further and talk more specifically about our view on the market, I'll start with the light vehicle view. And we will continue to remain pretty closely aligned with IHS, as we've done through out the year actually. So that points us to a projection for 2016, light vehicle growth in Europe of about 2%, North America around 4%, China somewhere around 5% to 6%. So we continue to share a similar set of views to those of IHS. 
If I switch over to commercial vehicle, which is obviously a key market for BorgWarner, we still see that very challenged. We're not seeing a lot of uplift in news, frankly speaking, on the environments around commercial vehicle. 
On a macro global level growth, these really very little, if any. And one of the evolution I would say in the commercial vehicle space is, we do see some of the new programs that were targeted for the out years coming into a little bit of question and review, and so we're paying a lot of attention to that. 
As we look out into 2016 from a higher level perspective, on the last call, I wanted to alert you to the areas of watch that we are paying attention to as we continue to move forward in the year. And we -- I'd like to refresh what we're watching and paying a lot of attention to. 
Commercial vehicle, I already alluded to. The secondary we're watching and paying a lot of attention to is China. And particularly, what we mean by China is, I think, we've all benefited from some good tailwinds around the incentives that were put in place at the end of 2015, and we're paying attention to how that evolves, particularly into the second half of the year. So what that means is are we seeing any pull forward in the first half of the year or do we see continued strength from the incentives, and I would say there's some questions there. 
Specifically, from a BorgWarner point of view, we're paying attention to, I would say, China and Europe relative to our biggest German-based customer and how that might play out to as the year unfolds. 
And then I think, like all of us, we're going to pay a lot of attention to inventory builds and inventory building schedules in North America. So those are just some of the areas. 
With that said, things have gone well for us so far. And we're optimistic and positive about our guidance for the year, but there are some watch points, and I think it's prudent of us to at least share with you what those watch points are from our viewpoint. 
Still on the same slide, let me reference some of the areas that might be of interest for you around the regulatory and technology trend area. 
We continue to see a strong drive for fuel economy and emissions regulations that are pulling our powertrain technology programs. I would articulate to the group here on the call, the intensity we see around product development activity, innovation activity is at least at the same level and potentially probably a little higher than it was several months ago around technology for fuel economy and emissions. 
So I just wanted to point that out. We're not seeing any slowdown. If anything, we're seeing a little bit more work around meeting fuel economy and emissions standards for powertrain technology. 
We've engaged in some meaningful dialogue in the last quarter with -- directly with the EPA. And our view of the world is that we are not anticipating meaningful change to the 2025 CAFE standards. That's not to say there maybe some minor adjustments, and clearly, the process has to play out with further discussions. But our view at this stage is we are not seeing meaningful change. 
Just like other suppliers in the space and the OEMs that you talked to, the transition to electrification of the powertrain continues to evolve, and I would say accelerate. We know this at -- a couple of years ago when we've seen that trend playing out, and we continue to see that intensify. 
Clearly, for BorgWarner, we're right in the middle of that electrification evolution. And whether that's 12 volt, 48 volt, hybrid CVs, we see a lot of activity around very -- many different architectures. And I would say to the group, and not just for the long term, 7 or 8 years out, but we're seeing meaningful evolution in that space in the next 2 to 3 years. 
So more to come on that in my later comments. 
I also wanted just to anecdotally mention as this electrification trend continues. I know one of the hot buttons for the company, and how does that play out for you from electric vehicles. We talked last -- on the last call that we were very proud of our EV transmission program with Geely that will run up somewhere around about 15,000 units in 2016. 
I can tell you we've been awarded 2 additional electric vehicle programs for the company. I'm not in a position to announce the details today. We need to work with our customers to get that, but those announcements will be coming out in the next few months, and we view them as significant in how we will play in that space. 
Finally around the regulatory or technology area, let me make a couple of comment around diesel, I know that's on people's minds. I would say just similar story to what I shared with you in February. We're not really seeing any meaningful mix shifts at this point. We do know, and we believe that the diesel/gas mix will slowly evolve and shift a little more to gas over the next couple of years. 
I think that's consistent with others viewing the space. And we see that as somewhat neutral event for BorgWarner as that technology continues to get adopted to the gasoline products at a similar level to diesel. 
Let me shift from the macro and the industry perspective and give you a little bit of a snapshot of -- from a BorgWarner viewpoint. 
First of all, let me start with Q1, and obviously, Ron will give you a lot more color and details in his commentary. 
But I would tell you from my seat, I was very pleased with our Q1. I think we delivered some good growth, a little bit above expectation, which was good to see. And as you'll see in the details, very strong operating performance across the segment. 
So I went into the quarter feeling good, I come out of the quarter feeling very good. It was a good solid quarter for us. 
Versus our expectations, the revenue, I would say, upon a regional basis, China was -- China played out about as we'd expected overall. Europe, a little lower than what we'd expected. And in fact, I can give a little bit of commentary on that later. And North America and Korea, a little better than we'd expected. 
But no meaningful big shifts. It was just a little bit of new ones in. And overall, that led to a good quarter. That quarter totaled up to $2.3 billion in sales, which when we exclude FX and Remy, that's about 4.5% growth. EPS of $0.80, which includes the noncomparables. It does, of course, include Remy. 
And our operating margin of 12.2% again for comparable thoughts when we exclude Remy on the core business for BorgWarner was 13.2%. Strong performance. 
If I break that down a little further by segment, Engine came in at $1.4 billion, which is -- which grew at 1% as reported or 4.5% when you exclude currency. 
Our primary drivers of the growth or good growth in Engine were turbo and VCT, variable cam timing, on the engine timing side of our business. 
Our Drivetrain sales, $879 million, that's up an impressive 44%, but obviously, we get the benefit of Remy. When we exclude Remy and currency, we grew at 5% in the Drivetrain segment. That was primarily driven by very good all-wheel drive sales in North America and also in Europe. So again, good quarter. 
As we look out for 2016, you'll see that we did tweak our guidance just a little for the full year, but generally, it's pretty much unchanged, and I'll let Ron give the necessary detail around that. 
I did want to comment on the broader restructuring because you see that in some of our walks as it comes up. I want to say this. I think that the Wahler transaction we did, strategically, we feel very positive about still. It was -- we're very comfortable with technology, we're comfortable with the customer reaction. We're customer -- we're pleased with the growth. 
The restructuring element obviously is taking longer than that we'd anticipated, and that's a little frustrating from a BorgWarner viewpoint. 
And let me just maybe give you a high-level summary of why that is, so you have a sense. What it really is it centers around our European facilities. The Asia, South America and North America are doing great actually. The European piece, we're in the process of having to make a lot of product moves. We're closing the plant, we're opening the plant, we are building a plant up. And those multiple moves of products, as part of the restructuring, with our customers is taking a little longer than we'd anticipated, but we're going to come through it and get back on track with Wahler. 
So our adjusted guidance does reflect a little less tailwind than expected for Wahler. But as you can see, we didn't change the total company margin or EPS guidance. 
I also want to share my view a little bit on as we look to the second half of the year and maybe some -- I think what I would say to you is we have opportunities and we have risks. I would say the risks little outweigh the opportunities as we see the world at this point. And let me maybe share what I see those as. 
I mentioned earlier the China, second half of the year, we do have a little bit of angst that some of that incentive benefits that we're getting has been potentially pulled into the first half. 
And as you know, our back half for the year is very heavily weighted to a lot of launches, particularly in Q3, and some of those are very significant, and we see a little bit of risk there. 
And commercial vehicle is kind of a little bit hard to read. It's hard to imagine it getting much worse than what it is, but we do pay attention to that. 
And I think the last comment I would make relative to the risk to the second half is our largest German-based customer and it's their additional risk their in China and Europe from a market share pressure point of view. 
So we've reflected that into our guidance. We believe that's the right thing to do, that's the prudent thing to do. But I do want to be very clear. I'm very comfortable, and I'm very confident about reiterating our ability to achieve our full year guidance. We're off to a good start, and we'll deliver on our full year guidance. 
And that guidance, of course, is a good mid-single-digit growth and strong operating performance. 
Let me just share a couple of highlights around growth that you can see on the screen. First of all, the Remy deal, I would say at a high level, the integration is actually going well for us. And I'd say to you, financially and operationally, it's performing about as expected, which is pretty good. 
So reaction from our customers around the technology is very positive. We have multiple customers already engaged in discussion around not just the core Remy business, starters, alternators, belt-alternator, starter systems, but a lot of activity, a lot of discussion, a lot of quoting activity around the combination products. And I would point you to the largest part of that is our activity about the combination of the former Remy motor, the BorgWarner clutching systems for hybrid vehicles. Some of you on the call may know that it's a P2 hybrid architecture. We feel very positive about where we stand on that position and more to come on that. 
Away from the Remy integration, I will tell you the coats, and our booking activity remains strong and solid, very much in line with our growth expectations. So we feel good about our win rates. We feel good about the actual overall coating activity and all of that building up nicely for our future growth. 
And as I said earlier, the intensity around electrification continues and BorgWarner is right in the middle of that. 
So if I wrap all of that up and summarize before I turn it off to Ron, we're off to a good start to the year. Really good solid Q1. The business is running well. We continue to be heavily focused on driving our growth through adoption of technology. And we're upbeat and confident about our delivery on our full year guidance. 
So with that, let me turn the call over to Ron who can provide more color and detail around the financials."

So before I review the financial details, I'd like to provide you some of the financial highlights as I see them for the quarter. 
As James said, we have experienced [indiscernible] expected sales growth for the quarter. We also expanded our operating margins on a comparable basis, and we flow-through that additional sales. 
But more importantly for me, on the cash side, we saw a return to normal CapEx spending. 
So now, as Ken mentioned, I will be referring to the supplemental financial slide deck as we posted on the IR website. So I do encourage you to follow along. 
So let's start on Slide 3. On a reported basis, which includes the change in sales due to market growth, price, net new business, FX and Remy, that's a mouthful by the way, sales were up 14.3%. However, to get a clearer picture of how the core business performed, we have to exclude the impact of FX and Remy. So when you exclude those items, sales were up 4.5%, which was above our high end of our guidance range. 
Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 20.5% in the quarter. 
On a comparable basis or excluding Remy, gross margin was 20.9%, which is down 70 basis points from last year, caused by plant start-ups and borrow restructuring inefficiencies, as James was talking about earlier. 
SG&A as a percentage of sales was 8.3%, but on a comparable basis, SG&A was 7.8% of sales or 70 basis points improvement from a year ago. 
The company did a good job executing cost controls to offset the gross margin decline. 
R&D spending, which has included SG&A, was flat from a year ago at 3.8% of sales. However, if you do exclude Remy, engineering was at 4.2% or actually a 30% increase in absolute spend. 
Now let's look at the year-over-year comparison for operating income, which can be found on Slide 4. 
Starting on the right, first quarter 2016 operating income, adjusted for noncomparable items, but including Remy, was $276 million or 12.2% of sales. 
Excluding Remy's $11 million of net contribution to operating income, operating income was $266 million or 13.2% of sales, and that's up 10 basis points from a year ago. 
Excluding noncomparable items, Remy and FX, operating income was up $14 million on $90 million in higher sales, and that gives us an incremental margin of 15% in the quarter. 
Now I'd like to pause for a second and point out that there is a reconciliation of reported operating income or GAAP basis to operating income adjusted for noncomparable items, plus Remy, and can be found on Slide 15. This is very important. So you understand as a GAAP reported differences here. 
Now I can move on. As we look further down the income statement, equity in the [indiscernible] earnings was about $9 million in the quarter, which is up slightly from last year. 
Interest expense and finance charges were $21 million in the quarter, up from $10 million a year ago, and this is -- increase is primarily due to the $1 billion and EUR 500 million fixed-rate senior notes issued in the first and third quarters of 2015, respectively. 
Provision for income taxes in the quarter on a reported basis was $80 million. However, this included a $1 million tax benefit associated with their noncomparable charges plus an additional $1 million favorable tax adjustment. 
You can read about each of these adjustments in our 10-Q, which will be filed later today. 
So if we exclude those items, the provision for income taxes was $82 million for an effective tax rate of 31%, and I should note, this is up from our guidance of 30%. 
Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest were about $9 million in line with the first quarter of 2015. 
Let's take a look at our diluted earnings per share on Slide 5. Net earnings, excluding noncomparable items, but including Remy, was $0.80 per diluted share. 
For comparison -- comparisons with prior periods, net earnings, excluding noncomparable items and Remy, was $0.77 per diluted share. 
Now let's take a closer look at our operating segments in the quarter, beginning on Slide 6 of the deck. 
Reported income for the -- I'm sorry, reported Engine segment net sales were just under $1.4 billion in the quarter. 
Sales growth for the Engine segment, excluding currency, was 4.5% compared with the same period a year ago, primarily due to higher turbocharger and variable cam timing systems. 
Turning to Slide 7. Adjusted EBIT was $233 million for the Engine segment or 16.7% of sales. 
Excluding currency, the Engine segment's adjusted EBIT was up $10 million on $63 million of higher sales for an incremental margin of 15%. 
Turning to Slide 8. And starting from the right, Drivetrain segment net sales were $879 million for the quarter. 
Excluding Remy and FX, sales growth for the Drivetrain segment was 4.8% compared to the same period a year ago, primarily due to higher all-wheel drive sales. 
Now on Slide 9. Adjusted EBIT was $84 million for Drivetrain segment or 9.5% of sales reported, but it exclude Remy, adjusted EBIT was 11.7% of sales, which is up 10 basis points from the prior year. 
Excluding Remy and FX, the Drivetrain segment's adjusted EBIT was up $5 million on $30 million of higher sales for an incremental margin of 15%. 
Now let's take a look at our balance sheet and cash flow. We generated $35 million of net cash from operating activities in the first quarter, which is typically our lowest quarter for cash flow. 
Our investment and working capital ramps up for the first quarter to match higher levels of business activity compared with the end of the year. 
Capital spending was $104 million in the first quarter, down from $140 million a year ago. 
Capital spending was above the trend in 2015, but we are returning to normal spending levels of 5% to 6% of sales this year. 
Free cash flow, which we defined as net cash from operating activities, less capital spending, was an outflow of $69 million in the first quarter. That's a $38 million improvement from a year ago. Again, this is a typical seasonal occurrence. 
We still expect to generate between $400 million and $475 million of free cash flow in 2016. 
At the midpoint, that's up 50% from 2015. $200 million to $300 million of this free cash flow will be used to repurchase shares in 2016. 
Looking at the balance sheet itself. Balance sheet debt increased by $48 million and cash decreased by $185 million in the first quarter compared with the end of 2015. 
The $233 million increase in net debt was primarily due to investments in working capital and share repurchases. 
We spent $80 million repurchasing 2.1 million shares in the first quarter and have scheduled for executing an expected $200 million to $300 million of share repurchases this year. 
Our net debt to net capital ratio was 37% at the end of the first quarter, that's up from 35.2% at the end of 2015. 
The net debt to EBITDA at the end of the year on a trailing 12-month basis was 1.5x. 
Now I'd like to discuss our 2016 guidance, which is slightly modified from our initial announcement. 
Returning to the slide deck. Let's start with our sales growth guidance for the full year on Slide 10. 
Note that the baseline of 2015 net sales, excluding Remy, which was just under $7.9 billion. All in, we expect growth between 12.7% and 17.5%, which is down slightly from 13.2% to 18.3%. This change is primarily due to lower growth expectations from Remy's commercial vehicle business. We're seeing the same effect in Remy and commercial vehicle we're seeing in our core business. 
Currency is unchanged and net new business, pricing and market-related growth is also unchanged at 2.5% to 5.5%. 
Looking at our operating income guidance on Slide 11. From an operating performance perspective, we are expecting 16% to 18% incremental margins on our core business sales growth, which is slightly down from our previous guide of 18% to 20%. The change is due to slower progress of the Wahler restructuring, as James mentioned earlier in his remarks. Our previous guide included an $8 million tailwind from Wahler restructuring this year, which is -- has been reduced to $3 million. 
On a comparable basis, we still expect our operating income margin to be 13% or greater. And including Remy, our operating income margin is still expected to be around the 12% range. 
Now on Slide 12. We have our EPS guidance. We still expect earnings of $3.11 to $3.32 per share on a consolidated basis, which includes about $0.12 per share from Remy. 
Excluding Remy, we now expect earnings to be $2.99 to $3.19 per share. 
Now let's review our second quarter guidance issued this morning, starting with the sales growth on Slide 13. 
All in, we expect to grow between 10.6% and 16% in the quarter, including about 12 percentage points due to Remy. 
Excluding Remy, our growth in the quarter is expected to be between minus 1.5% to positive 3.8%, but this includes the negative impact of currency. 
Currency is expected to lower sales by 290 basis points at the low end and 100 basis points on the high end. So if we exclude Remy in currency, the impact of net new business, pricing and market-related growth will drive growth between 1.5% to 4.5% in Q2. 
Now turning to Slide 14. We expect earnings of $0.78 to $0.83 per share on a consolidated basis in the second quarter, which includes about $0.03 per share from Remy. 
Excluding Remy, we expect earnings to be $0.75 to $0.80 per share. 
I'd like to make a few concluding remarks. We had a good first quarter. Sales growth exceeded our expectations, and we flow this through to our operating income. But more importantly, the first half of 2015 was a challenging year for us, and we were having a difficult time setting their sales guidance because of the market indexing that we have in BorgWarner. And as a result, this impacted earnings expectations last year. 
However, over the last 3 quarters, we have settled this down, and we've achieved our sales and earnings expectations. 
So as we look at the rest of the year, we expect to continue on this path, solid sales growth, strong operating margins and improve cash flow for the year. 
I remain confident that we will deliver our 2016 guidance similar to what James expressed earlier. 
And with that, I'd like to turn over the call back to Ken."

And just on that one, Rich, as an example, we saw some of that way on us in the first quarter with China in -- Volkswagen in China. You can see the numbers, right? They were down in production pretty significantly in the first quarter. That still 20%-plus of our business. So -- and then the last one, Rich, is we've got some pretty big launches, which we've talked about on the prior calls with -- whether that's Pentastar, whether that's Super Duty, the Duramax. And so these are all, I would say, Rich, these are all kind of pretty small new ones and things.

But we need the production build to stay pretty strong. And so far, I would say they're holding pretty good, and if they hold like that, we should be okay, which is why we didn't adjust the back half."

I think I mentioned earlier that we are not seeing any slowdown in the dialogue and the discussion around the need for technology to drive better fuel economy, emissions and vehicle performance. I know there's a lot of a bit of perception out there that, that's going to slow down. And so dollars can be shifted over to these other technologies. We have not seen that. Our activities as good as it's ever been in terms of working with our OEMs. And the equation -- the business equation has not changed. It's purely a value equation of how can the OEM meet their fuel economy and emissions standards at the minimal cost, frankly, so it minimizes any impact on the end consumer. And when I look across the suite of BorgWarner products that do that, we're in a very, very good position. That's why we're delivering the strong mid-single-digit growth we are. The adoption rates for our products remain very strong and they will do because they're very good cost-effective solutions to get the automakers where they need to in a way that they can support their end consumer."

Obviously, we grow at a much faster pace on the light vehicle side of the business. So now the commercial vehicle businesses still remains very core to us. We have a number of our products across the portfolio that play in commercial vehicle. Clearly, the Remy transaction we did has a strong presence in commercial vehicle, and that was attractive to us. So now we're -- we remain committed to commercial vehicle. I think what we'll always see is with 80%-plus of our business is pass car related and a lot of growth impacts car as an end market, you're going to see that growth generally outweighs in light vehicle over commercial vehicle.

Another great example is we apply that dual-clutch transmission technology that emanated from light vehicle, if you know, with Volkswagen, and we're applying that to the [indiscernible] trucks. So that's another very good example. Cooling -- thermal cooling technology, fans, fan drives, pump technology, cooling pumps, we apply those across both light and commercial vehicle. So yes, it's definitely. And as you think of the global situation, which where a lot of trucks, commercial trucks that is are getting smaller, think of like little delivery van-type technologies, and you think in some markets, light -- so-called light vehicles are getting bigger, large pickup truck-type vehicles and SUVs.

Thanks for joining the call today. Ron and I will spend a little bit of time here with you going through Q1 of 2016, and then obviously, we'll get in and share with you some of our thoughts around the outlook for the rest of the year. 
So you can see on Slide 2, let's start there and let me give you some of our perspective on some of the bigger picture issues, a little bit around the macro environment and then the industry in general. 
I think the headline for us as we look at the macro and the industry, this -- as we all know, there's a lot of uncertainty out there in the world, whether that's Federal Reserve issues, China monetary policy, oil, Middle East. The list is pretty extensive, and we do see a general tone of uncertainty in the general macro environment. 
That said, our view is that auto is relatively stable, and I'll get into more color on that. So we see an unstable macro, but auto is in pretty good shape actually. 
If I take that down a little further and talk more specifically about our view on the market, I'll start with the light vehicle view. And we will continue to remain pretty closely aligned with IHS, as we've done throughout the year actually. So that points us to a projection for 2016, light vehicle growth in Europe of about 2%, North America around 4%, China somewhere around 5% to 6%. So we continue to share a similar set of views to those of IHS. 
If I switch over to commercial vehicle, which is obviously a key market for BorgWarner, we still see that very challenged. We're not seeing a lot of uplift in news, frankly speaking, on the environments around commercial vehicle. 
On a macro global level growth, there's really very little, if any. And one of the evolution I would say in the commercial vehicle space is, we do see some of the new programs that were targeted for the out years coming into a little bit of question and review, and so we're paying a lot of attention to that. 
As we look out into 2016 from a higher level perspective, on the last call, I wanted to alert you to the areas of watch that we are paying attention to as we continue to move forward in the year. And we -- I'd like to refresh what we're watching and paying a lot of attention to. 
Commercial vehicle, I already alluded to. The secondary we're watching and paying a lot of attention to is China. And particularly, what we mean by China is, I think, we've all benefited from some good tailwinds around the incentives that were put in place at the end of 2015, and we're paying attention to how that evolves, particularly into the second half of the year. So what that means is are we seeing any pull forward in the first half of the year? Or do we see continued strength from the incentives? And I would say there's some questions there. 
Specifically, from a BorgWarner point of view, we're paying attention to, I would say, China and Europe relative to our biggest German-based customer and how that might play out to as the year unfolds. 
And then I think, like all of us, we're going to pay a lot of attention to inventory builds and inventory building schedules in North America. So those are just some of the areas. 
With that said, things have gone well for us so far. And we're optimistic and positive about our guidance for the year, but there are some watch points, and I think it's prudent of us to at least share with you what those watch points are from our viewpoint. 
Still on the same slide, let me reference some of the areas that may be of interest for you around the regulatory and technology trend area. 
We continue to see a strong drive for fuel economy and emissions regulations that are pulling our powertrain technology programs. I would articulate to the group here on the call, the intensity we see around product development activity, innovation activity is at least at the same level and potentially probably a little higher than it was several months ago around technology for fuel economy and emissions. 
So I just wanted to point that out. We're not seeing any slowdown. If anything, we're seeing a little bit more work around meeting fuel economy and emissions standards for powertrain technology. 
We've engaged in some meaningful dialogue in the last quarter with -- directly with the EPA. And our view of the world is that we are not anticipating meaningful change to the 2025 CAFE standards. That's not to say there may be some minor adjustments, and clearly, the process has to play out with further discussions. But our view at this stage is we are not seeing meaningful change. 
Just like other suppliers in the space and the OEMs that you talk to, the transition to electrification of the powertrain continues to evolve, and I would say accelerate. We noticed that a couple of years ago and we've seen that trend playing out, and we continue to see that intensify. 
Clearly, for BorgWarner, we're right in the middle of that electrification evolution. And whether that's 12 volt, 48 volt, hybrid CVs, we see a lot of activity around very -- many different architectures. And I would say to the group, and not just for the long term, 7 or 8 years out, but we're seeing meaningful evolution in that space in the next 2 to 3 years. 
So more to come on that in my later comments. 
I also wanted just to anecdotally mention as this electrification trend continues. I know one of the hot buttons for the company, and how does that play out for you from electric vehicles. We talked last -- on the last call that we were very proud of our EV transmission program with Geely that will run up somewhere around about 15,000 units in 2016. 
I can tell you we've been awarded 2 additional electric vehicle programs for the company. I'm not in a position to announce the details today. We need to work with our customers to get that, but those announcements will be coming out in the next few months, and we view them as significant in how we will play in that space. 
Finally around the regulatory or technology area, let me make a couple of comment around diesel, I know that's on people's minds. I would say it's a similar story to what I shared with you in February. We're not really seeing any meaningful mix shifts at this point. We do know, and we believe that the diesel/gas mix will slowly evolve and shift a little more to gas over the next couple of years. 
I think that's consistent with others viewing the space. And we see that as somewhat neutral event for BorgWarner as that technology continues to get adopted to the gasoline products at a similar level to diesel. 
Let me shift from the macro and the industry perspective and give you a little bit of a snapshot of -- from a BorgWarner viewpoint. 
First of all, let me start with Q1, and obviously, Ron will give you a lot more color and details in his commentary. 
But I would tell you from my seat, I was very pleased with our Q1. I think we delivered some good growth, a little bit above expectation, which was good to see. And as you'll see in the details, very strong operating performance across the segment. 
So I went into the quarter feeling good, I come out of the quarter feeling very good. It was a good solid quarter for us. 
Versus our expectations, the revenue, I would say, upon a regional basis, China was -- China played out about as we'd expected overall. Europe, a little lower than what we'd expected. And in fact, I can give a little bit of commentary on that later. And North America and Korea, a little better than we'd expected. 
But no meaningful big shifts. It was just a little bit of nuancing. And overall, that led to a good quarter. That quarter totaled up to $2.3 billion in sales, which when we exclude FX and Remy, that's about 4.5% growth. EPS of $0.80, which includes the noncomparables. It does, of course, include Remy. 
And our operating margin of 12.2% again for comparable thoughts when we exclude Remy on the core business for BorgWarner, it was 13.2%. Strong performance. 
If I break that down a little further by segment, Engine came in at $1.4 billion, which is -- which grew at 1% as reported or 4.5% when you exclude currency. 
Our primary drivers of the growth or good growth in Engine were turbo and VCT, variable cam timing, on the engine timing side of our business. 
Our Drivetrain sales, $879 million, that's up an impressive 44%, but obviously, we get the benefit of Remy. When we exclude Remy and currency, we grew at 5% in the Drivetrain segment. That was primarily driven by very good all-wheel drive sales in North America and also in Europe. So again, good quarter. 
As we look out for 2016, you'll see that we did tweak our guidance just a little for the full year, but generally, it's pretty much unchanged, and I'll let Ron give the necessary detail around that. 
I did want to comment on the Wahler restructuring because you see that in some of our walks as it comes up. I want to say this. I think that the Wahler transaction we did, strategically, we feel very positive about still. It was -- we're very comfortable with technology, we're comfortable with the customer reaction. We're customer -- we're pleased with the growth. 
The restructuring element obviously is taking longer than that we'd anticipated, and that's a little frustrating from a BorgWarner viewpoint. 
And let me just maybe give you a high-level summary of why that is, so you have a sense. What it really is it centers around our European facilities. The Asia, South America and North America are doing great actually. The European piece, we're in the process of having to make a lot of product moves. We're closing a plant, we're opening a plant, we are building a plant up. And those multiple moves of products, as part of the restructuring, with our customers is taking a little longer than we'd anticipated, but we're going to come through it and get back on track with Wahler. 
So our adjusted guidance does reflect a little less tailwind than expected for Wahler. But as you can see, we didn't change the total company margin or EPS guidance. 
I also want to share my view a little bit on as we look to the second half of the year and maybe some -- I think what I would say to you is we have opportunities and we have risks. I would say the risks a little outweigh the opportunities as we see the world at this point. And let me maybe share what I see those as. 
I mentioned earlier the China, second half of the year, we do have a little bit of angst that some of that incentive benefits that we're getting has been potentially pulled into the first half. 
And as you know, our back half for the year is very heavily weighted to a lot of launches, particularly in Q3, and some of those are very significant, and we see a little bit of risk there. 
And commercial vehicle is kind of a little bit hard to read. It's hard to imagine it getting much worse than what it is, but we do pay attention to that. 
And I think the last comment I would make relative to the risk to the second half is our largest German-based customer. And is there additional risk there in China and Europe from a market share pressure point of view?
So we've reflected that into our guidance. We believe that's the right thing to do, that's the prudent thing to do. But I do want to be very clear. I'm very comfortable, and I'm very confident about reiterating our ability to achieve our full year guidance. We're off to a good start, and we'll deliver on our full year guidance. 
And that guidance, of course, is a good mid-single-digit growth and strong operating performance. 
Let me just share a couple of highlights around growth that you can see on the screen. First of all, the Remy deal, I would say at a high level, the integration is actually going well for us. And I'd say to you, financially and operationally, it's performing about as expected, which is pretty good. 
So reaction from our customers around the technology is very positive. We have multiple customers already engaged in discussion around not just the core Remy business, starters, alternators, belt-alternator, starter systems, but a lot of activity, a lot of discussion, a lot of quoting activity around the combination products. And I would point you to the largest part of that is our activity about the combination of the former Remy motor, the BorgWarner clutching systems for hybrid vehicles. Some of you on the call may know that it's a P2 hybrid architecture. We feel very positive about where we stand on that position, and more to come on that. 
Away from the Remy integration, I will tell you the quotes and our booking activity remains strong and solid, very much in line with our growth expectations. So we feel good about our win rates. We feel good about the actual overall quoting activity and all of that building up nicely for our future growth. 
And as I said earlier, the intensity around electrification continues and BorgWarner is right in the middle of that. 
So if I wrap all of that up and summarize before I turn it off to Ron, we're off to a good start to the year. Really good solid Q1. The business is running well. We continue to be heavily focused on driving our growth through adoption of technology. And we're upbeat and confident about our delivery on our full year guidance. 
So with that, let me turn the call over to Ron who can provide more color and detail around the financials."
25708,328880797,966362,"BorgWarner Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","BorgWarner Inc.","Executives","Thank you, James, and good day, everyone. So before I review the financial details, I'd like to provide you some of the financial highlights as I see them for the quarter.

So before I review the financial details, I'd like to provide you some of the financial highlights as I see them for the quarter. 
As James said, we have experienced better than expected sales growth for the quarter. We also expanded our operating margins on a comparable basis, and we flow-through that additional sales. 
But more importantly for me, on the cash side, we saw a return to normal CapEx spending. 
So now, as Ken mentioned, I will be referring to the supplemental financial slide deck as we posted on the IR website. So I do encourage you to follow along. 
So let's start on Slide 3. On a reported basis, which includes the change in sales due to market growth, price, net new business, FX and Remy, that's a mouthful by the way, sales were up 14.3%. However, to get a clearer picture of how the core business performed, we have to exclude the impact of FX and Remy. So when you exclude those items, sales were up 4.5%, which was above our high end of our guidance range. 
Gross profit as a percentage of sales was 20.5% in the quarter. 
On a comparable basis or excluding Remy, gross margin was 20.9%, which is down 70 basis points from last year, caused by plant start-ups and Wahler restructuring inefficiencies, as James was talking about earlier. 
SG&A as a percentage of sales was 8.3%, but on a comparable basis, SG&A was 7.8% of sales or 70 basis points improvement from a year ago. 
The company did a good job executing cost controls to offset the gross margin decline. 
R&D spending, which is included in SG&A, was flat from a year ago at 3.8% of sales. However, if you do exclude Remy, engineering was at 4.2% or actually a 13% increase in absolute spend. 
Now let's look at the year-over-year comparison for operating income, which can be found on Slide 4. 
Starting on the right, first quarter 2016 operating income, adjusted for noncomparable items, but including Remy, was $276 million or 12.2% of sales. 
Excluding Remy's $11 million of net contribution to operating income, operating income was $266 million or 13.2% of sales, and that's up 10 basis points from a year ago. 
Excluding noncomparable items, Remy and FX, operating income was up $14 million on $90 million in higher sales, and that gives us an incremental margin of 15% in the quarter. 
Now I'd like to pause for a second and point out that there is a reconciliation of reported operating income or GAAP basis to operating income adjusted for noncomparable items, plus Remy, and it can be found on Slide 15. This is very important. So you understand there's a GAAP to reported differences here. 
Now I can move on. As we look further down the income statement, equity in affiliate earnings was about $9 million in the quarter, which is up slightly from last year. 
Interest expense and finance charges were $21 million in the quarter, up from $10 million a year ago, and this is -- increase is primarily due to the $1 billion and EUR 500 million fixed-rate senior notes issued in the first and third quarters of 2015, respectively. 
Provision for income taxes in the quarter on a reported basis was $80 million. However, this included a $1 million tax benefit associated with their noncomparable charges plus an additional $1 million favorable tax adjustment. 
You can read about each of these adjustments in our 10-Q, which will be filed later today. 
So if we exclude those items, the provision for income taxes was $82 million for an effective tax rate of 31%, and I should note, this is up from our guidance of 30%. 
Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest were about $9 million, in line with the first quarter of 2015. 
Let's take a look at our diluted earnings per share on Slide 5. Net earnings, excluding noncomparable items, but including Remy, was $0.80 per diluted share. 
For comparison -- comparisons with prior periods, net earnings, excluding noncomparable items and Remy, was $0.77 per diluted share. 
Now let's take a closer look at our operating segments in the quarter, beginning on Slide 6 of the deck. 
Reported income for the -- I'm sorry, reported Engine segment net sales were just under $1.4 billion in the quarter. 
Sales growth for the Engine segment, excluding currency, was 4.5% compared with the same period a year ago, primarily due to higher turbocharger and variable cam timing systems. 
Turning to Slide 7. Adjusted EBIT was $233 million for the Engine segment or 16.7% of sales. 
Excluding currency, the Engine segment's adjusted EBIT was up $10 million on $63 million of higher sales for an incremental margin of 15%. 
Turning to Slide 8. And starting from the right, Drivetrain segment net sales were $879 million for the quarter. 
Excluding Remy and FX, sales growth for the Drivetrain segment was 4.8% compared to the same period a year ago, primarily due to higher all-wheel drive sales. 
Now on Slide 9. Adjusted EBIT was $84 million for Drivetrain segment or 9.5% of sales reported, but it exclude Remy, adjusted EBIT was 11.7% of sales, which is up 10 basis points from the prior year. 
Excluding Remy and FX, the Drivetrain segment's adjusted EBIT was up $5 million on $30 million of higher sales for an incremental margin of 15%. 
Now let's take a look at our balance sheet and cash flow. We generated $35 million of net cash from operating activities in the first quarter, which is typically our lowest quarter for cash flow. 
Our investment and working capital ramps up for the first quarter to match higher levels of business activity compared with the end of the year. 
Capital spending was $104 million in the first quarter, down from $140 million a year ago. 
Capital spending was above the trend in 2015, but we are returning to normal spending levels of 5% to 6% of sales this year. 
Free cash flow, which we defined as net cash from operating activities, less capital spending, was an outflow of $69 million in the first quarter. That's a $38 million improvement from a year ago. Again, this is a typical seasonal occurrence. 
We still expect to generate between $400 million and $475 million of free cash flow in 2016. 
At the midpoint, that's up 50% from 2015. $200 million to $300 million of this free cash flow will be used to repurchase shares in 2016. 
Looking at the balance sheet itself. Balance sheet debt increased by $48 million and cash decreased by $185 million in the first quarter compared with the end of 2015. 
The $233 million increase in net debt was primarily due to investments in working capital and share repurchases. 
We spent $80 million repurchasing 2.1 million shares in the first quarter and have scheduled for executing an expected $200 million to $300 million of share repurchases this year. 
Our net debt to net capital ratio was 37% at the end of the first quarter, that's up from 35.2% at the end of 2015. 
The net debt to EBITDA at the end of the year on a trailing 12-month basis was 1.5x. 
Now I'd like to discuss our 2016 guidance, which is slightly modified from our initial announcement. 
Returning to the slide deck. Let's start with our sales growth guidance for the full year on Slide 10. 
Note that the baseline of 2015 net sales, excluding Remy, which was just under $7.9 billion. All in, we expect growth between 12.7% and 17.5%, which is down slightly from 13.2% to 18.3%. This change is primarily due to lower growth expectations from Remy's commercial vehicle business. We're seeing the same effect in Remy and commercial vehicle we're seeing in our core business. 
Currency is unchanged and net new business, pricing and market-related growth is also unchanged at 2.5% to 5.5%. 
Looking at our operating income guidance on Slide 11. From an operating performance perspective, we are expecting 16% to 18% incremental margins on our core business sales growth, which is slightly down from our previous guide of 18% to 20%. The change is due to slower progress of the Wahler restructuring, as James mentioned earlier in his remarks. Our previous guide included an $8 million tailwind from Wahler restructuring this year, which is -- has been reduced to $3 million. 
On a comparable basis, we still expect our operating income margin to be 13% or greater. And including Remy, our operating income margin is still expected to be around the 12% range. 
Now on Slide 12. We have our EPS guidance. We still expect earnings of $3.11 to $3.32 per share on a consolidated basis, which includes about $0.12 per share from Remy. 
Excluding Remy, we now expect earnings to be $2.99 to $3.19 per share. 
Now let's review our second quarter guidance issued this morning, starting with the sales growth on Slide 13. 
All in, we expect to grow between 10.6% and 16% in the quarter, including about 12 percentage points due to Remy. 
Excluding Remy, our growth in the quarter is expected to be between minus 1.5% to positive 3.8%, but this includes the negative impact of currency. 
Currency is expected to lower sales by 290 basis points at the low end and 100 basis points on the high end. So if we exclude Remy and currency, the impact of net new business, pricing and market-related growth will drive growth between 1.5% to 4.5% in Q2. 
Now turning to Slide 14. We expect earnings of $0.78 to $0.83 per share on a consolidated basis in the second quarter, which includes about $0.03 per share from Remy. 
Excluding Remy, we expect earnings to be $0.75 to $0.80 per share. 
I'd like to make a few concluding remarks. We had a good first quarter. Sales growth exceeded our expectations, and we flowed this through to our operating income. But more importantly, the first half of 2015 was a challenging year for us, and we were having a difficult time setting their sales guidance because of the market indexing that we have in BorgWarner. And as a result, this impacted earnings expectations last year. 
However, over the last 3 quarters, we have settled this down, and we've achieved our sales and earnings expectations. 
So as we look at the rest of the year, we expect to continue on this path, solid sales growth, strong operating margins and improved cash flow for the year. 
I remain confident that we will deliver our 2016 guidance similar to what James expressed earlier. 
And with that, I'd like to turn over the call back to Ken."

We've seen some acceleration in the first half on these incentives that might weigh a little bit on the back-end. Clearly, we have the Volkswagen business with China, particularly, and Europe from a market share risk point of view. And just on that one, Rich, as an example, we saw some of that weigh on us in the first quarter with China in -- Volkswagen in China. You can see the numbers, right? They were down in production pretty significantly in the first quarter. That still 20%-plus of our business. So -- and then the last one, Rich, is we've got some pretty big launches, which we've talked about on the prior calls with -- whether that's Pentastar, whether that's Super Duty, the Duramax.

It's not big, but when we add all of those up, we just see it slightly skewed to the risk side than the opportunity side, and we just think it's prudent to reflect that and play it from there."

They're coming our pretty much as we'd anticipated. So we're not seeing, I would just -- and that's why we didn't do anything with the back half guide, Rich. We left it alone.

So first thing I would say, we're in the first year of the net new business. And as we're communicating, we're comfortable, confident and feeling pretty good about this year, okay? So that's where -- what we think. As we look out, I'm going to say a couple of things. Are we comfortable internally as a company with the projection we made? Yes. Do we like it? Not really. I'd rather be much higher than 4% to 6%, and we're working like crazy to get higher than 4% to 6%. And as we get through this year, we will have a better read of what that looks like. And obviously, we need a little bit more time. So our focus right now is we're comfortable with what's out there. We're going to execute and perform against it, which I think we're starting to do, which is really good. And I would say incrementally, as I look out, we will go up from mid-single-digit growth at some point, it's not yet. That's kind of the way to think of it, Brett. We will. And I don't anticipate that it's certainly not '16, and I don't think yet it would be '17 either. I want you to know BorgWarner is not happy being a mid-single-digit growth company. We're going to go -- we're not. We're going to focus like crazy to go higher than that. But it's too early, Brett. We got to deliver, and we got to execute on the mid-single-digit growth. I think the Investor Day will -- that's later this year will help provide some clarity and color on why we believe there's opportunity to transition up, but it is too early at this point, Brett.

A lot of the dialogue we will be in because this is how BorgWarner operates is many times what the dialogue with the customer will be, they're not sure whether they want a 12 volt or 48 or a 12 and a 48 volt. People like BorgWarner can help them find that conclusion. So I'm not necessarily in the view that there's been a massive uptick in pure 48 volt architecture. I think there's definitely been a move up in electrification architecture, which we've talked about for a while. And I see the surprise they're going to win, just James' view, the ones that can service the flexibility between 12 and 48 volt and not rely on either one. And we have a bunch of products that do that. So whether that's electric turbocharger, whether that's former Remy motor technology, just to name a couple. So yes, it's strong and we're right in the midst of it."

As Ken said, Ron and I are really pleased to share our results from the second quarter with you and also talk about what the rest of the year looks like. What I'd like to do is just start and make a few high-level comments on some of the bigger picture perspective as we look out into the micro industry -- or the macro environment in our industry and you can see a couple of points here on Slide 2 for those following along. I think the theme I would talk the most in terms of the macro view is the notion of uncertainty out there in the world. And you know whether that's some of the civil unrest pressures that we see particularly in Europe, we see tents political environment, recently in Turkey, Middle East, pending U.S. elections and of course, fairly recently, the Brexit vote. All of that creates, I think, we all realize a sense of uncertainty at a macro view. But interestingly, when I look at the world of all of those, we generally, seen a pretty stable, steady issue go type environment and things playing out pretty much as we expect it. As we look forward, I think that macro uncertainty will continue, but I do see the other side remaining fairly stable. And as I articulate that a little further and talk to you about the market outlook, first of all, from a light vehicle perspective, I would say from a board point of view, we are pretty well aligned with IHS. We see the China market growing that mid-single-digit 5% to 6% type range, we see Europe in a 2% to 3% growth environment range and we see the U.S. in that 2% to 3% of growth to light vehicle production. We do see and acknowledge that the U.S. plateau affect is certainly on the horizon and we are very mindful of that. From a commercial vehicle point of view, we still see that space challenge for sure and as you look around globally, there's really not a lot of growth at all. We do see some pretty continued strong weakness around off-road. So that translates into a lot of new programs on the further review and consideration. So as I look at that, I would like to share with you one of the leading indicators or the areas of watch for us as a company [indiscernible] and the ones that can be most relevant to us. So I would characterize the North American market, how is the plateau going to play out, how is the inventory production levels going to play out and we pay good attention to that. And I'll talk about how these relate to our guidance shortly. VW remains a critical customer and a very important customer for us and we have to monitor the share for VW around the world. And like everybody, we're going to pay attention to the potential impacts of volumes in Europe in light of Brexit and we will obviously monitor the commercial vehicle weakness. Now all of that said, I would say so far, things aer absolutely panned up on our guidance and as you see on the guidance going forward, we still feel good about our guidance and we're building this in and going forward with good guidance. So yes, we're watching but we are also performing as expected and we expect to perform strongly going forward. Let me comment a little on the regulatory or the technology aspect of the business. First thing I would say to you is the poll and the drive for fuel economy and emissions regulations, absolutely unchanged and the pull for powertrain technology remains as strong as it did last quarter, the quarter before that and the quarter before that. So we have not seen any slowdown in customer engagement and programs that are driving and pulling advanced technology as we go forward. We do see the strong shift to increase powertrain electrification continues. And we know that because we're right in the middle of it and we're talking into customers literarily everyday around the world working with them on solutions for them in that additional electrification content. That applies across the board. That's 48 volts architectures, it's other hybrids, and it's electric vehicles and we have content and discussion there not just for the long-term, but products in the short run as well. I would say also relative to electrification, our quoting activity remains very strong, multiple customers, multiple products. And we'll be making further announcements on specific programs in the coming weeks and months. But I would just say this, I feel very pleased and very happy where we're at in terms of the level of engagement around new technology aligned with electrification. And as Ken alluded to in his opening comments, we plan to showcase a lot of those products, a lot of those technologies at our upcoming Investor Day on September 7. So let me kind of give you a high-level view here on the BorgWarner summary and let me start up with Q2. And leave us to say Ron's going to provide a lot more detail and commentary in his comments. But I would just say this, we had a really good quarter. I was very pleased with our second quarter. The growth came in at the high end of our guidance and we delivered strong operating performance. Breaking that down a little further, it was $2.3 billion in sales which is up 3.5% when we exclude FX and Remy. Regionally, it came in about as we have expected which was characterized by stronger growth in North America and a particularly strong quarter in Korea, which was balanced with the lower growth, as we had expected, in Europe in China. EPS came in at $0.84 a share when we exclude non-comparables and that does include Remy. Operating margin, 12.4% when we exclude Remy, 13.2%. The word I would use is impressive. Breaking that down by segment. Engine sales, $1.4 billion, so we grew at about 2.2% on a reported basis or 2.8% when we exclude currency. Primary drivers of the engine growth with [indiscernible] and variable comp timing. Switching to Drivetrain. Sales of $895 million, that's up to [ph] almost 43% but when we exclude currency and Remy, still a good quarter at [ph] 5.4% growth. Largest part of the growth came from strong overall drive sales in both North America and also in Europe. So let me shift gears and talk a little bit about the outlook for 2016. And again, Ron will provide more color on this. Basically, we've narrowed our guidance range to the high end of our previous range, which we think is very good news. We also have highlighted through the last couple of quarters 4 major launches this year that we talked about that are very critical to our success in the second half of the year. And just to remind you folks, it was the Pentastar in June, Ford Scorpion, Ford Super Duty and GM Duramax. All of these programs have launched except for Duramax which was launched in September. I would say to you that the launches have been probably slower than the original assumptions but it is the good news. This is exactly what we had anticipated and plan for an ouor guidance back in January, that's what we did it. And as a result of that, our launch activity remains on track. So the outlook on the second half of the year, if I talk about that, I would characterize it to you that I think our risk and our opportunities are pretty well balanced. I alluded earlier in my comments, there are some risks and some watch points out there, but I also see some positive aspects to and in general, I think with balance and with that, that's why we feel confident in our full year guidance at mid-single digit growth and continued strong operating performance. Let me make a few comments around growth in general and give you a little bit of an update on the Remy acquisition and integration. First of all, from an integration perspective, it's going well and I think it's fair to characterize that both financially and operationally, it's performing very much as we had expected. We remain very positive about the technology that came with the acquisition and we've had many, many discussions with our customers, particularly around the combination products where we're going to leverage the rotating electrical capability of Remy with our clutching capability. So that's very much on track. And you see that hardware, for those of you lucky enough to be with us in September 7. In general, our quoting and our booking activity remains strong and very good about the win rates on our booking business and all of that leads to in-line expectations are on track for growth. So let me kind of wrap up before I turn over to Ron. We had a good first half to the year and we feel very good about we delivered what we said we would. I think the business is operating well. We continue to be heavily focused on driving growth through the adoption of our technology and we remain upbeat and positive about delivery and our full year guidance. So with that, let me turn the call over to Ron."

Before I review the financial details, I would like to provide you some of the highlights as I see them for the quarter. In summary, we saw solid growth, great operating performance and a return to normal CapEx spending and free cash flow generation. Now as Ken mentioned, I will be referring to the supplemental financial slide deck as posted on our website, so I do encourage you to follow along. But first, I'd like to focus your attention on Slide 2 -- I'm sorry, Slide 3. Throughout the presentation, I will highlight certain non-U.S. GAAP measures to provide a clear picture of how the core business performed and for comparisons with prior periods. Specifically, we will be excluding the impact of FX, Remy and noncomparable items from certain U.S. GAAP measures. So when you hear me say on a comparable basis, that means excluding the impact of FX, Remy and noncomparable items. When you hear me say on a reported basis, that means U.S. GAAP. Now with that out of the way, let's move forward. 
Let's turn to Slide 4. On a reported basis, which includes the change in sales due to market growth, price, net new business, FX and Remy acquisition, sales were up 14.6%. On a comparable basis, our sales were up 3.5%, just above the midpoint of our guidance. On a reported basis, gross profit as a percentage of sales, was 21.3% in the quarter. On a comparable basis, gross margin was 21.4%, up 30 basis points from last year. On a reported basis, SG&A was 8.7% of sales. On a comparable basis, SG&A was 8.2% of sales or basically flat from the same period a year ago. R&D spending, which is included in SG&A, was 3.6% of sales. However, this did include the impact in Remy, so on a comparable basis, R&D spending as a percentage of sales was flat year-over-year. Now let's look at the year-over-year comparison for operating income which can be found on Slide 5. Starting on the right, second quarter 2016 operating income, excluding noncomparable items but including Remy, was $288 million or 12.4% of sales. If you also exclude Remy's $13 million net contribution, operating income on a comparable basis was $275 million or 13.2% of sales, up 30 basis points from a year ago, and yes, James, that is impressive. On a comparable basis, operating income was up $16 million on [ph] $71 million of higher sales. That gives us an incremental margin of 23% in the quarter, outstanding performance. As you look further down the income statement, equity and affiliate earnings was about $10 million a quarter, down slightly from a year ago. Interest expense and finance charges were $21 million in the quarter, up from $18 million a year ago. The increase is primarily due to the $500 million euro fixed rate senior notes issued in the third quarter of 2015. Provision for income taxes in the quarter on a reported basis was $84 million. However, this included $2 million net tax benefit related to our noncomparable items and a favorable tax adjustment. You can read about each of these adjustments in our 10-Q which will be filed later today. Excluding these items, the provision for income taxes was $86 million for an effective tax rate of 31%, which is in line with our full year guidance. Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest was about $11 million, up $2 million from the second quarter of 2015. This line item reflects our minority partner's share in the earnings performance of our Korean and Chinese consolidated joint ventures. Now let's take a look at our diluted earnings per share on Slide 6. Net earnings, excluding noncomparable items but including Remy, were $0.84 per diluted share. On a comparable basis, net earnings were $0.80 per diluted share. Now let's take a closer look at our operating segments in the quarter, beginning on Slide 7 of the deck. Reported Engine segment net sales were just over $1.4 billion in the quarter. Sales growth for the Engine segment, on a comparable basis, was 2.8%, primarily due to higher turbocharger and variable camp time in sales, partially offset by weak commercial vehicle markets around the world. Turning to Slide 8. Reported adjusted EBIT was $235 million for the Engine segment or 16.3% of sales. On a comparable basis, the Engine segment adjusted EBIT was up $8 million on $39 million of higher sales for an incremental margin of 20%. Again, solid performance for the Engine segment. Turning to Slide 9 and starting from the right. Drivetrain segment net sales were $895 million in the quarter. This included $240 million of sales from Remy. Sales growth for the Drivetrain segment on a comparable basis was 5.4%, primarily due to higher all-wheel drive sales. And Slide 10, reported adjusted EBIT was $93 million for the Drivetrain segment or 10.4% of sales. Excluding Remy, adjusted EBIT was 12.2% of sales, up 70 basis points from the prior year. On a comparable basis, the Drivetrain segment's adjusted EBIT was up $10 million on $34 million of higher sales for an incremental margin of 29%. Very good performance for the Drivetrain segment. 
Now let's take a look at our balance sheet and cash flow. We generated $362 million of net cash from operating activities in the first half of the year, which is up $43 million from a year ago. Capital spending was $235 million in the first half, which is down $50 [ph] million from a year ago. Capital spending was above our trend in 2015 but we have return to normal spending levels. As a percentage of sales, CapEx was 5.1% in the first half at the low end of our historical range of 5% to 6% of sales. Free cash flow, which was defined -- which we define as net cash from operating activities less capital spending, was $127 million in the first half, up $93 million from a year ago. We are still on track to generate between $400 million and $475 million of free cash flow in 2016 and at the midpoint, that's up 50% from 2015. Looking at the balance sheet itself, balance sheet debt increased by $85 million and cash decreased by $83 million. In the first half compared with the end of 2015, we purchased -- our debt increased $168 million, which is primarily due to share repurchases. We spent $100 million repurchasing 5.4 million shares in the first half, and have scheduled for executing an expected $200 million to $300 million of share repurchases this year. Our net debt to net capital ratio was 36.3% at the end of the second quarter, up from 35.2% at the end of 2015. Net debt-to-EBITDA at the end of the year on a trailing 12-month basis was 1.5%. 
Now I'd like to discuss our current 2016 guidance, which has improved from our previous guide, as James mentioned. So returning to the deck, let's start with our sales growth guidance for the full year on Slide 11. Note that the baseline 2015 net sales excludes Remy. We have raised the low end of our guidance range by 100 basis points. All in, we expect to grow between 13.7% and 17.5% this year, up from 12.7% to 17.5% previously. Having an improved outlook is due to greater comfort with volume and launch timing assumptions in our net new business. The other half is because we expect the impact of currency to be less negative compared to our previous guide. Market-related growth and new business growth, net of pricing, is now expected to be between 3% and 5.5%. Now let's look at our operating income guidance on Slide 12 from an operating performance perspective. We're expecting 15% to 17% incremental margins on our core business sales growth, which is slightly down from our previous guide of 16% to 18%. This is nothing to be excited about, just a few adjustments after taking a closer look at the remaining part of the year. On incremental margins -- incremental margins will be lower in the second half than the 19% we delivered in the first half primarily due to tough comparison in the third quarter last year. In the third quarter 2015, we implemented sharp cost controls in response to the macro uncertainty we saw last year. That's spend has returned to normal, making the year-over-year third quarter comparison challenging. On a comparable basis, we still expect our operating income margin to be greater than 13% and including Remy, our operating income margin is still expected to grow [ph] at 12%. On Slide 13, we have our EPS guidance. We now expect earnings of $3.16 to $3.32 per share. This includes $0.12 per share contribution from Remy, up from the $3.11 to $3.32 previously. The primary driver of the change is the lower share count, which raised EPS by about $0.04 across the range. Raising the low end of our sales guidance range added another penny per share to the low end and at the high end of the range, the lower incremental margin and other minor adjustments offset the lower share count. 
Now let's review our third quarter guidance issued this morning starting with the sales growth on Slide 14. All in, we expect to grow between 13% and 21% in the third quarter, excluding 13 percentage points due to Remy. Excluding Remy, our growth in the quarter is expected to be between 0.3% and 7.6% but this includes the negative impact to currency. Currency is expected to lower sales by 220 basis points at the low end and 10 basis points at the high end. On a comparable basis, we expect to grow between 2.5% and 7.5% in the quarter. Our growth is improving in the second half primarily due to major truck launches with GM and Ford. From an earnings perspective, as shown on Slide 15, we expect earnings of $0.74 to $0.81 per share in the third quarter, which includes about $0.03 per share from Remy. Excluding Remy, we expect earnings to be $0.71 to $0.78 per share. So in conclusion, we had a very good second quarter. This is the third quarter in a row of exceeding our EPS and sales goals. And as we look forward at the rest of the year, we expect to continue on this path. Solid sales growth, strong operating margins and improved cash flow from a year ago. I absolutely remain confident that we will deliver our 2016 guidance. And with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Ken."

So as we started out the year, we obviously have a lot of launches and one of the approach we took was to put, build some judgment into launch cadence, right, both in volume, and obviously we factored in some macros. I'm getting confidence that we delivered the first couple of quarters where we've gone through with other launches around the world. Clearly, the second half is a little more weighted. As I sit here today, I think we've done a pretty good job of factoring in good launch cadences as we see it today. So it's never perfect, right? You don't know. But I think we continue that mantra of applying some judgment to both the timing and the volume ramp.

Sometimes we're a little up higher in drivetrain, sometimes it's engine, it moves around a little bit. But in terms of why engine was a little lower than some of our historical quarters, you're right, commercial vehicle was clearly, clearly a factor that only applies to our Engine segment. There's no commercial vehicle revenue in Drivetrain so that was the key weight for us. I would say the other area that weighted a little bit on us is China. We're -- some of our larger customers in China -- so I'm talking about both Volkswagen, I'm talking about Great I'm talking about Ford and GM, had a pretty low growth quarters. If you aggregate those 4 actually it was no growth. So that weighted more on engine than Drivetrain as well. Those are the 2 of the bigger things. Doesn't really concern us, as I said, because we do have balances from quarter-to-quarter. So I think it is explainable and kind of it is frankly speaking what we had anticipated in our guide."

So let me talk a little bit about sources of growth for Remy. I think that was kind of your first key question. I would encourage you and the investors to think of 2 channels of growth both for Remy. First cha",604,"Okay, Brett, that's happy to talk about that. So let me talk a little bit about sources of growth for Remy. I think that was kind of your first key question. I would encourage you and the investors to think of 2 channels of growth both for Remy. First channel of growth is from only through their existing off-the-shelf technology for vehicles and applications that are in service today. What I mean by that is selling more belt-alternator starters and motors and generators to what they make site themselves today. What, I mean, channels is on light vehicle, today they ship to Hyundai and General Motors and that's it. And we see you leverage in the BorgWarner channels and BorgWarner relationships, that there's no reason in the planet why we can't be selling starters and automators and balternators starter systems to other customers beyond that current, that's okay. And regionally, they have almost no presence in Europe and clearly, BorgWarner has a big presence. So there's a regional player where we can accelerate our European relationship to grow. What I would describe, Brett, is they co-existed product line business. So that's a source of growth for us that we will leverage. And you would anticipate that can be done in a shorter horizon only because this quoting activity today and we have product to put on those vehicles. So that's a the first source of growth. The second source of growth is where you're alluding to is to help take us further into electrification. And there's a number of potential opportunities there. First of all, they have the motor technology that you could you see either on a hybrid vehicle or pure electric vehicle, and that's traction electric motor of sorts that we can use. The second path for them is to combine the rotating electrics of the motor, coupled together with our clutching technology to offer hybrid vehicles solution where we need to bring together the motor and the clutching technology so we can offer engagement or disengagement between the motor and the combustion engine. We have product from the shelf to do that today and we're quoting that activity. The third leg of opportunity to growth is the more advanced starters, belt-alternator starter systems that will emerge as a need for stop-start technology and hybrid technology and Remy has a number of products in that space that we'll be pushing forward onto hybrid applications. The last area, I would say, just in general, they bring motor technology that helps us on other product applications. So if you think of, I talked about earlier about e-booster technology which is a turbocharger with a boosting devie app, compressor device, requires power electronics and motor know-how, Remy can bring that knowledge to us. All of that separates so where does it all translate to into dollars of growth? We're working our way through that, but there's certainly absolutely no reason why Remy wouldn't grow at least at BorgWarner levels. You got to give us a little bit of time to lay that out for you in terms of cadence and pull all of that together. And we'll get through that in over the next few months because what we're going to do, Brett, is we'll use the September date to showcase the technology for you and what we're doing on it and pull of that altogether in the January net new business to lay out for you what the next 3 years of growth looks like to Remy both unconventional products and the combination products with BorgWarner products. Hopefully, that helps you a little bit."

As Ken said, Ron and I are really pleased to share our results from the second quarter with you and also talk about what the rest of the year looks like. What I'd like to do is just start and make a few high-level comments on some of the bigger-picture perspective as we look out into the macro industry -- or the macro environment in our industry, and you can see a couple of points here on Slide 2, for those following along. 
I think the theme I would talk the most to in terms of the macro view is the notion of uncertainty out there in the world, and whether that's some of the civil unrest issues that we see, particularly in Europe. We see tense political environment recently in Turkey and Middle East, pending U.S. elections and, of course, fairly recently, the Brexit vote. All of that creates, I think we all realize, a sense of uncertainty at a macro view. But interestingly, when I look at the world of autos, we've generally seen a pretty stable, steady-as-you-go type environment and things playing out pretty much as we'd expect it. And as we look forward, I see that macro uncertainty will continue, but I do see the auto side remaining fairly stable. 
And as I articulate that a little further and talk to you about the market outlook, first of all, from a light vehicle perspective, I would say from a BorgWarner viewpoint, we're pretty well aligned with IHS. We see the China market growing that mid-single-digit 5% to 6% type range. We see Europe in a 2% to 3% growth environment range, and we see the U.S. in that 2% to 3% range of growth for light vehicle production. We do see and we acknowledge that the U.S. plateau effect is certainly on the horizon, and we're very mindful of that. 
From a commercial vehicle point of view, we still see that space challenged, for sure, and as you look around globally, there's really not a lot of growth at all. We do see some pretty continued strong weakness around off-road. So that translates into a lot of new programs under further review and consideration. 
So as I look at that, I would like to share with you one of the leading indicators or the areas of watch for us as a company at BorgWarner and the ones that can be most relevant to us. So I would characterize the North American market, how is the plateau going to play out, how is the inventory production levels going to play out, and we pay good attention to that. And I'll talk about how these relate to our guidance shortly. VW remains a critical customer and a very important customer for us, and we have to monitor the share for VW around the world. And like everybody, we're going to pay attention to the potential impacts of volumes in Europe in light of Brexit, and we'll obviously monitor the commercial vehicle weakness. 
Now all of that said, I would say so far, things are absolutely planned up for our guidance. And as you'll see in the guidance going forward, we still feel good about our guidance, and we're building these in and going forward with good guidance. So yes, we're watching, but we're also performing as expected, and we expect to perform strongly going forward. 
Let me comment a little on the regulatory or the technology aspects of the business. First thing I would say to you is the pull and the drive for fuel economy and emissions regulations, absolutely unchanged, and the pull for powertrain technology remains as strong as it did last quarter, the quarter before that and the quarter before that. So we have not seen any slowdown in customer engagement and programs that are driving and pulling advanced technology as we go forward. We do see the strong shift to increased powertrain electrification continues. And we know that because we're right in the middle of it, and we're talking to customers literarily every day around the world and working with them on solutions for them in that additional electrification content. That applies across the board. That's 48-volt architectures. It's other hybrids, and it's electric vehicles. And we have content and discussion there, not just for the long term but products in the short run as well. 
I would say also relative to electrification, our quoting activity remains very strong, multiple customers, multiple products. And we'll be making further announcements on specific programs in the coming weeks and months. But I would just say this: I feel very pleased and very happy where we're at in terms of the level of engagement around new technology aligned with electrification. And as Ken alluded to in his opening comments, we plan to showcase a lot of those products, a lot of those technologies at our upcoming Investor Day on September 7. 
So let me kind of give you some high-level view here on the BorgWarner summary, and let me start off with Q2. And needless to say, Ron's going to provide a lot more detail and commentary in his comments. But I would just say this: We had a really good quarter. I was very pleased with our second quarter. The growth came in at the high end of our guidance, and we delivered strong operating performance. Breaking that down a little further, it was $2.3 billion in sales, which is up 3.5% when we exclude FX and Remy. Regionally, it came in about as we had expected, which was characterized by stronger growth in North America and a particularly strong quarter in Korea, which was balanced with the lower growth, as we had expected, in Europe in China. EPS came in at $0.84 a share when we exclude non-comparables, and that does include Remy. Operating margin, 12.4%; when we exclude Remy, 13.2%. The word I would use is impressive. 
Breaking that down by segment. Engine sales, $1.4 billion, so we grew at about 2.2% on a reported basis or 2.8% when we exclude currency. Primary drivers of the Engine growth were turbo and variable cam timing. Switching to Drivetrain. Sales of $895 million. That's up almost 43%, but when we exclude currency and Remy, still a good quarter of 5.4% growth. Largest part of the growth came from strong all-wheel drive sales in both North America and also in Europe. 
So let me shift gears and talk a little bit about the outlook for 2016. And again, Ron will provide more color on this. Basically, we've narrowed our guidance range to the high end of our previous range, which we think is very good news. We also have highlighted through the last couple of quarters 4 major launches this year that we've talked about that are very critical to our success in the second half of the year. And just to remind you folks, it was the Pentastar in June, Ford Scorpion, Ford Super Duty and the GM Duramax. All of these programs have launched, except for Duramax, which were launched in September. And I would say to you that the launches have been probably slower than the original assumptions, but here's the good news. This is exactly what we'd anticipated and planned for in our guidance back in January. That's why we did it. And as a result of that, our launch activity remains on track. 
So the outlook on the second half of the year, if I talk about that, I would characterize it to you that I think our risks and our opportunities are pretty well balanced. I alluded earlier in my comments, there are some risks and some watch points out there, but I also see some positive aspects, too. And in general, I think we're balanced, and with that -- that's why we feel confident in our full year guidance of mid-single-digit growth and continued strong operating performance. 
Let me make a few comments around growth in general and give you a little bit of an update on the Remy acquisition and integration. First of all, from an integration perspective, it's going well. And I think it's fair to characterize it that both financially and operationally, it's performing very much as we had expected. We remain very positive about the technology that came with the acquisition. And we've had many, many discussions with our customers, particularly around the combination products, where we're going to leverage the rotating electrical capability of Remy with our clutching capability. So that's very much on track. And you'll see that hardware, for those of you lucky enough to be with us on September 7. 
In general, our quoting and our booking activity remains strong and very good about the win rates on our booking business, and all of that leads to in-line expectations are on track for growth. 
So let me kind of wrap up before I turn over to Ron. We had a good first half to the year, and we feel very good about we delivered what we said we would. I think the business is operating well. We continue to be heavily focused on driving growth through the adoption of our technology, and we remain upbeat and positive about delivering our full year guidance. 
So with that, let me turn the call over to Ron."

Before I review the financial details, I would like to provide you some of the highlights, as I see them, for the quarter. In summary, we saw solid growth, great operating performance and a return to normal CapEx",1775,"Thank you, James, and good day, everyone. Before I review the financial details, I would like to provide you some of the highlights, as I see them, for the quarter. In summary, we saw solid growth, great operating performance and a return to normal CapEx spending and free cash flow generation. Now as Ken mentioned, I will be referring to the supplemental financial slide deck that is posted on our website, so I do encourage you to follow along. 
But first, I'd like to focus your attention on Slide 2 -- I'm sorry, Slide 3. Throughout the presentation, I will highlight certain non-U.S. GAAP measures to provide a clear picture of how the core business performed and for comparisons with prior periods. Specifically, we will be excluding the impact of FX, Remy and noncomparable items from certain U.S. GAAP measures. So when you hear me say on a comparable basis, that means excluding the impact of FX, Remy and noncomparable items. When you hear me say on a reported basis, that means U.S. GAAP. Now with that out of the way, let's move forward. 
Let's turn to Slide 4. On a reported basis, which includes the change in sales due to market growth, price, net new business, FX and Remy acquisition, sales were up 14.6%. On a comparable basis, our sales were up 3.5%, just above the midpoint of our guidance. On a reported basis, gross profit as a percentage of sales was 21.3% in the quarter. On a comparable basis, gross margin was 21.4%, up 30 basis points from last year. On a reported basis, SG&A was 8.7% of sales. On a comparable basis, SG&A was 8.2% of sales or basically flat from the same period a year ago. R&D spending, which is included in SG&A, was 3.6% of sales. However, this did include the impact of Remy, so on a comparable basis, R&D spending as a percentage of sales was flat year-over-year. 
Now let's look at the year-over-year comparison for operating income, which can be found on Slide 5. Starting on the right, second quarter 2016 operating income, excluding noncomparable items but including Remy, was $288 million or 12.4% of sales. If you also exclude Remy's $13 million net contribution, operating income on a comparable basis was $275 million or 13.2% of sales, up 30 basis points from a year ago, and yes, James, that is impressive. On a comparable basis, operating income was up $16 million on $71 million of higher sales. That gives us an incremental margin of 23% in the quarter, outstanding performance. As you look further down the income statement, equity and affiliate earnings was about $10 million in the quarter, down slightly from a year ago. Interest expense and finance charges were $21 million in the quarter, up from $18 million a year ago. The increase is primarily due to the EUR 500 million fixed-rate senior notes issued in the third quarter of 2015. Provision for income taxes in the quarter on a reported basis was $84 million. However, this included $2 million net tax benefit related to our noncomparable items and a favorable tax adjustment. You can read about each of these adjustments in our 10-Q, which will be filed later today. Excluding these items, the provision for income taxes was $86 million for an effective tax rate of 31%, which is in line with our full year guidance. Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest was about $11 million, up $2 million from the second quarter of 2015. This line item reflects our minority partner's share in the earnings performance of our Korean and Chinese consolidated joint ventures. 
Now let's take a look at our diluted earnings per share on Slide 6. Net earnings, excluding noncomparable items but including Remy, were $0.84 per diluted share. On a comparable basis, net earnings were $0.80 per diluted share. 
Now let's take a closer look at the operating segments in the quarter, beginning on Slide 7 of the deck. Reported Engine segment net sales were just over $1.4 billion in the quarter. Sales growth for the Engine segment on a comparable basis was 2.8% primarily due to higher turbocharger and variable cam timing sales, partially offset by weak commercial vehicle markets around the world. 
Turning to Slide 8. Reported adjusted EBIT was $235 million for the Engine segment or 16.3% of sales. On a comparable basis, the Engine segment adjusted EBIT was up $8 million on $39 million of higher sales for an incremental margin of 20%. Again, solid performance for the Engine segment. 
Turning to Slide 9 and starting from the right. Drivetrain segment net sales were $895 million in the quarter. This included $240 million of sales from Remy. Sales growth for the Drivetrain segment on a comparable basis was 5.4% primarily due to higher all-wheel drive sales. 
On Slide 10, reported adjusted EBIT was $93 million for the Drivetrain segment or 10.4% of sales. Excluding Remy, adjusted EBIT was 12.2% of sales, up 70 basis points from the prior year. On a comparable basis, the Drivetrain segment's adjusted EBIT was up $10 million on $34 million of higher sales for an incremental margin of 29%. Very good performance for the Drivetrain segment. 
Now let's take a look at our balance sheet and cash flow. We generated $362 million of net cash from operating activities in the first half of the year, which is up $43 million from a year ago. Capital spending was $235 million in the first half, which is down $50 million from a year ago. Capital spending was above our trend in 2015, but we have returned to normal spending levels. As a percentage of sales, CapEx was 5.1% in the first half, at the low end of our historical range of 5% to 6% of sales. Free cash flow, which was defined -- which we define as net cash from operating activity less capital spending, was $127 million in the first half, up $93 million from a year ago. We are still on track to generate between $400 million and $475 million of free cash flow in 2016, and at the midpoint, that's up 50% from 2015. Looking at the balance sheet itself, balance sheet debt increased by $85 million, and cash decreased by $83 million. In the first half compared with the end of 2015, we purchased -- our debt increased $168 million, which is primarily due to share repurchases. We spent $100 million repurchasing 5.4 million shares in the first half and have scheduled for executing an expected $200 million to $300 million of share repurchases this year. Our net debt to net capital ratio was 36.3% at the end of the second quarter, up from 35.2% at the end of 2015. Net debt-to-EBITDA at the end of the year on a trailing 12-month basis was 1.5%. 
Now I'd like to discuss our current 2016 guidance, which has improved from our previous guide, as James mentioned. So returning to the deck, let's start with our sales growth guidance for the full year on Slide 11. Note that the baseline 2015 net sales excludes Remy. We have raised the low end of our guidance range by 100 basis points. All in, we expect to grow between 13.7% and 17.5% this year, up from 12.7% to 17.5% previously. Half of the improved outlook is due to greater comfort with volume and launch timing assumptions in our net new business. The other half is because we expect the impact of currency to be less negative compared with our previous guide. Market-related growth and new business growth, net of pricing, is now expected to be between 3% and 5.5%. 
Now let's look at our operating income guidance on Slide 12 from an operating performance perspective. We're expecting 15% to 17% incremental margins on our core business sales growth, which is slightly down from our previous guide of 16% to 18%. This is nothing to get excited about, just a few minor adjustments after taking a closer look at the remaining part of the year. On an incremental margin -- incremental margins will be lower in the second half than the 19% we delivered in the first half primarily due to a tough comparison in the third quarter last year. In the third quarter 2015, we implemented sharp cost controls in response to the macro uncertainty we saw last year. That spending has returned to normal, making the year-over-year third quarter comparison challenging. On a comparable basis, we still expect our operating income margin to be greater than 13%, and including Remy, our operating income margin is still expected to be greater than 12%. 
On Slide 13, we have our EPS guidance. We now expect earnings of $3.16 to $3.32 per share. This includes $0.12 per share contribution from Remy, up from the $3.11 to $3.32 previously. The primary driver of the change is the lower share count, which raised EPS by about $0.04 across the range. Raising the low end of our sales guidance range added another $0.01 per share to the low end. And at the high end of the range, the lower incremental margin and other minor adjustments offset the lower share count. 
Now let's review our third quarter guidance issued this morning, starting with the sales growth on Slide 14. All in, we expect to grow between 13% and 21% in the third quarter, excluding 13 percentage points due to Remy. Excluding Remy, our growth in the quarter is expected to be between 0.3% and 7.6%, but this includes the negative impact of currency. Currency is expected to lower sales by 220 basis points at the low end and 10 basis points at the high end. On a comparable basis, we expect to grow between 2.5% and 7.5% in the quarter. Our growth is improving in the second half primarily due to major truck launches with GM and Ford. 
From an earnings perspective, as shown on Slide 15, we expect earnings of $0.74 to $0.81 per share in the third quarter, which includes about $0.03 per share from Remy. Excluding Remy, we expect earnings to be $0.71 to $0.78 per share. 
So in conclusion, we had a very good second quarter. This is the third quarter in a row of exceeding our EPS and sales goals. And as we look forward at the rest of the year, we expect to continue on this path: solid sales growth, strong operating margins and improved cash flow from a year ago. I absolutely remain confident that we will deliver our 2016 guidance. 
And with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Ken."

The only thing that's a little different to what it was -- well, obviously, the truck-car mix is a little different in North America, so that kind of moves things around in how companies look at their overall fleet averages. But fundamentally, I mean, the standards are not changing of any note in our view. And I would say the pull for the types of technologies that we have to deliver on those standards is as strong as it was 6 months, 12 months or 18 months ago. So we're not seeing any pullback at all in terms of desire and drive for the types of technologies that we have. And I think our best guess as we engage with EPA and others is there could be some nuance and some modest -- minor tweaks to the standards, but we've not seen anything material enough to change the direction of the OEMs and what we're doing with them."

I would tell you we've not seen any impact thus far in schedules and releases and those types of things. So I think it's going to be more of a '17 type event than a '16 event for Europe. And the U.K. will trim itself up, but again, that's -- about 1% of our revenue is in the U.K. So we're still pretty good where we're at right now."

You got this 29% incremental margin, which is about $10 million. Probably a little bit less than half of that is because of the tailwinds that we're having for the full year from the restructuring activities, so call it $4 million, for example. So that's the benefit we're getting from the restructuring. If you take a look at the full year guidance, you can see $15 million roughly. I think we're $7 million year-to-date of restructuring tailwinds. So we had about $2 million, I think it was, in the first or something, so remaining's in the second quarter. That's going to continue through the rest of the year. We'll get that other $7 million, say, I'm running numbers here, the rest of the year. Now the third quarter might be a little bit tougher, but the fourth quarter, we'll get that through the year. I think we're on track in that range that we have for tailwinds. So that's Drivetrain, okay? Puts the best. We're on track. Now the other issue that we're dealing with is the year-over-year. I mentioned in my script that we took some cost controls, primarily in SG&A, last year when we saw some difficulties in the macro environment we've been facing. So some of these SG&A spending is going to come back in the second half of the year. Specifically, probably in the corporate spending rates, we'll uptick a few million bucks here and there in the next 2 quarters. So that's what you're going to see going forward sequentially on the SG&A side, primarily in the corporate."

So we're talking about a 400-ish number in the second half. I said earlier that sequentially, we're a little lower, so you're south the $400 million in the second half of the year. So let's just play that out, and maybe that moves down a little bit based on some inventory true-up. What are you, $20 million, $30 million, $40 million type of a number? So it's important for us.

First c",613,"Okay, Brett, that's -- I'm happy to talk about that. So let me talk a little bit about sources of growth for Remy. I think that was kind of your first key question. I would encourage you and the investors to think of 2 channels of growth for Remy. First channel of growth is primarily through their existing off-the-shelf technology for vehicles and applications that are in service today. What I mean by that is selling more belt-alternator starters and motors and generators to -- than they sell today. And what I mean by channels is on light vehicle, today, they ship to Hyundai and General Motors, and that's it. And we see leverage in the BorgWarner channels and BorgWarner relationships, that there's no reason on the planet why we can't be selling starters and alternators and belt-alternator starter systems to other customers beyond that current. That's okay. And regionally, they have almost no presence in Europe, and clearly, Borg has a big presence, so there's a regional play where we can accelerate our European relationships to grow, what I would describe, Brett, as their coexisting product line business. So that's a source of growth for us that we will leverage. And you would anticipate that can be done in a shorter horizon only because there's quoting activity today, and we have product to put on those vehicles. So that's the first source of growth. The second source of growth is, where you're alluding to, is to help take us further into electrification, and there's a number of potential opportunities there. First of all, they have the motor technology that you could use either in a hybrid vehicle or pure electric vehicle, and that's a traction motor of sorts that we can use. The second path for them is to combine the rotating electrics of the motor, coupled -- together with our clutching technology to offer hybrid vehicle solution, where we need to bring together the motor and the clutching technology, so we can offer engagement or disengagement between the motor and the combustion engine. We have product on the shelf to do that today, and we're quoting that activity. The third leg of opportunistic growth is the more advanced starter -- belt-alternator starter systems that will emerge as a need for stop-start technology and hybrid technology. And Remy has a number of products in that space that we'll be pushing forward onto hybrid applications. The last area, I would say, just in general, they bring motor technology that helps us on other product applications. So if you think of -- I talked about earlier about an eBooster technology, which is a turbocharger with a boosting [indiscernible]. A compressor device requires power electronics and motor know-how. Remy can bring that knowledge to us. All of that separate, so where does that all translate to into dollars of growth? We're working our way through that, but there's certainly absolutely no reason why Remy wouldn't grow at least at BorgWarner levels. You got to give us a little bit of time to lay that out for you in terms of cadence and pull all of that together, and we'll get through that over the next few months. So what we're going to do, Brett, is we'll use the September date to showcase the technology for you and some of the -- and what we're doing on it. And then we'll pull all of that together in the January net new business to lay out for you what the next 3 years of growth looks like for Remy, both from conventional products and the combination products with BorgWarner products. Hopefully, that helps you a little bit."

As Ken said, Ron and I are really pleased to share our results from the second quarter with you and also talk about what the rest of the year looks like. What I'd like to do is just start and make a few high-level",1569,"Thank you, Ken, and welcome to everybody. As Ken said, Ron and I are really pleased to share our results from the second quarter with you and also talk about what the rest of the year looks like. What I'd like to do is just start and make a few high-level comments on some of the bigger-picture perspective as we look out into the macro industry -- or the macro environment in our industry, and you can see a couple of points here on Slide 2, for those following along. 
I think the theme I would talk the most to in terms of the macro view is the notion of uncertainty out there in the world, and whether that's some of the civil unrest issues that we see, particularly in Europe. We see tense political environment recently in Turkey and Middle East, pending U.S. elections and, of course, fairly recently, the Brexit vote. All of that creates, I think we all realize, a sense of uncertainty at a macro view. But interestingly, when I look at the world of autos, we've generally seen a pretty stable, steady-as-you-go type environment and things playing out pretty much as we'd expect it. And as we look forward, I see that macro uncertainty will continue, but I do see the auto side remaining fairly stable. 
And as I articulate that a little further and talk to you about the market outlook, first of all, from a light vehicle perspective, I would say from a BorgWarner viewpoint, we're pretty well aligned with IHS. We see the China market growing that mid-single-digit 5% to 6% type range. We see Europe in a 2% to 3% growth environment range, and we see the U.S. in that 2% to 3% range of growth for light vehicle production. We do see and we acknowledge that the U.S. plateau effect is certainly on the horizon, and we're very mindful of that. 
From a commercial vehicle point of view, we still see that space challenged, for sure, and as you look around globally, there's really not a lot of growth at all. We do see some pretty continued strong weakness around off-road. So that translates into a lot of new programs under further review and consideration. 
So as I look at that, I would like to share with you one of the leading indicators or the areas of watch for us as a company at BorgWarner and the ones that can be most relevant to us. So I would characterize the North American market, how is the plateau going to play out, how is the inventory production levels going to play out, and we pay good attention to that. And I'll talk about how these relate to our guidance shortly. VW remains a critical customer and a very important customer for us, and we have to monitor the share for VW around the world. And like everybody, we're going to pay attention to the potential impacts of volumes in Europe in light of Brexit, and we'll obviously monitor the commercial vehicle weakness. 
Now all of that said, I would say so far, things are absolutely planned up for our guidance. And as you'll see in the guidance going forward, we still feel good about our guidance, and we're building these in and going forward with good guidance. So yes, we're watching, but we're also performing as expected, and we expect to perform strongly going forward. 
Let me comment a little on the regulatory or the technology aspects of the business. First thing I would say to you is the pull and the drive for fuel economy and emissions regulations, absolutely unchanged, and the pull for powertrain technology remains as strong as it did last quarter, the quarter before that and the quarter before that. So we have not seen any slowdown in customer engagement and programs that are driving and pulling advanced technology as we go forward. We do see the strong shift to increased powertrain electrification continues. And we know that because we're right in the middle of it, and we're talking to customers literarily every day around the world and working with them on solutions for them in that additional electrification content. That applies across the board. That's 48-volt architectures. It's other hybrids, and it's electric vehicles. And we have content and discussion there, not just for the long term but products in the short run as well. 
I would say also relative to electrification, our quoting activity remains very strong, multiple customers, multiple products. And we'll be making further announcements on specific programs in the coming weeks and months. But I would just say this: I feel very pleased and very happy where we're at in terms of the level of engagement around new technology aligned with electrification. And as Ken alluded to in his opening comments, we plan to showcase a lot of those products, a lot of those technologies at our upcoming Investor Day on September 7. 
So let me kind of give you some high-level view here on the BorgWarner summary, and let me start off with Q2. And needless to say, Ron's going to provide a lot more detail and commentary in his comments. But I would just say this: We had a really good quarter. I was very pleased with our second quarter. The growth came in at the high end of our guidance, and we delivered strong operating performance. Breaking that down a little further, it was $2.3 billion in sales, which is up 3.5% when we exclude FX and Remy. Regionally, it came in about as we had expected, which was characterized by stronger growth in North America and a particularly strong quarter in Korea, which was balanced with the lower growth, as we had expected, in Europe in China. EPS came in at $0.84 a share when we exclude non-comparables, and that does include Remy. Operating margin, 12.4%; when we exclude Remy, 13.2%. The word I would use is impressive. 
Breaking that down by segment. Engine sales, $1.4 billion, so we grew at about 2.2% on a reported basis or 2.8% when we exclude currency. Primary drivers of the Engine growth were turbo and variable cam timing. Switching to Drivetrain. Sales of $895 million. That's up almost 43%, but when we exclude currency and Remy, still a good quarter of 5.4% growth. Largest part of the growth came from strong all-wheel drive sales in both North America and also in Europe. 
So let me shift gears and talk a little bit about the outlook for 2016. And again, Ron will provide more color on this. Basically, we've narrowed our guidance range to the high end of our previous range, which we think is very good news. We also have highlighted through the last couple of quarters 4 major launches this year that we've talked about that are very critical to our success in the second half of the year. And just to remind you folks, it was the Pentastar in June, Ford Scorpion, Ford Super Duty and the GM Duramax. All of these programs have launched, except for Duramax, which were launched in September. And I would say to you that the launches have been probably slower than the original assumptions, but here's the good news. This is exactly what we'd anticipated and planned for in our guidance back in January. That's why we did it. And as a result of that, our launch activity remains on track. 
So the outlook on the second half of the year, if I talk about that, I would characterize it to you that I think our risks and our opportunities are pretty well balanced. I alluded earlier in my comments, there are some risks and some watch points out there, but I also see some positive aspects, too. And in general, I think we're balanced, and with that -- that's why we feel confident in our full year guidance of mid-single-digit growth and continued strong operating performance. 
Let me make a few comments around growth in general and give you a little bit of an update on the Remy acquisition and integration. First of all, from an integration perspective, it's going well. And I think it's fair to characterize it that both financially and operationally, it's performing very much as we had expected. We remain very positive about the technology that came with the acquisition. And we've had many, many discussions with our customers, particularly around the combination products, where we're going to leverage the rotating electrical capability of Remy with our clutching capability. So that's very much on track. And you'll see that hardware, for those of you lucky enough to be with us on September 7. 
In general, our quoting and our booking activity remains strong and very good about the win rates on our booking business, and all of that leads to in-line expectations are on track for growth. 
So let me kind of wrap up before I turn over to Ron. We had a good first half to the year, and we feel very good about we delivered what we said we would. I think the business is operating well. We continue to be heavily focused on driving growth through the adoption of our technology, and we remain upbeat and positive about delivering our full year guidance. 
So with that, let me turn the call over to Ron."

Before I review the financial details, I would like to provide you some of the highlights, as I see them, for the quarter. In summary, we saw solid growth, great operating performance and a return to normal CapEx",1775,"Thank you, James, and good day, everyone. Before I review the financial details, I would like to provide you some of the highlights, as I see them, for the quarter. In summary, we saw solid growth, great operating performance and a return to normal CapEx spending and free cash flow generation. Now as Ken mentioned, I will be referring to the supplemental financial slide deck that is posted on our website, so I do encourage you to follow along. 
But first, I'd like to focus your attention on Slide 2 -- I'm sorry, Slide 3. Throughout the presentation, I will highlight certain non-U.S. GAAP measures to provide a clear picture of how the core business performed and for comparisons with prior periods. Specifically, we will be excluding the impact of FX, Remy and noncomparable items from certain U.S. GAAP measures. So when you hear me say on a comparable basis, that means excluding the impact of FX, Remy and noncomparable items. When you hear me say on a reported basis, that means U.S. GAAP. Now with that out of the way, let's move forward. 
Let's turn to Slide 4. On a reported basis, which includes the change in sales due to market growth, price, net new business, FX and Remy acquisition, sales were up 14.6%. On a comparable basis, our sales were up 3.5%, just above the midpoint of our guidance. On a reported basis, gross profit as a percentage of sales was 21.3% in the quarter. On a comparable basis, gross margin was 21.4%, up 30 basis points from last year. On a reported basis, SG&A was 8.7% of sales. On a comparable basis, SG&A was 8.2% of sales or basically flat from the same period a year ago. R&D spending, which is included in SG&A, was 3.6% of sales. However, this did include the impact of Remy, so on a comparable basis, R&D spending as a percentage of sales was flat year-over-year. 
Now let's look at the year-over-year comparison for operating income, which can be found on Slide 5. Starting on the right, second quarter 2016 operating income, excluding noncomparable items but including Remy, was $288 million or 12.4% of sales. If you also exclude Remy's $13 million net contribution, operating income on a comparable basis was $275 million or 13.2% of sales, up 30 basis points from a year ago, and yes, James, that is impressive. On a comparable basis, operating income was up $16 million on $71 million of higher sales. That gives us an incremental margin of 23% in the quarter, outstanding performance. As you look further down the income statement, equity and affiliate earnings was about $10 million in the quarter, down slightly from a year ago. Interest expense and finance charges were $21 million in the quarter, up from $18 million a year ago. The increase is primarily due to the EUR 500 million fixed-rate senior notes issued in the third quarter of 2015. Provision for income taxes in the quarter on a reported basis was $84 million. However, this included $2 million net tax benefit related to our noncomparable items and a favorable tax adjustment. You can read about each of these adjustments in our 10-Q, which will be filed later today. Excluding these items, the provision for income taxes was $86 million for an effective tax rate of 31%, which is in line with our full year guidance. Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest was about $11 million, up $2 million from the second quarter of 2015. This line item reflects our minority partner's share in the earnings performance of our Korean and Chinese consolidated joint ventures. 
Now let's take a look at our diluted earnings per share on Slide 6. Net earnings, excluding noncomparable items but including Remy, were $0.84 per diluted share. On a comparable basis, net earnings were $0.80 per diluted share. 
Now let's take a closer look at the operating segments in the quarter, beginning on Slide 7 of the deck. Reported Engine segment net sales were just over $1.4 billion in the quarter. Sales growth for the Engine segment on a comparable basis was 2.8% primarily due to higher turbocharger and variable cam timing sales, partially offset by weak commercial vehicle markets around the world. 
Turning to Slide 8. Reported adjusted EBIT was $235 million for the Engine segment or 16.3% of sales. On a comparable basis, the Engine segment adjusted EBIT was up $8 million on $39 million of higher sales for an incremental margin of 20%. Again, solid performance for the Engine segment. 
Turning to Slide 9 and starting from the right. Drivetrain segment net sales were $895 million in the quarter. This included $240 million of sales from Remy. Sales growth for the Drivetrain segment on a comparable basis was 5.4% primarily due to higher all-wheel drive sales. 
On Slide 10, reported adjusted EBIT was $93 million for the Drivetrain segment or 10.4% of sales. Excluding Remy, adjusted EBIT was 12.2% of sales, up 70 basis points from the prior year. On a comparable basis, the Drivetrain segment's adjusted EBIT was up $10 million on $34 million of higher sales for an incremental margin of 29%. Very good performance for the Drivetrain segment. 
Now let's take a look at our balance sheet and cash flow. We generated $362 million of net cash from operating activities in the first half of the year, which is up $43 million from a year ago. Capital spending was $235 million in the first half, which is down $50 million from a year ago. Capital spending was above our trend in 2015, but we have returned to normal spending levels. As a percentage of sales, CapEx was 5.1% in the first half, at the low end of our historical range of 5% to 6% of sales. Free cash flow, which was defined -- which we define as net cash from operating activity less capital spending, was $127 million in the first half, up $93 million from a year ago. We are still on track to generate between $400 million and $475 million of free cash flow in 2016, and at the midpoint, that's up 50% from 2015. Looking at the balance sheet itself, balance sheet debt increased by $85 million, and cash decreased by $83 million. In the first half compared with the end of 2015, we purchased -- our debt increased $168 million, which is primarily due to share repurchases. We spent $100 million repurchasing 5.4 million shares in the first half and have scheduled for executing an expected $200 million to $300 million of share repurchases this year. Our net debt to net capital ratio was 36.3% at the end of the second quarter, up from 35.2% at the end of 2015. Net debt-to-EBITDA at the end of the year on a trailing 12-month basis was 1.5%. 
Now I'd like to discuss our current 2016 guidance, which has improved from our previous guide, as James mentioned. So returning to the deck, let's start with our sales growth guidance for the full year on Slide 11. Note that the baseline 2015 net sales excludes Remy. We have raised the low end of our guidance range by 100 basis points. All in, we expect to grow between 13.7% and 17.5% this year, up from 12.7% to 17.5% previously. Half of the improved outlook is due to greater comfort with volume and launch timing assumptions in our net new business. The other half is because we expect the impact of currency to be less negative compared with our previous guide. Market-related growth and new business growth, net of pricing, is now expected to be between 3% and 5.5%. 
Now let's look at our operating income guidance on Slide 12 from an operating performance perspective. We're expecting 15% to 17% incremental margins on our core business sales growth, which is slightly down from our previous guide of 16% to 18%. This is nothing to get excited about, just a few minor adjustments after taking a closer look at the remaining part of the year. On an incremental margin -- incremental margins will be lower in the second half than the 19% we delivered in the first half primarily due to a tough comparison in the third quarter last year. In the third quarter 2015, we implemented sharp cost controls in response to the macro uncertainty we saw last year. That spending has returned to normal, making the year-over-year third quarter comparison challenging. On a comparable basis, we still expect our operating income margin to be greater than 13%, and including Remy, our operating income margin is still expected to be greater than 12%. 
On Slide 13, we have our EPS guidance. We now expect earnings of $3.16 to $3.32 per share. This includes $0.12 per share contribution from Remy, up from the $3.11 to $3.32 previously. The primary driver of the change is the lower share count, which raised EPS by about $0.04 across the range. Raising the low end of our sales guidance range added another $0.01 per share to the low end. And at the high end of the range, the lower incremental margin and other minor adjustments offset the lower share count. 
Now let's review our third quarter guidance issued this morning, starting with the sales growth on Slide 14. All in, we expect to grow between 13% and 21% in the third quarter, excluding 13 percentage points due to Remy. Excluding Remy, our growth in the quarter is expected to be between 0.3% and 7.6%, but this includes the negative impact of currency. Currency is expected to lower sales by 220 basis points at the low end and 10 basis points at the high end. On a comparable basis, we expect to grow between 2.5% and 7.5% in the quarter. Our growth is improving in the second half primarily due to major truck launches with GM and Ford. 
From an earnings perspective, as shown on Slide 15, we expect earnings of $0.74 to $0.81 per share in the third quarter, which includes about $0.03 per share from Remy. Excluding Remy, we expect earnings to be $0.71 to $0.78 per share. 
So in conclusion, we had a very good second quarter. This is the third quarter in a row of exceeding our EPS and sales goals. And as we look forward at the rest of the year, we expect to continue on this path: solid sales growth, strong operating margins and improved cash flow from a year ago. I absolutely remain confident that we will deliver our 2016 guidance. 
And with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Ken."

But fundamentally, I mean, the standards are not changing of any note in our view. And I would say the pull for the types of technologies that we have to deliver on those standards is as strong as it was 6 months, 12 months or 18 months ago. So we're not seeing any pullback at all in terms of desire and drive for the types of technologies that we have. And I think our best guess as we engage with EPA and others is there could be some nuance and some modest -- minor tweaks to the standards, but we've not seen anything material enough to change the direction of the OEMs and what we're doing with them."

You got this 29% incremental margin, which is about $10 million. Probably a little bit less than half of that is because of the tailwinds that we're having for the full year from the restructuring activities, so call it $4 million, for example. So that's the benefit we're getting from the restructuring. If you take a look at the full year guidance, you can see $15 million roughly. I think we're $7 million year-to-date of restructuring tailwinds. So we had about $2 million, I think it was, in the first or something, so remaining's in the second quarter. That's going to continue through the rest of the year. We'll get that other $7 million, say, I'm running numbers here, the rest of the year. Now the third quarter might be a little bit tougher, but the fourth quarter, we'll get that through the year. I think we're on track in that range that we have for tailwinds. So that's Drivetrain, okay? Puts the best. We're on track. Now the other issue that we're dealing with is the year-over-year. I mentioned in my script that we took some cost controls, primarily in SG&A, last year when we saw some difficulties in the macro environment we've been facing. So some of these SG&A spending is going to come back in the second half of the year.

So rough numbers, you can think all of BorgWarner with Ford in North America maybe about an $800 million, $900 million revenue number for the year. So half of that's gone, right? So we're talking about a 400-ish number in the second half. I said earlier that sequentially, we're a little lower, so you're south the $400 million in the second half of the year. So let's just play that out, and maybe that moves down a little bit based on some inventory true-up. What are you, $20 million, $30 million, $40 million type of a number? So it's important for us. We're not dismissing it, but it's also scalable and manageable from a BorgWarner point of view. It's the way I would think of it. Specifically on Super Duty, as Ron alluded to earlier, it's important to recognize that's conquest business for us, so we go from 0 to whatever.

There's no commercial vehicle revenue in Drivetrain. So that was the key weight for us. I would say the other area that weighted a little bit on us was China. Some of our larger customers in China, so I'm talking about Volkswagen, I'm talking about Great Wall, I'm talking about Ford and GM, had pretty low-growth quarters. If you aggregate those 4, actually, it was no growth. So that weighted more on Engine than Drivetrain as well. And those are 2 of the bigger things.

So let me talk a little bit about sources of growth for Remy. I think that was kind of your first key question. I would encourage you and the investors to think of 2 channels of growth for Remy. First c",613,"Okay, Brett, that's -- I'm happy to talk about that. So let me talk a little bit about sources of growth for Remy. I think that was kind of your first key question. I would encourage you and the investors to think of 2 channels of growth for Remy. First channel of growth is primarily through their existing off-the-shelf technology for vehicles and applications that are in service today. What I mean by that is selling more belt-alternator starters and motors and generators to -- than they sell today. And what I mean by channels is on light vehicle, today, they ship to Hyundai and General Motors, and that's it. And we see leverage in the BorgWarner channels and BorgWarner relationships, that there's no reason on the planet why we can't be selling starters and alternators and belt-alternator starter systems to other customers beyond that current. That's okay. And regionally, they have almost no presence in Europe, and clearly, Borg has a big presence, so there's a regional play where we can accelerate our European relationships to grow, what I would describe, Brett, as their coexisting product line business. So that's a source of growth for us that we will leverage. And you would anticipate that can be done in a shorter horizon only because there's quoting activity today, and we have product to put on those vehicles. So that's the first source of growth. The second source of growth is, where you're alluding to, is to help take us further into electrification, and there's a number of potential opportunities there. First of all, they have the motor technology that you could use either in a hybrid vehicle or pure electric vehicle, and that's a traction motor of sorts that we can use. The second path for them is to combine the rotating electrics of the motor, coupled -- together with our clutching technology to offer hybrid vehicle solution, where we need to bring together the motor and the clutching technology, so we can offer engagement or disengagement between the motor and the combustion engine. We have product on the shelf to do that today, and we're quoting that activity. The third leg of opportunistic growth is the more advanced starter -- belt-alternator starter systems that will emerge as a need for stop-start technology and hybrid technology. And Remy has a number of products in that space that we'll be pushing forward onto hybrid applications. The last area, I would say, just in general, they bring motor technology that helps us on other product applications. So if you think of -- I talked about earlier about an eBooster technology, which is a turbocharger with a boosting [indiscernible]. A compressor device requires power electronics and motor know-how. Remy can bring that knowledge to us. All of that separate, so where does that all translate to into dollars of growth? We're working our way through that, but there's certainly absolutely no reason why Remy wouldn't grow at least at BorgWarner levels. You got to give us a little bit of time to lay that out for you in terms of cadence and pull all of that together, and we'll get through that over the next few months. So what we're going to do, Brett, is we'll use the September date to showcase the technology for you and some of the -- and what we're doing on it. And then we'll pull all of that together in the January net new business to lay out for you what the next 3 years of growth looks like for Remy, both from conventional products and the combination products with BorgWarner products. Hopefully, that helps you a little bit."

R&D reviews, technology programs, advanced engineering programs, all pretty much continuing on as is, so to speak. So yes, we're not seeing any meaningful shift, to your question."

As Ken said, Ron and I are really pleased to share our results from the second quarter with you and also talk about what the rest of the year looks like. What I'd like to do is just start and make a few high-level",1570,"Thank you, Ken, and welcome to everybody. As Ken said, Ron and I are really pleased to share our results from the second quarter with you and also talk about what the rest of the year looks like. What I'd like to do is just start and make a few high-level comments on some of the bigger-picture perspective as we look out into the macro industry -- or the macro environment in our industry, and you can see a couple of points here on Slide 2, for those following along. 
I think the theme I would talk the most to in terms of the macro view is the notion of uncertainty out there in the world, and whether that's some of the civil unrest issues that we see, particularly in Europe. We see tense political environment recently in Turkey and Middle East, pending U.S. elections and, of course, fairly recently, the Brexit vote. All of that creates, I think we all realize, a sense of uncertainty at a macro view. But interestingly, when I look at the world of autos, we've generally seen a pretty stable, steady-as-you-go type environment and things playing out pretty much as we'd expect it. And as we look forward, I see that macro uncertainty will continue, but I do see the auto side remaining fairly stable. 
And as I articulate that a little further and talk to you about the market outlook, first of all, from a light vehicle perspective, I would say from a BorgWarner viewpoint, we're pretty well aligned with IHS. We see the China market growing that mid-single-digit 5% to 6% type range. We see Europe in a 2% to 3% growth environment range, and we see the U.S. in that 2% to 3% range of growth for light vehicle production. We do see and we acknowledge that the U.S. plateau effect is certainly on the horizon, and we're very mindful of that. 
From a commercial vehicle point of view, we still see that space challenged, for sure, and as you look around globally, there's really not a lot of growth at all. We do see some pretty continued strong weakness around off-road. So that translates into a lot of new programs under further review and consideration. 
So as I look at that, I would like to share with you one of the leading indicators or the areas of watch for us as a company at BorgWarner and the ones that can be most relevant to us. So I would characterize the North American market, how is the plateau going to play out, how is the inventory production levels going to play out, and we pay good attention to that. And I'll talk about how these relate to our guidance shortly. VW remains a critical customer and a very important customer for us, and we have to monitor the share for VW around the world. And like everybody, we're going to pay attention to the potential impacts of volumes in Europe in light of Brexit, and we'll obviously monitor the commercial vehicle weakness. 
Now all of that said, I would say so far, things are absolutely planned out for our guidance. And as you'll see in the guidance going forward, we still feel good about our guidance, and we're building these in and going forward with good guidance. So yes, we'll watch it, but we're also performing as expected, and we expect to perform strongly going forward. 
Let me comment a little on the regulatory or the technology aspects of the business. First thing I would say to you is the pull and the drive for fuel economy and emissions regulations, absolutely unchanged, and the pull for powertrain technology remains as strong as it did last quarter, the quarter before that and the quarter before that. So we have not seen any slowdown in customer engagement and programs that are driving and pulling advanced technology as we go forward. We do see the strong shift to increased powertrain electrification continues. And we know that because we're right in the middle of it, and we're talking to customers literally every day around the world and working with them on solutions for them in that additional electrification content. That applies across the board. That's 48-volt architectures. It's other hybrids, and it's electric vehicles. And we have content and discussion there, not just for the long term but products in the short run as well. 
I would say also relative to electrification, our quoting activity remains very strong, multiple customers, multiple products. And we'll be making further announcements on specific programs in the coming weeks and months. But I would just say this: I feel very pleased and very happy where we're at in terms of the level of engagement around new technology aligned with electrification. And as Ken alluded to in his opening comments, we plan to showcase a lot of those products, a lot of those technologies at our upcoming Investor Day on September 7. 
So let me kind of give you some high-level view here on the BorgWarner summary, and let me start off with Q2. And needless to say, Ron's going to provide a lot more detail and commentary in his comments. But I would just say this: We had a really good quarter. I was very pleased with our second quarter. The growth came in at the high end of our guidance, and we delivered strong operating performance. Breaking that down a little further, it was $2.3 billion in sales, which is up 3.5% when we exclude FX and Remy. Regionally, it came in about as we had expected, which was characterized by stronger growth in North America and a particularly strong quarter in Korea, which was balanced with the lower growth, as we had expected, in Europe in China. EPS came in at $0.84 a share when we exclude noncomparables, and that does include Remy. Operating margin, 12.4%; when we exclude Remy, 13.2%. The word I would use is impressive. 
Breaking that down by segment. Engine sales, $1.4 billion, so we grew at about 2.2% on a reported basis or 2.8% when we exclude currency. Primary drivers of the Engine growth were turbo and variable cam timing. Switching to Drivetrain. Sales of $895 million. That's up almost 43%, but when we exclude currency and Remy, still a good quarter of 5.4% growth. Largest part of the growth came from strong all-wheel drive sales in both North America and also in Europe. 
So let me shift gears and talk a little bit about the outlook for 2016. And again, Ron will provide more color on this. Basically, we've narrowed our guidance range to the high end of our previous range, which we think is very good news. We also have highlighted through the last couple of quarters 4 major launches this year that we've talked about that are very critical to our success in the second half of the year. And just to remind you folks, it was the Pentastar in June, Ford Scorpion, Ford Super Duty and the GM Duramax. All of these programs have launched, except for Duramax, which were launched in September. And I would say to you that the launches have been probably slower than the original assumptions, but here's the good news. This is exactly what we'd anticipated and planned for in our guidance back in January. That's why we did it. And as a result of that, our launch activity remains on track. 
So the outlook on the second half of the year, if I talk about that, I would characterize it to you that I think our risks and our opportunities are pretty well balanced. I alluded earlier in my comments, there are some risks and some watch points out there, but I also see some positive aspects, too. And in general, I think we're balanced, and with that, that's why we feel confident in our full year guidance of mid-single-digit growth and continued strong operating performance. 
Let me make a few comments around growth in general and give you a little bit of an update on the Remy acquisition and integration. First of all, from an integration perspective, it's going well. And I think it's fair to characterize it that both financially and operationally, it's performing very much as we had expected. We remain very positive about the technology that came with the acquisition. And we've had many, many discussions with our customers, particularly around the combination products, where we're going to leverage the rotating electrical capability of Remy with our clutching capability. So that's very much on track. And you'll see that hardware, for those of you lucky enough to be with us on September 7. 
In general, our quoting and our booking activity remains strong and very good about the win rates on our booking business, and all of that leads to in-line expectations are on track for growth. 
So let me kind of wrap up before I turn it over to Ron. We had a good first half to the year, and we feel very good about we delivered what we said we would. I think the business is operating well. We continue to be heavily focused on driving growth through the adoption of our technology, and we remain upbeat and positive about delivering our full year guidance. 
So with that, let me turn the call over to Ron."

Before I review the financial details, I would like to provide you some of the highlights, as I see them, for the quarter. In summary, we saw solid growth, great operating performance and a return to normal CapEx",1775,"Thank you, James, and good day, everyone. Before I review the financial details, I would like to provide you some of the highlights, as I see them, for the quarter. In summary, we saw solid growth, great operating performance and a return to normal CapEx spending and free cash flow generation. Now as Ken mentioned, I will be referring to the supplemental financial slide deck that is posted on our website, so I do encourage you to follow along. 
But first, I'd like to focus your attention on Slide 2 -- I'm sorry, Slide 3. Throughout the presentation, I will highlight certain non-U.S. GAAP measures to provide a clear picture of how the core business performed and for comparisons with prior periods. Specifically, we will be excluding the impact of FX, Remy and noncomparable items from certain U.S. GAAP measures. So when you hear me say on a comparable basis, that means excluding the impact of FX, Remy and noncomparable items. When you hear me say on a reported basis, that means U.S. GAAP. Now with that out of the way, let's move forward. 
Let's turn to Slide 4. On a reported basis, which includes the change in sales due to market growth, price, net new business, FX and Remy acquisition, sales were up 14.6%. On a comparable basis, our sales were up 3.5%, just above the midpoint of our guidance. On a reported basis, gross profit as a percentage of sales was 21.3% in the quarter. On a comparable basis, gross margin was 21.4%, up 30 basis points from last year. On a reported basis, SG&A was 8.7% of sales. On a comparable basis, SG&A was 8.2% of sales or basically flat from the same period a year ago. R&D spending, which is included in SG&A, was 3.6% of sales. However, this did include the impact of Remy, so on a comparable basis, R&D spending as a percentage of sales was flat year-over-year. 
Now let's look at the year-over-year comparison for operating income, which can be found on Slide 5. Starting on the right, second quarter 2016 operating income, excluding noncomparable items but including Remy, was $288 million or 12.4% of sales. If you also exclude Remy's $13 million net contribution, operating income on a comparable basis was $275 million or 13.2% of sales, up 30 basis points from a year ago, and yes, James, that is impressive. On a comparable basis, operating income was up $16 million on $71 million of higher sales. That gives us an incremental margin of 23% in the quarter, outstanding performance. As you look further down the income statement, equity and affiliate earnings was about $10 million in the quarter, down slightly from a year ago. Interest expense and finance charges were $21 million in the quarter, up from $18 million a year ago. The increase is primarily due to the EUR 500 million fixed-rate senior notes issued in the third quarter of 2015. Provision for income taxes in the quarter on a reported basis was $84 million. However, this included $2 million net tax benefit related to our noncomparable items and a favorable tax adjustment. You can read about each of these adjustments in our 10-Q, which will be filed later today. Excluding these items, the provision for income taxes was $86 million for an effective tax rate of 31%, which is in line with our full year guidance. Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest was about $11 million, up $2 million from the second quarter of 2015. This line item reflects our minority partner's share in the earnings performance of our Korean and Chinese consolidated joint ventures. 
Now let's take a look at our diluted earnings per share on Slide 6. Net earnings, excluding noncomparable items but including Remy, were $0.84 per diluted share. On a comparable basis, net earnings were $0.80 per diluted share. 
Now let's take a closer look at the operating segments in the quarter, beginning on Slide 7 of the deck. Reported Engine segment net sales were just over $1.4 billion in the quarter. Sales growth for the Engine segment on a comparable basis was 2.8% primarily due to higher turbocharger and variable cam timing sales, partially offset by weak commercial vehicle markets around the world. 
Turning to Slide 8. Reported adjusted EBIT was $235 million for the Engine segment or 16.3% of sales. On a comparable basis, the Engine segment adjusted EBIT was up $8 million on $39 million of higher sales for an incremental margin of 20%. Again, solid performance for the Engine segment. 
Turning to Slide 9 and starting from the right. Drivetrain segment net sales were $895 million in the quarter. This included $240 million of sales from Remy. Sales growth for the Drivetrain segment on a comparable basis was 5.4% primarily due to higher all-wheel drive sales. 
On Slide 10, reported adjusted EBIT was $93 million for the Drivetrain segment or 10.4% of sales. Excluding Remy, adjusted EBIT was 12.2% of sales, up 70 basis points from the prior year. On a comparable basis, the Drivetrain segment's adjusted EBIT was up $10 million on $34 million of higher sales for an incremental margin of 29%. Very good performance for the Drivetrain segment. 
Now let's take a look at our balance sheet and cash flow. We generated $362 million of net cash from operating activities in the first half of the year, which is up $43 million from a year ago. Capital spending was $235 million in the first half, which is down $50 million from a year ago. Capital spending was above our trend in 2015, but we have returned to normal spending levels. As a percentage of sales, CapEx was 5.1% in the first half, at the low end of our historical range of 5% to 6% of sales. Free cash flow, which was defined -- which we define as net cash from operating activity less capital spending, was $127 million in the first half, up $93 million from a year ago. We are still on track to generate between $400 million and $475 million of free cash flow in 2016, and at the midpoint, that's up 50% from 2015. Looking at the balance sheet itself, balance sheet debt increased by $85 million, and cash decreased by $83 million. In the first half compared with the end of 2015, we purchased -- our debt increased $168 million, which is primarily due to share repurchases. We spent $100 million repurchasing 5.4 million shares in the first half and have scheduled for executing an expected $200 million to $300 million of share repurchases this year. Our net debt to net capital ratio was 36.3% at the end of the second quarter, up from 35.2% at the end of 2015. Net debt-to-EBITDA at the end of the year on a trailing 12-month basis was 1.5%. 
Now I'd like to discuss our current 2016 guidance, which has improved from our previous guide, as James mentioned. So returning to the deck, let's start with our sales growth guidance for the full year on Slide 11. Note that the baseline 2015 net sales excludes Remy. We have raised the low end of our guidance range by 100 basis points. All in, we expect to grow between 13.7% and 17.5% this year, up from 12.7% to 17.5% previously. Half of the improved outlook is due to greater comfort with volume and launch timing assumptions in our net new business. The other half is because we expect the impact of currency to be less negative compared with our previous guide. Market-related growth and new business growth, net of pricing, is now expected to be between 3% and 5.5%. 
Now let's look at our operating income guidance on Slide 12 from an operating performance perspective. We're expecting 15% to 17% incremental margins on our core business sales growth, which is slightly down from our previous guide of 16% to 18%. This is nothing to get excited about, just a few minor adjustments after taking a closer look at the remaining part of the year. On an incremental margin -- incremental margins will be lower in the second half than the 19% we delivered in the first half primarily due to a tough comparison in the third quarter last year. In the third quarter 2015, we implemented sharp cost controls in response to the macro uncertainty we saw last year. That spending has returned to normal, making the year-over-year third quarter comparison challenging. On a comparable basis, we still expect our operating income margin to be greater than 13%, and including Remy, our operating income margin is still expected to be greater than 12%. 
On Slide 13, we have our EPS guidance. We now expect earnings of $3.16 to $3.32 per share. This includes $0.12 per share contribution from Remy, up from the $3.11 to $3.32 previously. The primary driver of the change is the lower share count, which raised EPS by about $0.04 across the range. Raising the low end of our sales guidance range added another $0.01 per share to the low end. And at the high end of the range, the lower incremental margin and other minor adjustments offset the lower share count. 
Now let's review our third quarter guidance issued this morning, starting with the sales growth on Slide 14. All in, we expect to grow between 13% and 21% in the third quarter, excluding 13 percentage points due to Remy. Excluding Remy, our growth in the quarter is expected to be between 0.3% and 7.6%, but this includes the negative impact of currency. Currency is expected to lower sales by 220 basis points at the low end and 10 basis points at the high end. On a comparable basis, we expect to grow between 2.5% and 7.5% in the quarter. Our growth is improving in the second half primarily due to major truck launches with GM and Ford. 
From an earnings perspective, as shown on Slide 15, we expect earnings of $0.74 to $0.81 per share in the third quarter, which includes about $0.03 per share from Remy. Excluding Remy, we expect earnings to be $0.71 to $0.78 per share. 
So in conclusion, we had a very good second quarter. This is the third quarter in a row of exceeding our EPS and sales goals. And as we look forward at the rest of the year, we expect to continue on this path: solid sales growth, strong operating margins and improved cash flow from a year ago. I absolutely remain confident that we will deliver our 2016 guidance. 
And with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Ken."

You got this 29% incremental margin, which is about $10 million. Probably a little bit less than half of that is because of the tailwinds that we're having for the full year from the restructuring activities, so maybe -- we’ll call it $4 million, for example. So that's the benefit we're getting from the restructuring. If you take a look at the full year guidance, you can see $15 million roughly. I think we're $7 million year-to-date of restructuring tailwinds. So we had about $2 million, I think it was, in the first or something, so remaining's in the second quarter. That's going to continue through the rest of the year. We'll get that other $7 million, say, I'm running numbers here, the rest of the year. Now the third quarter might be a little bit tougher, but the fourth quarter, we'll get that through the year. I think we're on track in that range that we have for tailwinds. So that's Drivetrain, okay? Book’s the best. We're on track. Now the other issue that we're dealing with is the year-over-year. I mentioned in my script that we took some cost controls, primarily in SG&A, last year when we saw some difficulties in the macro environment we've been facing.

So we're talking about a 400-ish number in the second half. I said earlier that sequentially, we're a little lower, so you're south the $400 million in the second half of the year. So let's just play that out, and maybe that moves down a little bit based on some inventory true-up. What are you, $20 million, $30 million, $40 million type of a number? So it's important for us.

But in terms of why Engine was a little lower than some of our historical quarters, you're right, commercial vehicle was clearly a factor. That only applies to our Engine segment. There's no commercial vehicle revenue in Drivetrain. So that was the key weight for us. I would say the other area that weighed a little bit on us was China with some of our larger customers in China, so I'm talking about Volkswagen, I'm talking about Great Wall, I'm talking about Ford and GM, had pretty low-growth quarters. If you aggregate those 4, actually, it was no growth. So that weighed more on Engine than Drivetrain as well. And those are 2 of the bigger things. It doesn't really concern us, as I said, because we do have bounces from quarter to quarter. So I think it's explainable, and it's kind of, frankly speaking, what we'd anticipated in our guide."

So let me talk a little bit about sources of growth for Remy. I think that was kind of your first key question. I would encourage you and the investors to think of 2 channels of growth for Remy. First c",616,"Okay, Brett, that's -- I'm happy to talk about that. So let me talk a little bit about sources of growth for Remy. I think that was kind of your first key question. I would encourage you and the investors to think of 2 channels of growth for Remy. First channel of growth is primarily through their existing off-the-shelf technology for vehicles and applications that are in service today. What I mean by that is selling more belt-alternator starters and motors and generators to -- than they sell today. And what I mean by channels is on light vehicle, today, they ship to Hyundai [ph] and General Motors, and that's it. And we see leverage in the BorgWarner channels and BorgWarner relationships, that there's no reason on the planet why we can't be selling starters and alternators and belt-alternator starter systems to other customers beyond the current, if that's okay. And regionally, they have almost no presence in Europe, and clearly, Borg has a big presence, so there's a regional play where we can accelerate our European relationships to grow, what I would describe, Brett, as their core existing product line business. So that's a source of growth for us that we will leverage. And you would anticipate that can be done in a shorter horizon only because there's quoting activity today, and we have product to put on those vehicles. So that's the first source of growth. The second source of growth is, where you were alluding to, is to help take us further into electrification, and there's a number of potential opportunities there. First of all, they have the motor technology that you could use either in a hybrid vehicle or a pure electric vehicle, and that's a traction motor of sorts that we can use. The second path for them is to combine the rotating electrics of the motor, coupled -- together with our clutching technology to offer hybrid vehicle solutions, where we need to bring together the motor and the clutching technology, so we can offer engagement or disengagement between the motor and the combustion engine. We have product on the shelf to do that today, and we're quoting that activity. The third leg of opportunistic growth is the more advanced starter -- belt-alternator starter systems that will emerge as a need for stop-start technology and hybrid technology. And Remy has a number of products in that space that we'll be pushing forward onto hybrid applications. The last area, I would say, just in general, they bring motor technology that helps us on other product applications. So if you think of -- I talked about earlier about an eBooster technology, which is a turbocharger with a boosting compressor device, requires power electronics and motor know-how. Remy can bring that knowledge to us. All of that separate, so where does that all translate to into dollars of growth? We're working our way through that, but there's certainly absolutely no reason why Remy wouldn't grow at least at BorgWarner levels. You got to give us a little bit of time to lay that out for you in terms of cadence and pull all of that together, and we'll get through that over the next few months. So what we're going to do, Brett, is we'll use the September date to showcase the technology for you and some of the -- and what we're doing on it. And then we'll pull all of that together in the January net new business to lay out for you what the next 3 years of growth looks like for Remy, both from conventional products and the combination products with BorgWarner products. Hopefully, that helps you a little bit."

As Ken said, Ron and I are really pleased to share our results from the second quarter with you and also talk about what the rest of the year looks like. What I'd like to do is just start and make a few high-level comments on some of the bigger-picture perspective as we look out into the macro industry -- or the macro environment in our industry, and you can see a couple of points here on Slide 2, for those following along. 
I think the theme I would talk the most to in terms of the macro view is the notion of uncertainty out there in the world, and whether that's some of the civil unrest issues that we see, particularly in Europe. We see tense political environment recently in Turkey and Middle East, pending U.S. elections and, of course, fairly recently, the Brexit vote. All of that creates, I think we all realize, a sense of uncertainty at a macro view. But interestingly, when I look at the world of autos, we've generally seen a pretty stable, steady-as-you-go type environment and things playing out pretty much as we'd expect it. And as we look forward, I see that macro uncertainty will continue, but I do see the auto side remaining fairly stable. 
And as I articulate that a little further and talk to you about the market outlook, first of all, from a light vehicle perspective, I would say from a BorgWarner viewpoint, we're pretty well aligned with IHS. We see the China market growing that mid-single-digit 5% to 6% type range. We see Europe in a 2% to 3% growth environment range, and we see the U.S. in that 2% to 3% range of growth for light vehicle production. We do see and we acknowledge that the U.S. plateau effect is certainly on the horizon, and we're very mindful of that. 
From a commercial vehicle point of view, we still see that space challenged, for sure, and as you look around globally, there's really not a lot of growth at all. We do see some pretty continued strong weakness around off-road. So that translates into a lot of new programs under further review and consideration. 
So as I look at that, I would like to share with you one of the leading indicators or the areas of watch for us as a company at BorgWarner and the ones that can be most relevant to us. So I would characterize the North American market, how is the plateau going to play out, how is the inventory production levels going to play out, and we pay good attention to that. And I'll talk about how these relate to our guidance shortly. VW remains a critical customer and a very important customer for us, and we have to monitor the share for VW around the world. And like everybody, we're going to pay attention to the potential impacts of volumes in Europe in light of Brexit, and we'll obviously monitor the commercial vehicle weakness. 
Now all of that said, I would say so far, things are absolutely planned out for our guidance. And as you'll see in the guidance going forward, we still feel good about our guidance, and we're building these in and going forward with good guidance. So yes, we'll watch it, but we're also performing as expected, and we expect to perform strongly going forward. 
Let me comment a little on the regulatory or the technology aspects of the business. First thing I would say to you is the pull and the drive for fuel economy and emissions regulations, absolutely unchanged, and the pull for powertrain technology remains as strong as it did last quarter, the quarter before that and the quarter before that. So we have not seen any slowdown in customer engagement and programs that are driving and pulling advanced technology as we go forward. We do see the strong shift to increased powertrain electrification continues. And we know that because we're right in the middle of it, and we're talking to customers literally every day around the world and working with them on solutions for them in that additional electrification content. That applies across the board. That's 48-volt architectures. It's other hybrids, and it's electric vehicles. And we have content and discussion there, not just for the long term but products in the short run as well. 
I would say also relative to electrification, our quoting activity remains very strong, multiple customers, multiple products. And we'll be making further announcements on specific programs in the coming weeks and months. But I would just say this: I feel very pleased and very happy where we're at in terms of the level of engagement around new technology aligned with electrification. And as Ken alluded to in his opening comments, we plan to showcase a lot of those products, a lot of those technologies at our upcoming Investor Day on September 7. 
So let me kind of give you some high-level view here on the BorgWarner summary, and let me start off with Q2. And needless to say, Ron's going to provide a lot more detail and commentary in his comments. But I would just say this: We had a really good quarter. I was very pleased with our second quarter. The growth came in at the high end of our guidance, and we delivered strong operating performance. Breaking that down a little further, it was $2.3 billion in sales, which is up 3.5% when we exclude FX and Remy. Regionally, it came in about as we had expected, which was characterized by stronger growth in North America and a particularly strong quarter in Korea, which was balanced with the lower growth, as we had expected, in Europe in China. EPS came in at $0.84 a share when we exclude noncomparables, and that does include Remy. Operating margin, 12.4%; when we exclude Remy, 13.2%. The word I would use is impressive. 
Breaking that down by segment. Engine sales, $1.4 billion, so we grew at about 2.2% on a reported basis or 2.8% when we exclude currency. Primary drivers of the Engine growth were turbo and variable cam timing. Switching to Drivetrain. Sales of $895 million. That's up almost 43%, but when we exclude currency and Remy, still a good quarter of 5.4% growth. Largest part of the growth came from strong all-wheel drive sales in both North America and also in Europe. 
So let me shift gears and talk a little bit about the outlook for 2016. And again, Ron will provide more color on this. Basically, we've narrowed our guidance range to the high end of our previous range, which we think is very good news. We also have highlighted through the last couple of quarters 4 major launches this year that we've talked about that are very critical to our success in the second half of the year. And just to remind you folks, it was the Pentastar in June, Ford Scorpion, Ford Super Duty and the GM Duramax. All of these programs have launched, except for Duramax, which were launched in September. And I would say to you that the launches have been probably slower than the original assumptions, but here's the good news. This is exactly what we'd anticipated and planned for in our guidance back in January. That's why we did it. And as a result of that, our launch activity remains on track. 
So the outlook on the second half of the year, if I talk about that, I would characterize it to you that I think our risks and our opportunities are pretty well balanced. I alluded earlier in my comments, there are some risks and some watch points out there, but I also see some positive aspects, too. And in general, I think we're balanced, and with that, that's why we feel confident in our full year guidance of mid-single-digit growth and continued strong operating performance. 
Let me make a few comments around growth in general and give you a little bit of an update on the Remy acquisition and integration. First of all, from an integration perspective, it's going well. And I think it's fair to characterize it that both financially and operationally, it's performing very much as we had expected. We remain very positive about the technology that came with the acquisition. And we've had many, many discussions with our customers, particularly around the combination products, where we're going to leverage the rotating electrical capability of Remy with our clutching capability. So that's very much on track. And you'll see that hardware, for those of you lucky enough to be with us on September 7. 
In general, our quoting and our booking activity remains strong and very good about the win rates on our booking business, and all of that leads to in-line expectations are on track for growth. 
So let me kind of wrap up before I turn it over to Ron. We had a good first half to the year, and we feel very good about we delivered what we said we would. I think the business is operating well. We continue to be heavily focused on driving growth through the adoption of our technology, and we remain upbeat and positive about delivering our full year guidance. 
So with that, let me turn the call over to Ron."

Before I review the financial details, I would like to provide you some of the highlights, as I see them, for the quarter. In summary, we saw solid growth, great operating performance and a return to normal CapEx",1775,"Thank you, James, and good day, everyone. Before I review the financial details, I would like to provide you some of the highlights, as I see them, for the quarter. In summary, we saw solid growth, great operating performance and a return to normal CapEx spending and free cash flow generation. Now as Ken mentioned, I will be referring to the supplemental financial slide deck that is posted on our website, so I do encourage you to follow along. 
But first, I'd like to focus your attention on Slide 2 -- I'm sorry, Slide 3. Throughout the presentation, I will highlight certain non-U.S. GAAP measures to provide a clear picture of how the core business performed and for comparisons with prior periods. Specifically, we will be excluding the impact of FX, Remy and noncomparable items from certain U.S. GAAP measures. So when you hear me say on a comparable basis, that means excluding the impact of FX, Remy and noncomparable items. When you hear me say on a reported basis, that means U.S. GAAP. Now with that out of the way, let's move forward. 
Let's turn to Slide 4. On a reported basis, which includes the change in sales due to market growth, price, net new business, FX and Remy acquisition, sales were up 14.6%. On a comparable basis, our sales were up 3.5%, just above the midpoint of our guidance. On a reported basis, gross profit as a percentage of sales was 21.3% in the quarter. On a comparable basis, gross margin was 21.4%, up 30 basis points from last year. On a reported basis, SG&A was 8.7% of sales. On a comparable basis, SG&A was 8.2% of sales or basically flat from the same period a year ago. R&D spending, which is included in SG&A, was 3.6% of sales. However, this did include the impact of Remy, so on a comparable basis, R&D spending as a percentage of sales was flat year-over-year. 
Now let's look at the year-over-year comparison for operating income, which can be found on Slide 5. Starting on the right, second quarter 2016 operating income, excluding noncomparable items but including Remy, was $288 million or 12.4% of sales. If you also exclude Remy's $13 million net contribution, operating income on a comparable basis was $275 million or 13.2% of sales, up 30 basis points from a year ago, and yes, James, that is impressive. On a comparable basis, operating income was up $16 million on $71 million of higher sales. That gives us an incremental margin of 23% in the quarter, outstanding performance. As you look further down the income statement, equity and affiliate earnings was about $10 million in the quarter, down slightly from a year ago. Interest expense and finance charges were $21 million in the quarter, up from $18 million a year ago. The increase is primarily due to the EUR 500 million fixed-rate senior notes issued in the third quarter of 2015. Provision for income taxes in the quarter on a reported basis was $84 million. However, this included $2 million net tax benefit related to our noncomparable items and a favorable tax adjustment. You can read about each of these adjustments in our 10-Q, which will be filed later today. Excluding these items, the provision for income taxes was $86 million for an effective tax rate of 31%, which is in line with our full year guidance. Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest was about $11 million, up $2 million from the second quarter of 2015. This line item reflects our minority partner's share in the earnings performance of our Korean and Chinese consolidated joint ventures. 
Now let's take a look at our diluted earnings per share on Slide 6. Net earnings, excluding noncomparable items but including Remy, were $0.84 per diluted share. On a comparable basis, net earnings were $0.80 per diluted share. 
Now let's take a closer look at the operating segments in the quarter, beginning on Slide 7 of the deck. Reported Engine segment net sales were just over $1.4 billion in the quarter. Sales growth for the Engine segment on a comparable basis was 2.8% primarily due to higher turbocharger and variable cam timing sales, partially offset by weak commercial vehicle markets around the world. 
Turning to Slide 8. Reported adjusted EBIT was $235 million for the Engine segment or 16.3% of sales. On a comparable basis, the Engine segment adjusted EBIT was up $8 million on $39 million of higher sales for an incremental margin of 20%. Again, solid performance for the Engine segment. 
Turning to Slide 9 and starting from the right. Drivetrain segment net sales were $895 million in the quarter. This included $240 million of sales from Remy. Sales growth for the Drivetrain segment on a comparable basis was 5.4% primarily due to higher all-wheel drive sales. 
On Slide 10, reported adjusted EBIT was $93 million for the Drivetrain segment or 10.4% of sales. Excluding Remy, adjusted EBIT was 12.2% of sales, up 70 basis points from the prior year. On a comparable basis, the Drivetrain segment's adjusted EBIT was up $10 million on $34 million of higher sales for an incremental margin of 29%. Very good performance for the Drivetrain segment. 
Now let's take a look at our balance sheet and cash flow. We generated $362 million of net cash from operating activities in the first half of the year, which is up $43 million from a year ago. Capital spending was $235 million in the first half, which is down $50 million from a year ago. Capital spending was above our trend in 2015, but we have returned to normal spending levels. As a percentage of sales, CapEx was 5.1% in the first half, at the low end of our historical range of 5% to 6% of sales. Free cash flow, which was defined -- which we define as net cash from operating activity less capital spending, was $127 million in the first half, up $93 million from a year ago. We are still on track to generate between $400 million and $475 million of free cash flow in 2016, and at the midpoint, that's up 50% from 2015. Looking at the balance sheet itself, balance sheet debt increased by $85 million, and cash decreased by $83 million. In the first half compared with the end of 2015, we purchased -- our debt increased $168 million, which is primarily due to share repurchases. We spent $100 million repurchasing 5.4 million shares in the first half and have scheduled for executing an expected $200 million to $300 million of share repurchases this year. Our net debt to net capital ratio was 36.3% at the end of the second quarter, up from 35.2% at the end of 2015. Net debt-to-EBITDA at the end of the year on a trailing 12-month basis was 1.5%. 
Now I'd like to discuss our current 2016 guidance, which has improved from our previous guide, as James mentioned. So returning to the deck, let's start with our sales growth guidance for the full year on Slide 11. Note that the baseline 2015 net sales excludes Remy. We have raised the low end of our guidance range by 100 basis points. All in, we expect to grow between 13.7% and 17.5% this year, up from 12.7% to 17.5% previously. Half of the improved outlook is due to greater comfort with volume and launch timing assumptions in our net new business. The other half is because we expect the impact of currency to be less negative compared with our previous guide. Market-related growth and new business growth, net of pricing, is now expected to be between 3% and 5.5%. 
Now let's look at our operating income guidance on Slide 12 from an operating performance perspective. We're expecting 15% to 17% incremental margins on our core business sales growth, which is slightly down from our previous guide of 16% to 18%. This is nothing to get excited about, just a few minor adjustments after taking a closer look at the remaining part of the year. On an incremental margin -- incremental margins will be lower in the second half than the 19% we delivered in the first half primarily due to a tough comparison in the third quarter last year. In the third quarter 2015, we implemented sharp cost controls in response to the macro uncertainty we saw last year. That spending has returned to normal, making the year-over-year third quarter comparison challenging. On a comparable basis, we still expect our operating income margin to be greater than 13%, and including Remy, our operating income margin is still expected to be greater than 12%. 
On Slide 13, we have our EPS guidance. We now expect earnings of $3.16 to $3.32 per share. This includes $0.12 per share contribution from Remy, up from the $3.11 to $3.32 previously. The primary driver of the change is the lower share count, which raised EPS by about $0.04 across the range. Raising the low end of our sales guidance range added another $0.01 per share to the low end. And at the high end of the range, the lower incremental margin and other minor adjustments offset the lower share count. 
Now let's review our third quarter guidance issued this morning, starting with the sales growth on Slide 14. All in, we expect to grow between 13% and 21% in the third quarter, excluding 13 percentage points due to Remy. Excluding Remy, our growth in the quarter is expected to be between 0.3% and 7.6%, but this includes the negative impact of currency. Currency is expected to lower sales by 220 basis points at the low end and 10 basis points at the high end. On a comparable basis, we expect to grow between 2.5% and 7.5% in the quarter. Our growth is improving in the second half primarily due to major truck launches with GM and Ford. 
From an earnings perspective, as shown on Slide 15, we expect earnings of $0.74 to $0.81 per share in the third quarter, which includes about $0.03 per share from Remy. Excluding Remy, we expect earnings to be $0.71 to $0.78 per share. 
So in conclusion, we had a very good second quarter. This is the third quarter in a row of exceeding our EPS and sales goals. And as we look forward at the rest of the year, we expect to continue on this path: solid sales growth, strong operating margins and improved cash flow from a year ago. I absolutely remain confident that we will deliver our 2016 guidance. 
And with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Ken."

But fundamentally, I mean, the standards are not changing of any note in our view. And I would say the pull for the types of technologies that we have to deliver on those standards is as strong as it was 6 months, 12 months or 18 months ago. So we're not seeing any pullback at all in terms of desire and drive for the types of technologies that we have. And I think our best guess as we engage with EPA and others is there could be some nuance in and some modest, minor tweaks to the standards, but we've not seen anything material enough to change the direction of the OEMs and what we're doing with them."

I think everybody needs to kind of digest that. So we are watching it, and I think it's a little early from a -- how does it impact Europe in general. I would tell you we've not seen any impact thus far in schedules and releases and those types of things. So I think it's going to be more of a '17 type event than a '16 event for Europe. And the U.K. will trim itself up, but again, that's -- about 1% of our revenue is in the U.K. So we feel pretty good where we're at right now."

You got this 29% incremental margin, which is about $10 million. Probably a little bit less than half of that is because of the tailwinds that we're having for the full year from the restructuring activities, so maybe -- we’ll call it $4 million, for example. So that's the benefit we're getting from the restructuring. If you take a look at the full year guidance, you can see $15 million roughly. I think we're $7 million year-to-date of restructuring tailwinds. So we had about $2 million, I think it was, in the first or something, so remaining's in the second quarter. That's going to continue through the rest of the year. We'll get that other $7 million, say, I'm running numbers here, the rest of the year. Now the third quarter might be a little bit tougher, but the fourth quarter, we'll get that through the year. I think we're on track in that range that we have for tailwinds. So that's Drivetrain, okay? Book’s the best. We're on track. Now the other issue that we're dealing with is the year-over-year. I mentioned in my script that we took some cost controls, primarily in SG&A, last year when we saw some difficulties in the macro environment we've been facing. So some of this SG&A spending is going to come back in the second half of the year. Specifically, probably in the corporate spending rates, we'll uptick about a few million bucks here and there in the next 2 quarters.

So we're talking about a 400-ish number in the second half. I said earlier that sequentially, we're a little lower, so you're south the $400 million in the second half of the year.

First c",616,"Okay, Brett, that's -- I'm happy to talk about that. So let me talk a little bit about sources of growth for Remy. I think that was kind of your first key question. I would encourage you and the investors to think of 2 channels of growth for Remy. First channel of growth is primarily through their existing off-the-shelf technology for vehicles and applications that are in service today. What I mean by that is selling more belt-alternator starters and motors and generators to -- than they sell today. And what I mean by channels is on light vehicle, today, they ship to Hyundai [ph] and General Motors, and that's it. And we see leverage in the BorgWarner channels and BorgWarner relationships, that there's no reason on the planet why we can't be selling starters and alternators and belt-alternator starter systems to other customers beyond the current, if that's okay. And regionally, they have almost no presence in Europe, and clearly, Borg has a big presence, so there's a regional play where we can accelerate our European relationships to grow, what I would describe, Brett, as their core existing product line business. So that's a source of growth for us that we will leverage. And you would anticipate that can be done in a shorter horizon only because there's quoting activity today, and we have product to put on those vehicles. So that's the first source of growth. The second source of growth is, where you were alluding to, is to help take us further into electrification, and there's a number of potential opportunities there. First of all, they have the motor technology that you could use either in a hybrid vehicle or a pure electric vehicle, and that's a traction motor of sorts that we can use. The second path for them is to combine the rotating electrics of the motor, coupled -- together with our clutching technology to offer hybrid vehicle solutions, where we need to bring together the motor and the clutching technology, so we can offer engagement or disengagement between the motor and the combustion engine. We have product on the shelf to do that today, and we're quoting that activity. The third leg of opportunistic growth is the more advanced starter -- belt-alternator starter systems that will emerge as a need for stop-start technology and hybrid technology. And Remy has a number of products in that space that we'll be pushing forward onto hybrid applications. The last area, I would say, just in general, they bring motor technology that helps us on other product applications. So if you think of -- I talked about earlier about an eBooster technology, which is a turbocharger with a boosting compressor device, requires power electronics and motor know-how. Remy can bring that knowledge to us. All of that separate, so where does that all translate to into dollars of growth? We're working our way through that, but there's certainly absolutely no reason why Remy wouldn't grow at least at BorgWarner levels. You got to give us a little bit of time to lay that out for you in terms of cadence and pull all of that together, and we'll get through that over the next few months. So what we're going to do, Brett, is we'll use the September date to showcase the technology for you and some of the -- and what we're doing on it. And then we'll pull all of that together in the January net new business to lay out for you what the next 3 years of growth looks like for Remy, both from conventional products and the combination products with BorgWarner products. Hopefully, that helps you a little bit."

Ron and I are really pleased today to share our third quarter 2016 results with you as well as give you some thoughts and outlook for the rest of the year. I'd like to start actually by sharing a few thoughts on the macro environment to the industry in general. And you can see that on Slide 2, if you're following along. So just a few thoughts on the macro state of the world. I think the word that we think about is still, there's a level of uncertainty in the macro world. There's -- I think the slowing economic growth around the world is still on everybody's mind, and that's presenting some challenges. The world is still not without a lot of tenseness around some of the political climate. You think of the Middle East, you think of U.S. election and those types of things. So there's still an environment of uncertainty. But with that said, what we've seen in the auto space, there's things have been moving along pretty well as anticipated and as expected, particularly in the third quarter.
If I turn a little more specifically to the outlook around the auto space, let me start with some comments around light vehicle 2016 calendar year. Generally, our view on the marketplace is well aligned with IHS, which is calling for approximately a 7% growth in China on light vehicle. We see about 2% growth in Europe, and the U.S. is somewhere in the 2% to 3% growth. And we, like IHS, and I think many on this call, we certainly acknowledge that the U.S. cycle is maturing and in a slower-growth mode. 
If I reflect where we are on commercial vehicle, I think I would characterize the global commercial vehicle space as still challenged. We see North America and South America still down and challenged for sure. We do see a little bit of improvement this year running through Western Europe and China also. So whilst it's a mixed bag globally, overall, this space is still challenged.
I always like to start these calls and talk a little bit about areas of watch that we think are particularly relevant to BorgWarner. And I would point for us to 3 in particular: The North American mature cycle I referenced earlier and how that's going to play out with inventory. Recently, we saw Ford aligning its inventory to match sales and with their production schedule reductions. I think from a BorgWarner perspective, we felt that was well contained within our guidance. But we're going to pay close attention of will there be further adjustments as we go through the fourth quarter. 
The second area of watch that we pay a little bit of attention to for sure is diesel penetration in Western Europe or in Europe in general. And as through this year, if we look at how '16 is playing out versus '15, we see about a 2 percentage point drop in diesel penetration in Europe. We talked about this for a long time. We've been watching this trend of a declining diesel, and I think we're very well prepared as BorgWarner as we've been aligned in our products closely around gasoline and hybrid technology.
The third area that we're paying close attention to is China. We're enjoying some strong growth in the third quarter. And we're going to look to see what happens with the incentives as that phases out towards the end of this year, and how that plays into next year.
All of that said, I would say 2 things: So far, have been going very much as planned per our guidance, and naturally, we're excited to discuss our performance. So let me talk a little bit about one other aspect before I get into our detailed numbers, and that's in the regulatory and technology trend area.
We still see a very strong drive around fuel economy and emissions regulations, and the pull for advanced propulsion technology is not changing. There is a very robust intensity around the pull for advanced propulsion technology.
I would say with -- in the last quarter, we've seen a notable acceleration in discussions on gas and hybrid and EV technology, and that is playing itself out. And as that transition to electrification continues, we remain very active here. Multiple customers working with us on electrification solutions,  whether that be 48-volt architecture, hybrid architecture and EVs. And not just long term, this is also for products in the here and now.
At our recent Investor Day, we highlighted that we had approximately 19 new customer awards in the hybrid and electric vehicle space, and I can assure you, that number continues to grow. Our quoting activity remains robust with multiple customers and multiple products. As normal, we will publicly announce additional new business awards in this category when you receive additional customer approvals. But I will say again, I'm very pleased with our bookings. Our win rates remains strong and the diversification of our bookings is also exciting for us. Both regionally, it's well-balanced, customers is well-balanced and we're pleased of the booking rates across the combustion, hybrid and electric space. And last but certainly not least, we're also pleased with the profitability that we're booking that new business at.
So let me give a little bit of color on the financials and obviously, Ron will step through this in a lot more detail. So I start with the third quarter at the BorgWarner level, and the conclusion for me is I'm very pleased with our third quarter.
We delivered growth towards the high end of our guidance range and solid operating performance. With sales at $2.2 billion, that's up 6% when we exclude FX and Remy. And I think that's pretty impressive when you look at the global light vehicle production, it essentially was flat around the world with the exception of China. That was a strong growth market.
Regionally, it played out pretty much as expected from a BorgWarner point of view which resulted in strong growth in China and North America and Korea, partially offset by Europe aftermarket in CV. We delivered $0.78 EPS, excluding noncomparable items. And our operating margin at 12%, when we exclude Remy, that's 12.9%, strong operating performance for us. 
If we break that down by segments, the Engine business was at $1.36 billion, which grew just under 4%. Primary drivers for there were turbo and variable cam timing. And from a Drivetrain perspective, we were $866 million reported. That's up 48%. But when we exclude currency and Remy, we grew at an impressive 11.4% in the Drivetrain segment. That was primarily driven by strong all-wheel drive sales in both North America and in Europe.
Now turning to our outlook for the rest of 2016. You see we did narrow our guidance around the center of the previous range, and Ron will give you more details there. I would also say as we've gone through this year, we've talked to you about some major launches that BorgWarner has been actively involved with. That's the Pentastar with FCA, Ford Scorpion, Ford Super Duty and the GM Duramax. All have launched and in our view, all are on track. 
So the outlook for our Q4, as we step into Q4, I would articulate that our risks and our opportunities are pretty well-balanced. We see good, strong growth in China and a slowing North America, but we think our risks and opportunities are balanced. And the punchline is we feel confident in our guidance of 3% to 5% organic growth for the quarter and continued strong operating performance.
Just a couple of comments around growth highlights. And I'll start with Remy. Ron will talked a lot more about the detailed financial aspects of the light-duty aftermarket transaction that we recently announced. I think this is a really good deal from a BorgWarner perspective. The primary thing for me strategically is this really allows the team to focus on what I would describe as the core Remy business and combining that rotating electrical expertise with the BorgWarner product offering. So this is a good transaction that we're going forward with. 
I would characterize the integration going well. I think operationally and financially, it's performing as expected, albeit with sales coming in a little lighter primarily driven by CV and aftermarket.
We remain very positive about the strength of the technology. Multiple customers are engaged with us in discussions about the combination products particularly again around the motors and clutches for hybrid vehicles that we talked extensively about at Investor Day.
Also a comment about M&A. The M&A pipeline remains very strong for us, very actively considering things. And as I mentioned at Investor Day and on prior calls, power electronics is the big priority for us as a company.
So let me kind of summarize. I think, so far, I would characterize it as being a very good year for us so far. We've delivered what we said we would do. And with my accounting, this is 4 very strong quarters for us consecutively where we meet or beat both the top line and the bottom line. The business is operating very well, and we're heavily focused on executing the short-term performance but also securing the growth for us in the future.
Key for me is we -- I absolutely believe we have a winning strategy that's going to focus on delivering advanced propulsion technology for combustion, hybrid and electric vehicles that will deliver the mid- to high single-digit growth that we've committed to. And finally, I remain upbeat and very positive about delivering our 2016 guidance. 
So with that, let me turn the call over to Ron. Thank you."

First, we saw good growth. Second, we delivered solid operating performance. And third, we continue to see improvement in CapEx spending and free cash flow generation.
So now as Ken mentioned, I will be referring to the supplemental financial slide deck that is posted on our IR website. Please follow along.
First, I'd like to focus your attention on Slide 3. Throughout the presentation, I will highlight certain non-U.S. GAAP measures to provide a clear picture of how the core business performed and for comparisons with prior periods. Specifically, we will be excluding the impact of foreign currency, Remy and noncomparable items from certain U.S. GAAP measures. When you hear me say on a comparable basis, that means excluding the impact of foreign currencies, Remy and noncomparable items. When you hear me say on a reported basis, that means U.S. GAAP.
So let's turn to Slide 4. On a reported basis, which includes the change in sales due to market growth, price, net new business and currency and the Remy acquisition, sales were up 17.5%. On a comparable basis, our sales were up 6.1% toward the high end of our guidance range. On a reported basis, gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 21.3% in the quarter. But on a comparable basis, gross margin was 21.9% of sales, up 70 basis points from last year. On a reported basis, SG&A was 9.5% of sales. R&D spending, which is included in SG&A, was 4% of sales. On a comparable basis, SG&A was 9.1% of sales, which is up 120 basis points from a year ago. 
There's 3 reasons for this increase. First, R&D spending, on a comparable basis, was up 40 basis points from a year ago as we continue to invest in the future. I would like to point out, that's still 4% of sales. Second, as we discussed in our second quarter earnings call, we implemented sharp cost controls in the third quarter of 2015 in response to macro uncertainty, making the year-over-year comparison challenging. So about 40 basis points of this increase was due to that rough comparison. The remaining 40 points is that increase is due to higher administrative costs in the company.
Now let's take a look at the year-over-year comparison from operating income, which can be found on Slide 5. Starting in the right, third quarter 2016 operating income, excluding noncomparable items but including Remy, was $265 million or 12% of sales. If you also exclude Remy's $7 million of net contribution, operating income on a comparable basis was $259 million or 12.9% of sales, down 40 basis points from a year ago.
On a comparable basis, operating income was up $8 million on $115 million of higher sales. That gives us an incremental margin of 7% in the quarter. This performance is below trend but was expected due to the higher SG&A spending.
From operations perspective, or if you look at the segment levels, not only look, saying it, incremental margins were up actually 14% in the quarter. As you look further down the income statement, equity and affiliate earnings was about $12 million in the quarter, up from $9 million last year. Interest expense and finance charges were $22 million in the quarter, up from $15 million a year ago. The increase is primarily due to the $500 million euro fixed-rate senior notes we issued in the third quarter of 2015. 
Provisions for income taxes in the quarter on a reported basis was $49 million. However, this included a $31 million tax benefit related to our noncomparable item and other favorable tax adjustments. You can read about each of these adjustments in our 10-Q, which will be filed later today. Excluding these items, the provision for income taxes was $80 million for an effective tax rate of 31%, which is in line with our full year guidance. Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest were about $10 million, up $1 million from the third quarter of '15. This line represents our minority partner's share in the earnings and performance of our Korean and Chinese joint ventures.
So take let's take a look at our diluted earnings per share on Slide 6. Net earnings, excluding noncomparable items, but including Remy, were $0.78 per share. On a comparable basis, net earnings were $0.76 per diluted share.
Now let's take a closer look at our operating segments in the quarter, beginning on Slide 7 of the deck. Reported Engine segment net sales were $1.36 billion in the quarter. Sales growth for the Engine segment on a comparable basis was 3.8%, primarily due to higher turbocharger and variable cam timing sales, partially offset by weak aftermarket and off-road commercial vehicle markets around the world.
Turning to Slide 8. Reported EBIT was $218 million for the Engine segment or 16.1% of sales. Excluding currency, adjusted EBIT for -- was 16% of sales, down 20 basis points from the prior year. On a comparable basis, the Engine segment's adjusted EBIT was up $6 million on $15 million of higher sales for an incremental margin of 12%.
Now turning to Slide 9 and starting from the right. Drivetrain segment net sales were $866 million in the quarter. This includes $215 million of sales from Remy. Sales growth for the Drivetrain segment on a comparable basis was 11.4%, primarily due to higher all-wheel drive sales. Strong growth for the Drivetrain segment.
On Slide 10, reported EBIT was $87 million for the Drivetrain segment or 10% of sales. Excluding Remy and currency, adjusted EBIT was 12.4% of sales, which is up 40 basis points from the prior year. On a comparable basis, the Drivetrain segment's adjusted EBIT was up $10 million on $67 million of sales for an incremental margin of 15%.
Now let's take a look at the balance sheet and cash flow. We generated $593 million of net cash from operating activities in the first 9 months of the year, and that's up $123 million from a year ago. Capital spending was $355 million for the first half, which is down $64 million from a year ago. As a percentage of sales, CapEx was 5.2% of sales in the first 9 months. Free cash flow, which we define as net cash from operating activities less capital spending, was $238 million in the first 9 months, up $187 million from a year ago. We are still on track to generate between $400 million and $475 million of free cash flow in 2016. At the midpoint, that's up 50% from 2015.
Looking at the balance sheet itself. Balance sheet debt increased by $65 million, and cash decreased by 55 -- $59 million in the first 9 months compared with the end of 2015. The $124 million increase in net debt was primarily due to share repurchases. We spent $215 million repurchasing just under 7.3 million shares in the first 9 months, already achieving our expected $200 million to $300 million of share repurchases this year.
Our net debt to net capital ratio is 35.6% at the end of the quarter, up from 35.2% at the end of 2015. Net debt-to-EBITDA at the end of the quarter on a trailing 12-month basis was 1.4x.
Now before we move on to guidance discussion, I like to review the sale of the Remy's light vehicle aftermarket business announced earlier this month. As James said, strategically, the business was not core. While aftermarket's an important segment for us, this aftermarket business sells to big-box retailers, which is a very different business model from our aftermarket business, which sells to wholesalers and distributors.
The deal is a win-win for both the buyer and BorgWarner. The buyer has a strategic focus in this market segment. They will invest in this business, and combined with its existing business, gain a scale advantage. BorgWarner will retain the rotating electric components that complement our strategic focus on hybrid and electric vehicle propulsion systems.
We sold the business for $80 million, which is a fair price. From a accounting perspective, we recorded a pretax loss of $106 million due to the reevaluation of the business reflecting current market conditions.
There are 2 additional favorable outcomes of the deal. First, it is accretive to margins. Year-to-date, Remy's margins have been just over 4%. Excluding the light vehicle market business, Remy's margins would have been 100 basis points higher. Second, due to the payment terms with the customers, that business factored the majority of its receivables, which is considered debt by the rating agencies. But the sale of that business, our debt as calculated by the rating agencies, is reduced by $75 million.
Now I'd like to discuss our current 2016 guidance. Returning to the slide deck, let's start with our sales growth guidance for the full year on Slide 11. Note that the baseline for 2015 net sales excludes Remy, which was just under $7.9 billion. We have narrowed our sales guidance range around the center of the previous range. All in, we expect to grow between 15.2% and 16% this year compared to 13.7% and 17.5% previously.
A few points on updated sales guidance. Our outlook for organic growth has improved. Market-related growth and new business growth net of pricing is now expected to be 4.3% to 4.8% compared with 3% to 5.5% previously.
And we expect the impact of currency to be less negative than it was before. However, these favorable items are offset by a weaker outlook for Remy sales, as James said earlier, primarily in the commercial vehicle and the Aftermarket business.
Net-net, the midpoint of the sales guidance range is unchanged. And I'd like to make 1 other point in here. The assumption is that the Remy Aftermarket remains at BorgWarner throughout the end of the year because of uncertainty exactly when the closing date's going to be on sale.
Now let's take a look at our operating income guidance on Slide 12. We are now expecting 13% to 14% incremental margins on our core business sales growth, which is slightly down from our previous guide of 15% to 17%. Incremental margins were about 14 % to the first 9 months of the year and we expect our fourth quarter incremental margin to be in the low- to mid-teens as well.
On a comparable basis, we still expect our operating income margin to be above 13% and including Remy, our operating income margin is still expected to be greater than 12%.
On Slide 13, we have our EPS guidance. We expect earnings of $3.24 to $3.28 per share, including a $0.12 per share contribution from Remy, up from $2.16 to $3.32 previously. An improved outlook on the impact of currency and a lower share count are driving the change.
Now let's review our fourth quarter guidance, which is simply the remainder of what's left in our annual guidance, starting with the sales growth on Slide 14. All in, we expect to grow between 14.3% and 17.8% in the quarter, including between 10 to 12 percentage points for Remy and about 1 percentage point due to favorable currency.
On a comparable basis, our organic growth is expected to be between 3% and 5% in the quarter. From an earnings perspective, as shown on Slide 15, we expect earnings of between $0.82 and $0.86 per share in the fourth quarter, which includes about $0.02 per share from Remy.
So in conclusion, we had solid quarter. As James said, this is the fourth quarter in a row we exceeded EPS and sales goals and as we look at the remainder of the year, we expect to continue to be on this path, solid sales growth, strong operating margins and improved cash flow from a year ago.
So with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Ken. Thank you."

The question is you look out will that trend continued down? I argue it will, we feel we're well prepared with the growth that we're delivering on gas turbos. In the quarter itself, the 2 big drivers for growth at engine were Turbo and variable timing, those were strong. And I would say that was on a pretty global basis, so it wasn't 1 region particularly that stood out.

I think there'll be a balance but I would tend to agree with you that the intensity and the drive towards pure electric vehicle is probably strongest in China than in any other region of the world. That's not to say it's not going to adopt in Europe and North America but there is a strong push for pure electrics in China. And we've been announcing that we're benefiting from that. The single speed transmission technology is adopted on a number of those vehicles that are out there. And we got other products going on. But directionally, I would agree, Brian, that it's the fastest area which is penetrating the most from a pure EV, but I would not say it's without any hybrids, there will be hybrids for sure in China."

What we're doing and we will continue to do is position ourself to offer product offering for all of those architectures and support the customers as needed.

So you're right, I alluded to earlier, Emmanuel, I'm not sure if you're on the call, our view of Europe, if you look at a '15 year-to-date versus a '16 year-to-date, the diesel share or diesel penetration is down about 2%. Our view is that will continue to creep down. We're not seeing a cliff-type event. So we see that trending down. I think fundamentally, what we are seeing is -- so the question really is what are those diesel vehicles being replaced with? And I'd say, the vast majority in our view of those, with turbocharged gasoline vehicles. So that obviously plays well for BorgWarner. We're not seeing a shift from diesel to naturally aspirated vehicle so much. We're seeing turbocharged gasoline and sometimes turbocharged gasoline and hybrids. So near-term, it's pretty small impact or others. Obviously, it affects a little bit some of our emissions products a little. But net-net for BorgWarner, Emmanuel, its relatively small impact as it shifts from the diesel to gas, particularly if it's at a gradual pace that we've seen thus far. And just to reinforce, I think your other point, as we get to the midterm, let's say, 3 years plus out, then it's not an issue at all for BorgWarner. So small is kind of a conclusion, Emmanuel, does that help you?"

We're in 4 good quarters now. So we feel good we're hitting our stride on executing that mid-single-digit growth organically, which is excellent. I think one of the other things I would say as we start to think about '17, '18 and '19, one of the things we articulated at Investor Day is I want people to think that we're going to operate in a band of mid-to-high single-digit growth rate. So that means there may be a year or 2 where we're at high, there maybe a year or 2 where we're at mid. It's not a linear upward curve or arrow, if that makes sense to you, Emmanuel. I don't want people to think we're going to be running 3 or 4 or 5 and then we got a 6 and we got a 7, we got an 8 and we got a 9, it's not that way. What we're saying is we are confident and comfortable in our strategy and our portfolio and our technology that we will consistently be able to deliver in the mid-to-high single-digit growth band and external factors will move us a little bit in the band, Emmanuel, of that mid-to-high single-digit band.

An example for us should be generally when we have this exact same call last quarter, there is -- that was at a time when Ford was kind of suggesting releases, reductions, et cetera, and we talked about it than that we believe we have that well contained in our guidance. I think it's fair to say we delivered on that. So that's encouraging. And I mentioned earlier in the call, John, I'm not sure if you were on the latest news from Ford, so to speak, we feel that's contained in our guidance which essentially was unchanged as we went into this quarter.

Ron and I are really pleased today to share our third quarter 2016 results with you as well as give you some thoughts and outlook for the rest of the year. I'd like to start actually by sharing a few thoughts on the macro environment to the industry in general. And you can see that on Slide 2, if you're following along. So just a few thoughts on the macro state of the world. I think the word that we think about is still, there's a level of uncertainty in the macro world. There's -- I think the slowing economic growth around the world is still on everybody's mind, and that's presenting some challenges. The world is still not without a lot of tenseness around some of the political climate. You think of the Middle East, you think of U.S. election and those types of things. So there's still an environment of uncertainty. But with that said, what we've seen in the auto space, there's things have been moving along pretty well as anticipated and as expected, particularly in the third quarter.
If I turn a little more specifically to the outlook around the auto space, let me start with some comments around light vehicle 2016 calendar year. Generally, our view on the marketplace is well aligned with IHS, which is calling for approximately a 7% growth in China on light vehicle. We see about 2% growth in Europe, and the U.S. is somewhere in the 2% to 3% growth. And we, like IHS, and I think many on this call, we certainly acknowledge that the U.S. cycle is maturing and in a slower-growth mode. 
If I reflect where we are on commercial vehicle, I think I would characterize the global commercial vehicle space as still challenged. We see North America and South America still down and challenged for sure. We do see a little bit of improvement this year running through Western Europe and China also. So whilst it's a mixed bag globally, overall, this space is still challenged.
I always like to start these calls and talk a little bit about areas of watch that we think are particularly relevant to BorgWarner. And I would point for us to 3 in particular: The North American mature cycle I referenced earlier and how that's going to play out with inventory. Recently, we saw Ford aligning its inventory to match sales and with their production schedule reductions. I think from a BorgWarner perspective, we felt that was well contained within our guidance. But we're going to pay close attention of will there be further adjustments as we go through the fourth quarter. 
The second area of watch that we pay a little bit of attention to for sure is diesel penetration in Western Europe or in Europe in general. And as through this year, if we look at how '16 is playing out versus '15, we see about a 2 percentage point drop in diesel penetration in Europe. We talked about this for a long time. We've been watching this trend of a declining diesel, and I think we're very well prepared as BorgWarner as we've been aligned in our products closely around gasoline and hybrid technology.
The third area that we're paying close attention to is China. We're enjoying some strong growth in the third quarter. And we're going to look to see what happens with the incentives as that phases out towards the end of this year, and how that plays into next year.
All of that said, I would say 2 things: So far, have been going very much as planned per our guidance, and naturally, we're excited to discuss our performance. So let me talk a little bit about one other aspect before I get into our detailed numbers, and that's in the regulatory and technology trend area.
We still see a very strong drive around fuel economy and emissions regulations, and the pull for advanced propulsion technology is not changing. There is a very robust intensity around the pull for advanced propulsion technology.
I would say with -- in the last quarter, we've seen a notable acceleration in discussions on gas and hybrid and EV technology, and that is playing itself out. And as that transition to electrification continues, we remain very active here. Multiple customers working with us on electrification solutions,  whether that be 48-volt architecture, hybrid architecture and EVs. And not just long term, this is also for products in the here and now.
At our recent Investor Day, we highlighted that we had approximately 19 new customer awards in the hybrid and electric vehicle space, and I can assure you, that number continues to grow. Our quoting activity remains robust with multiple customers and multiple products. As normal, we will publicly announce additional new business awards in this category when you receive additional customer approvals. But I will say again, I'm very pleased with our bookings. Our win rates remains strong and the diversification of our bookings is also exciting for us. Both regionally, it's well-balanced, customers is well-balanced and we're pleased of the booking rates across the combustion, hybrid and electric space. And last but certainly not least, we're also pleased with the profitability that we're booking that new business at.
So let me give a little bit of color on the financials and obviously, Ron will step through this in a lot more detail. So I start with the third quarter at the BorgWarner level, and the conclusion for me is I'm very pleased with our third quarter.
We delivered growth towards the high end of our guidance range and solid operating performance. With sales at $2.2 billion, that's up 6% when we exclude FX and Remy. And I think that's pretty impressive when you look at the global light vehicle production, it essentially was flat around the world with the exception of China. That was a strong growth market.
Regionally, it played out pretty much as expected from a BorgWarner point of view which resulted in strong growth in China and North America and Korea, partially offset by Europe aftermarket and CV. We delivered $0.78 EPS, excluding noncomparable items. And our operating margin at 12%, when we exclude Remy, that's 12.9%, strong operating performance for us. 
If we break that down by segments, the Engine business was at $1.36 billion, which grew just under 4%. Primary drivers for there were turbo and variable cam timing. And from a Drivetrain perspective, we were $866 million reported. That's up 48%. But when we exclude currency and Remy, we grew at an impressive 11.4% in the Drivetrain segment. That was primarily driven by strong all-wheel drive sales in both North America and in Europe.
Now turning to our outlook for the rest of 2016. You see we did narrow our guidance around the center of the previous range, and Ron will give you more details there. I would also say as we've gone through this year, we've talked to you about some major launches that BorgWarner has been actively involved with. That's the Pentastar with FCA, Ford Scorpion, Ford Super Duty and the GM Duramax. All have launched and in our view, all are on track. 
So the outlook for our Q4, as we step into Q4, I would articulate that our risks and our opportunities are pretty well-balanced. We see good, strong growth in China and a slowing North America, but we think our risks and opportunities are balanced. And the punchline is we feel confident in our guidance of 3% to 5% organic growth for the quarter and continued strong operating performance.
Just a couple of comments around growth highlights. And I'll start with Remy. Ron will talked a lot more about the detailed financial aspects of the light-duty aftermarket transaction that we recently announced. I think this is a really good deal from a BorgWarner perspective. The primary thing for me strategically is this really allows the team to focus on what I would describe as the core Remy business and combining that rotating electrical expertise with the BorgWarner product offering. So this is a good transaction that we're going forward with. 
I would characterize the integration going well. I think operationally and financially, it's performing as expected, albeit with sales coming in a little lighter primarily driven by CV and aftermarket.
We remain very positive about the strength of the technology. Multiple customers are engaged with us in discussions about the combination products particularly again around the motors and clutches for hybrid vehicles that we talked extensively about at Investor Day.
Also a comment about M&A. The M&A pipeline remains very strong for us, very actively considering things. And as I mentioned at Investor Day and on prior calls, power electronics is the big priority for us as a company.
So let me kind of summarize. I think, so far, I would characterize it as being a very good year for us so far. We've delivered what we said we would do. And with my accounting, this is 4 very strong quarters for us consecutively where we meet or beat both the top line and the bottom line. The business is operating very well, and we're heavily focused on executing the short-term performance but also securing the growth for us in the future.
Key for me is we -- I absolutely believe we have a winning strategy that's going to focus on delivering advanced propulsion technology for combustion, hybrid and electric vehicles that will deliver the mid- to high single-digit growth that we've committed to. And finally, I remain upbeat and very positive about delivering our 2016 guidance. 
So with that, let me turn the call over to Ron. Thank you."

Before I review the financial details, I'd like to provide you some of the highlights that I see them for the quarter. First, we saw good growth. Second, we delivered solid operating performance. And third, we con",2002,"Thank you, James, and good day, everyone. Before I review the financial details, I'd like to provide you some of the highlights that I see them for the quarter. First, we saw good growth. Second, we delivered solid operating performance. And third, we continue to see improvement in CapEx spending and free cash flow generation.
So now as Ken mentioned, I will be referring to the supplemental financial slide deck that is posted on our IR website. Please follow along.
First, I'd like to focus your attention on Slide 3. Throughout the presentation, I will highlight certain non-U.S. GAAP measures to provide a clear picture of how the core business performed and for comparisons with prior periods. Specifically, we will be excluding the impact of foreign currency, Remy and noncomparable items from certain U.S. GAAP measures. When you hear me say on a comparable basis, that means excluding the impact of foreign currencies, Remy and noncomparable items. When you hear me say on a reported basis, that means U.S. GAAP.
So let's turn to Slide 4. On a reported basis, which includes the change in sales due to market growth, price, net new business and currency and the Remy acquisition, sales were up 17.5%. On a comparable basis, our sales were up 6.1% toward the high end of our guidance range. On a reported basis, gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 21.3% in the quarter. But on a comparable basis, gross margin was 21.9% of sales, up 70 basis points from last year. On a reported basis, SG&A was 9.5% of sales. R&D spending, which is included in SG&A, was 4% of sales. On a comparable basis, SG&A was 9.1% of sales, which is up 120 basis points from a year ago. 
There's 3 reasons for this increase. First, R&D spending, on a comparable basis, was up 40 basis points from a year ago as we continue to invest in the future. I would like to point out, that's still 4% of sales. Second, as we discussed in our second quarter earnings call, we implemented sharp cost controls in the third quarter of 2015 in response to macro uncertainty, making the year-over-year comparison challenging. So about 40 basis points of this increase was due to that rough comparison. The remaining 40 points is that increase is due to higher administrative costs in the company.
Now let's take a look at the year-over-year comparison from operating income, which can be found on Slide 5. Starting in the right, third quarter 2016 operating income, excluding noncomparable items but including Remy, was $265 million or 12% of sales. If you also exclude Remy's $7 million of net contribution, operating income on a comparable basis was $259 million or 12.9% of sales, down 40 basis points from a year ago.
On a comparable basis, operating income was up $8 million on $115 million of higher sales. That gives us an incremental margin of 7% in the quarter. This performance is below trend but was expected due to the higher SG&A spending.
From operations perspective, or if you look at the segment levels, not only look, saying it, incremental margins were up actually 14% in the quarter. As you look further down the income statement, equity and affiliate earnings was about $12 million in the quarter, up from $9 million last year. Interest expense and finance charges were $22 million in the quarter, up from $15 million a year ago. The increase is primarily due to the $500 million euro fixed-rate senior notes we issued in the third quarter of 2015. 
Provisions for income taxes in the quarter on a reported basis was $49 million. However, this included a $31 million tax benefit related to our noncomparable item and other favorable tax adjustments. You can read about each of these adjustments in our 10-Q, which will be filed later today. Excluding these items, the provision for income taxes was $80 million for an effective tax rate of 31%, which is in line with our full year guidance. Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest were about $10 million, up $1 million from the third quarter of '15. This line represents our minority partner's share in the earnings and performance of our Korean and Chinese joint ventures.
So take let's take a look at our diluted earnings per share on Slide 6. Net earnings, excluding noncomparable items, but including Remy, were $0.78 per share. On a comparable basis, net earnings were $0.76 per diluted share.
Now let's take a closer look at our operating segments in the quarter, beginning on Slide 7 of the deck. Reported Engine segment net sales were $1.36 billion in the quarter. Sales growth for the Engine segment on a comparable basis was 3.8%, primarily due to higher turbocharger and variable cam timing sales, partially offset by weak aftermarket and off-road commercial vehicle markets around the world.
Turning to Slide 8. Reported EBIT was $218 million for the Engine segment or 16.1% of sales. Excluding currency, adjusted EBIT for -- was 16% of sales, down 20 basis points from the prior year. On a comparable basis, the Engine segment's adjusted EBIT was up $6 million on $15 million of higher sales for an incremental margin of 12%.
Now turning to Slide 9 and starting from the right. Drivetrain segment net sales were $866 million in the quarter. This includes $215 million of sales from Remy. Sales growth for the Drivetrain segment on a comparable basis was 11.4%, primarily due to higher all-wheel drive sales. Strong growth for the Drivetrain segment.
On Slide 10, reported EBIT was $87 million for the Drivetrain segment or 10% of sales. Excluding Remy and currency, adjusted EBIT was 12.4% of sales, which is up 40 basis points from the prior year. On a comparable basis, the Drivetrain segment's adjusted EBIT was up $10 million on $67 million of sales for an incremental margin of 15%.
Now let's take a look at the balance sheet and cash flow. We generated $593 million of net cash from operating activities in the first 9 months of the year, and that's up $123 million from a year ago. Capital spending was $355 million for the first half, which is down $64 million from a year ago. As a percentage of sales, CapEx was 5.2% of sales in the first 9 months. Free cash flow, which we define as net cash from operating activities less capital spending, was $238 million in the first 9 months, up $187 million from a year ago. We are still on track to generate between $400 million and $475 million of free cash flow in 2016. At the midpoint, that's up 50% from 2015.
Looking at the balance sheet itself. Balance sheet debt increased by $65 million, and cash decreased by 55 -- $59 million in the first 9 months compared with the end of 2015. The $124 million increase in net debt was primarily due to share repurchases. We spent $215 million repurchasing just under 7.3 million shares in the first 9 months, already achieving our expected $200 million to $300 million of share repurchases this year.
Our net debt to net capital ratio is 35.6% at the end of the quarter, up from 35.2% at the end of 2015. Net debt-to-EBITDA at the end of the quarter on a trailing 12-month basis was 1.4x.
Now before we move on to guidance discussion, I like to review the sale of the Remy's light vehicle aftermarket business announced earlier this month. As James said, strategically, the business was not core. While aftermarket's an important segment for us, this aftermarket business sells to big-box retailers, which is a very different business model from our aftermarket business, which sells to wholesalers and distributors.
The deal is a win-win for both the buyer and BorgWarner. The buyer has a strategic focus in this market segment. They will invest in this business, and combined with its existing business, gain a scale advantage. BorgWarner will retain the rotating electric components that complement our strategic focus on hybrid and electric vehicle propulsion systems.
We sold the business for $80 million, which is a fair price. From a accounting perspective, we recorded a pretax loss of $106 million due to the reevaluation of the business reflecting current market conditions.
There are 2 additional favorable outcomes of the deal. First, it is accretive to margins. Year-to-date, Remy's margins have been just over 4%. Excluding the light vehicle market business, Remy's margins would have been 100 basis points higher. Second, due to the payment terms with its customers, that business factored the majority of its receivables, which is considered debt by the rating agencies. With the sale of that business, our debt, as calculated by the rating agencies, is reduced by $75 million.
Now I'd like to discuss our current 2016 guidance. Returning to the slide deck, let's start with our sales growth guidance for the full year on Slide 11. Note that the baseline for 2015 net sales excludes Remy, which was just under $7.9 billion. We have narrowed our sales guidance range around the center of the previous range. All in, we expect to grow between 15.2% and 16% this year compared to 13.7% and 17.5% previously.
A few points on the updated sales guidance. Our outlook for organic growth has improved. Market-related growth and new business growth net of pricing is now expected to be 4.3% to 4.8% compared with 3% to 5.5% previously. And we expect the impact of currency to be less negative than it was before. However, these favorable items are offset by a weaker outlook for Remy sales, as James said earlier, primarily in the commercial vehicle and the Aftermarket business. 
Net-net, the midpoint of the sales guidance range is unchanged. And I'd like to make one other point in here. The assumption is that the Remy aftermarket remains at BorgWarner throughout the end of the year because of the uncertainty of exactly when the closing date's going to be on the sale.
Now let's take a look at our operating income guidance on Slide 12. We are now expecting 13% to 14% incremental margins on our core business sales growth, which is slightly down from our previous guide of 15% to 17%. Incremental margins were about 14 % through the first 9 months of the year, and we expect our fourth quarter incremental margin to be in the low to mid-teens as well. On a comparable basis, we still expect our operating income margin to be above 13%. And including Remy, our operating income margin is still expected to be greater than 12%.
On Slide 13, we have our EPS guidance. We expect earnings of $3.24 to $3.28 per share, including a $0.12 per share contribution from Remy, up from $2.16 to $3.32 previously. An improved outlook on the impact of currency and a lower share count are driving the change.
Now let's review our fourth quarter guidance, which is simply the remainder of what's left in our annual guidance, starting with sales growth on Slide 14. All in, we expect to grow between 14.3% and 17.8% in the quarter, including between 10 to 12 percentage points from Remy and about 1 percentage point due to favorable currency. On a comparable basis, our organic growth is expected to be between 3% and 5% in the quarter. From an earnings perspective, as shown on Slide 15, we expect earnings of between $0.82 and $0.86 per share in the fourth quarter, which includes about $0.02 per share from Remy.
So in conclusion, we had a solid quarter. As James said, this is the fourth quarter in a row exceeded EPS and sales goals. And as we look at the remainder of the year, we expect to continue to be on this path: solid sales growth, strong operating margins and improved cash flow from a year ago.
So with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Ken. Thank you."

We've seen launch noise and macro noise, and we've been executing really well in that mid-single-digit organic growth area or range. And so we'll be applying that same approach, that same methodology as we're marching towards '17 and '18. I would say that at a general level, our launch cadence, our launch volumes has played out pretty much. There's obviously puts and takes.

I talked a little bit about diesel mix and soft -- if you do a year-to-date comparable, Brian, from '15 to '16, our view is in Western Europe, it's down a couple of percentage points. And I think we've been fairly consistent through the year that, that's not -- that doesn't move the needle for us materially when it moves 1% or 2% down. The question as you look out, will that trend continue down? Our view is it will, and we feel we're well prepared there with the growth that we're delivering on gas turbos. In the quarter itself, you'd -- we -- the 2 big drivers for growth on Engine were turbo and variable cam timing. Those were strong. And I would say that was on a pretty global basis, so it wasn't one region particularly that stood out. And relative to fourth, Brian, if you go back to the prior earnings call, I know there was a lot of concern on that day of Ford's lowering expectations or lowering volume projections, what are you going to do? We felt we that we had that pretty well contained in our guidance, and we delivered.

I think there'll be a balance but I would tend to agree with you that the intensity and the drive towards pure battery electric vehicle is probably strongest in China than any other region of the world. That's not to say it's not going to adopted in Europe and North America. But there is a strong push for pure electrics in China, and we've been announcing that we're benefiting from that. The -- our single-speed transmission technology is adopted on a number of those vehicles that are out there, and we've got other products going on it.

And to your point, Chris, we know that those penetration rates of the different hybrid vehicles and the different electric, are going to move around. And nobody has a crystal ball to know exactly what the penetration rate is on any of those platforms. What we're doing, and we will continue to do, is position ourself to offer product offering for all those architectures and support the customers as needed. And we're putting ourself in a position with the portfolio that we have, that if hybrids accelerate a little higher than electrics or electrics go a little faster than hybrids, we will be great because we're going to grow with any of them. We're going to grow on hybrid content, we're going to grow on electric and we're going to grow on combustion. So I appreciate your point. I think there is some uncertainty out there, and that's what we're looking, frankly speaking, to take advantage of by offering a broader portfolio than anybody else, that we can participate and it will play out as it plays out.

I think fundamentally, what we're seeing is those -- so the question really is what are those diesel vehicles being replaced with? And I'd say, the vast majority, in our view of those, are with turbocharged gasoline vehicles. So that obviously plays well for BorgWarner. We're not seeing a shift from diesel to naturally aspirated vehicle so much. We're seeing turbocharged gasoline and sometimes turbocharged gasoline hybrids. So near term, it's pretty small impact for us. Obviously, it affects a little bit of our -- some of our emissions products a little. But net-net for BorgWarner, Emmanuel, it's relatively small impact for us as it shifts from diesel to gas, particularly if it's at a gradual pace that we've seen thus far.

We're seeing that adjustment, is a good word for me. And what we see is fundamentally, the technology on the engine is very similar. So if it's a turbocharged direct-injection engines with variable cam timing, they shifting that from maybe a 1.6 to a 1.8 or a 2, and that's helping us. Generally speaking, your observation's a good one, Joe. The larger engines are generally slightly beneficial for BorgWarner. So this is, net-net, a good move for BorgWarner.

Ron and I are really pleased today to share our third quarter 2016 results with you as well as give you some thoughts and outlook for the rest of the year. I'd like to start actually by sharing a few thoughts on the macro environment to the industry in general. And you can see that on Slide 2, if you're following along. So just a few thoughts on the macro state of the world. I think the word that we think about is still, there's a level of uncertainty in the macro world. There's -- I think the slowing economic growth around the world is still on everybody's mind, and that's presenting some challenges. 
I do know the world is still not without a lot of tenseness around some of the political climate. You think of the Middle East, you think of U.S. election and those types of things. So there's still an environment of uncertainty. But with that said, what we've seen in the auto space is things have been moving along pretty well as anticipated and as expected, particularly in the third quarter.
If I turn a little more specifically to the outlook around the auto space, let me start with some comments around light vehicle 2016 calendar year. Generally, our view on the marketplace is well aligned with IHS, which is calling for approximately a 7% growth in China on light vehicle. We see about 2% growth in Europe, and the U.S. is somewhere in the 2% to 3% growth. And we, like IHS, and I think many on this call, we certainly acknowledge that the U.S. cycle is maturing and in a slower-growth mode. 
If I reflect where we are on commercial vehicle, I think I would characterize the global commercial vehicle space as still challenged. We see North America and South America still down and challenged for sure. We do see a little bit of improvement this year running through Western Europe and China also. So whilst it's a mixed bag globally, overall, this space is still challenged.
I always like to start these calls and talk a little bit about areas of watch that we think are particularly relevant to BorgWarner. And I would point for us to 3 in particular: The North American mature cycle I referenced earlier and how that's going to play out with inventory. Recently, we saw Ford aligning its inventory to match sales and with their production schedule reductions. I think from a BorgWarner perspective, we felt that was well contained within our guidance. But we're going to pay close attention of will there be further adjustments as we go through the fourth quarter. 
The second area of watch that we pay a little bit of attention to for sure is diesel penetration in Western Europe or in Europe in general. And as through this year, if we look at how '16 is playing out versus '15, we see about a 2 percentage point drop in diesel penetration in Europe. And we talked about this for a long time. We've been watching this trend of a declining diesel, and I think we're very well prepared as BorgWarner as we've been aligned in our products closely around gasoline and hybrid technology.
The third area that we're paying close attention to is China. We're enjoying some strong growth in the third quarter. And we're going to look to see what happens with the incentives as that phases out towards the end of this year, and how that plays into next year.
All of that said, I would say to you, things, so far, have been going very much as planned per our guidance, and naturally, we're excited to discuss our performance. So let me talk a little bit about one other aspect before I get into our detailed numbers, and that's in the regulatory and technology trend area.
We still see a very strong drive around fuel economy and emissions regulations, and the pull for advanced propulsion technology is not changing. There is a very robust intensity around the pull for advanced propulsion technology.
I would say with -- in the last quarter, we've seen a notable acceleration in discussions on gas and hybrid and EV technology, and that is playing itself out. And as that transition to electrification continues, we remain very active here. Multiple customers working with us on electrification solutions, whether that be 48-volt architecture, hybrid architecture and EVs. And not just long term, this is also for products in the here and now.
At our recent Investor Day, we highlighted that we had approximately 19 new customer awards in the hybrid and electric vehicle space, and I can assure you, that number continues to grow. Our quoting activity remains robust with multiple customers and multiple products. As normal, we will publicly announce additional new business awards in this category when we receive additional customer approvals. But I will say again, I'm very pleased with our bookings. Our win rates remain strong and the diversification of our bookings is also exciting for us. Both regionally, it's well-balanced, customers, it's well-balanced and we're pleased of the booking rates across the combustion, hybrid and electric space. And last but certainly not least, we're also pleased with the profitability that we're booking that new business at.
So let me give a little bit of color on the financials and obviously, Ron will step through this in a lot more detail. So I start with the third quarter at the BorgWarner level, and the conclusion for me is I'm very pleased with our third quarter.
We delivered growth towards the high end of our guidance range and solid operating performance. With sales at $2.2 billion, that's up 6% when we exclude FX and Remy. And I think that's pretty impressive when you look at the global light vehicle production, it essentially was flat around the world with the exception of China; that was a strong growth market.
Regionally, it played out pretty much as expected from a BorgWarner point of view which resulted in strong growth in China and North America and Korea, partially offset by Europe aftermarket and CV. We delivered $0.78 EPS, excluding noncomparable items. And our operating margin at 12%, when we exclude Remy, that's 12.9%, strong operating performance for us. 
If we break that down by segments, the Engine business was at $1.36 billion, which grew just under 4%. Primary drivers for there were turbo and variable cam timing. And from a Drivetrain perspective, we were $866 million reported. That's up 48%. But when we exclude currency and Remy, we grew at an impressive 11.4% in the Drivetrain segment. That was primarily driven by strong all-wheel drive sales in both North America and in Europe.
Now turning to our outlook for the rest of 2016. You see we did narrow our guidance around the center of the previous range, and Ron will give you more details there. I would also say as we've gone through this year, we've talked to you about some major launches that BorgWarner has been actively involved with. That's the Pentastar with FCA, Ford Scorpion, Ford Super Duty and the DM (sic) [GM] Duramax. All have launched and in our view, all are on track. 
So the outlook for our Q4, as we step into Q4, I would articulate that our risks and our opportunities are pretty well-balanced. We see good, strong growth in China and a slowing North America, but we think our risks and opportunities are balanced. And the punchline is we feel confident in our guidance of 3% to 5% organic growth for the quarter and continued strong operating performance.
Just a couple of comments around growth highlights. And I'll start with Remy. Ron will talked a lot more about the detailed financial aspects of the light-duty aftermarket transaction that we recently announced. I think this is a really good deal from a BorgWarner perspective. The primary thing for me strategically is this really allows the team to focus on what I would describe as the core Remy business and combining that rotating electrical expertise with the BorgWarner product offering. So this is a good transaction that we're going forward with. 
I would characterize the integration going well. I think operationally and financially, it's performing as expected, albeit with sales coming in a little lighter primarily driven by CV and aftermarket.
We remain very positive about the strength of the technology. Multiple customers are engaged with us in discussions about the combination products particularly again around the motors and clutches for hybrid vehicles that we talked extensively about at Investor Day.
Also a comment about M&A. The M&A pipeline remains very strong for us, very actively considering things. And as I mentioned at Investor Day and on prior calls, power electronics is the big priority for us as a company.
So let me kind of summarize. I think, so far, I would characterize it as being a very good year for us so far. We've delivered what we said we would do. And with my accounting, this is 4 very strong quarters for us consecutively where we meet or beat both the top line and the bottom line. The business is operating very well, and we're heavily focused on executing the short-term performance but also securing the growth for us in the future.
Key for me is we -- I absolutely believe we have a winning strategy that's going to focus on delivering advanced propulsion technology for combustion, hybrid and electric vehicles that will deliver the mid- to high single-digit growth that we've committed to. And finally, I remain upbeat and very positive about delivering our 2016 guidance. 
So with that, let me turn the call over to Ron. Thank you."

Before I review the financial details, I'd like to provide you some of the highlights that I see them [ph] for the quarter. First, we saw good growth. Second, we delivered solid operating performance. And third, w",2010,"Thank you, James, and good day, everyone. Before I review the financial details, I'd like to provide you some of the highlights that I see them [ph] for the quarter. First, we saw good growth. Second, we delivered solid operating performance. And third, we continue to see improvement in CapEx spending and free cash flow generation.
So now as Ken mentioned, I will be referring to the supplemental financial slide deck that is posted on our IR website. Please follow along.
First, I'd like to focus your attention on Slide 3. Throughout the presentation, I will highlight certain non-U.S. GAAP measures to provide a clear picture of how the core business performed and for comparisons with prior periods. Specifically, we will be excluding the impact of foreign currency, Remy and noncomparable items from certain U.S. GAAP measures. When you hear me say on a comparable basis, that means excluding the impact of foreign currencies, Remy and noncomparable items. When you hear me say on a reported basis, that means U.S. GAAP.
So let's turn to Slide 4. On a reported basis, which includes the change in sales due to market growth, price, net new business and currency and the Remy acquisition, sales were up 17.5%. On a comparable basis, our sales were up 6.1% toward the high end of our guidance range. On a reported basis, gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 21.3% in the quarter. But on a comparable basis, gross margin was 21.9% of sales, up 70 basis points from last year. On a reported basis, SG&A was 9.5% of sales. R&D spending, which is included in SG&A, was 4% of sales. On a comparable basis, SG&A was 9.1% of sales, which is up 120 basis points from a year ago. 
There's 3 reasons for this increase. First, R&D spending, on a comparable basis, was up 40 basis points from a year ago as we continue to invest in the future. I would like to point out, though, it was still at 4% of sales. Second, as we discussed in our second quarter earnings call, we implemented sharp cost controls in the third quarter of 2015 in response to macro uncertainty, making the year-over-year comparison challenging. So about 40 basis points of this increase was due to that rough comparison. The remaining 40 points is (sic) [of] that increase is due to higher administrative costs in the company.
Now let's take a look at the year-over-year comparison from operating income, which can be found on Slide 5. Starting in the right, third quarter 2016 operating income, excluding noncomparable items but including Remy, was $265 million or 12% of sales. If you also exclude Remy's $7 million of net contribution, operating income on a comparable basis was $259 million or 12.9% of sales, down 40 basis points from a year ago.
On a comparable basis, operating income was up $8 million on $115 million of higher sales. That gives us an incremental margin of 7% in the quarter. This performance is below trend but was expected due to the higher SG&A spending.
From operations perspective, or if you look at the segment levels, now that we love [ph] saying it, incremental margins were up actually 14% in the quarter. As you look further down the income statement, equity and affiliate earnings was about $12 million in the quarter, up from $9 million last year. Interest expense and finance charges were $22 million in the quarter, up from $15 million a year ago. The increase is primarily due to the $500 million euro fixed-rate senior notes we issued in the third quarter of 2015. 
Provisions for income taxes in the quarter on a reported basis was $49 million. However, this included a $31 million tax benefit related to our noncomparable item and other favorable tax adjustments. You can read about each of these adjustments in our 10-Q, which will be filed later today. Excluding these items, the provision for income taxes was $80 million for an effective tax rate of 31%, which is in line with our full year guidance. Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest were about $10 million, up $1 million from the third quarter of '15. This line represents our minority partner's share in the earnings and performance of our Korean and Chinese joint ventures.
So take let's take a look at our diluted earnings per share on Slide 6. Net earnings, excluding noncomparable items, but including Remy, were $0.78 per share. On a comparable basis, net earnings were $0.76 per diluted share.
Now let's take a closer look at our operating segments in the quarter, beginning on Slide 7 of the deck. Reported Engine segment net sales were $1.36 billion in the quarter. Sales growth for the Engine segment on a comparable basis was 3.8%, primarily due to higher turbocharger and variable cam timing sales, partially offset by weak aftermarket and off-road commercial vehicle markets around the world.
Turning to Slide 8. Reported EBIT was $218 million for the Engine segment or 16.1% of sales. Excluding currency, adjusted EBIT for -- was 16% of sales, down 20 basis points from the prior year. On a comparable basis, the Engine segment's adjusted EBIT was up $6 million on $15 million of higher sales for an incremental margin of 12%.
Now turning to Slide 9 and starting from the right. Drivetrain segment net sales were $866 million in the quarter. This includes $215 million of sales from Remy. Sales growth for the Drivetrain segment on a comparable basis was 11.4%, primarily due to higher all-wheel drive sales. Strong growth for the Drivetrain segment.
On Slide 10, reported EBIT was $87 million for the Drivetrain segment or 10% of sales. Excluding Remy and currency, adjusted EBIT was 12.4% of sales, which is up 40 basis points from the prior year. On a comparable basis, the Drivetrain segment's adjusted EBIT was up $10 million on $67 million of sales for an incremental margin of 15%.
Now let's take a look at the balance sheet and cash flow. We generated $593 million of net cash from operating activities in the first 9 months of the year, and that's up $123 million from a year ago. Capital spending was $355 million for the first half, which is down $64 million from a year ago. As a percentage of sales, CapEx was 5.2% of sales in the first 9 months. Free cash flow, which we define as net cash from operating activities less capital spending, was $238 million in the first 9 months, up $187 million from a year ago. We are still on track to generate between $400 million and $475 million of free cash flow in 2016. At the midpoint, that's up 50% from 2015.
Looking at the balance sheet itself. Balance sheet debt increased by $65 million, and cash decreased by 55 -- $59 million in the first 9 months compared with the end of 2015. The $124 million increase in net debt was primarily due to share repurchases. We spent $215 million repurchasing just under 7.3 million shares in the first 9 months, already achieving our expected $200 million to $300 million of share repurchases this year.
Our net debt to net capital ratio is 35.6% at the end of the quarter, up from 35.2% at the end of 2015. Net debt-to-EBITDA at the end of the quarter on a trailing 12-month basis was 1.4x.
Now before we move on to guidance discussion, I like to review the sale of the Remy's light vehicle aftermarket business announced earlier this month. As James said, strategically, the business was not core. While aftermarket's an important segment for us, this aftermarket business sells to big-box retailers, which is a very different business model from our aftermarket business, which sells to wholesalers and distributors.
The deal is a win-win for both the buyer and BorgWarner. The buyer has a strategic focus in this market segment. They will invest in this business, and combined with its existing business, gain a scale advantage. BorgWarner will retain the rotating electric components that complement our strategic focus on hybrid and electric vehicle propulsion systems.
We sold the business for $80 million, which is a fair price. From an accounting perspective, we recorded a pretax loss of $106 million due to the reevaluation of the business reflecting current market conditions.
There are 2 additional favorable outcomes of the deal. First, it is accretive to margins. Year-to-date, Remy's margins have been just over 4%. Excluding the light vehicle market business, Remy's margins would have been 100 basis points higher. Second, due to the payment terms with its customers, that business factored the majority of its receivables, which is considered debt by the rating agencies. With the sale of that business, our debt, as calculated by the rating agencies, is reduced by $75 million.
Now I'd like to discuss our current 2016 guidance. Returning to the slide deck, let's start with our sales growth guidance for the full year on Slide 11. Note that the baseline for 2015 net sales excludes Remy, which was just under $7.9 billion. We have narrowed our sales guidance range around the center of the previous range. All in, we expect to grow between 15.2% and 16% this year compared to 13.7% and 17.5% previously.
A few points on the updated sales guidance. Our outlook for organic growth has improved. Market-related growth and new business growth net of pricing is now expected to be 4.3% to 4.8% compared with 3% to 5.5% previously. And we expect the impact of currency to be less negative than it was before. However, these favorable items are offset by a weaker outlook for Remy sales, as James said earlier, primarily in the commercial vehicle and the Aftermarket business. 
Net-net, the midpoint of the sales guidance range is unchanged. And I'd like to make one other point in here. The assumption is that the Remy aftermarket remains at BorgWarner throughout the end of the year because of the uncertainty of exactly when the closing date's going to be on the sale.
Now let's take a look at our operating income guidance on Slide 12. We are now expecting 13% to 14% incremental margins on our core business sales growth, which is slightly down from our previous guide of 15% to 17%. Incremental margins were about 14 % through the first 9 months of the year, and we expect our fourth quarter incremental margin to be in the low to mid-teens as well. On a comparable basis, we still expect our operating income margin to be above 13%. And including Remy, our operating income margin is still expected to be greater than 12%.
On Slide 13, we have our EPS guidance. We expect earnings of $3.24 to $3.28 per share, including a $0.12 per share contribution from Remy, up from $3.16 to $3.32 previously. An improved outlook on the impact of currency and a lower share count are driving the change.
Now let's review our fourth quarter guidance, which is simply the remainder of what's left in our annual guidance, starting with sales growth on Slide 14. All in, we expect to grow between 14.3% and 17.8% in the quarter, including between 10 to 12 percentage points from Remy and about 1 percentage point due to favorable currency. On a comparable basis, our organic growth is expected to be between 3% and 5% in the quarter. From an earnings perspective, as shown on Slide 15, we expect earnings of between $0.82 and $0.86 per share in the fourth quarter, which includes about $0.02 per share from Remy.
So in conclusion, we had a solid quarter. As James said, this is the fourth quarter in a row exceeded EPS and sales goals. And as we look at the remainder of the year, we expect to continue to be on this path: solid sales growth, strong operating margins and improved cash flow from a year ago.
So with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Ken. Thank you."

The -- let me say the discipline and the methodology and approach that we used for '16, we feel good about. And the reason we feel good about that is, as Ron and I both alluded to, we've been hitting our numbers pretty well with some fluctuations in the market. We've seen noise in the marketplace. We've seen launch noise and macro noise, and we've been executing really well in that mid-single-digit organic growth area or range. And so we'll be applying that same approach, that same methodology as we're marching towards '17 and '18. I would say that at a general level, our launch cadence, our launch volumes has played out pretty much. There's obviously puts and takes. So that gives me, at least, comfort that the methodology is solid, the business strategy is very solid, the win rates are very solid. So we'll go through all our mathematics, as you can imagine, in the fourth quarter as we get ready for January. But I would say at a high level, there's nothing fundamentally there that's different to the way we were thinking a year ago. And I would just say you and we should take comfort of the way we've executed this year, both on the top line and bottom line as we get ready for net new business in January."

And I think we've been fairly consistent through the year that, that's not -- that doesn't move the needle for us materially when it moves 1% or 2% down. The question as you look out, will that trend continue down? Our view is it will, and we feel we're well prepared there with the growth that we're delivering on gas turbos. In the quarter itself, you'd -- we -- the 2 big drivers for growth on Engine were turbo and variable cam timing. Those were strong. And I would say that was on a pretty global basis, so it wasn't one region particularly that stood out. And relative to Ford, Brian, if you go back to the prior earnings call, I know there was a lot of concern on that day of Ford's lowering expectations or lowering volume projections, what are you going to do? We felt we that we had that pretty well contained in our guidance, and we delivered.

One, you did talk about being neutral with those. But are you seeing any evidence in your quoting activity? And any -- in China, vis-à-vis EVs, are they going to skip the hybrid step and go right to EVs?

I think there'll be a balance but I would tend to agree with you that the intensity and the drive towards pure battery electric vehicle is probably strongest in China than any other region of the world. That's not to say it's not going to be adopted in Europe and North America. But there is a strong push for pure electrics in China, and we've been announcing that we're benefiting from that. The -- our single-speed transmission technology is adopted on a number of those vehicles that are out there, and we've got other products going on it.

And we're putting ourself in a position with the portfolio that we have, that if hybrids accelerate a little faster than electrics or electrics go a little faster than hybrids, we will be great because we're going to grow with any of them. We're going to grow on hybrid content, we're going to grow on electric and we're going to grow on combustion. So I appreciate your point. I think there is some uncertainty out there, and that's what we're looking, frankly speaking, to take advantage of by offering a broader portfolio than anybody else, that we can participate and it will play out as it plays out. BorgWarner will continue to grow in that mid- to high single-digit growth rate independent of shifts within the different propulsion architectures, if that helps you."

Our view is that will continue to creep down. We're not seeing a cliff-type event. So we see that trending down. I think fundamentally, what we're seeing is those -- so the question really is what are those diesel vehicles being replaced with? And I'd say, the vast majority, in our view of those, are with turbocharged gasoline vehicles. So that obviously plays well for BorgWarner. We're not seeing a shift from diesel to naturally aspirated vehicle so much. We're seeing turbocharged gasoline and sometimes turbocharged gasoline hybrids. So near term, it's pretty small impact for us. Obviously, it affects a little bit of our -- some of our emissions products a little. But net-net for BorgWarner, Emmanuel, it's relatively small impact for us as it shifts from diesel to gas, particularly if it's at a gradual pace that we've seen thus far.

And then we also made the judgment to be a little bit more -- play a little bit more of a macro factor to the number. Our view -- and we're a little biased, Joe, is we thing that was a smart call. Because I think, as we've come through the year, we've been consistently hitting our numbers in that just around that mid-single-digit growth rate. That would imply, and I think you're right, that the backlog is running a little better than where we'd anticipated, which is good. And I said earlier in the call, Joe, that we'll be utilizing that same discipline and methodology as we go into '17. And I think if we look at what the 3-year view of the backlog that we went into this year was in that mid-single-digit growth range. I think 4% to 6% was the range for the 3-year period. And as we're executing in that range this year, so it gives us comfort as we go into the process for '17, '18, '19. So we got some work to do, Joe, on the detail. But I gain comfort from our strong execution this year, and delivering the growth that we set out to do helps me get confident, and hopefully, you get confident as we go into the out years."

We're seeing that adjustment, is a good word for me. And what we see is fundamentally, the technology on the engine is very similar. So if it's a turbocharged direct-injection engine with variable cam timing, they shifting that from maybe a 1.6 to a 1.8 or a 2, and that's helping us. Generally speaking, your observation's a good one, Joe. The larger engines are generally slightly beneficial for BorgWarner. So this is, net-net, a good move for BorgWarner. It's helpful for BorgWarner, I'll put it that way."

Ron and I are really pleased today to share our third quarter 2016 results with you as well as give you some thoughts and outlook for the rest of the year. I'd like to start actually by sharing a few thoughts on the macro environment to the industry in general. And you can see that on Slide 2, if you're following along. So just a few thoughts on the macro state of the world. I think the word that we think about is still, there's a level of uncertainty in the macro world. There's -- I think the slowing economic growth around the world is still on everybody's mind, and that's presenting some challenges. 
I do know the world is still not without a lot of tenseness around some of the political climate. You think of the Middle East, you think of U.S. election and those types of things. So there's still an environment of uncertainty. But with that said, what we've seen in the auto space is things have been moving along pretty well as anticipated and as expected, particularly in the third quarter.
If I turn a little more specifically to the outlook around the auto space, let me start with some comments around light vehicle 2016 calendar year. Generally, our view on the marketplace is well aligned with IHS, which is calling for approximately a 7% growth in China on light vehicle. We see about 2% growth in Europe, and the U.S. is somewhere in the 2% to 3% growth. And we, like IHS, and I think many on this call, we certainly acknowledge that the U.S. cycle is maturing and in a slower-growth mode. 
If I reflect where we are on commercial vehicle, I think I would characterize the global commercial vehicle space as still challenged. We see North America and South America still down and challenged for sure. We do see a little bit of improvement this year running through Western Europe and China also. So whilst it's a mixed bag globally, overall, this space is still challenged.
I always like to start these calls and talk a little bit about areas of watch that we think are particularly relevant to BorgWarner. And I would point for us to 3 in particular: The North American mature cycle I referenced earlier and how that's going to play out with inventory. Recently, we saw Ford aligning its inventory to match sales and with their production schedule reductions. I think from a BorgWarner perspective, we felt that was well contained within our guidance. But we're going to pay close attention of will there be further adjustments as we go through the fourth quarter. 
The second area of watch that we pay a little bit of attention to for sure is diesel penetration in Western Europe or in Europe in general. And as through this year, if we look at how '16 is playing out versus '15, we see about a 2 percentage point drop in diesel penetration in Europe. And we talked about this for a long time. We've been watching this trend of a declining diesel, and I think we're very well prepared as BorgWarner as we've been aligned in our products closely around gasoline and hybrid technology.
The third area that we're paying close attention to is China. We're enjoying some strong growth in the third quarter. And we're going to look to see what happens with the incentives as that phases out towards the end of this year, and how that plays into next year.
All of that said, I would say to you, things, so far, have been going very much as planned per our guidance, and naturally, we're excited to discuss our performance. So let me talk a little bit about one other aspect before I get into our detailed numbers, and that's in the regulatory and technology trend area.
We still see a very strong drive around fuel economy and emissions regulations, and the pull for advanced propulsion technology is not changing. There is a very robust intensity around the pull for advanced propulsion technology.
I would say with -- in the last quarter, we've seen a notable acceleration in discussions on gas and hybrid and EV technology, and that is playing itself out. And as that transition to electrification continues, we remain very active here. Multiple customers working with us on electrification solutions, whether that be 48-volt architecture, hybrid architecture and EVs. And not just long term, this is also for products in the here and now.
At our recent Investor Day, we highlighted that we had approximately 19 new customer awards in the hybrid and electric vehicle space, and I can assure you, that number continues to grow. Our quoting activity remains robust with multiple customers and multiple products. As normal, we will publicly announce additional new business awards in this category when we receive additional customer approvals. But I will say again, I'm very pleased with our bookings. Our win rates remain strong and the diversification of our bookings is also exciting for us. Both regionally, it's well-balanced, customers, it's well-balanced and we're pleased of the booking rates across the combustion, hybrid and electric space. And last but certainly not least, we're also pleased with the profitability that we're booking that new business at.
So let me give a little bit of color on the financials and obviously, Ron will step through this in a lot more detail. So I start with the third quarter at the BorgWarner level, and the conclusion for me is I'm very pleased with our third quarter.
We delivered growth towards the high end of our guidance range and solid operating performance. With sales at $2.2 billion, that's up 6% when we exclude FX and Remy. And I think that's pretty impressive when you look at the global light vehicle production, it essentially was flat around the world with the exception of China; that was a strong growth market.
Regionally, it played out pretty much as expected from a BorgWarner point of view which resulted in strong growth in China and North America and Korea, partially offset by Europe aftermarket and CV. We delivered $0.78 EPS, excluding noncomparable items. And our operating margin at 12%, when we exclude Remy, that's 12.9%, strong operating performance for us. 
If we break that down by segments, the Engine business was at $1.36 billion, which grew just under 4%. Primary drivers for there were turbo and variable cam timing. And from a Drivetrain perspective, we were $866 million reported. That's up 48%. But when we exclude currency and Remy, we grew at an impressive 11.4% in the Drivetrain segment. That was primarily driven by strong all-wheel drive sales in both North America and in Europe.
Now turning to our outlook for the rest of 2016. You see we did narrow our guidance around the center of the previous range, and Ron will give you more details there. I would also say as we've gone through this year, we've talked to you about some major launches that BorgWarner has been actively involved with. That's the Pentastar with FCA, Ford Scorpion, Ford Super Duty and the DM (sic) [GM] Duramax. All have launched and in our view, all are on track. 
So the outlook for our Q4, as we step into Q4, I would articulate that our risks and our opportunities are pretty well-balanced. We see good, strong growth in China and a slowing North America, but we think our risks and opportunities are balanced. And the punchline is we feel confident in our guidance of 3% to 5% organic growth for the quarter and continued strong operating performance.
Just a couple of comments around growth highlights. And I'll start with Remy. Ron will talked a lot more about the detailed financial aspects of the light-duty aftermarket transaction that we recently announced. I think this is a really good deal from a BorgWarner perspective. The primary thing for me strategically is this really allows the team to focus on what I would describe as the core Remy business and combining that rotating electrical expertise with the BorgWarner product offering. So this is a good transaction that we're going forward with. 
I would characterize the integration going well. I think operationally and financially, it's performing as expected, albeit with sales coming in a little lighter primarily driven by CV and aftermarket.
We remain very positive about the strength of the technology. Multiple customers are engaged with us in discussions about the combination products particularly again around the motors and clutches for hybrid vehicles that we talked extensively about at Investor Day.
Also a comment about M&A. The M&A pipeline remains very strong for us, very actively considering things. And as I mentioned at Investor Day and on prior calls, power electronics is the big priority for us as a company.
So let me kind of summarize. I think, so far, I would characterize it as being a very good year for us so far. We've delivered what we said we would do. And with my accounting, this is 4 very strong quarters for us consecutively where we meet or beat both the top line and the bottom line. The business is operating very well, and we're heavily focused on executing the short-term performance but also securing the growth for us in the future.
Key for me is we -- I absolutely believe we have a winning strategy that's going to focus on delivering advanced propulsion technology for combustion, hybrid and electric vehicles that will deliver the mid- to high single-digit growth that we've committed to. And finally, I remain upbeat and very positive about delivering our 2016 guidance. 
So with that, let me turn the call over to Ron. Thank you."

Before I review the financial details, I'd like to provide you some of the highlights that I see them [ph] for the quarter. First, we saw good growth. Second, we delivered solid operating performance. And third, we continue to see improvement in CapEx spending and free cash flow generation.
So now as Ken mentioned, I will be referring to the supplemental financial slide deck that is posted on our IR website. Please follow along.
First, I'd like to focus your attention on Slide 3. Throughout the presentation, I will highlight certain non-U.S. GAAP measures to provide a clear picture of how the core business performed and for comparisons with prior periods. Specifically, we will be excluding the impact of foreign currency, Remy and noncomparable items from certain U.S. GAAP measures. When you hear me say on a comparable basis, that means excluding the impact of foreign currencies, Remy and noncomparable items. When you hear me say on a reported basis, that means U.S. GAAP.
So let's turn to Slide 4. On a reported basis, which includes the change in sales due to market growth, price, net new business and currency and the Remy acquisition, sales were up 17.5%. On a comparable basis, our sales were up 6.1% toward the high end of our guidance range. On a reported basis, gross profit, as a percentage of sales, was 21.3% in the quarter. But on a comparable basis, gross margin was 21.9% of sales, up 70 basis points from last year. On a reported basis, SG&A was 9.5% of sales. R&D spending, which is included in SG&A, was 4% of sales. On a comparable basis, SG&A was 9.1% of sales, which is up 120 basis points from a year ago. 
There's 3 reasons for this increase. First, R&D spending, on a comparable basis, was up 40 basis points from a year ago as we continue to invest in the future. I would like to point out, though, it was still at 4% of sales. Second, as we discussed in our second quarter earnings call, we implemented sharp cost controls in the third quarter of 2015 in response to macro uncertainty, making the year-over-year comparison challenging. So about 40 basis points of this increase was due to that rough comparison. The remaining 40 points is (sic) [of] that increase is due to higher administrative costs in the company.
Now let's take a look at the year-over-year comparison from operating income, which can be found on Slide 5. Starting in the right, third quarter 2016 operating income, excluding noncomparable items but including Remy, was $265 million or 12% of sales. If you also exclude Remy's $7 million of net contribution, operating income on a comparable basis was $259 million or 12.9% of sales, down 40 basis points from a year ago.
On a comparable basis, operating income was up $8 million on $115 million of higher sales. That gives us an incremental margin of 7% in the quarter. This performance is below trend but was expected due to the higher SG&A spending.
From operations perspective, or if you look at the segment levels, now that we love [ph] saying it, incremental margins were up actually 14% in the quarter. As you look further down the income statement, equity and affiliate earnings was about $12 million in the quarter, up from $9 million last year. Interest expense and finance charges were $22 million in the quarter, up from $15 million a year ago. The increase is primarily due to the $500 million euro fixed-rate senior notes we issued in the third quarter of 2015. 
Provisions for income taxes in the quarter on a reported basis was $49 million. However, this included a $31 million tax benefit related to our noncomparable item and other favorable tax adjustments. You can read about each of these adjustments in our 10-Q, which will be filed later today. Excluding these items, the provision for income taxes was $80 million for an effective tax rate of 31%, which is in line with our full year guidance. Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest were about $10 million, up $1 million from the third quarter of '15. This line represents our minority partner's share in the earnings and performance of our Korean and Chinese joint ventures.
So take let's take a look at our diluted earnings per share on Slide 6. Net earnings, excluding noncomparable items, but including Remy, were $0.78 per share. On a comparable basis, net earnings were $0.76 per diluted share.
Now let's take a closer look at our operating segments in the quarter, beginning on Slide 7 of the deck. Reported Engine segment net sales were $1.36 billion in the quarter. Sales growth for the Engine segment on a comparable basis was 3.8%, primarily due to higher turbocharger and variable cam timing sales, partially offset by weak aftermarket and off-road commercial vehicle markets around the world.
Turning to Slide 8. Reported EBIT was $218 million for the Engine segment or 16.1% of sales. Excluding currency, adjusted EBIT for -- was 16% of sales, down 20 basis points from the prior year. On a comparable basis, the Engine segment's adjusted EBIT was up $6 million on $15 million of higher sales for an incremental margin of 12%.
Now turning to Slide 9 and starting from the right. Drivetrain segment net sales were $866 million in the quarter. This includes $215 million of sales from Remy. Sales growth for the Drivetrain segment on a comparable basis was 11.4%, primarily due to higher all-wheel drive sales. Strong growth for the Drivetrain segment.
On Slide 10, reported EBIT was $87 million for the Drivetrain segment or 10% of sales. Excluding Remy and currency, adjusted EBIT was 12.4% of sales, which is up 40 basis points from the prior year. On a comparable basis, the Drivetrain segment's adjusted EBIT was up $10 million on $67 million of sales for an incremental margin of 15%.
Now let's take a look at the balance sheet and cash flow. We generated $593 million of net cash from operating activities in the first 9 months of the year, and that's up $123 million from a year ago. Capital spending was $355 million for the first half, which is down $64 million from a year ago. As a percentage of sales, CapEx was 5.2% of sales in the first 9 months. Free cash flow, which we define as net cash from operating activities less capital spending, was $238 million in the first 9 months, up $187 million from a year ago. We are still on track to generate between $400 million and $475 million of free cash flow in 2016. At the midpoint, that's up 50% from 2015.
Looking at the balance sheet itself. Balance sheet debt increased by $65 million, and cash decreased by 55 -- $59 million in the first 9 months compared with the end of 2015. The $124 million increase in net debt was primarily due to share repurchases. We spent $215 million repurchasing just under 7.3 million shares in the first 9 months, already achieving our expected $200 million to $300 million of share repurchases this year.
Our net debt to net capital ratio is 35.6% at the end of the quarter, up from 35.2% at the end of 2015. Net debt-to-EBITDA at the end of the quarter on a trailing 12-month basis was 1.4x.
Now before we move on to guidance discussion, I like to review the sale of the Remy's light vehicle aftermarket business announced earlier this month. As James said, strategically, the business was not core. While aftermarket's an important segment for us, this aftermarket business sells to big-box retailers, which is a very different business model from our aftermarket business, which sells to wholesalers and distributors.
The deal is a win-win for both the buyer and BorgWarner. The buyer has a strategic focus in this market segment. They will invest in this business, and combined with its existing business, gain a scale advantage. BorgWarner will retain the rotating electric components that complement our strategic focus on hybrid and electric vehicle propulsion systems.
We sold the business for $80 million, which is a fair price. From an accounting perspective, we recorded a pretax loss of $106 million due to the reevaluation of the business reflecting current market conditions.
There are 2 additional favorable outcomes of the deal. First, it is accretive to margins. Year-to-date, Remy's margins have been just over 4%. Excluding the light vehicle market business, Remy's margins would have been 100 basis points higher. Second, due to the payment terms with its customers, that business factored the majority of its receivables, which is considered debt by the rating agencies. With the sale of that business, our debt, as calculated by the rating agencies, is reduced by $75 million.
Now I'd like to discuss our current 2016 guidance. Returning to the slide deck, let's start with our sales growth guidance for the full year on Slide 11. Note that the baseline for 2015 net sales excludes Remy, which was just under $7.9 billion. We have narrowed our sales guidance range around the center of the previous range. All in, we expect to grow between 15.2% and 16% this year compared to 13.7% and 17.5% previously.
A few points on the updated sales guidance. Our outlook for organic growth has improved. Market-related growth and new business growth net of pricing is now expected to be 4.3% to 4.8% compared with 3% to 5.5% previously. And we expect the impact of currency to be less negative than it was before. However, these favorable items are offset by a weaker outlook for Remy sales, as James said earlier, primarily in the commercial vehicle and the Aftermarket business. 
Net-net, the midpoint of the sales guidance range is unchanged. And I'd like to make one other point in here. The assumption is that the Remy aftermarket remains at BorgWarner throughout the end of the year because of the uncertainty of exactly when the closing date's going to be on the sale.
Now let's take a look at our operating income guidance on Slide 12. We are now expecting 13% to 14% incremental margins on our core business sales growth, which is slightly down from our previous guide of 15% to 17%. Incremental margins were about 14 % through the first 9 months of the year, and we expect our fourth quarter incremental margin to be in the low to mid-teens as well. On a comparable basis, we still expect our operating income margin to be above 13%. And including Remy, our operating income margin is still expected to be greater than 12%.
On Slide 13, we have our EPS guidance. We expect earnings of $3.24 to $3.28 per share, including a $0.12 per share contribution from Remy, up from $3.16 to $3.32 previously. An improved outlook on the impact of currency and a lower share count are driving the change.
Now let's review our fourth quarter guidance, which is simply the remainder of what's left in our annual guidance, starting with sales growth on Slide 14. All in, we expect to grow between 14.3% and 17.8% in the quarter, including between 10 to 12 percentage points from Remy and about 1 percentage point due to favorable currency. On a comparable basis, our organic growth is expected to be between 3% and 5% in the quarter. From an earnings perspective, as shown on Slide 15, we expect earnings of between $0.82 and $0.86 per share in the fourth quarter, which includes about $0.02 per share from Remy.
So in conclusion, we had a solid quarter. As James said, this is the fourth quarter in a row exceeded EPS and sales goals. And as we look at the remainder of the year, we expect to continue to be on this path: solid sales growth, strong operating margins and improved cash flow from a year ago.
So with that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Ken. Thank you."

We've seen launch noise and macro noise, and we've been executing really well in that mid-single-digit organic growth area or range. And so we'll be applying that same approach, that same methodology as we're marching towards '17 and '18. I would say that at a general level, our launch cadence, our launch volumes has played out pretty much. There's obviously puts and takes.

And I think we've been fairly consistent through the year that, that's not -- that doesn't move the needle for us materially when it moves 1% or 2% down. The question as you look out, will that trend continue down? Our view is it will, and we feel we're well prepared there with the growth that we're delivering on gas turbos. In the quarter itself, you'd -- we -- the 2 big drivers for growth on Engine were turbo and variable cam timing. Those were strong. And I would say that was on a pretty global basis, so it wasn't one region particularly that stood out. And relative to Ford, Brian, if you go back to the prior earnings call, I know there was a lot of concern on that day of Ford's lowering expectations or lowering volume projections, what are you going to do? We felt we that we had that pretty well contained in our guidance, and we delivered.

I think there'll be a balance but I would tend to agree with you that the intensity and the drive towards pure battery electric vehicle is probably strongest in China than any other region of the world. That's not to say it's not going to be adopted in Europe and North America. But there is a strong push for pure electrics in China, and we've been announcing that we're benefiting from that. The -- our single-speed transmission technology is adopted on a number of those vehicles that are out there, and we've got other products going on it.

And I would refer us back to the conversations we had at Investor Day, and it goes something like this.

And to your point, Chris, we know that those penetration rates of the different hybrid vehicles and the different electric, are going to move around. And nobody has a crystal ball to know exactly what the penetration rate is on any of those platforms. What we're doing, and we will continue to do, is position ourself to offer product offering for all those architectures and support the customers as needed. And we're putting ourself in a position with the portfolio that we have, that if hybrids accelerate a little faster than electrics or electrics go a little faster than hybrids, we will be great because we're going to grow with any of them. We're going to grow on hybrid content, we're going to grow on electric and we're going to grow on combustion. So I appreciate your point. I think there is some uncertainty out there, and that's what we're looking, frankly speaking, to take advantage of by offering a broader portfolio than anybody else, that we can participate and it will play out as it plays out.

I think fundamentally, what we're seeing is those -- so the question really is what are those diesel vehicles being replaced with? And I'd say, the vast majority, in our view of those, are with turbocharged gasoline vehicles. So that obviously plays well for BorgWarner. We're not seeing a shift from diesel to naturally aspirated vehicle so much. We're seeing turbocharged gasoline and sometimes turbocharged gasoline hybrids. So near term, it's pretty small impact for us. Obviously, it affects a little bit of our -- some of our emissions products a little.

Just first on schedules here in the near term, particularly in North America, there appears to be some disparate strategies where some companies like Ford are cutting production pretty quickly to try to adjust inventory down relative to demand. And some companies are not. I'm just curious what you guys were seeing as far as schedules and volatility. And as you look on 30 and 60-day releases, are there significant changes that had been occurring or volatility that are tough to handle? Or is it really pretty consistent, and they're giving you a good heads up and seem logical so far?"

Obviously, like you and everybody, we're going to pay a lot of attention to this because as you start to come towards the year-end. But I would say, to use the phrase, the discipline around scheduling and releasing has been pretty good. An example for us would be, John, when we have this exact same call last quarter, there was -- that was at a time when Ford was kind of suggesting releases, reductions, et cetera. And we talked about it than that we believe we had that well contained in our guidance. And I think it's fair to say we delivered on that, so that's encouraging. And I mentioned earlier in the call, John, I'm not sure if you were on. The latest news from Ford, so to speak, we feel that's contained in our guidance, which essentially was unchanged as we went into this quarter. So I think, generally, John, it's reasonably well disciplined. We watch it and pay a lot of attention to it, but so far, so good."

I think from an operating point of view, John, it's been running well. And I think, I would say, we're incrementally positive on our dialogue with the customers, particularly around the combination of Remy's rotating electrics with our mechanical know-how around P2 hybrid modules that we talked about in Investor Day. I think that continues to go extremely well for us, globally by the way, Europe, Asia and North America. So overall, really good. Ron gave a couple of comments earlier, John, if you weren't on about it's a really good thing that we can complete this transaction on the light duty retail aftermarket business. That's just not core to us, and I think that'll allow us to focus more on the core side. I think that's another incremental step forward with Remy.
