Today, I'm going to discuss highlights of our fourth quarter; review our accomplishments in 2015; introduce our video strategy, which will be a key focus going forward;",1822,"Good morning, and thank you for joining Frontier's Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. Today, I'm going to discuss highlights of our fourth quarter; review our accomplishments in 2015; introduce our video strategy, which will be a key focus going forward; and update you on our execution plans for the acquisition of Verizon's wireline operations in California, Texas and Florida. We continued our track record of solid execution in operating our existing business in the fourth quarter and throughout the year, even while committing substantial time and resources to preparing for the California, Texas and Florida acquisition. 
Please turn to Slide 3. The fourth quarter represented our 12th consecutive quarter of strong broadband net additions, with net additions of 28,500. That extends our continuing trend of very strong progress in broadband with cumulative net additions totaling nearly 350,000 since the beginning of 2012. Our progress continues to be broad-based across our footprint. In the fourth quarter, we once again, increased our residential broadband penetration in over 75% of the markets we serve. We maintained good momentum in our business segment as well. This was our eighth consecutive quarter of roughly stable sequential results in SME, excluding Connecticut. 
2015 was a year of very substantial accomplishments for Frontier. We executed a smooth, successful CEO transition as well as the separation of the CEO and Chairman roles. This will culminate on April 1 in the appointment of an independent, nonexecutive Chairman, Pam Reid, we'll be less of a government by many shareholders. In the second and third quarters, we raised all the equity and debt funding required to close the California, Texas and Florida transaction. We completed the regulatory approval process with the final steps being received of the California PCE approval in December. We also are nearly complete with our integration activities and are looking forward to closing in less than 40 days. In 2015, we completed the integration of our Connecticut property. 
This included stabilizing the residential customer base after a number of customers migrated to new pricing early in the year. We have invested heavily and continued to improve the network in Connecticut and are focused on introducing higher speeds and video  to more communities in the state. Finally, we have transitioned to a  normalized of acquisition pricing and market-based video pricing, which will improve our back and margins over time. Last year, we fulfilled our commitments under the FCC's CAF I program and embarked upon the CAF II program in order to improve our broadband availability to unserved households. John will address this further, but let me say that our plan is to connect or upgrade over 100,000 households, utilizing CAF II funding this year. We also continue to improve broadband capabilities elsewhere within our footprint. For example, in Connecticut and other markets, we are in the process of introducing speeds in excess of 100 megabits over copper sent by our fiber-to-the-node infrastructure. We have been investing to transform our operating support systems, our customer self-service capabilities and our provisioning platforms. We believe these investments will position us well to lower operating expenses of our existing business as we deploy these enhancements and customers begin to adapt the new functionality. 
In reviewing 2015, there are areas we have identified where we can do better in the future. We have efforts underway to improve our performance. One significant ongoing pressure we have in our business is the decline of voice, particularly in residential. In fact, this was the reason our customer revenues were slightly short of our expectations in the fourth quarter. While this sectoral headwind will continue, the relative impact of total revenue will decline. We estimate our residential voice revenue run rate will be approaching 15% of revenue pro forma for California, Texas and Florida acquisitions. In Connecticut, we began to experience the benefit of the expiration of promotions introduced into fall of 2014. The benefit was limited in Q4 as the expirations occurred only part way through the period. We anticipate a more significant benefit in the first and second quarters. And as we migrate these customers off promotional pricing, we haven't experienced a result in significant increase in churn.
Please turn to Slide 4. As you know, we are in the process of reshaping our business to offer customers enhancements to the broadband products that had become such important parts of their lives. Additional broadband market share growth remains a key initiative for the company. Currently, our percentage of residential broadband penetration is only in the mid-20s. Approximately 50% of broadband activity in Q4 was above the basic speed tier, up from nearly 40% in Q4 2014. We have an opportunity to drive this higher, encouraging a more rapid shift to the higher speed capabilities offered by our network. And as we open new markets with the CAF II funds, we will introduce broadband areas that have been waiting for this product. Another key strategic initiative for Frontier is the introduction of video service in a number of our existing markets, with a minimal capital outlay. This will leverage our fiber-to-the-node architecture and has become a viable opportunity due to advances in technology regarding video compression and server architecture. This represents an exciting revenue opportunity for Frontier that takes advantage of our increase in scale and a substantial investments that we've already made in our broadband network. We will be growing a new stream of revenue from our existing investments in the network while leveraging our enhanced operational support and billing support systems and our IPTV delivery platform. We believe that offering video service opens the door to attracting new customers to our broadband service while introducing new tools to improve retaining our existing customers. We began this process as we introduced our video service in North Carolina. First on a trial basis in the fourth quarter and now commercially. Our plans are to introduce video service to more than 40 markets, representing approximately 3 million households over a 3- to 4-year period. Once complete, the service will be available to about 50% of the 8.5 million households in Frontier's existing footprints, not counting the pending Verizon acquisition. Including California, Texas and Florida properties, we'll be able to provide our video service to more than 7 million households, and we anticipate additional opportunities as we upgrade select copper markets in the acquired states. This initiative is a direct result of the experience in technology we have gained from Connecticut and the pending California, Texas and Florida acquisition. This video offering will essentially be a product extension, to our already robust network infrastructure. We will utilize extend content relationships and we already have their rights in place to offer video across our footprint. And these rights provide us the flexibility to introduce a variety of bundles and packages that will appeal to a wide spectrum of customer preferences. This endeavor is extremely capital efficient for 2 key reasons. First, we are leveraging a substantial broadband infrastructure investment we have made in our network over the last half-dozen years; and second, our IPTV applications employ the latest their advanced compression technology. television channel will require approximately 2.5 megabits of capacity, meaning a household with HDTVs active at once will only require 10 megabits of capacity into the home, leaving the remainder available for data usage. The capabilities of the latest technology, combined with our increasing scale, make it extremely compelling for Frontier to undertake this initiative now. To enable 1.3 million households to receive video over our existing broadband infrastructure, we'll require total capital spending of less than $150 million spread over several years. That means we can undertake this project within our existing capital budget and current forecast. The rate of our deployment can be very dependent on success. As a result, this is a low-risk undertaking. If the take rates aren't in line with our expeditions, we can adjust our plan accordingly. 
In addition to the direct revenue to Frontier, also consider the scale benefits. With the closing of California, Texas and Florida acquisition, we will have approximately 1.5 million video subscribers, excluding satellite. consider how much larger our video scale could become as we proceed with this initiative increase our penetration across the 3 million additional households. For all the reasons I've discussed, I hope you can see where this is such a strategically significant initiative for Frontier. 
And now, let's discuss our California, Texas and Florida transaction. We're in the final phases of preparing for the closing of the acquisition, which is scheduled for April 1. The integration teams from both sides have been extremely diligent in planning a detailed cut over, with a mutual objective of minimal customer disruptions. As we have previously discussed, our plan is to maintain the existing service plans and go-to-market approach that currently exist in the Verizon markets. We have already adopted them within our resistance and existing various markets. We're in the final stages of our conversion plans. The systems conversions are on track, and we are seeing conversion metrics at or above our expectations for this point in the conversion process. We are executing our training plans excluding a segment of the incoming workforce. All indications are very positive with less than 40 days until the cut over. The entire Frontier organization is focused on having a smooth cutover and a great experience for our new customers. We are excited about the opportunities on our new markets. And as we continue to learn more about these markets and the employees who will be joining us, we believe we will gain a strong position to drive significant benefits for our customers and our stakeholders. As we have moved close to the cutover, we have developed better insight into our cost structure. At this time, I can say with full confidence that we will be in excess of $600 million in day 1 cost synergies, and we are continuing to refine our day 1 cost structure. We will provide an update on our cost structure and initial synergy attainment on our Q1 earnings call. The acceleration of the synergies support our ability to deliver the leveraged free cash flow accretion before for this transaction. 
In summary, I am extremely excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for Frontier. We were on the cost of closing the long anticipated California, Texas and Florida acquisition, to which our entire team has devoted so much time, energy and effort. And we have a compelling low-risk plan to broaden our capabilities across our legacy markets through the video initiative while leveraging the significant investments made for the Verizon integration and our IP platforms to improve our cost structure over time. We appreciate the investment community's ongoing patient and confidence as we execute this transformative acquisition, which is a significantly forward for Frontier. I will now hand the call over to our CFO, John Jureller, who will go into more details on our financial performance."

Frontier reported a loss per common share of $0.14 in the fourth quarter 2015 after dividends on our preferred stock, compared to a loss per common share of $0.07 in the third quarter of 2015 and income of $0.01 per common share in the fou",1626,"Thank you, Dan. Frontier reported a loss per common share of $0.14 in the fourth quarter 2015 after dividends on our preferred stock, compared to a loss per common share of $0.07 in the third quarter of 2015 and income of $0.01 per common share in the fourth quarter 2014. 
Adjusting for dividends on the preferred stock, acquisition-related interest expense, acquisition and integration costs, severance costs and certain tax items, our non-GAAP adjusted net income was $0.05 per share in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $0.03 per share in the third quarter of 2015 and $0.04 per share in the fourth quarter of 2014.
On February 11, the board declared a common dividend of $0.105 per share for the first quarter 2016, payable March 31, in line with a dividend rate of the 4 quarters of 2015. We also will be paying the regularly scheduled dividend on our preferred shares on March 31.
Please turn to Slide 5. Fourth quarter revenue was $1.41 billion as compared to $1.42 billion in the third quarter. Total legacy revenue declined by $4 million, with a decline in voice revenues, partially offset by an increase in video and regulatory revenues. Revenue in Connecticut was $257 million, a sequential decline of about $7 million, primarily due to declines in voice revenue. Customer revenue of $1.21 billion was down $16 million sequentially or negative 1.3%. We experienced a slight increase in the headwind from voice revenue relative to the expectation we had outlined for Q4 revenue.
Total residential customer revenue of $594 million was down $12 million as compared to Q3. We did experience an improvement in Connecticut as we began to migrate customers off the 1 year promotions that were introduced into fourth quarter of 2014, but this benefit was offset by a decline in voice revenue. We should see more of the benefit in this migration in the first quarter.
Business customer revenue was -- of $613 million was down only $4 million sequentially. Total data and Internet services revenue was stable sequentially, with increases in our residential and business broadband services and carrier revenues, offsetting the declines in wireless backhaul revenue. Voice revenue declined slightly more than anticipated, reflecting customer migration to different price plans. Regulatory revenue for the quarter was $206 million, up $5 million sequentially. Our regulatory revenue was reduced by approximately $4 million in the fourth quarter versus expectations because in the process of verifying the CAF II household account divided by the FCC, we found a slightly lower number. This will reduce our CAF II revenue by about $1 million per quarter going forward. 
In the fourth quarter, we recognized the full year impact of this change, which was approximately $4 million.
Residential average revenue per customer, or ARPC, was $63.14 for the fourth quarter of 2015, a decline of 1.1% sequentially. Lower voice revenue of stand-alone and within product bundles was a contributing factor, partially offset by improvements in data and video. Business ARPC was up 0.9% sequentially. The adjusted EBITDA margin for the fourth quarter was 42.5%, which was up 110 basis points from the third quarter level as a result of lower cash operating expenses in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter and the increase in CAF II revenue recognized in the period.
Cash operating expenses of $813 million was slightly lower in the target range that we have outlined for Q4 in November. We do anticipate an increase in operating expense in Q1, driven by seasonal factors such as the usual first quarter increase in payroll tax and some additional headcount. Capital expenditures were $185 million in the fourth quarter, and we spent an additional $52 million in CapEx related to integration activities.
Please turn to Slide 6. Frontier's cash flow remains very healthy. Our adjusted free cash flow was $243 million in the fourth quarter. Our dividend payout ratio, adjusted to exclude the incremental dividends and interest expense on the capital raise for our pending transaction of Verizon was 43% in the fourth quarter, as compared to 46% in the third quarter of 2015 and 52% in the fourth quarter of 2014. We believe that the adjusted dividend payout ratio that excludes the incremental capital cost is appropriate until such time as we complete our transaction as we don't yet have the operating cash flow associated with those capital.
Please turn to Slide 7. Our leverage ratio at the end of Q4 was 3.6x. Frontier's liquidity remains robust. Excluding the restricted cash earmarked for our California, Texas and Florida acquisition, we ended the quarter with approximately $1.7 billion in cash and credit availability. Our debt maturities are well laddered, and at the present time, we don't see any to access the public capital markets for the next couple of years. As we move forward, it's important to reiterate Frontier's capital allocation framework, investing appropriately in our network infrastructures and operations, supporting our current dividend and utilizing excess cash generated to reduce indebtedness and our leverage ratio. 
As Dan outlined earlier, within our capital spending plan, we have the flexibility to shift funds to invest in the deployment of video services and to meet the CAF II obligations. We are comfortable with our leverage level off or approximately 4x that we project after the closing of the Verizon transaction. We are committed to maintaining our liquidity and reducing our leverage over time. We know that there has been some substantial interest in getting an update on the results of the California, Texas and Florida assets we are acquiring. So let me give you a snapshot on a few things. The pro forma adjusted revenues for California, Texas and Florida were approximately $1.4 billion in Q3. Verizon has not yet finalized the full year audited financial statements of that business but has advised us that based upon preliminary information, it's anticipated the pro forma adjusted revenues for the fourth quarter were slightly ahead of Q3. This is a directional indication, and we await final confirmation when Verizon delivers to us the 2015 audited financial statements for the California, Texas and Florida business. 
FiOS data connections increased by approximately 17,000 in Q3 and 18,000 in Q4. Similar to the historical trends, which Verizon has reported, as anticipated, DSL data connections declined by approximately 28,000 in Q3 and 24,000 in Q4. FiOS video connections declined by about 4,000 in Q3 and Q4. These metrics are consistent with Verizon's total results and what we expected. We anticipate providing full year audited results in accordance with our reporting requirements. 
I will review our guidance on Slide 8. Our current plan is to provide full year guidance with a combined operations in May during our Q1 earnings call, following the closing of the California, Texas and Florida acquisition. We are not providing complete guidance for the full year, particularly given how our business will be changing in about 6 short weeks. However, there are a few things for which we can provide some direction. For Q1, we anticipate regulatory revenue to decline by about $46 million, reflecting the ongoing CAF II revenue run rate, partially offset by other items. Regarding cash operating expenses, we have already discussed our expectation that the first quarter cash operating expenses will increase sequentially from Q4. We anticipate the increase to be in the range of $20 million to $25 million. This increase primarily reflects the impact of a step up in payroll taxes, which begins to reverse in Q2, and costs related to headcount that supports our third-party Internet helpdesk revenue. 
Looking forward, the combined Q2 cash operating expenses will include the day 1 -- the benefit of the day 1 cost synergies, which as Dan described, will be in excess of $600 million. 
Capital expenditures for Q1, inclusive of CAF II spending, are anticipated to be a slight increase over Q4, we will provide the full year guidance in may. A full year guidance item that we are providing at this time is with respect to cash income taxes. We estimate the full year cash taxes in a range of $5 million to $15 million. This includes the impact of California, Texas and Florida acquisition, reflects the incremental interest expense for the year, the substantial benefits from the acid-base of step up that is part of the Verizon transaction and the benefit of bonus depreciation extension. Further, given the funded position of our pension plan, we estimate cash pension contributions for 2016 in the $15 million to $25 million range, inclusive of the California, Texas and Florida acquisition. As a reminder, the pension liabilities for the transferring employees will be fully funded by Verizon as part of this transaction. We estimate 2016 interest expense of slightly more than $1.5 billion. This includes the cost of the Term Loan A that will be drawn at quarter end to fund the closing of the California, Texas and Florida acquisition, as well as interest-related to the debt that we will be assuming from Verizon at the closing. Only about 10% of our debt will be floating rate debt following the closing of this transaction, so we continue to have an immaterial exposure to changes in interest rates. In summary, Frontier's Q4 2015 operating results are preparations for the California, Texas and Florida acquisition, our prudent capital investment and expense management all provide a strong cash flow base in a solid financial platform for supporting and investing in our business. We have ample capital to invest in and enhance our competitive infrastructure, service our debt and comfortably sustain our dividend and maintain the dividend payout ratio superior to others in the telecom sector. I will pass the call back to the operator. We will open up the line for questions."

And I guess the second part is, kind of looking past to that, presumably with the incremental cash flow generation you'll have in front of you. There seems to be an awful lot of opportunities in the capital structure looking at some of the early maturity bonds in the 20s or some of the highly discounted bonds looking further out even some of your convertible preferreds. Is it your intention after the deal to kind of going after the capital structure and taking advantage of some of those discounts in the markets with your incremental free cash flow?"

On Connecticut, one of the key issues was that, that we actually changed some of our pricing structures and go-to-market plans to be more Frontier-like in Connecticut on day 1. In this instance, we've done just the opposite. We've adopted the Verizon bundles, products. Including all the bundles that are introduce as of yesterday into the product family. So there really is no chance that there'll be a sudden migration of customers to a different bundle structure, which had a significant ARPC impact. On the operational side, we're taking great pains and steps to stage the cutovers, so that you don't have as much happening in that first night. In fact, the Verizon video cutover a number of days so that we minimize the potential impact that we can back out of any step at any point. So that was probably the biggest single issue that happened on the Connecticut integration that ultimately led to some of the problems, day 1 and in the first month or so. So combining those 2, and I could go through a number of different other additional facts. But those are the 2 biggest selling impacts that will be very, very different between the Verizon transaction and Connecticut.

What we saw in beginning late Q3 and Q4 was the useful trends in our business. We have the product that, for example, on the voice side, what we call, Stay Connected product, which allows spillovers, for example, those in the north that may vacation or go to their winter homes in the South, to maintain their service but at a substantially reduced rate that we keep their port open for broadband. So we maintain them as customers but at a lower ARPC for those periods of time. We see that -- that happens every season. So late Q3, call it, right through mid-Q1. And what we'll see is that ARPC returning in the late Q1 to early Q2 timeframe. So that's a seasonal thing that we see for us. I think some customers, too, put themselves into different bundles does given how they're using their landline versus their mobile service. So it's not a loss of customers as compared to our expectations. It was more of a pricing migration, which is in many ways seasonal in nature. We expect that to return back. As you rightly pointed out, we saw some increase in ARPC from the video migrations, pricing migration that Dan outlined. Recall that we had brought the customer -- pardon me. Existing customers at new customer acquisition pricing beginning late last year. And that was only for a 1 year period. They are now coming off that pricing and a greater cohort comes off that pricing in Q1 and then finally, in Q2. So we will see lift, for example, on the video side or in our double- or triple-play in Connecticut with respect to that migration. So we see some good opportunity in residential ARPC as we transition throughout the quarters of this year."

And there was a small segment of the base that we're inheriting that has that. It appears to us that the individuals that we're taking those scaled-down bundles are really a segment whether you call them core shavers or just people that are looking for unique product. That's a minority in the market. In fact, our research indicates that the propensity for customers to take the full bundle is much higher in these markets even than the national average. So as we look at it, we will have the bundles that are available for the core shavers. It will not be our focus initially as we enter the markets and begin operating the business. We'll support our customers that are on it today.

But you'll see that we'll have probably 3 markets open for sale by that point, and then we'll start accelerating. We feel very good about the margin profile. We would not sell, obviously, a standalone video product. So it's really designed to be a bundled product.

Our tax guidance really benefits from a couple of different things. But 2 substantial things: One was, certainly, the extension of bonus depreciation; but almost even more so was the asset bases step up that we negotiated as part of this transaction. Now both the benefit of that bases step up as well as bonus depreciation certainly continue onto 2017. We are not providing 2017 guidance at this point in time.

First off, on the cost integration. We had a heavy lift in the fourth quarter associated with capital, specifically around standing up a super core network around the country, as well expanding our capabilities for TV Everywhere and video-on-demand, which are new platforms that we'll be able to leverage across all of our video base. So I think you'll see Q1 less heavy from a CapEx perspective, more about OpEx. With do anticipate that there'll be some costs post-close but we're expected to get those out of the business fairly quickly. So I would expect to see a long-term impact from the integration cost. And then as far as Durham goes, some of the initial learnings is that we were locked out in many cases of securing long-term contracts with some of the apartments and condominium owners in the market because we didn't have a video product other than a mini headed that was using satellite, which was not the preferred solution. So in the first several weeks of introducing the product, we've already secured new contracts that would be substantial units right out of the gate.

Today, I'm going to discuss highlights of our fourth quarter; review our accomplishments in 2015; introduce our video strategy, which will be a key focus going forward;",1827,"Good morning, and thank you for joining Frontier's Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. Today, I'm going to discuss highlights of our fourth quarter; review our accomplishments in 2015; introduce our video strategy, which will be a key focus going forward; and update you on our execution plans for the acquisition of Verizon's wireline operations in California, Texas and Florida.
We continued our track record of solid execution in operating our existing business in the fourth quarter and throughout the year, even while committing substantial time and resources to preparing for the California, Texas and Florida acquisition.
Please turn to Slide 3. The fourth quarter represented our 12th consecutive quarter of strong broadband net additions with net additions of 28,500. This extends our continuing trend of very strong progress in broadband with cumulative net additions totaling nearly 350,000 since the beginning of 2012. Our progress continues to be broad-based across our footprint. In the fourth quarter, we, once again, increased our residential broadband penetration in over 75% of the markets we serve. We maintained good momentum in our business segment as well. This was our eighth consecutive quarter of roughly stable sequential results in SME, excluding Connecticut.
2015 was a year of very substantial accomplishments for Frontier. We executed a smooth, successful CEO transition as well as the separation of the CEO and Chairman roles. This will culminate on April 1 in the appointment of an independent, nonexecutive Chairman, Pam Reid, moving us to the covenant structure preferred by many shareholders. In the second and third quarters, we raised all the equity and debt funding required to close the California, Texas and Florida transaction. We completed the regulatory approval process with the final steps being received of the California PCE approval in December. We also are nearly complete with our integration activities and are looking forward to closing in less than 40 days.
In 2015, we completed the integration of our Connecticut property. This included stabilizing the residential customer base after a number of customers migrated to new pricing early in the year. We have invested heavily and continue to improve the network in Connecticut and are focused on introducing higher speeds and video availability to more communities in the state.
Finally, we have transitioned to a normalized of acquisition pricing and market-based video pricing, which will improve our pick and margins over time. Last year, we fulfilled our commitments under the FCC's CAF I program and embarked upon the CAF II program in order to improve our broadband availability to unserved households. John will address this further, but let me say that our plan is to connect or upgrade over 100,000 households utilizing CAF II funding this year. We also continue to improve broadband capabilities elsewhere within our footprint. For example, in Connecticut and other markets, we are in the process of introducing speeds in excess of 100 megabits over copper, sent by our fiber-to-the-node infrastructure. We have been investing to transform our operating support systems, our customer self-service capabilities and our provisioning platforms. We believe these investments will position us well to lower operating expenses from our existing business as we deploy these enhancements and customers begin to adopt the new functionality.
In reviewing 2015, there are areas we have identified where we can do better in the future. We have efforts underway to improve our performance. One significant ongoing pressure we have in our business is the decline of voice, particularly in residential. In fact, this was the reason our customer revenues were slightly short of our expectations in the fourth quarter. While this sectoral headwind will continue, the relative impact of total revenue will decline. We estimate our residential voice revenue run rate will be approaching 15% of revenue pro forma for California, Texas and Florida acquisitions. In Connecticut, we began to experience the benefit of the expiration of promotions introduced into fall of 2014. The benefit was limited in Q4 as the expirations occurred only partway through the period. We anticipate a more significant benefit in the first and second quarters. And as we migrate this cohort of customers off promotional pricing, we haven't experienced a resulting significant increase in churn.
Please turn to Slide 4. As you know, we are in the process of reshaping our business to offer customers enhancements to the broadband products that had become such important parts of their lives. Additional broadband market share growth remains a key initiative for the company. Currently, our percentage of residential broadband penetration is only in the mid-20s. Approximately 50% of broadband activity in Q4 was above the basic speed tier, up from nearly 40% in Q4 2014. We have an opportunity to drive this higher, encouraging a more rapid shift to the higher speed capabilities offered by our network. And as we open new markets with the CAF II funds, we will introduce broadband areas that have been waiting for this product.
Another key strategic initiative for Frontier is the introduction of video service in a number of our existing markets with a minimal capital outlay. This will leverage our fiber-to-the-node architecture and has become a viable opportunity due to advances in technology regarding video compression and server architecture. This represents an exciting revenue opportunity for Frontier, that takes advantage of our increasing scale and the substantial investments that we've already made in our broadband network. We will be growing a new stream of revenue from our existing investments in the network, while leveraging our enhanced operational support and billing support systems and our IPTV delivery platform. We believe that offering video service opens the door to attracting new customers to our broadband service, while introducing new tools to improve retaining existing customers. We began this process as we introduced our video service in North Carolina, first on a trial basis in the fourth quarter and now commercially. Our plans are to introduce video service to more than 40 markets, representing approximately 3 million households over a 3- to 4-year period. Once complete, video service will be available to about 50% of the 8.5 million households in Frontier's existing footprints, not counting the pending Verizon acquisition. Including California, Texas and Florida properties, we would be able to provide our video service to more than 7 million households, and we anticipate additional opportunities as we upgrade select copper markets in the acquired states. This initiative is a direct result of the experience in technology we have gained from Connecticut and the pending California, Texas and Florida acquisition. This video offering will essentially be a product extension running on our already robust network infrastructure. We will utilize existing content relationships, and we already have their rights in place to offer video across our footprint. And these rights provide us the flexibility to introduce a variety of bundles and packages that will appeal to a wide spectrum of customer preferences. This endeavor is extremely capital efficient for 2 key reasons. First, we are leveraging the substantial broadband infrastructure investment we have made in our network over the last half-dozen years; and second, our IPTV applications employ the latest, very advanced compression technology. The HD television channel will require approximately 2.5 megabits of capacity, meaning a household with 4 HDTVs active at once will only require 10 megabits of capacity into the home, leaving the remainder available for data usage. The capabilities of the latest technology, combined with our increasing scale, make it extremely compelling for Frontier to undertake this initiative now. To enable 1.3 million households to receive video over our existing broadband infrastructure, we'll require total capital spending of less than $150 million spread over several years. That means we can undertake this project within our existing capital budget and current forecast. The rate of our deployment can be very depending on success. As a result, this is a low-risk undertaking. If the take rates aren't in line with our expeditions, we can adjust our plan accordingly.
In addition to the direct revenue benefits to Frontier, also consider the scale benefits. With the closing of California, Texas and Florida acquisition, we'll have approximately 1.5 million video subscribers, excluding satellite. Consider how much larger our video scale could become as we proceed with this initiative and increase our penetration across the 3 million additional households. For all the reasons I've discussed, I hope you can see why this is such a strategically significant initiative for Frontier.
And now, let's discuss our California, Texas and Florida transaction. We're in the final phases of preparing for the closing of the acquisition, which is scheduled for April 1. The integration teams from both sides have been extremely diligent in planning a detailed cutover with the mutual objective of minimal customer disruptions. As we have previously discussed, our plan is to maintain the existing service plans and go-to-market approach that currently exist in the Verizon markets. We have already adopted them within our systems and existing FiOs markets. We're in the final stages of our conversion plans. The system conversions are on track, and we are seeing conversion metrics at or above our expectations for this point in the conversion process. We are executing our training plans, including a segment of the incoming workforce. All indications are very positive with less than 40 days until the cutover. The entire Frontier organization is focused on having a smooth cutover and a great experience for our new customers. We are excited about the opportunities in our new markets. And as we continue to learn more about these markets and the employees who will be joining us, we believe we will gain a strong position to drive significant benefits for our customers and our stakeholders. As we have moved close to the cutover, we have developed better insight into our cost structure. At this time, I can say with full confidence that we will be in excess of $600 million in day 1 cost synergies, and we are continuing to refine our day 1 cost structure. We will provide an update on our cost structure and initial synergy attainment on our Q1 earnings call. The acceleration of the synergies support our ability to deliver the leveraged free cash flow accretion before cash for this transaction.
In summary, I am extremely excited about the opportunities that lie at for Frontier. We are on the cusp of closing the long anticipated California, Texas and Florida acquisition, to which our entire team has devoted so much time, energy and effort. And we have a compelling low-risk plan to broaden our capabilities across our legacy markets through the video initiative, while leveraging the significant investments made for the Verizon integration in our IP platforms to improve our cost structure over time. We appreciate the investment community's ongoing patience and confidence as we execute this transformative acquisition, which is a significantly forward for Frontier.
I will now hand the call over to our CFO, John Jureller, who will go into more details on our financial performance."

Frontier reported a loss per common share of $0.14 in the fourth quarter 2015 after dividends on our preferred stock compared to a loss per common share of $0.07 in the third quarter of 2015 and income of $0.01 per common share in the four",1625,"Thank you, Dan. Frontier reported a loss per common share of $0.14 in the fourth quarter 2015 after dividends on our preferred stock compared to a loss per common share of $0.07 in the third quarter of 2015 and income of $0.01 per common share in the fourth quarter 2014. Adjusting for dividends on the preferred stock, acquisition-related interest expense, acquisition and integration costs, severance costs and certain tax items, our non-GAAP adjusted net income was $0.05 per share in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $0.03 per share in the third quarter of 2015 and $0.04 per share in the fourth quarter of 2014.
On February 11, the board declared a common dividend of $0.105 per share for the first quarter of 2016, payable March 31, in line with a dividend rate of the 4 quarters of 2015. We also will be paying the regularly scheduled dividend on our preferred shares on March 31.
Please turn to Slide 5. Fourth quarter revenue was $1.41 billion as compared to $1.42 billion in the third quarter. Total legacy revenue declined by $4 million, with a decline in voice revenues partially offset by an increase in video and regulatory revenues. Revenue in Connecticut was $257 million, a sequential decline of about $7 million, primarily due to declines in voice revenue. Customer revenue of $1.21 billion was down $16 million sequentially or negative 1.3%. We experienced a slight increase in the headwind from voice revenue relative to the expectation we had outlined for Q4 revenue.
The total residential customer revenue of $594 million was down $12 million as compared to Q3. We did experience an improvement in Connecticut as we began to migrate customers off the 1-year promotions that were introduced into fourth quarter of 2014, but this benefit was offset by a decline in voice revenue. We should see more of the benefit in this migration in the first quarter.
Business customer revenue was -- of $613 million was down only $4 million sequentially. Total data and Internet services revenue was stable sequentially, with increases in our residential and business broadband services and carrier revenues offsetting the declines in wireless backhaul revenue. Voice revenue declined slightly more than anticipated, reflecting customer migration to different price plans. Regulatory revenue for the quarter was $206 million, up $5 million sequentially. Our regulatory revenue was reduced by approximately $4 million in the fourth quarter versus expectations because in the process of verifying the CAF II household count provided by the FCC, we found a slightly lower number. This will reduce our CAF II revenue by about $1 million per quarter going forward. In the fourth quarter, we recognized the full year impact of this change, which was approximately $4 million.
Residential average revenue per customer, or ARPC, was $63.14 for the fourth quarter of 2015, a decline of 1.1% sequentially. Lower voice revenue of stand-alone and within product bundles was a contributing factor, partially offset by improvements in data and video. Business ARPC was up 0.9% sequentially. The adjusted EBITDA margin for the fourth quarter was 42.5%, which was up 110 basis points from the third quarter level as a result of lower cash operating expenses in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter and the increase in CAF II revenue recognized in the period.
Cash operating expenses of $813 million was slightly lower than the target range we had outlined for Q4 in November. We do anticipate an increase in operating expense in Q1, driven by seasonal factors, such as the usual first quarter increase in payroll tax and some additional headcount. Capital expenditures were $185 million in the fourth quarter, and we spent an additional $52 million in CapEx related to integration activities.
Please turn to Slide 6. Frontier's cash flow remains very healthy. Our adjusted free cash flow was $243 million in the fourth quarter. Our dividend payout ratio, adjusted to exclude the incremental dividends and interest expense on the capital raised for our pending transaction with Verizon, was 43% in the fourth quarter as compared to 46% in the third quarter of 2015 and 52% in the fourth quarter of 2014. We believe that the adjusted dividend payout ratio, that excludes the incremental capital cost, is appropriate until such time as we complete our transaction as we don't yet have the operating cash flow associated with those capital.
Please turn to Slide 7. Our leverage ratio at the end of Q4 was 3.6x. Frontier's liquidity remains robust. Excluding the restricted cash earmarked for our California, Texas and Florida acquisition, we ended the quarter with approximately $1.7 billion in cash and credit availability. Our debt maturities are well laddered, and at the present time, we don't see a need to access the public capital markets for the next couple of years. As we move forward, it's important to reiterate Frontier's capital allocation framework, investing appropriately in our network infrastructure and operations, supporting our current dividend and utilizing excess cash generated to reduce indebtedness and our leverage ratio.
As Dan outlined earlier, within our capital spending plan, we have the flexibility to shift funds to invest in the deployment of video services and to meet the CAF II obligations. We are comfortable with a leverage level off or approximately 4x that we project after the closing of the Verizon transaction. We are committed to maintaining our liquidity and reducing our leverage over time. We know that there has been some substantial interest in getting an update on the results of the California, Texas and Florida assets we are acquiring. So let me give you a snapshot on a few things. The pro forma adjusted revenues for California, Texas and Florida were approximately $1.4 billion in Q3. Verizon has not yet finalized the full year audited financial statements of that business, but has advised us that based upon preliminary information, it's anticipated that the pro forma-adjusted revenues for the fourth quarter were slightly ahead of Q3. This is a directional indication, and we await final confirmation when Verizon delivers to us the 2015 audited financial statements for the California, Texas and Florida business.
FiOS data connections increased by approximately 17,000 in Q3 and 18,000 in Q4. Similar to the historical trends, which Verizon has reported, as anticipated, DSL data connections declined by approximately 28,000 in Q3 and 24,000 in Q4. FiOS video connections declined by about 4,000 in Q3 and Q4. These metrics are consistent with Verizon's total results and what we expected. We anticipate providing full year audited results in accordance with our reporting requirements.
I will review our guidance on Slide 8. Our current plan is to provide full year guidance with combined operations in May during our Q1 earnings call, following the closing of the California, Texas and Florida acquisition. We are not providing complete guidance for the full year, particularly given how our business will be changing in about 6 short weeks. However, there are a few things for which we can provide some direction. For Q1, we anticipate regulatory revenue to decline by about $46 million, reflecting the ongoing CAF II revenue run rate, partially offset by other items. Regarding cash operating expenses, we have already discussed our expectation that the first quarter cash operating expenses will increase sequentially from Q4. We anticipate the increase to be in the range of $20 million to $25 million. This increase primarily reflects the impact of a step up in payroll taxes, which begins to reverse in Q2, and costs related to headcount that supports our third-party Internet helpdesk revenue.
Looking forward, the combined Q2 cash operating expenses will include the day 1 -- the benefit of the day 1 cost synergies, which, as Dan described, will be in excess of $600 million.
Capital expenditures for Q1, inclusive of CAF II spending, are anticipated to be a slight increase over Q4; we will provide the full year guidance in may. A full year guidance item that we are providing at this time is with respect to cash income taxes. We estimate the full year cash taxes in a range of $5 million to $15 million. This includes the impact of California, Texas and Florida acquisition, reflects the incremental interest expense for the year, the substantial benefits from the acid-bases step up that is part of the Verizon transaction and the benefit of bonus depreciation extension.
Further, given the funded position of our pension plan, we estimate cash pension contributions for 2016 in the $15 million to $25 million range, inclusive of the California, Texas and Florida acquisition. As a reminder, the pension liabilities for the transferring employees will be fully funded by Verizon as part of this transaction. We estimate 2016 interest expense of slightly more than $1.5 billion. This includes the cost of the term loan A that will be drawn at quarter end to fund the closing of the California, Texas and Florida acquisition as well as interest-related to the debt that we will be assuming from Verizon at the closing. Only about 10% of our debt will be floating rate debt following the closing of this transaction, so we continue to have an immaterial exposure to changes in interest rates. In summary, Frontier's Q4 2015 operating results are preparations for the California, Texas and Florida acquisition, our prudent capital investments and expense management all provide a strong cash flow base in a solid financial platform for supporting and investing in our business. We have ample capital to invest in and enhance our competitive infrastructure, service our debt and comfortably sustain our dividend and maintain the dividend payout ratio superior to others in the telecom sector.

And I guess the second part is, kind of looking past to that, presumably with the incremental cash flow generation you'll have in front of you, there seems to be an awful lot of opportunities in the capital structure looking at some of the early maturity bonds in the 20s or some of the highly discounted bonds looking further out even some of your convertible preferred. Is it your intention after the deal to kind of start going after the capital structure and taking advantage of some of those discounts in the market with your incremental free cash flow?"

On Connecticut, one of the key issues was that we actually changed some of our pricing structures and go-to-market plans to be more Frontier-like in Connecticut on day 1. In this instance, we've done just the opposite. We've adopted the Verizon bundles, products, including all the bundles that are introduced as of yesterday into the product family. So there really is no chance that there'll be a sudden migration of customers to a different bundle structure, which had the significant ARPC impact. On the operational side, we've have taken great pains and steps to stage the cutovers, so that we don't have as much happening that first night. In fact, the Verizon video cutover will take place over a number of days, so that we minimize the potential impact, and we can back out of any step at any point. So that was probably the biggest single issue that happened on the Connecticut integration that ultimately led to some of the problems, day 1 and in the first month or so. So combining those 2, and I could go through a number of different other additional facts, but those are the 2 biggest sale impacts that will be very, very different between the Verizon transaction and Connecticut. And as we execute on the Verizon, I think you'll see a very smooth transition and no impact like we saw in Connecticut."

What we saw in beginning of late Q3 and Q4 was the usual trends in our business. We have a product that, for example, on the voice side, what we call, our Stay Connected product, which allows snowbirds, for example, those in the north, that may vacation or go to their winter homes in the South, to maintain their service, but at a substantially reduced rate that we keep their port open for broadband. So we maintain them as customers, but at a lower ARPC for those periods of time. We see that -- that happens every season. So late Q3, call it, right through mid-Q1. And what you'll see is that ARPC returning in the late Q1 to early Q2 timeframe. So that's a seasonal thing that we see for us. I think some customers, too, have put themselves into different bundles, just given how they're using their landline versus their mobile service. So it's not a loss of customers as compared to our expectations, it was more of a pricing migration, which is, in many ways, seasonal in nature. We expect that to return back. As you rightly pointed out, we saw some increase in ARPC from the video migrations, pricing migration that Dan outlined. Recall that we had brought new customer -- pardon me, existing customers at new customer acquisition pricing beginning late last year. And that was only for a 1-year period. They're now coming off that pricing and a greater cohort comes off that pricing in Q1 and then finally in Q2. So we will see lift, for example, on the video side or in our double- and triple-play in Connecticut with respect to that migration. So we see some good opportunity in residential ARPC as we transition throughout the quarters of this year."

And there is a small segment of the base, that we're inheriting, that has that. It appears to us that the individuals, that we're taking those scaled-down bundles, are really a segment, whether you call them cord shavers or just people that are looking for unique product, that's a minority in the market. In fact, our research indicates that the propensity for customers to take the full bundle is much higher in these markets even than the national average. So as we look at it, we will have the bundles that are available for the cord shavers. It will not be our focus initially as we enter the markets and begin operating the business. We'll support all the customers that are on it today. And then as we gain more intimacy in the market, I think you'll see us target different segments with those bundles where it makes sense, but still offer a pretty attractive feature-rich, linear video bundle."

But you'll see that we'll have probably 3 markets open for sale by that point, and then we'll start accelerating. We feel very good about the margin profile. We would not sell, obviously, a standalone video product. So it's really designed to be a bundled product.

Now both the benefit of that bases step-up as well as bonus depreciation certainly continue onto 2017. We are not providing 2017 guidance at this point in time.

First off, on the cost integration. We had a heavy lift in the fourth quarter associated with capital, specifically around standing up a super cord network around the country as well expanding our capabilities for TV Everywhere and video-on-demand, which are new platforms that we'll be able to leverage across all of our video base. So I think you'll see Q1 less heavy from a CapEx perspective, more about OpEx. We do anticipate that there'll be some costs post-close but we're expected to get those out of the business fairly quickly. So I wouldn't expect to see a long-term impact from the integration cost. And then as far as Durham goes, some of the initial learnings are that we were locked out in many cases of securing long-term contracts with some of the apartments and condominium owners in the market because we didn't have a video product other than a mini headend that was using satellite, which was not the preferred solution. So in the first several weeks of introducing the product, we've already secured new contracts that would be substantial units right out of the gate. Our door-to-door sales process has been very successful so far, but we're in the early days. It's only been really about a month or so.

The entire company remains intensely focused on increasing shareholder values, and we believe we have significant opportunities ahead of us. So thank you for joining us on our call today, and we look forward to updating you again on the first quarter call."

Today, I'm going to discuss highlights of our fourth quarter; review our accomplishments in 2015; introduce our video strategy, which will be a key focus going forward;",1831,"Good morning, and thank you for joining Frontier's Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. Today, I'm going to discuss highlights of our fourth quarter; review our accomplishments in 2015; introduce our video strategy, which will be a key focus going forward; and update you on our execution plans for the acquisition of Verizon's wireline operations in California, Texas and Florida.
We continued our track record of solid execution in operating our existing business in the fourth quarter and throughout the year, even while committing substantial time and resources to preparing for the California, Texas and Florida acquisition.
Please turn to Slide 3. The fourth quarter represented our 12th consecutive quarter of strong broadband net additions with net additions of 28,500. This extends our continuing trend of very strong progress in broadband with cumulative net additions totaling nearly 350,000 since the beginning of 2012. Our progress continues to be broad-based across our footprint. In the fourth quarter, we once again, increased our residential broadband penetration in over 75% of the markets we serve. We maintained good momentum in our business segment as well. This was our eighth consecutive quarter of roughly stable sequential results in SME, excluding Connecticut.
2015 was a year of very substantial accomplishments for Frontier. We executed a smooth, successful CEO transition as well as the separation of the CEO and Chairman roles. This will culminate on April 1 in the appointment of an independent, nonexecutive Chairman, Pam Reeve, moving us to the covenant structure preferred by many shareholders. In the second and third quarters, we raised all the equity and debt funding required to close the California, Texas and Florida transaction. We completed the regulatory approval process with the final steps being receipt of the California PUC approval in December. We also are nearly complete with our integration activities and are looking forward to closing in less than 40 days.
In 2015, we completed the integration of our Connecticut property. This included stabilizing the residential customer base after a number of customers migrated to new pricing early in the year. We have invested heavily and continue to improve the network in Connecticut and are focused on introducing higher speeds and video availability to more communities in the state.
Finally, we have transitioned to a normalized rhythm of acquisition pricing and market-based video pricing, which will improve our pick and margins over time. Last year, we fulfilled our commitments under the FCC's CAF I program and embarked upon the CAF II program in order to improve our broadband availability to unserved households. John will address this further, but let me say that our plan is to connect or upgrade over 100,000 households utilizing CAF II funding this year. We also continue to improve broadband capabilities elsewhere within our footprint. For example, in Connecticut and other markets, we are in the process of introducing speeds in excess of 100 megabits over copper, sent by our fiber-to-the-node infrastructure. We have been investing to transform our operating support systems, our customer self-service capabilities and our provisioning platforms. We believe these investments will position us well to lower operating expenses from our existing business as we deploy these enhancements and customers begin to adopt the new functionality.
In reviewing 2015, there are areas we have identified where we can do better in the future. We have efforts underway to improve our performance. One significant ongoing pressure we have in our business is the decline of voice, particularly in residential. In fact, this was the reason our customer revenues were slightly short of our expectations in the fourth quarter. While this sectoral headwind will continue, the relative impact of total revenue will decline. We estimate our residential voice revenue run rate will be approaching 15% of revenue pro forma for California, Texas and Florida acquisitions. In Connecticut, we began to experience the benefit of the expiration of promotions introduced in the fall of 2014. The benefit was limited in Q4 as the expirations occurred only partway through the period. We anticipate a more significant benefit in the first and second quarters. And as we migrate this cohort of customers off promotional pricing, we haven't experienced a resulting significant increase in churn.
Please turn to Slide 4. As you know, we are in the process of reshaping our business to offer customers enhancements to the broadband products that had become such important parts of their lives. Additional broadband market share growth remains a key initiative for the company. Currently, our percentage of residential broadband penetration is only in the mid-20s. Approximately 50% of broadband activity in Q4 was above the basic speed tier, up from nearly 40% in Q4 2014. We have an opportunity to drive this higher, encouraging a more rapid shift to the higher speed capabilities offered by our network. And as we open new markets with the CAF II funds, we will introduce broadband areas that have been waiting for this product.
Another key strategic initiative for Frontier is the introduction of video service in a number of our existing markets with a minimal capital outlay. This will leverage our fiber-to-the-node architecture and has become a viable opportunity due to advances in technology regarding video compression and server architecture. This represents an exciting revenue opportunity for Frontier, that takes advantage of our increasing scale and the substantial investments that we've already made in our broadband network. We will be growing a new stream of revenue from our existing investments in the network, while leveraging our enhanced operational support and billing support systems and our IPTV delivery platform. We believe that offering video service opens the door to attracting new customers to our broadband service, while introducing new tools to improve retaining existing customers. We began this process as we introduced our video service in Durham,  North Carolina, first on a trial basis in the fourth quarter and now commercially. Our plans are to introduce video service to more than 40 markets, representing approximately 3 million households over a 3- to 4-year period. Once complete, video service will be available to about 50% of the 8.5 million households in Frontier's existing footprints, not counting the pending Verizon acquisition. Including California, Texas and Florida properties, we would be able to provide our video service to more than 7 million households, and we anticipate additional opportunities as we upgrade select copper markets in the acquired states. This initiative is a direct result of the experience in technology we have gained from Connecticut and the pending California, Texas and Florida acquisition. This video offering will essentially be a product extension running on our already robust network infrastructure. We will utilize existing content relationships, and we already have their rights in place to offer video across our footprint. And these rights provide us the flexibility to introduce a variety of bundles and packages that will appeal to a wide spectrum of customer preferences. This endeavor is extremely capital efficient for 2 key reasons. First, we are leveraging the substantial broadband infrastructure investment we have made in our network over the last half-dozen years; and second, our IPTV applications employ the latest, very advanced compression technology. The HD television channel will require approximately 2.5 megabits of capacity, meaning a household with 4 HDTVs active at once will only require 10 megabits of capacity into the home, leaving the remainder available for data usage. The capabilities of the latest technology, combined with our increasing scale, make it extremely compelling for Frontier to undertake this initiative now. To enable 1.3 million households to receive video over our existing broadband infrastructure, we'll require total capital spending of less than $150 million spread over several years. That means we can undertake this project within our existing capital budget and current forecast. The rate of our deployment can be varied depending on success. As a result, this is a low-risk undertaking. If the take rates aren't in line with our expeditions, we can adjust our plan accordingly.
In addition to the direct revenue benefits to Frontier, also consider the scale benefits. With the closing of California, Texas and Florida acquisition, we'll have approximately 1.5 million video subscribers, excluding satellite. Consider how much larger our video scale could become as we proceed with this initiative and increase our penetration across the 3 million additional households. For all the reasons I've discussed, I hope you can see why this is such a strategically significant initiative for Frontier.
And now, let's discuss our California, Texas and Florida transaction. We're in the final phases of preparing for the closing of the acquisition, which is scheduled for April 1. The integration teams from both sides have been extremely diligent in planning a detailed cutover with the mutual objective of minimal customer disruptions. As we have previously discussed, our plan is to maintain the existing service plans and go-to-market approach that currently exist in the Verizon markets. We have already adopted them within our systems and existing FiOS markets. We're in the final stages of our conversion plans. The system conversions are on track, and we are seeing conversion metrics at or above our expectations for this point in the conversion process. We are executing our training plans, including a segment of the incoming workforce. All indications are very positive with less than 40 days until the cutover. The entire Frontier organization is focused on having a smooth cutover and a great experience for our new customers. We are excited about the opportunities in our new markets. And as we continue to learn more about these markets and the employees who will be joining us, we believe we will be in a strong position to drive significant benefits for our customers and our stakeholders. As we have moved close to the cutover, we have developed better insight into our cost structure. At this time, I can say with full confidence that we will be in excess of $600 million in day 1 cost synergies, and we are continuing to refine our day 1 cost structure. We will provide an update on our cost structure and initial synergy attainment on our Q1 earnings call. The acceleration of the synergies support our ability to deliver the leveraged free cash flow accretion we forecasted for this transaction.
In summary, I am extremely excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for Frontier. We are on the cusp of closing the long anticipated California, Texas and Florida acquisition, to which our entire team has devoted so much time, energy and effort. And we have a compelling low-risk plan to broaden our capabilities across our legacy markets through the video initiative, while leveraging the significant investments made for the Verizon integration in our IP platforms to improve our cost structure over time. We appreciate the investment community's ongoing patience and confidence as we execute this transformative acquisition, which is a significantly forward for Frontier.
I will now hand the call over to our CFO, John Jureller, who will go into more details on our financial performance."

Frontier reported a loss per common share of $0.14 in the fourth quarter 2015 after dividends on our preferred stock compared to a loss per common share of $0.07 in the third quarter of 2015 and income of $0.01 per common share in the fourth quarter 2014. Adjusting for dividends on the preferred stock, acquisition-related interest expense, acquisition and integration costs, severance costs and certain tax items, our non-GAAP adjusted net income was $0.05 per share in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $0.03 per share in the third quarter of 2015 and $0.04 per share in the fourth quarter of 2014.
On February 11, the board declared a common dividend of $0.105 per share for the first quarter of 2016, payable March 31, in line with a dividend rate of the 4 quarters of 2015. We also will be paying the regularly scheduled dividend on our preferred shares on March 31.
Please turn to Slide 5. Fourth quarter revenue was $1.41 billion as compared to $1.42 billion in the third quarter. Total legacy revenue declined by $4 million, with a decline in voice revenues partially offset by an increase in video and regulatory revenues. Revenue in Connecticut was $257 million, a sequential decline of about $7 million, primarily due to declines in voice revenue. Customer revenue of $1.21 billion was down $16 million sequentially or negative 1.3%. We experienced a slight increase in the headwind from voice revenue relative to the expectation we had outlined for Q4 revenue.
The total residential customer revenue of $594 million was down $12 million as compared to Q3. We did experience an improvement in Connecticut as we began to migrate customers off the 1-year promotions that were introduced in the fourth quarter of 2014, but this benefit was offset by a decline in voice revenue. We should see more of the benefit in this migration in the first quarter.
Business customer revenue was -- of $613 million was down only $4 million sequentially. Total data and Internet services revenue was stable sequentially, with increases in our residential and business broadband services and carrier revenues offsetting the declines in wireless backhaul revenue. Voice revenue declined slightly more than anticipated, reflecting customer migration to different price plans. Regulatory revenue for the quarter was $206 million, up $5 million sequentially. Our regulatory revenue was reduced by approximately $4 million in the fourth quarter versus expectations because in the process of verifying the CAF II household count provided by the FCC, we found a slightly lower number. This will reduce our CAF II revenue by about $1 million per quarter going forward. In the fourth quarter, we recognized the full year impact of this change, which was approximately $4 million.
Residential average revenue per customer, or ARPC, was $63.14 for the fourth quarter of 2015, a decline of 1.1% sequentially. Lower voice revenue of stand-alone and within product bundles was a contributing factor, partially offset by improvements in data and video. Business ARPC was up 0.9% sequentially. The adjusted EBITDA margin for the fourth quarter was 42.5%, which was up 110 basis points from the third quarter level as a result of lower cash operating expenses in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter and the increase in CAF II revenue recognized in the period.
Cash operating expenses of $813 million was slightly lower than the target range we had outlined for Q4 in November. We do anticipate an increase in operating expense in Q1, driven by seasonal factors, such as the usual first quarter increase in payroll tax and some additional headcount. Capital expenditures were $185 million in the fourth quarter, and we spent an additional $52 million in CapEx related to integration activities.
Please turn to Slide 6. Frontier's cash flow remains very healthy. Our adjusted free cash flow was $243 million in the fourth quarter. Our dividend payout ratio, adjusted to exclude the incremental dividends and interest expense on the capital raised for our pending transaction with Verizon, was 43% in the fourth quarter as compared to 46% in the third quarter of 2015 and 52% in the fourth quarter of 2014. We believe that the adjusted dividend payout ratio, that excludes the incremental capital cost, is appropriate until such time as we complete our transaction as we don't yet have the operating cash flow associated with this capital.
Please turn to Slide 7. Our leverage ratio at the end of Q4 was 3.6x. Frontier's liquidity remains robust. Excluding the restricted cash earmarked for our California, Texas and Florida acquisition, we ended the quarter with approximately $1.7 billion in cash and credit availability. Our debt maturities are well laddered, and at the present time, we don't see a need to access the public capital markets for the next couple of years. As we move forward, it's important to reiterate Frontier's capital allocation framework, investing appropriately in our network infrastructure and operations, supporting our current dividend and utilizing excess cash generated to reduce indebtedness and our leverage ratio.
As Dan outlined earlier, within our capital spending plan, we have the flexibility to shift funds to invest in the deployment of video services and to meet the CAF II obligations. We are comfortable with a leverage level of approximately 4x that we project after the closing of the Verizon transaction. We are committed to maintaining our liquidity and reducing our leverage over time. We know that there has been some substantial interest in getting an update on the results of the California, Texas and Florida assets we are acquiring. So let me give you a snapshot on a few things. The pro forma adjusted revenues for California, Texas and Florida were approximately $1.4 billion in Q3. Verizon has not yet finalized the full year audited financial statements of that business, but has advised us that based upon preliminary information, it's anticipated that the pro forma-adjusted revenues for the fourth quarter were slightly ahead of Q3. This is a directional indication, and we await final confirmation when Verizon delivers to us the 2015 audited financial statements for the California, Texas and Florida business.
FiOS data connections increased by approximately 17,000 in Q3 and 18,000 in Q4. Similar to the historical trends, which Verizon has reported, as anticipated, DSL data connections declined by approximately 28,000 in Q3 and 24,000 in Q4. FiOS video connections declined by about 4,000 in Q3 and Q4. These metrics are consistent with Verizon's total results and what we expected. We anticipate providing full year audited results in accordance with our reporting requirements.
I will review our guidance on Slide 8. Our current plan is to provide full year guidance with combined operations in May during our Q1 earnings call, following the closing of the California, Texas and Florida acquisition. We are not providing complete guidance for the full year, particularly given how our business will be changing in about 6 short weeks. However, there are a few things for which we can provide some direction. For Q1, we anticipate regulatory revenue to decline by about $46 million, reflecting the ongoing CAF II revenue run rate, partially offset by other items. Regarding cash operating expenses, we have already discussed our expectation that the first quarter cash operating expenses will increase sequentially from Q4. We anticipate the increase to be in the range of $20 million to $25 million. This increase primarily reflects the impact of a step up in payroll taxes, which begins to reverse in Q2, and costs related to headcount that supports our third-party Internet helpdesk revenue.
Looking forward, the combined Q2 cash operating expenses will include the day 1 -- the benefit of the day 1 cost synergies, which, as Dan described, will be in excess of $600 million.
Capital expenditures for Q1, inclusive of CAF II spending, are anticipated to be a slight increase over Q4; we will provide the full year guidance on CapEx in May. A full year guidance item that we are providing at this time is with respect to cash income taxes. We estimate the full year cash taxes in a range of $5 million to $15 million. This includes the impact of California, Texas and Florida acquisition, reflects the incremental interest expense for the year, the substantial benefits from the acid-bases step up that is part of the Verizon transaction and the benefit of bonus depreciation extension.
Further, given the funded position of our pension plan, we estimate cash pension contributions for 2016 in the $15 million to $25 million range, inclusive of the California, Texas and Florida acquisition. As a reminder, the pension liabilities for the transferring employees will be fully funded by Verizon as part of this transaction. We estimate 2016 interest expense of slightly more than $1.5 billion. This includes the cost of the term loan A that will be drawn at quarter end to fund the closing of the California, Texas and Florida acquisition as well as interest-related to the debt that we will be assuming from Verizon at the closing. Only about 10% of our debt will be floating rate debt following the closing of this transaction, so we continue to have an immaterial exposure to changes in interest rates. In summary, Frontier's Q4 2015 operating results are preparations for the California, Texas and Florida acquisition, our prudent capital investments and expense management all provide a strong cash flow base in a solid financial platform for supporting and investing in our business. We have ample capital to invest in and enhance our competitive infrastructure, service our debt and comfortably sustain our dividend and maintain the dividend payout ratio superior to others in the telecom sector.

And I guess the second part is, kind of looking past that, presumably with the incremental cash flow generation you'll have in front of you, there seems to be an awful lot of opportunities in the capital structure looking at some of the early maturity bonds in the 20s or some of the highly discounted bonds looking further out even some of your convertible preferred. Is it your intention after the deal to kind of start going after the capital structure and taking advantage of some of those discounts in the market with your incremental free cash flow?"

On Connecticut, one of the key issues was that we actually changed some of our pricing structures and go-to-market plans to be more Frontier-like in Connecticut on day 1. In this instance, we've gone just the opposite. We've adopted the Verizon bundles, products, including all the bundles that are introduced as of yesterday into the product family. So there really is no chance that there'll be a sudden migration of customers to a different bundle structure, which had the significant ARPC impact. On the operational side, we've have taken great pains and steps to stage the cutovers, so that we don't have as much happening that first night. In fact, the Verizon video cutover will take place over a number of days, so that we minimize the potential impact, and we can back out of any step at any point. So that was probably the biggest single issue that happened on the Connecticut integration that ultimately led to some of the problems, day 1 and in the first month or so. So combining those 2, and I could go through a number of different other additional facts, but those are the 2 biggest sale impacts that will be very, very different between the Verizon transaction and Connecticut. And as we execute on the Verizon, I think you'll see a very smooth transition and no impact like we saw in Connecticut."

What we saw in beginning of late Q3 and Q4 was the usual trends in our business. We have a product that, for example, on the voice side, what we call, our Stay Connected product, which allows snowbirds, for example, those in the north, that may vacation or go to their winter homes in the South, to maintain their service, but at a substantially reduced rate that we keep their port open for broadband. So we maintain them as customers, but at a lower ARPC for those periods of time. We see that -- that happens every season. So late Q3, call it, right through mid-Q1. And what you'll see is that ARPC returning in the late Q1 to early Q2 timeframe. So that's a seasonal thing that we see for us. I think some customers, too, have put themselves into different bundles, just given how they're using their landline versus their mobile service. So it's not a loss of customers as compared to our expectations, it was more of a pricing migration, which is, in many ways, seasonal in nature. We expect that to return back. As you rightly pointed out, we saw some increase in ARPC from the video migrations, pricing migration that Dan outlined. Recall that we had brought new customer -- pardon me, existing customers at new customer acquisition pricing beginning late last year. And that was only for a 1-year period. They're now coming off that pricing and a greater cohort comes off that pricing in Q1 and then finally in Q2. So we will see lift, for example, on the video side or in our double- and triple-play in Connecticut with respect to that migration. So we see some good opportunity in residential ARPC as we transition throughout the quarters of this year."

And there is a small segment of the base, that we're inheriting, that has that. It appears to us that the individuals, that we're taking those scaled-down bundles, are really a segment, whether you call them cord shavers or just people that are looking for unique product, that's a minority in the market. In fact, our research indicates that the propensity for customers to take the full bundle is much higher in these markets even than the national average. So as we look at it, we will have the bundles that are available for the cord shavers. It will not be our focus initially as we enter the markets and begin operating the business. We'll support all the customers that are on it today. And then as we gain more intimacy in the market, I think you'll see us target different segments with those bundles where it makes sense, but still offer a pretty attractive feature-rich, linear video bundle."

But you'll see that we'll have probably 3 markets open for sale by that point, and then we'll start accelerating. We feel very good about the margin profile. We would not sell, obviously, a standalone video product. So it's really designed to be a bundled product.

Now both the benefit of that bases step-up as well as bonus depreciation certainly continue onto 2017. We are not providing 2017 guidance at this point in time.

First off, on the cost integration. We had a heavy lift in the fourth quarter associated with capital, specifically around standing up a super cord network around the country as well as expanding our capabilities for TV Everywhere and video-on-demand, which are new platforms that we'll be able to leverage across all of our video base. So I think you'll see Q1 less heavy from a CapEx perspective, more about OpEx. We do anticipate that there'll be some costs post-close but we're expected to get those out of the business fairly quickly. So I wouldn't expect to see a long-term impact from the integration cost. And then as far as Durham goes, some of the initial learnings are that we were locked out in many cases of securing long-term contracts with some of the apartments and condominium owners in the market because we didn't have a video product other than a mini headend that was using satellite, which was not the preferred solution. So in the first several weeks of introducing the product, we've already secured new contracts that would be substantial units right out of the gate. Our door-to-door sales process has been very successful so far, but we're in the early days. It's only been really about a month or so.

Today, I'm going to discuss highlights of our fourth quarter; review our accomplishments in 2015; introduce our video strategy, which will be a key focus going forward;",1833,"Good morning, and thank you for joining Frontier's Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. Today, I'm going to discuss highlights of our fourth quarter; review our accomplishments in 2015; introduce our video strategy, which will be a key focus going forward; and update you on our execution plans for the acquisition of Verizon's wireline operations in California, Texas and Florida.
We continued our track record of solid execution in operating our existing business in the fourth quarter and throughout the year, even while committing substantial time and resources to preparing for the California, Texas and Florida acquisition.
Please turn to Slide 3. The fourth quarter represented our 12th consecutive quarter of strong broadband net additions with net additions of 28,500. This extends our continuing trend of very strong progress in broadband with cumulative net additions totaling nearly 350,000 since the beginning of 2012. Our progress continues to be broad-based across our footprint. In the fourth quarter, we once again, increased our residential broadband penetration in over 75% of the markets we serve. We maintained good momentum in our business segment as well. This was our eighth consecutive quarter of roughly stable sequential results in SME, excluding Connecticut.
2015 was a year of very substantial accomplishments for Frontier. We executed a smooth, successful CEO transition as well as the separation of the CEO and Chairman roles. This will culminate on April 1 in the appointment of an independent, nonexecutive Chairman, Pam Reeve, moving us to the governance structure preferred by many shareholders. In the second and third quarters, we raised all the equity and debt funding required to close the California, Texas and Florida transaction. We completed the regulatory approval process with the final steps being the receipt of the California PUC approval in December. We also are nearly complete with our integration activities and are looking forward to closing in less than 40 days.
In 2015, we completed the integration of our Connecticut property. This included stabilizing the residential customer base after a number of customers migrated to new pricing early in the year. We have invested heavily and continue to improve the network in Connecticut and are focused on introducing higher speeds and video availability to more communities in the state.
Finally, we have transitioned to a normalized rhythm of acquisition pricing and market-based video pricing, which will improve our pick and margins over time. Last year, we fulfilled our commitments under the FCC's CAF I program and embarked upon the CAF II program in order to improve our broadband availability to unserved households. John will address this further, but let me say that our plan is to connect or upgrade over 100,000 households utilizing CAF II funding this year. We also continue to improve broadband capabilities elsewhere within our footprint. For example, in Connecticut and other markets, we are in the process of introducing speeds in excess of 100 megabits over copper, sent by our fiber-to-the-node infrastructure. We have been investing to transform our operating support systems, our customer self-service capabilities and our provisioning platforms. We believe these investments will position us well to lower operating expenses from our existing business as we deploy these enhancements and customers begin to adopt the new functionality.
In reviewing 2015, there are areas we have identified where we can do better in the future. We have efforts underway to improve our performance. One significant ongoing pressure we have in our business is the decline of voice, particularly in residential. In fact, this was the reason our customer revenues were slightly short of our expectations in the fourth quarter. While this secular headwind will continue, the relative impact on total revenue will decline. We estimate our residential voice revenue run rate will be approaching 15% of revenue pro forma for California, Texas and Florida acquisitions. In Connecticut, we began to experience the benefit of the expiration of promotions introduced in the fall of 2014. The benefit was limited in Q4 as the expirations occurred only partway through the period. We anticipate a more significant benefit in the first and second quarters. And as we migrate this cohort of customers off promotional pricing, we haven't experienced a resulting significant increase in churn.
Please turn to Slide 4. As you know, we are in the process of reshaping our business to offer customers enhancements to the broadband products that had become such important parts of their lives. Additional broadband market share growth remains a key initiative for the company. Currently, our percentage of residential broadband penetration is only in the mid-20s. Approximately 50% of broadband activity in Q4 was above the basic speed tier, up from nearly 40% in Q4 2014. We have an opportunity to drive this higher, encouraging a more rapid shift to the higher speed capabilities offered by our network. And as we open new markets with the CAF II funds, we will introduce broadband areas that have been waiting for this product.
Another key strategic initiative for Frontier is the introduction of video service in a number of our existing markets with a minimal capital outlay. This will leverage our fiber-to-the-node architecture and has become a viable opportunity due to advances in technology regarding video compression and server architecture. This represents an exciting revenue opportunity for Frontier that takes advantage of our increasing scale and the substantial investments that we've already made in our broadband network. We will be growing a new stream of revenue from our existing investments in the network, while leveraging our enhanced operational support and billing support systems and our IPTV delivery platform. We believe that offering video service opens the door to attracting new customers to our broadband service, while introducing new tools to improve retaining existing customers. We began this process as we introduced our video service in Durham,  North Carolina, first on a trial basis in the fourth quarter and now commercially. Our plans are to introduce video service to more than 40 markets, representing approximately 3 million households over a 3- to 4-year period. Once complete, video service will be available to about 50% of the 8.5 million households in Frontier's existing footprint, not counting the pending Verizon acquisition. 
Including California, Texas and Florida properties, we would be able to provide our video service to more than 7 million households, and we anticipate additional opportunities as we upgrade select copper markets in the acquired states. This initiative is a direct result of the experience in technology we have gained from Connecticut and the pending California, Texas and Florida acquisition. This video offering will essentially be a product extension running on our already robust network infrastructure. We will utilize existing content relationships, and we already have the rights in place to offer video across our footprint. And these rights provide us the flexibility to introduce a variety of bundles and packages that will appeal to a wide spectrum of customer preferences. This endeavor is extremely capital efficient for 2 key reasons. First, we are leveraging the substantial broadband infrastructure investment we have made in our network over the last half-dozen years; and second, our IPTV applications employ the latest, very advanced compression technology. The HD television channel will require approximately 2.5 megabits of capacity, meaning a household with 4 HDTVs active at once will only require 10 megabits of capacity into the home, leaving the remainder available for data usage. The capabilities of the latest technology, combined with our increasing scale, make it extremely compelling for Frontier to undertake this initiative now. To enable 1.3 million households to receive video over our existing broadband infrastructure, we'll require total capital spending of less than $150 million spread over several years. That means we can undertake this project within our existing capital budget and current forecast. The rate of our deployment can be varied depending on success. As a result, this is a low-risk undertaking. If the take rates aren't in line with our expectations, we can adjust our plan accordingly.
In addition to the direct revenue benefits to Frontier, also consider the scale benefits. With the closing of California, Texas and Florida acquisition, we'll have approximately 1.5 million video subscribers, excluding satellite. Consider how much larger our video scale could become as we proceed with this initiative and increase our penetration across the 3 million additional households. For all the reasons I've discussed, I hope you can see why this is such a strategically significant initiative for Frontier.
And now, let's discuss our California, Texas and Florida transaction. We're in the final phases of preparing for the closing of the acquisition, which is scheduled for April 1. The integration teams from both sides have been extremely diligent in planning a detailed cutover with the mutual objective of minimal customer disruptions. As we have previously discussed, our plan is to maintain the existing service plans and go-to-market approach that currently exist in the Verizon markets. We have already adopted them within our systems and our existing FiOS markets. 
We're in the final stages of our conversion plans. The systems conversions are on track, and we are seeing conversion metrics at or above our expectations for this point in the conversion process. We are executing our training plans, including a segment of the incoming workforce. All indications are very positive with less than 40 days until the cutover. The entire Frontier organization is focused on having a smooth cutover and a great experience for our new customers. We are excited about the opportunities in our new markets. And as we continue to learn more about these markets and the employees who will be joining us, we believe we will be in a strong position to drive significant benefits for our customers and our stakeholders. As we have moved close to the cutover, we have developed better insight into our cost structure. At this time, I can say with full confidence that we will be in excess of $600 million in day 1 cost synergies, and we are continuing to refine our day 1 cost structure. We will provide an update on our cost structure and initial synergy attainment on our Q1 earnings call. The acceleration of the synergies support our ability to deliver the leveraged free cash flow accretion we forecasted for this transaction.
In summary, I am extremely excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for Frontier. We are on the cusp of closing the long anticipated California, Texas and Florida acquisition, to which our entire team has devoted so much time, energy and effort. And we have a compelling low-risk plan to broaden our capabilities across our legacy markets through the video initiative, while leveraging the significant investments made for the Verizon integration in our IT platforms to improve our cost structure over time. We appreciate the investment community's ongoing patience and confidence as we execute this transformative acquisition, which is a significantly forward for Frontier.
I will now hand the call over to our CFO, John Jureller, who will go into more details on our financial performance."

Frontier reported a loss per common share of $0.14 in the fourth quarter 2015 after dividends on our preferred stock compared to a loss per common share of $0.07 in the third quarter of 2015 and income of $0.01 per common share in the fourth quarter 2014. Adjusting for dividends on the preferred stock, acquisition-related interest expense, acquisition and integration costs, severance costs and certain tax items, our non-GAAP adjusted net income was $0.05 per share in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $0.03 per share in the third quarter of 2015 and $0.04 per share in the fourth quarter of 2014.
On February 11, the board declared a common dividend of $0.105 per share for the first quarter of 2016, payable March 31, in line with the dividend rate of the 4 quarters of 2015. We also will be paying the regularly scheduled dividend on our preferred shares on March 31.
Please turn to Slide 5. Fourth quarter revenue was $1.41 billion as compared to $1.42 billion in the third quarter. Total legacy revenue declined by $4 million, with a decline in voice revenues partially offset by an increase in video and regulatory revenues. Revenue in Connecticut was $257 million, a sequential decline of about $7 million, primarily due to declines in voice revenue. Customer revenue of $1.21 billion was down $16 million sequentially or negative 1.3%. We experienced a slight increase in the headwind from voice revenue relative to the expectation we had outlined for Q4 revenue.
The total residential customer revenue of $594 million was down $12 million as compared to Q3. We did experience an improvement in Connecticut as we began to migrate customers off the 1-year promotions that were introduced in the fourth quarter of 2014, but this benefit was offset by a decline in voice revenue. We should see more of the benefit in this migration in the first quarter.
Business customer revenue of $613 million was down only $4 million sequentially. Total data and Internet services revenue was stable sequentially, with increases in our residential and business broadband services and carrier revenues offsetting the declines in wireless backhaul revenue. Voice revenue declined slightly more than anticipated, reflecting customer migration to different price plans. Regulatory revenue for the quarter was $206 million, up $5 million sequentially. Our regulatory revenue was reduced by approximately $4 million in the fourth quarter versus expectations because in the process of verifying the CAF II household count provided by the FCC, we found a slightly lower number. This will reduce our CAF II revenue by about $1 million per quarter going forward. In the fourth quarter, we recognized the full year impact of this change, which was approximately $4 million.
Residential average revenue per customer, or ARPC, was $63.14 for the fourth quarter of 2015, a decline of 1.1% sequentially. Lower voice revenue of stand-alone and within product bundles was a contributing factor, partially offset by improvements in data and video. Business ARPC was up 0.9% sequentially. The adjusted EBITDA margin for the fourth quarter was 42.5%, which was up 110 basis points from the third quarter level as a result of lower cash operating expenses in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter and the increase in CAF II revenue recognized in the period.
Cash operating expenses of $813 million was slightly lower than the target range we had outlined for Q4 in November. We do anticipate an increase in operating expense in Q1, driven by seasonal factors, such as the usual first quarter increase in payroll tax and some additional headcount. Capital expenditures were $185 million in the fourth quarter, and we spent an additional $52 million in CapEx related to integration activities.
Please turn to Slide 6. Frontier's cash flow remains very healthy. Our adjusted free cash flow was $243 million in the fourth quarter. Our dividend payout ratio, adjusted to exclude the incremental dividends and interest expense on the capital raised for our pending transaction with Verizon, was 43% in the fourth quarter as compared to 46% in the third quarter of 2015 and 52% in the fourth quarter of 2014. We believe that the adjusted dividend payout ratio, that excludes the incremental capital cost, is appropriate until such time as we complete our transaction as we don't yet have the operating cash flow associated with this capital.
Please turn to Slide 7. Our leverage ratio at the end of Q4 was 3.6x. Frontier's liquidity remains robust. Excluding the restricted cash earmarked for our California, Texas and Florida acquisition, we ended the quarter with approximately $1.7 billion in cash and credit availability. Our debt maturities are well laddered, and at the present time, we don't see a need to access the public capital markets for the next couple of years. As we move forward, it's important to reiterate Frontier's capital allocation framework, investing appropriately in our network infrastructure and operations, supporting our current dividend and utilizing excess cash generated to reduce indebtedness and our leverage ratio.
As Dan outlined earlier, within our capital spending plan, we have the flexibility to shift funds to invest in the deployment of video services and to meet the CAF II obligations. We are comfortable with a leverage level of approximately 4x that we project after the closing of the Verizon transaction. We are committed to maintaining our liquidity and reducing our leverage over time. We know that there has been substantial interest in getting an update on the results of the California, Texas and Florida assets we are acquiring. So let me give you a snapshot on a few things. The pro forma adjusted revenues for California, Texas and Florida were approximately $1.4 billion in Q3. Verizon has not yet finalized the full year audited financial statements of that business, but has advised us that based upon preliminary information, it's anticipated that the pro forma adjusted revenues for the fourth quarter were slightly ahead of Q3. This is a directional indication, and we await final confirmation when Verizon delivers to us the 2015 audited financial statements for the California, Texas and Florida business.
FiOS data connections increased by approximately 17,000 in Q3 and 18,000 in Q4. Similar to the historical trends, which Verizon has reported, as anticipated, DSL data connections declined by approximately 28,000 in Q3 and 24,000 in Q4. FiOS video connections declined by about 4,000 in Q3 and Q4. These metrics are consistent with Verizon's total results and what we expected. We anticipate providing full year audited results in accordance with our reporting requirements.
I will review our guidance on Slide 8. Our current plan is to provide full year guidance with combined operations in May during our Q1 earnings call, following the closing of the California, Texas and Florida acquisition. We are not providing complete guidance for the full year, particularly given how our business will be changing in about 6 short weeks. However, there are a few things for which we can provide some direction. For Q1, we anticipate regulatory revenue to decline by about $46 million, reflecting the ongoing CAF II revenue run rate, partially offset by other items. Regarding cash operating expenses, we have already discussed our expectation that the first quarter cash operating expenses will increase sequentially from Q4. We anticipate the increase to be in the range of $20 million to $25 million. This increase primarily reflects the impact of a step up in payroll taxes, which begins to reverse in Q2, and costs related to headcount that supports our third-party Internet helpdesk revenue.
Looking forward, the combined Q2 cash operating expenses will include the benefit of the day 1 cost synergies, which, as Dan described, will be in excess of $600 million.
Capital expenditures for Q1, inclusive of CAF II spending, are anticipated to be a slight increase over Q4; we will provide the full year guidance on CapEx in May. A full year guidance item that we are providing at this time is with respect to cash income taxes. We estimate the full year cash taxes in a range of $5 million to $15 million. This includes the impact of California, Texas and Florida acquisition, reflects the incremental interest expense for the year, the substantial benefits from the asset-basis step up that is part of the Verizon transaction and the benefit of bonus depreciation extension.
Further, given the funded position of our pension plan, we estimate cash pension contributions for 2016 in the $15 million to $25 million range, inclusive of the California, Texas and Florida acquisition. As a reminder, the pension liabilities for the transferring employees will be fully funded by Verizon as part of this transaction. We estimate 2016 interest expense of slightly more than $1.5 billion. This includes the cost of the term loan A that will be drawn at quarter end to fund the closing of the California, Texas and Florida acquisition as well as interest-related to the debt that we will be assuming from Verizon at the closing. Only about 10% of our debt will be floating rate debt following the closing of this transaction, so we continue to have an immaterial exposure to changes in interest rates. 
In summary, Frontier's Q4 2015 operating results, our preparations for the California, Texas and Florida acquisition, our prudent capital investments and expense management all provide a strong cash flow base in a solid financial platform for supporting and investing in our business. We have ample capital to invest in and enhance our competitive infrastructure, service our debt and comfortably sustain our dividend and maintain the dividend payout ratio superior to others in the telecom sector.

On Connecticut, one of the key issues was that we actually changed some of our pricing structures and go-to-market plans to be more Frontier-like in Connecticut on day 1. In this instance, we've gone just the opposite. We've adopted the Verizon bundles, products, including all the bundles that are introduced as of yesterday into the product family. So there really is no chance that there'll be a sudden migration of customers to a different bundle structure, which had the significant ARPC impact. On the operational side, we've have taken great pains and steps to stage the cutovers, so that we don't have as much happening that first night. In fact, the Verizon video cutover will take place over a number of days, so that we minimize the potential impact, and we can back out of any step at any point. So that was probably the biggest single issue that happened on the Connecticut integration that ultimately led to some of the problems, day 1 and in the first month or so. So combining those 2, and I could go through a number of different other additional facts, but those are the 2 biggest selling impacts that will be very, very different between the Verizon transaction and Connecticut. And as we execute on the Verizon, I think you'll see a very smooth transition and no impact like we saw in Connecticut."

What we saw in beginning of late Q3 and Q4 was the usual trends in our business. We have a product that, for example, on the voice side, that we call, our Stay Connected product, which allows snowbirds, for example, those in the North, that may vacation or go to their winter homes in the South, to maintain their service, but at a substantially reduced rate that we keep their port open for broadband. So we maintain them as customers, but at a lower ARPC for those periods of time. We see that -- that happens every season. So late Q3, call it, right through mid-Q1. And what you'll see is that ARPC returning in the late Q1 to early Q2 time frame. So that's a seasonal thing that we see for us. And I think some customers, too, have put themselves into different bundles, just given how they're using their landline versus their mobile service. So it's not a loss of customers as compared to our expectations, it was more of a pricing migration, which is, in many ways, seasonal in nature. We expect that to return back. As you rightly pointed out, we saw some increase in ARPC from the video migrations, pricing migration that Dan outlined. Recall that we had brought new customer -- pardon me, existing customers at new customer acquisition pricing beginning late last year. And that was only for a 1-year period. They're now coming off that pricing and a greater cohort comes off that pricing in Q1 and then finally in Q2. So we will see lift, for example, on the video side or in our double- and triple-play customers in Connecticut with respect to that migration. So we see some good opportunity in residential ARPC as we transition throughout the quarters of this year."

And there is a small segment of the base, that we're inheriting, that has that. It appears to us that the individuals, that we're taking those scaled-down bundles, are really a segment, whether you call them cord shavers or just people that are looking for a unique product, that's a minority in the market. In fact, our research indicates that the propensity for customers to take the full bundle is much higher in these markets even than the national average. So as we look at it, we will have the bundles that are available for the cord shavers. It will not be our focus initially as we enter the markets and begin operating the business. We'll support all the customers that are on it today. And then as we gain more intimacy in the market, I think you'll see us target different segments with those bundles where it makes sense, but still offer a pretty attractive feature-rich, linear video bundle."

But you'll see that we'll have probably 3 markets open for sale by that point, and then we'll start accelerating. We feel very good about the margin profile. We would not sell, obviously, a standalone video product. So it's really designed to be a bundled product. But it gives us the ability to be a disruptive force in the different markets and to really change the conversation with customers and to offer them a unique product and service that integrates a great linear video experience, but also social media and over-the-top that might come with different partnerships with providers."

Regarding your question on tax, our tax guidance really benefits from a couple of different things. But 2 substantial things: One was, certainly, the extension of bonus depreciation; but almost even more so was the asset basis step-up that we negotiated as part of this transaction. Now both the benefit of that basis step-up as well as bonus depreciation certainly continue on to 2017. We are not providing 2017 guidance at this point in time.

First off, on the cost integration. We had a heavy lift in the fourth quarter associated with capital, specifically around standing up a supercore network around the country as well as expanding our capabilities for TV Everywhere and video-on-demand, which are new platforms that we'll be able to leverage across all of our video base. So I think you'll see Q1 less heavy from a CapEx perspective, more about OpEx. We do anticipate that there'll be some costs post-close but we're expecting to get those out of the business fairly quickly. So I wouldn't expect to see a long-term impact from the integration cost. And then as far as Durham goes, some of the initial learnings are that we were locked out in many cases of securing long-term contracts with some of the apartments and condominium owners in the market because we didn't have a video product other than a mini headend that was using satellite, which was not the preferred solution. So in the first several weeks of introducing the product, we've already secured new contracts that would be substantial units right out of the gate.

Good morning, and thank you for joining Frontier's First Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. I'm going to discuss our first quarter results, update you on our acquisition of California, Texas, and Florida markets and share our outlook for the remainder of the year.
Please turn to Slide 3. During the first quarter, we were intensely focused on preparing for the closing of our California, Texas, and Florida acquisition, an enormous undertaking in terms of size and complexity. I'm pleased to report that during this period, we continue to execute on our key strategic initiatives and we delivered a solid first quarter.
We maintained our momentum on broadband growth with net additions of more than 24,000. Our progress must business customers continues to be positive with another quarter of sequentially stable SME results. And our video initiative received a positive reception during an introductory quarter in its first market.
In Q1, over half of broadband activity was above the basic speed tier. We increased the portion of sales from AlterNet's channels in Q1 to 45% so that contact center team members could attend training and prepare for system modifications necessary for our integration of the new products.
I'm pleased with these results, given the magnitude of changes we were implementing in Q1 in preparation for the deal closure. With this transaction completed, we have dramatically increased our scale, with the addition of approximately 3.3 million voice customers, 2.1 million broadband connections and 1.2 to million FiOS video subscribers as well as related business.
We have also welcomed approximately 9400 new employees to the Frontier team. The turnover that began in April 1 was the largest and most complex product that has ever been executed in our industry and I am proud to say that it's been very successful. We took lessons from previous cutovers and applied them to strengthen our processes and minimize service interruption. As with any transfer of this scale and complexity, there were some issues in the outset, but these affected less than 1% of our customers in total and much less than that at any point in time. As we move through the initial transition period, we have identified and addressed a number of issues with imperfect data extracts and network complexities. We were able to modify our business practices and conduct additional rounds of employee training immediately because of our extensive preparation and the contingency procedures we have developed. This delayed the rate of reaching a normal business cadence and as a result, we were slow in responding to customers and restoring service. This disappointed some customers and resulted in some negative publicity in the market. We now have these issues resolved and behind us. At this point, we have completed all business and residential billing cycles for the first month of ownership.
We know that disruptions of any kind are frustrating for customers, and our teams work around-the-clock to resolve outstanding issues and resource service. This cutover required extensive training of more than 10,000 field technicians and customers representatives, which could only take place after the transaction was closed.
During the training period, we relied on partners to help us support customer service requests. As of today, we have completed that training. We have our customer service teams back to full strength, and we will be reducing reliance on the temporary partner. We expect this to have a significant positive impact on the customer experience.
All service issues related to the conversion have been substantially results, and a level of outages is now trending at approximately the levels we expect for these properties. We continue to monitor customer call closely and are doing everything we can to respondent improve the customer experience.
I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our customers for their patience throughout this process, and I would like to thank all of our employees for their outstanding efforts on this very challenging transformation.
I see a great deal of potential in these 3 new markets. In addition to increased scale, they each have significant growth opportunity. California, Texas, and Florida are projected to account for nearly half of the U.S. population growth over the next decade. We are expanding into these markets with leading edge capabilities, including networks that as about 55% FiOS-enabled. With the completion of this acquisition, we have expectations for 2016, and we are targeting a range of free cash flow between $800 million and $925 million, and Jon will cover our guidance in the additional detail momentarily.
As we continue to learn more about these markets and the employees who have joined us, we believe we will be in a strong position to drive significant additional benefits for our customers and shareholders.
I expect the second quarter to be impacted by integration in a few ways. As part of the integration plans, we minimize marketing efforts to allow our teams to gain proficiency and utilization of the front your systems to operate the business. This will impact the gross addition in these new operation. This was planned and necessary to ensure we were capable of meeting higher activity level. As a result, we anticipate that the customer metrics for the second quarter will most likely be negative as we begin to build our marketing campaigns over the coming week. 
Please turn to Slide 4. When we reviewed the opportunity for Frontier going forward, we will continue to be focused on increasing our broadband opportunities, both and FiOS and copper market. We are building out increased speed capabilities across our network using both our own funds as well as CAF II funds for rural areas. We have substantial opportunity to increase our broadband penetration, and we are at the beginning of a multiyear program to offer video service to an increasing footprint of our footprint. We can service slightly over 30% of our 14.5 million household footprint with video today, and we anticipate that will grow to well in excess of half over the coming years.
We believe that the expand reach of our video capability will help us attract new customers to Frontier for both video and broadband service. We will continue expanding our capabilities for business customers, particularly in that newly acquired California, Texas, and Florida markets. This includes developing direct and indirect channels to service opportunities we see in these markets.
And we will continue to focus on improving customer retention. We anticipate that -- in their contribution, increasing availability of video file compiling low risk deployment plan, improving broadband speeds, increasing retention, and product availability of our compelling business offering that our revenue trends should improve. Furthermore, we continue to have a substantial opportunity to improve efficiencies across the business. This is an exciting time for Frontier. We appreciate the investment community's ongoing patience and confidence, as we can execute on the transformation of frontiers business. I will now hand the call over to our CFO, John Jureller, who will go into more detail on our financial performance."

Frontier reported loss per common share of $0.21 in the first quarter of 2016 after dividends on our preferred stock compared to a loss per common share of $0.14 in the fourth quarter of 2015 and a loss of $0.05 per common share in the fir",1414,"Thank you, Dan. Frontier reported loss per common share of $0.21 in the first quarter of 2016 after dividends on our preferred stock compared to a loss per common share of $0.14 in the fourth quarter of 2015 and a loss of $0.05 per common share in the first quarter of 2015.
Adjusting for dividends on preferred stock, acquisition-related interest expense, acquisition and integration costs, severance cost in certain tax items are non-GAAP adjusted net income was $0.01 per share in the first quarter 2016 compared to $0.05 per share in the fourth quarter of 2015 and $0.02 per share in the first quarter of 2015. On May 2, the board declared a common dividend of $0.105 per share for the second quarter 2016, payable June 30, in line with the dividend rate in recent quarters. We will also be paying the regularly scheduled dividend on our preferred shares on June 30.
Please turn to Slide 5. First quarter revenue was $1.36 billion as compared to $1.41 billion in the fourth quarter. Revenue declined by $58 million, reflecting the anticipated sequential step down in CAF II revenues of $39 million as well as the decline in voice services revenue, partially offset by an increase in data services revenue.
Customer revenue, up $1.19 billion was down $18 million sequentially or negative 1.5%, reflecting the sequential decline in voice revenue. Total residential customer revenue was $583 million, was down $11 million as compared to Q4. The decline was primarily due to a decrease in voice revenue. During the quarter, we continue to migrate the Connecticut-based customers, who received the 1-year acquisition pricing offers beginning in late 2014 and through early 2015 back to the non-promotional pricing.
Business customer revenue of $606 million was down only $7 million sequentially. Within business, as Dan noted, SME revenue was stable sequentially. Approximately 1/2 of the quarterly sequential decline was due to the anticipated reduction in wireless backhaul revenue.
Total data and Internet services revenue declined slightly from the prior quarter. During the quarter, our residential combined with as in the, data and Internet services revenues continue to increase. This was offset by the decline in wireless backhaul and other carrier revenue. The rate of voice revenue decline improved from the fourth quarter. In Q1, we had a sequential improvement in the impact from residential rate migrations and a stable trend in residential voice disconnects.
Regulatory revenue for the quarter was $166 million, a sequential decrease of $40 million. This reflects the anticipated CAF II revenue recognition, as we recognize revenue throughout the year as compared to 2015, when the incremental subsidy revenue recognition was concentrated in Q3 and Q4.
Beginning in the second quarter, the regulatory revenue will increase by approximately $12 million per quarter due to the incremental CAF II subsidy revenue for California and Texas.
Residential average revenue per customer or ARPC was $62.64 for the first quarter of 2016, a decline of 0.8% sequentially. This reduction reflects a continued decline in the percentage of customers that bundle voice as well as the reduced visual impact from the migration to stay connected rates that occur in Q4. Prior years have shown that we see a return on connected residential voice revenue in Q2 and Q3. This was up 0.6% sequentially. In Q1, our residential customer churn was 1.83% and expect a slight seasonal increase over 1.76% in Q4, but a material improvement as compared to the 1.97% in Q3 2015.
Cash operating expenses of $827 million represented an increase of $14 million sequentially. However, this is better than the sequential estimates we have provided on the fourth quarter earnings call. The improvements came from multiple areas, including operations, third-party services and benefits expense.
The adjusted operating cash flow or EBITDA margin in the first quarter was 38.9%, a decline from Q4 that we anticipated due to the lesser amount of CAF II revenue recognized in the respective quarters and from the estimated sequential increase in cash operating expenses.
Capital expenditures were $207 million in the first quarter, and we spent an additional $52 million in CapEx related to integration activities.
Please turn to Slide 6. Frontier's cash flow remains very healthy. Our adjusted free cash flow was $187 million in the first quarter. Our dividend payout ratio, adjusted to exclude the incremental dividends and interest expense on the capital for our transaction with Verizon, was 56% in the first quarter, as compared to 43% in the fourth quarter of 2015. The adjusted dividend payout ratio excludes the capital cost of the debt and equity capital for the acquisition and we believe remains at the appropriate measure until we begin to include the operating cash flow from the acquisition.
Please turn to Slide 7. Our leverage ratio at the end of Q1 was 3.85x. Pro forma for the inclusion of the rise in transaction and incremental debt, based upon our trailing 12-month results, the reported Verizon separate telephone operations pro forma results for 2015 as filed in our recent 8-K, and an estimated $600 million of annualized net cost synergies, the net debt-to-EBITDA ratio would have been approximately 4x.
Frontier's liquidity position remains robust, excluding the restricted cash that was in acquisition, we ended the quarter with approximately $1.25 billion in cash and credit availability. Our debt maturities schedules well laddered and we have the ability to come to the debt maturities coming due over the next few years.
Frontier's capital allocation framework remains unchanged. We will invest appropriately in our network infrastructure and operations, including our newly acquired operations, support our current dividend and utilize remaining cash flow to reduce debt in our leverage ratio. We are committed to maintaining our liquidity and reducing our leverage over time.
Please turn to Slide 8. With the California, Texas, and Florida acquisition completed effective April 1, let's look at Frontier's outlook for the full year 2016.
We anticipated full year 2016 adjusted free cash flow, otherwise known as leveraged free cash flow to be in the range of $800 million to $925 million. The adjusted free cash flow guidance range is after the deduction of dividends paid on the preferred shares. This includes the contribution from 3 quarters of the newly acquired operations. The adjusted free cash flow guidance includes that benefit of the cost synergies with respect to this transaction. This guidance estimate excludes our remaining integration spending in 2016, the majority of which is estimated to be completed in the second quarter.
Within this quarter, we will be filing Verizon separate telephone operations Q1 2016 financial results in pro forma adjustments, which will provide further information on the most recent operating trends in his business.
We anticipated capital expenditures of $1.25 billion to $1.4 billion in 2016, inclusive of our CAF II related expenditures but excluding integration spending.
We continue to estimate full year cash taxes in the range of $5 million to $15 million, including the impact of our acquisition. We estimate cash pension contributions for 2016 in the $15 million to $20 million range, including of the funding obligations for the transferring workforce in California, Texas, and Florida.
We estimate the 2016 reported interest expense will be in the range of $1.53 billion to $1.55 billion. Keep in mind that interest expense in Q2 will step up sequentially from the first quarter by about $20 million, reflecting the drawing of a term loan A of quarter end to fund acquisition as well as the interest related to the debt we have assumed from Verizon at the closing.
We estimate that interest expense, excluding the Q1 portion of the interest expense on a $6.6 billion of acquisition-related debt will be in the range of $1.34 billion to $1.36 billion. The adjusted free cash flow guidance range of $800 million, $925 million reflects this interest expense range.
Approximately 13% of our debt is interest rates, so we are relatively minor exposure to fluctuations in variable interest rates.
In summary, Frontier's Q1 2016 operating results, our operating California, Texas, and Florida operation our prudent capital expense all provide a strong base -- cash flow base and a solid financial platform for supporting and investing in the business. We have ample capital to invest in and enhance our competitive infrastructure, service our debt and comfortably sustain our dividend and maintain the dividend payout ratio superior to others in the telecom sector. With that, I'll pass the call back to the operator, who will open up the lines for questions."

That could be everything from people moving out of market to different individuals making decisions to go to different provider, all of the gamut of why people and limited in what activity associated with the marketing. So as a result, you actually will see a negative subscriber metric for Q2. And then if we anticipate that changing to more normal rhythms as we end the quarter and moving to Q3. So we wouldn't have the inward activity from a subscriber perspective and potentially inward activity revenue associated with our month or 2 of revenue with those customers. And that's what I was really try to make sure everybody understood."

The video is really allowed leveraging the investment that we've made, historically, in the market from a transportation perspective and also from an electronics perspective. And the low cost deployment is really about how little it takes to enable a market from a video capability perspective. And generally, that is enabling what people refer to as a video head office and a market and the technology, as we described in the last call, really are -- have come back down from a cost perspective on routing, on server architecture and also the code at the run compression that's use in these markets really are what makes it very low cost as opposed to some of our peers in the pool might have been forced with to deal with a much higher cost due to market.

Good morning, and thank you for joining Frontier's First Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. I'm going to discuss our first quarter results, update you on our acquisition of California, Texas, and Florida markets and share our outlook for the remainder of the year.
Please turn to Slide 3. During the first quarter, we were intensely focused on preparing for the closing of our California, Texas, and Florida acquisition, an enormous undertaking in terms of size and complexity. I'm pleased to report that during this period, we continue to execute on our key strategic initiatives and we delivered a solid first quarter.
We maintained our momentum on broadband growth with net additions of more than 24,000. Our progress must business customers continues to be positive with another quarter of sequentially stable SME results. And our video initiative received a positive reception during an introductory quarter in its first market.
In Q1, over half of broadband activity was above the basic speed tier. We increased the portion of sales from AlterNet's channels in Q1 to 45% so that contact center team members could attend training and prepare for system modifications necessary for our integration of the new products.
I'm pleased with these results, given the magnitude of changes we were implementing in Q1 in preparation for the deal closure. With this transaction completed, we have dramatically increased our scale, with the addition of approximately 3.3 million voice customers, 2.1 million broadband connections and 1.2 to million FiOS video subscribers as well as related business.
We have also welcomed approximately 9400 new employees to the Frontier team. The turnover that began in April 1 was the largest and most complex product that has ever been executed in our industry and I am proud to say that it's been very successful. We took lessons from previous cutovers and applied them to strengthen our processes and minimize service interruption. As with any transfer of this scale and complexity, there were some issues in the outset, but these affected less than 1% of our customers in total and much less than that at any point in time. As we move through the initial transition period, we have identified and addressed a number of issues with imperfect data extracts and network complexities. We were able to modify our business practices and conduct additional rounds of employee training immediately because of our extensive preparation and the contingency procedures we have developed. This delayed the rate of reaching a normal business cadence and as a result, we were slow in responding to customers and restoring service. This disappointed some customers and resulted in some negative publicity in the market. We now have these issues resolved and behind us. At this point, we have completed all business and residential billing cycles for the first month of ownership.
We know that disruptions of any kind are frustrating for customers, and our teams work around-the-clock to resolve outstanding issues and resource service. This cutover required extensive training of more than 10,000 field technicians and customers representatives, which could only take place after the transaction was closed.
During the training period, we relied on partners to help us support customer service requests. As of today, we have completed that training. We have our customer service teams back to full strength, and we will be reducing reliance on the temporary partner. We expect this to have a significant positive impact on the customer experience.
All service issues related to the conversion have been substantially results, and a level of outages is now trending at approximately the levels we expect for these properties. We continue to monitor customer call closely and are doing everything we can to respondent improve the customer experience.
I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our customers for their patience throughout this process, and I would like to thank all of our employees for their outstanding efforts on this very challenging transformation.
I see a great deal of potential in these 3 new markets. In addition to increased scale, they each have significant growth opportunity. California, Texas, and Florida are projected to account for nearly half of the U.S. population growth over the next decade. We are expanding into these markets with leading edge capabilities, including networks that as about 55% FiOS-enabled. With the completion of this acquisition, we have expectations for 2016, and we are targeting a range of free cash flow between $800 million and $925 million, and Jon will cover our guidance in the additional detail momentarily.
As we continue to learn more about these markets and the employees who have joined us, we believe we will be in a strong position to drive significant additional benefits for our customers and shareholders.
I expect the second quarter to be impacted by integration in a few ways. As part of the integration plans, we minimize marketing efforts to allow our teams to gain proficiency and utilization of the front your systems to operate the business. This will impact the gross addition in these new operation. This was planned and necessary to ensure we were capable of meeting higher activity level. As a result, we anticipate that the customer metrics for the second quarter will most likely be negative as we begin to build our marketing campaigns over the coming week. 
Please turn to Slide 4. When we reviewed the opportunity for Frontier going forward, we will continue to be focused on increasing our broadband opportunities, both and FiOS and copper market. We are building out increased speed capabilities across our network using both our own funds as well as CAF II funds for rural areas. We have substantial opportunity to increase our broadband penetration, and we are at the beginning of a multiyear program to offer video service to an increasing footprint of our footprint. We can service slightly over 30% of our 14.5 million household footprint with video today, and we anticipate that will grow to well in excess of half over the coming years.
We believe that the expand reach of our video capability will help us attract new customers to Frontier for both video and broadband service. We will continue expanding our capabilities for business customers, particularly in that newly acquired California, Texas, and Florida markets. This includes developing direct and indirect channels to service opportunities we see in these markets.
And we will continue to focus on improving customer retention. We anticipate that -- in their contribution, increasing availability of video file compiling low risk deployment plan, improving broadband speeds, increasing retention, and product availability of our compelling business offering that our revenue trends should improve. Furthermore, we continue to have a substantial opportunity to improve efficiencies across the business. This is an exciting time for Frontier. We appreciate the investment community's ongoing patience and confidence, as we can execute on the transformation of frontiers business. I will now hand the call over to our CFO, John Jureller, who will go into more detail on our financial performance."

Adjusting for dividends on preferred stock, acquisition-related interest expense, acquisition and integration costs, severance cost in certain tax items are non-GAAP adjusted net income was $0.01 per share in the first quarter 2016 compared to $0.05 per share in the fourth quarter of 2015 and $0.02 per share in the first quarter of 2015.

We will also be paying the regularly scheduled dividend on our preferred shares on June 30.
Please turn to Slide 5. First quarter revenue was $1.36 billion as compared to $1.41 billion in the fourth quarter. Revenue declined by $58 million, reflecting the anticipated sequential step down in CAF II revenues of $39 million as well as the decline in voice services revenue, partially offset by an increase in data services revenue.
Customer revenue, up $1.19 billion was down $18 million sequentially or negative 1.5%, reflecting the sequential decline in voice revenue. Total residential customer revenue was $583 million, was down $11 million as compared to Q4. The decline was primarily due to a decrease in voice revenue. During the quarter, we continue to migrate the Connecticut-based customers, who received the 1-year acquisition pricing offers beginning in late 2014 and through early 2015 back to the non-promotional pricing.
Business customer revenue of $606 million was down only $7 million sequentially. Within business, as Dan noted, SME revenue was stable sequentially. Approximately 1/2 of the quarterly sequential decline was due to the anticipated reduction in wireless backhaul revenue.
Total data and Internet services revenue declined slightly from the prior quarter. During the quarter, our residential combined with as in the, data and Internet services revenues continue to increase. This was offset by the decline in wireless backhaul and other carrier revenue. The rate of voice revenue decline improved from the fourth quarter. In Q1, we had a sequential improvement in the impact from residential rate migrations and a stable trend in residential voice disconnects.
Regulatory revenue for the quarter was $166 million, a sequential decrease of $40 million. This reflects the anticipated CAF II revenue recognition, as we recognize revenue throughout the year as compared to 2015, when the incremental subsidy revenue recognition was concentrated in Q3 and Q4.
Beginning in the second quarter, the regulatory revenue will increase by approximately $12 million per quarter due to the incremental CAF II subsidy revenue for California and Texas.
Residential average revenue per customer or ARPC was $62.64 for the first quarter of 2016, a decline of 0.8% sequentially. This reduction reflects a continued decline in the percentage of customers that bundle voice as well as the reduced visual impact from the migration to stay connected rates that occur in Q4. Prior years have shown that we see a return on connected residential voice revenue in Q2 and Q3. This was up 0.6% sequentially. In Q1, our residential customer churn was 1.83% and expect a slight seasonal increase over 1.76% in Q4, but a material improvement as compared to the 1.97% in Q3 2015.
Cash operating expenses of $827 million represented an increase of $14 million sequentially. However, this is better than the sequential estimates we have provided on the fourth quarter earnings call. The improvements came from multiple areas, including operations, third-party services and benefits expense.
The adjusted operating cash flow or EBITDA margin in the first quarter was 38.9%, a decline from Q4 that we anticipated due to the lesser amount of CAF II revenue recognized in the respective quarters and from the estimated sequential increase in cash operating expenses.
Capital expenditures were $207 million in the first quarter, and we spent an additional $52 million in CapEx related to integration activities.
Please turn to Slide 6. Frontier's cash flow remains very healthy. Our adjusted free cash flow was $187 million in the first quarter. Our dividend payout ratio, adjusted to exclude the incremental dividends and interest expense on the capital for our transaction with Verizon, was 56% in the first quarter, as compared to 43% in the fourth quarter of 2015. The adjusted dividend payout ratio excludes the capital cost of the debt and equity capital for the acquisition and we believe remains at the appropriate measure until we begin to include the operating cash flow from the acquisition.
Please turn to Slide 7. Our leverage ratio at the end of Q1 was 3.85x. Pro forma for the inclusion of the rise in transaction and incremental debt, based upon our trailing 12-month results, the reported Verizon separate telephone operations pro forma results for 2015 as filed in our recent 8-K, and an estimated $600 million of annualized net cost synergies, the net debt-to-EBITDA ratio would have been approximately 4x.
Frontier's liquidity position remains robust, excluding the restricted cash that was in acquisition, we ended the quarter with approximately $1.25 billion in cash and credit availability. Our debt maturities schedules well laddered and we have the ability to come to the debt maturities coming due over the next few years.
Frontier's capital allocation framework remains unchanged. We will invest appropriately in our network infrastructure and operations, including our newly acquired operations, support our current dividend and utilize remaining cash flow to reduce debt in our leverage ratio. We are committed to maintaining our liquidity and reducing our leverage over time.
Please turn to Slide 8. With the California, Texas, and Florida acquisition completed effective April 1, let's look at Frontier's outlook for the full year 2016.
We anticipated full year 2016 adjusted free cash flow, otherwise known as leveraged free cash flow to be in the range of $800 million to $925 million. The adjusted free cash flow guidance range is after the deduction of dividends paid on the preferred shares. This includes the contribution from 3 quarters of the newly acquired operations. The adjusted free cash flow guidance includes that benefit of the cost synergies with respect to this transaction. This guidance estimate excludes our remaining integration spending in 2016, the majority of which is estimated to be completed in the second quarter.
Within this quarter, we will be filing Verizon separate telephone operations Q1 2016 financial results in pro forma adjustments, which will provide further information on the most recent operating trends in his business.
We anticipated capital expenditures of $1.25 billion to $1.4 billion in 2016, inclusive of our CAF II related expenditures but excluding integration spending.
We continue to estimate full year cash taxes in the range of $5 million to $15 million, including the impact of our acquisition. We estimate cash pension contributions for 2016 in the $15 million to $20 million range, including of the funding obligations for the transferring workforce in California, Texas, and Florida.
We estimate the 2016 reported interest expense will be in the range of $1.53 billion to $1.55 billion. Keep in mind that interest expense in Q2 will step up sequentially from the first quarter by about $20 million, reflecting the drawing of a term loan A of quarter end to fund acquisition as well as the interest related to the debt we have assumed from Verizon at the closing.
We estimate that interest expense, excluding the Q1 portion of the interest expense on a $6.6 billion of acquisition-related debt will be in the range of $1.34 billion to $1.36 billion. The adjusted free cash flow guidance range of $800 million, $925 million reflects this interest expense range.
Approximately 13% of our debt is interest rates, so we are relatively minor exposure to fluctuations in variable interest rates.
In summary, Frontier's Q1 2016 operating results, our operating California, Texas, and Florida operation our prudent capital expense all provide a strong base -- cash flow base and a solid financial platform for supporting and investing in the business. We have ample capital to invest in and enhance our competitive infrastructure, service our debt and comfortably sustain our dividend and maintain the dividend payout ratio superior to others in the telecom sector. With that, I'll pass the call back to the operator, who will open up the lines for questions."

So as a result, what you tend to see in the first month or 2 of operation is the normal activity that's happening in the market. That could be everything from people moving out of market to different individuals making decisions to go to different provider, all of the gamut of why people and limited in what activity associated with the marketing.

The remainder of the higher end products, where there was complex Internet solutions or data products were really offered under the Verizon business brand. So as we come in, we'll be introducing Frontier brand and competing for total solutions with customers from ACP perspective as well as advanced Ethernet applications and beginning to offer those very quickly just as we establish distribution channel. This is very different than the last horizon acquisition, where we had to build out the network people offer those products it took several years and this takes network is in very good shape, with the capabilities existing currently, as a matter of marrying distribution strategy around capabilities and then executing. So we think that is a near-term opportunity and we're working on it right now."

Good morning, and thank you for joining Frontier's First Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. I'm going to discuss our first quarter results, update you on our acquisition of California, Texas, and Florida markets and share our outlook for the remainder of the year.
Please turn to Slide 3. During the first quarter, we were intensely focused on preparing for the closing of our California, Texas, and Florida acquisition, an enormous undertaking in terms of size and complexity. I am pleased to report that during this period, we continued to execute on our key strategic initiatives, and we delivered a solid first quarter. We maintained our momentum on broadband growth with net additions of more than 24,000. Our progress with business customers continues to be positive with another quarter of sequentially stable SME results, and our video initiative received a positive reception during its introductory quarter in its first market.
In Q1, over half of the broadband activity was at speeds above the basic speed tier. We increased a portion of sales from alternate channels in Q1 to 45% so that contact center team members could attend training and prepare for system modifications necessary for our integration of the new properties.
I'm pleased with these results given the magnitude of changes we were implementing in Q1 in preparation for the deal closure. With this transaction completed, we have dramatically increased our scale with the addition of approximately 3.3 million voice customers, 2.1 million broadband connections and 1.2 to million FiOS video subscribers as well as relate businesses. We've also welcomed approximately 9,400 new employees to the Frontier team. 
The cutover that began in April 1 was the largest and most complex flash cut that has ever been executed in our industry that I'm proud to say that it's been very successful. We took lessons from previous cutovers and applied them to strengthen our processes and minimize service interruption. As with any transfer of this scale and complexity, there were some issues at the outset, but these affected less than 1% of our customers in total and much less than that at any point in time. As we move through the initial transition period, we identified and addressed a number of issues with imperfect data extracts and network complexities. We were able to modify our business practices and conduct additional rounds of employee training immediately because of our extensive preparation and the contingency procedures we had developed. This delayed the rate of reaching a normal business cadence, and as a result, we were slower in responding to customers and restoring service. This disappointed some customers and resulted in some negative publicity in the market. We now have these issues resolved and behind us. At this point, we have completed all business and residential billing cycles for the first month of ownership.
We know that disruptions of any kind are frustrating for customers, and our teams worked around-the-clock to resolve outstanding issues and restore service. This cutover required extensive training of more than 10,000 field technicians and customers service representatives, which can only take place after the transaction was closed.
During this training period, we relied on partners to help us support customer service requests. As of today, we have completed that training. We have our customer service teams back to full strength, and we will be reducing reliance on the temporary partner. We expect this to have a significant positive impact on the customer experience.
All service issues related to the conversion have been substantially resolved, and a level of reported outages is now trending at approximately the levels we expect for this property. We continue to monitor customer call trends closely and are doing everything we can to respond and improve the customer experience.
I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our customers for their patience throughout this process, and I would like to thank all of our employees for their outstanding efforts on this very challenging transformation.
I see a great deal of potential in these 3 new markets. In addition to increased scale, they each have significant growth opportunity. California, Texas, and Florida are projected to account for nearly half of the U.S. population growth over the next decade. We are expanding into these markets with leading-edge capabilities, including networks that are 55% FiOS-enabled. With the completion of this acquisition, we have begun to refine our expectations for 2016, and we are targeting a range of free cash flow of between $800 million and $925 million, and John will cover our guidance in additional detail momentarily.
As we continue to learn more about these markets and the employees who have joined us, we believe we will be in a strong position to drive significant additional benefits for our customers and shareholders.
I expect the second quarter to be impacted by integration in a few ways. As part of the integration plans, we minimized marketing efforts to allow our teams to gain proficiency and utilization of the Frontier systems to operate the business. This will impact the gross additions in these new operations. This was planned and necessary to ensure we were capable of meeting higher activity level. As a result, we anticipate that the customer metrics for the second quarter will most likely be negative as we begin to build our marketing campaigns over the coming week. 
Please turn to Slide 4. Let me review the opportunity for Frontier going forward. We will continue to be focused on increasing our broadband opportunities, both in FiOS and copper market. We are building out increased speed capabilities across our network using both our own funds as well as CAF II funds for rural areas. We have substantial opportunity to increase our broadband penetration, and we are at the beginning of a multiyear program to offer video service to an increasing portion of our footprint. We can service slightly over 30% of our 14.5 million household footprint with video today, and we anticipate that will grow to well in excess of half over the coming years. We believe that the expanded reach of our video capability will help us attract new customers to Frontier for both video and broadband service. We will continue expanding our capabilities for business customers, particularly in the newly acquired California, Texas, and Florida markets. This includes developing direct and indirect channels to service the opportunities we see in these markets. And we will continue to focus on improving customer retention. We anticipate that as these trends grow in their contribution, increasing availability of video through our compelling low-risk deployment plan, improving broadband speeds, increasing retention and broader availability of our compelling business offering that our revenue trends should improve. Furthermore, we continue to have a substantial opportunity to improve efficiencies across the business. 
This is an exciting time for Frontier. We appreciate the investment community's ongoing patience and confidence as we execute on the transformation of Frontier's business. 
I will now hand the call over to our CFO, John Jureller, who will go into more detail on our financial performance."

Frontier reported a loss per common share of $0.21 in the first quarter of 2016 after dividends on our preferred stock compared to a loss per common share of $0.14 in the fourth quarter of 2015 and a loss of $0.05 per common share in the f",1431,"Thank you, Dan. Frontier reported a loss per common share of $0.21 in the first quarter of 2016 after dividends on our preferred stock compared to a loss per common share of $0.14 in the fourth quarter of 2015 and a loss of $0.05 per common share in the first quarter of 2015.
Adjusting for dividends on preferred stock, acquisition-related interest expense, acquisition and integration costs, severance costs and certain tax items, our non-GAAP adjusted net income was $0.01 per share in the first quarter 2016 compared to $0.05 per share in the fourth quarter of 2015 and $0.02 per share in the first quarter of 2015. On May 2, the board declared a common dividend of $0.105 per share for the second quarter 2016 payable June 30, in line with the dividend rate in recent quarters. We will also be paying the regularly scheduled dividend on our preferred shares on June 30.
Please turn to Slide 5. First quarter revenue was $1.36 billion as compared to $1.41 billion in the fourth quarter. Revenue declined by $58 million, reflecting the anticipated sequential step-down in CAF II revenues of $39 million as well as the decline in voice services revenue, partially offset by an increase in data services revenue.
Customer revenue, up $1.19 billion was down $18 million sequentially or negative 1.5%, reflecting the sequential decline in voice revenue. Total residential customer revenue was $583 million was down $11 million as compared to Q4. The decline was primarily due to a decrease in voice revenue. During the quarter, we continue to migrate the Connecticut-based customers, who received the 1-year acquisition pricing offers beginning in late 2014 and through early 2015, back to the non-promotional pricing.
Business customer revenue of $606 million was down only $7 million sequentially. Within business, as Dan noted, SME revenue was stable sequentially. Approximately 1/2 of the quarterly sequential decline was due to the anticipated reduction in wireless backhaul revenue.
Total data and Internet services revenue declined slightly from the prior quarter. During the quarter, our residential, combined with SME, data and Internet services revenues continued to increase. This was offset by the decline in wireless backhaul and other carrier revenue. The rate of voice revenue decline improved from the fourth quarter. In Q1, we had a sequential improvement in the impact from residential rate migrations and a stable trend in residential voice disconnects.
Regulatory revenue for the quarter was $166 million, a sequential decrease of $40 million. This reflects the anticipated CAF II revenue recognition as we recognize revenue throughout the year as compared to 2015 when the incremental subsidy revenue recognition was concentrated in Q3 and Q4. Beginning in the second quarter, the regulatory revenue will increase by approximately $12 million per quarter due to the incremental CAF II subsidy revenue for California and Texas.
Residential average revenue per customer, or ARPC, was $62.64 for the first quarter of 2016, a decline of 0.8% sequentially. This reduction reflects a continued decline in the percentage of customers that bundle voice as well as the residual impact from the migration to Stay Connected rates that occurred in Q4. Prior years have shown that we see a return to Stay Connected residential voice revenue in Q2 and Q3. Business ARPC was up 0.6% sequentially. 
In Q1, our residential customer churn was 1.83% and expect a slight seasonal increase over 1.76% in Q4 but a material improvement as compared to the 1.97% in Q3 2015.
Cash operating expenses of $827 million represented an increase of $14 million sequentially. However, this is better than the sequential estimates we had provided on the fourth quarter earnings call. The improvements came from multiple areas, including operations, third-party services and benefits expense.
The adjusted operating cash flow or EBITDA margin in the first quarter was 38.9%, a decline from Q4 that we anticipated due to the lesser amount of CAF II revenue recognized in the respective quarters and from the estimated sequential increase in cash operating expenses.
Capital expenditures were $207 million in the first quarter, and we spent an additional $52 million in CapEx related to integration activities.
Please turn to Slide 6. Frontier's cash flow remains very healthy. Our adjusted free cash flow was $187 million in the first quarter. Our dividend payout ratio, adjusted to exclude the incremental dividends and interest expense on the capital raised for our transaction with Verizon, was 56% in the first quarter as compared to 43% in the fourth quarter of 2015. The adjusted dividend payout ratio excludes the incremental capital cost of the debt and equity capital for the acquisition and we believe remains the appropriate measure until we begin to include the operating cash flow from the acquisition.
Please turn to Slide 7. Our leverage ratio at the end of Q1 was 3.85x. Pro forma for the inclusion of the Verizon transaction and incremental debt, based upon our trailing 12-month results, the reported Verizon Separate Telephone Operations pro forma results for 2015 as filed in our recent 8-K and an estimated $600 million of annualized net cost synergies, the net debt-to-EBITDA ratio would have been approximately 4x.
Frontier's liquidity position remains robust. Excluding the restricted cash that was earmarked for our acquisition, we ended the quarter with approximately $1.25 billion in cash and credit availability. Our debt maturities schedule is well laddered, and we have the ability to comfortably manage the debt maturities coming due over the next few years.
Frontier's capital allocation framework remains unchanged. We will invest appropriately in our network infrastructure and operations, including our newly acquired operations, support our current dividend and utilize remaining cash flow to reduce debt in our leverage ratio. We are committed to maintaining our liquidity and reducing our leverage over time.
Please turn to Slide 8. With the California, Texas, and Florida acquisition completed effective April 1, let's look at Frontier's outlook for the full year 2016. We anticipate full year 2016 adjusted free cash flow, otherwise known as leveraged free cash flow, to be in the range of $800 million to $925 million. The adjusted free cash flow guidance range is after the deduction of dividends paid on the preferred shares. This includes the contribution from 3 quarters of the newly acquired operations. The adjusted free cash flow guidance includes the in year benefit of the cost synergies with respect to this transaction. This guidance estimate excludes our remaining integration spending in 2016, the majority of which is estimated to be completed in the second quarter.
Within this quarter, we will be filing the Verizon Separate Telephone Operations Q1 2016 financial results and pro forma adjustments, which will provide further information on the most recent operating trends in this business.
We anticipate capital expenditures of $1.25 billion to $1.4 billion in 2016, inclusive of our CAF II-related expenditures but excluding the integration spending.
We continue to estimate full year cash taxes in the range of $5 million to $15 million, including the impact of our acquisition. 
We estimate cash pension contributions for 2016 in the $15 million to $20 million range, inclusive of the pension funding obligations for the transferring employee workforce in California, Texas, and Florida.
We estimate that 2016 reported interest expense will be in the range of $1.53 billion to $1.55 billion. Keep in mind that interest expense in Q2 will step up sequentially from the first quarter by about $20 million, reflecting the drawing of a term loan A at the quarter end to fund the acquisition as well as the interest related to the debt we have assumed from Verizon at the closing. We estimate that interest expense, excluding the Q1 portion of the interest expense on a $6.6 billion of acquisition-related debt, will be in the range of $1.34 billion to $1.36 billion. The adjusted free cash flow guidance range of $800 million to $925 million reflects this interest expense range.
Approximately 13% of our debt is at floating interest rates, so we have relatively minor exposure to fluctuations in variable interest rates.
In summary, Frontier's Q1 2016 operating results, our opportunities with the California, Texas, and Florida acquisition, our prudent capital investments and expense management all provide a strong base -- cash flow base and a solid financial platform for supporting and investing in the business. We have ample capital to invest in and enhance our competitive infrastructure, service our debt and comfortably sustain our dividend and maintain the dividend payout ratio superior to others in the telecom sector. 
With that, I'll pass the call back to the operator, who will open up the line for questions."

As part of the normal process, what we try to do is minimize additional variables that could be introduced into the first 2 months or so of operation of the property. And it's our -- it's kind of our standard to not introduce a lot of marketing calls. One because we were relying up until this week on third-party partners on the customer service side to answer a number of calls, but more importantly, we wanted to allow our field technicians, our support teams that are there helping them on a daily basis to get good at -- and proficient at using our systems. So as a result, what you tend to see in the first month or 2 of operation is the normal activity that's happening in the market. That could be everything from people moving out of a market to different individuals making decisions to go with a different provider, all of the gamut of why people disconnect and limited in where activity is associated with the marketing. So as a result, you actually will see a negative subscriber metric for Q2. And then we anticipate that changing to more normal rhythms as we exit the quarter and move in to Q3. So we wouldn't have the inward activity from a subscriber perspective and potentially inward activity revenue associated with a month or 2 of revenue with those customers. That's what I was really trying to make sure everybody understood."

I mean, CAF II can have some benefits in certain areas that may enable a slightly larger footprint availability in those markets, but it really -- it's not really the driver on the video. The video is really around leveraging the investment that we've made historically in the market from a transportation perspective and also from an electronics perspective. And the low cost deployment is really about how little it takes to enable a market from a video capability perspective. And generally, that is enabling what people refer to as a video head office in a market. And the technology, as we've described on the last call, really are -- have come down from a cost perspective on routing, on server architecture and also the codec around compression that's used in these markets really are what makes it very low cost as opposed to some of our peers in the past who might have been forced with -- to deal with much higher cost to enter a market.

So I think the reality is that the SEC will find many of the markets very competitive, and it won't have much of an impact at all.

But we're -- we obviously have said probably we're not -- we don't think that there's a real need for regulation on the Ethernet side of the business, and we still believe that today. And I think the FCC will see that as they move through it. On the special access side of the equation, it was really focused on TDM services that were -- what people referred to as DS1s and DS3s, so older file transport. It was not really focused on the IP-based services, and it was really, for us, limited to looking at some special tariffs that were filed by Verizon and AT&T that we inherit as part of the acquisition. From our perspective, any changes to that will be prospective. We don't anticipate any large impact to our revenue streams, and we will be working with the FCC moving forward as they make decisions on how to modify pricing terms for customers supporting."

This is very different than the last Verizon acquisition, where we had to build out a network to be able to offer those products, and it took several years. In this case, the network is in very good shape with the capabilities existing currently. And it's a matter of marrying distribution strategy around capabilities and then executing.

Good morning, and thank you for joining Frontier's First Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. I'm going to discuss our first quarter results, update you on our acquisition of California, Texas, and Florida markets and share our outlook for the remainder of the year.
Please turn to Slide 3. During the first quarter, we were intensely focused on preparing for the closing of our California, Texas, and Florida acquisition, an enormous undertaking in terms of size and complexity. I am pleased to report that during this period, we continued to execute on our key strategic initiatives, and we delivered a solid first quarter. We maintained our momentum on broadband growth with net additions of more than 24,000. Our progress with business customers continues to be positive with another quarter of sequentially stable SME results, and our video initiative received a positive reception during its introductory quarter in its first market.
In Q1, over half of the broadband activity was at speeds above the basic speed tier. We increased a portion of sales from alternate channels in Q1 to 45% so that contact center team members could attend training and prepare for system modifications necessary for our integration of the new properties.
I'm pleased with these results given the magnitude of changes we were implementing in Q1 in preparation for the deal closure. With this transaction completed, we have dramatically increased our scale with the addition of approximately 3.3 million voice customers, 2.1 million broadband connections and 1.2 million FiOS video subscribers as well as related businesses. We've also welcomed approximately 9,400 new employees to the Frontier team. 
The cutover that began in April 1 was the largest and most complex flash cut that has ever been executed in our industry that I'm proud to say that it's been very successful. We took lessons from previous cutovers and applied them to strengthen our processes and minimize service interruption. As with any transfer of this scale and complexity, there were some issues at the outset, but these affected less than 1% of our customers in total and much less than that at any point in time. As we move through the initial transition period, we identified and addressed a number of issues with imperfect data extracts and network complexities. We were able to modify our business practices and conduct additional rounds of employee training immediately because of our extensive preparation and the contingency procedures we had developed. This delayed the rate of reaching a normal business cadence, and as a result, we were slower in responding to customers and restoring service. This disappointed some customers and resulted in some negative publicity in the market. We now have these issues resolved and behind us. At this point, we have completed all business and residential billing cycles for the first month of ownership.
We know that disruptions of any kind are frustrating for customers, and our teams worked around-the-clock to resolve outstanding issues and restore service. This cutover required extensive training of more than 10,000 field technicians and customers service representatives, which can only take place after the transaction was closed.
During this training period, we relied on partners to help us support customer service requests. As of today, we have completed that training. We have our customer service teams back to full strength, and we will be reducing reliance on the temporary partner. We expect this to have a significant positive impact on the customer experience.
All service issues related to the conversion have been substantially resolved, and a level of reported outages is now trending at approximately the levels we expect for this property. We continue to monitor customer call trends closely and are doing everything we can to respond and improve the customer experience.
I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our customers for their patience throughout this process, and I would like to thank all of our employees for their outstanding efforts on this very challenging transformation.
I see a great deal of potential in these 3 new markets. In addition to increased scale, they each have significant growth opportunity. California, Texas, and Florida are projected to account for nearly half of the U.S. population growth over the next decade. We are expanding into these markets with leading-edge capabilities, including networks that are 55% FiOS-enabled. With the completion of this acquisition, we have begun to refine our expectations for 2016, and we are targeting a range of free cash flow of between $800 million and $925 million, and John will cover our guidance in additional detail momentarily.
As we continue to learn more about these markets and the employees who have joined us, we believe we will be in a strong position to drive significant additional benefits for our customers and shareholders.
I expect the second quarter to be impacted by integration in a few ways. As part of the integration plans, we minimized marketing efforts to allow our teams to gain proficiency in utilization of the Frontier systems to operate the business. This will impact the gross additions in these new operations. This was planned and necessary to ensure we were capable of meeting higher activity level. As a result, we anticipate that the customer metrics for the second quarter will most likely be negative as we begin to build our marketing campaigns over the coming week. 
Please turn to Slide 4. Let me review the opportunity for Frontier going forward. We will continue to be focused on increasing our broadband opportunities, both in FiOS and copper market. We are building out increased speed capabilities across our network using both our own funds as well as CAF II funds for rural areas. We have substantial opportunity to increase our broadband penetration, and we are at the beginning of a multiyear program to offer video service to an increasing portion of our footprint. We can service slightly over 30% of our 14.5 million household footprint with video today, and we anticipate that will grow to well in excess of half over the coming years. We believe that the expanded reach of our video capability will help us attract new customers to Frontier for both video and broadband service. We will continue expanding our capabilities for business customers, particularly in the newly acquired California, Texas, and Florida markets. This includes developing direct and indirect channels to service the opportunities we see in these markets. And we will continue to focus on improving customer retention. We anticipate that as these trends grow in their contribution, increasing availability of video through our compelling low-risk deployment plan, improving broadband speeds, increasing retention and broader availability of our compelling business offering that our revenue trends should improve. Furthermore, we continue to have a substantial opportunity to improve efficiencies across the business. 
This is an exciting time for Frontier. We appreciate the investment community's ongoing patience and confidence as we execute on the transformation of Frontier's business. 
I will now hand the call over to our CFO, John Jureller, who will go into more detail on our financial performance."

Frontier reported a loss per common share of $0.21 in the first quarter of 2016 after dividends on our preferred stock compared to a loss per common share of $0.14 in the fourth quarter of 2015 and a loss of $0.05 per common share in the first quarter of 2015.
Adjusting for dividends on preferred stock, acquisition-related interest expense, acquisition and integration costs, severance costs and certain tax items, our non-GAAP adjusted net income was $0.01 per share in the first quarter 2016 compared to $0.05 per share in the fourth quarter of 2015 and $0.02 per share in the first quarter of 2015. On May 2, the board declared a common dividend of $0.105 per share for the second quarter 2016 payable June 30, in line with the dividend rate in recent quarters. We will also be paying the regularly scheduled dividend on our preferred shares on June 30.
Please turn to Slide 5. First quarter revenue was $1.36 billion as compared to $1.41 billion in the fourth quarter. Revenue declined by $58 million, reflecting the anticipated sequential step-down in CAF II revenues of $39 million as well as the decline in voice services revenue, partially offset by an increase in data services revenue.
Customer revenue, up $1.19 billion was down $18 million sequentially or negative 1.5%, reflecting the sequential decline in voice revenue. Total residential customer revenue was $583 million was down $11 million as compared to Q4. The decline was primarily due to a decrease in voice revenue. During the quarter, we continue to migrate the Connecticut-based customers, who received the 1-year acquisition pricing offers beginning in late 2014 and through early 2015, back to the non-promotional pricing.
Business customer revenue of $606 million was down only $7 million sequentially. Within business, as Dan noted, SME revenue was stable sequentially. Approximately 1/2 of the quarterly sequential decline was due to the anticipated reduction in wireless backhaul revenue.
Total data and Internet services revenue declined slightly from the prior quarter. During the quarter, our residential, combined with SME, data and Internet services revenues continued to increase. This was offset by the decline in wireless backhaul and other carrier revenue. The rate of voice revenue decline improved from the fourth quarter. In Q1, we had a sequential improvement in the impact from residential rate migrations and a stable trend in residential voice disconnects.
Regulatory revenue for the quarter was $166 million, a sequential decrease of $40 million. This reflects the anticipated CAF II revenue recognition as we recognize revenue throughout the year as compared to 2015 when the incremental subsidy revenue recognition was concentrated in Q3 and Q4. Beginning in the second quarter, the regulatory revenue will increase by approximately $12 million per quarter due to the incremental CAF II subsidy revenue for California and Texas.
Residential average revenue per customer, or ARPC, was $62.64 for the first quarter of 2016, a decline of 0.8% sequentially. This reduction reflects a continued decline in the percentage of customers that bundle voice as well as the residual impact from the migration to Stay Connected rates that occurred in Q4. Prior years have shown that we see a return to Stay Connected residential voice revenue in Q2 and Q3. Business ARPC was up 0.6% sequentially. 
In Q1, our residential customer churn was 1.83% and expect a slight seasonal increase over 1.76% in Q4 but a material improvement as compared to the 1.97% in Q3 2015.
Cash operating expenses of $827 million represented an increase of $14 million sequentially. However, this is better than the sequential estimates we had provided on the fourth quarter earnings call. The improvements came from multiple areas, including operations, third-party services and benefits expense.
The adjusted operating cash flow or EBITDA margin in the first quarter was 38.9%, a decline from Q4 that we anticipated due to the lesser amount of CAF II revenue recognized in the respective quarters and from the estimated sequential increase in cash operating expenses.
Capital expenditures were $207 million in the first quarter, and we spent an additional $52 million in CapEx related to integration activities.
Please turn to Slide 6. Frontier's cash flow remains very healthy. Our adjusted free cash flow was $187 million in the first quarter. Our dividend payout ratio, adjusted to exclude the incremental dividends and interest expense on the capital raised for our transaction with Verizon, was 56% in the first quarter as compared to 43% in the fourth quarter of 2015. The adjusted dividend payout ratio excludes the incremental capital cost of the debt and equity capital for the acquisition and we believe remains the appropriate measure until we begin to include the operating cash flow from the acquisition.
Please turn to Slide 7. Our leverage ratio at the end of Q1 was 3.85x. Pro forma for the inclusion of the Verizon transaction and incremental debt, based upon our trailing 12-month results, the reported Verizon Separate Telephone Operations pro forma results for 2015 as filed in our recent 8-K and an estimated $600 million of annualized net cost synergies, the net debt-to-EBITDA ratio would have been approximately 4x.
Frontier's liquidity position remains robust. Excluding the restricted cash that was earmarked for our acquisition, we ended the quarter with approximately $1.25 billion in cash and credit availability. Our debt maturities schedule is well laddered, and we have the ability to comfortably manage the debt maturities coming due over the next few years.
Frontier's capital allocation framework remains unchanged. We will invest appropriately in our network infrastructure and operations, including our newly acquired operations, support our current dividend and utilize remaining cash flow to reduce debt in our leverage ratio. We are committed to maintaining our liquidity and reducing our leverage over time.
Please turn to Slide 8. With the California, Texas, and Florida acquisition completed effective April 1, let's look at Frontier's outlook for the full year 2016. We anticipate full year 2016 adjusted free cash flow, otherwise known as leveraged free cash flow, to be in the range of $800 million to $925 million. The adjusted free cash flow guidance range is after the deduction of dividends paid on the preferred shares. This includes the contribution from 3 quarters of the newly acquired operations. The adjusted free cash flow guidance includes the in year benefit of the cost synergies with respect to this transaction. This guidance estimate excludes our remaining integration spending in 2016, the majority of which is estimated to be completed in the second quarter.
Within this quarter, we will be filing the Verizon Separate Telephone Operations Q1 2016 financial results and pro forma adjustments, which will provide further information on the most recent operating trends in this business.
We anticipate capital expenditures of $1.25 billion to $1.4 billion in 2016, inclusive of our CAF II-related expenditures but excluding the integration spending.
We continue to estimate full year cash taxes in the range of $5 million to $15 million, including the impact of our acquisition. 
We estimate cash pension contributions for 2016 in the $15 million to $20 million range, inclusive of the pension funding obligations for the transferring employee workforce in California, Texas, and Florida.
We estimate that 2016 reported interest expense will be in the range of $1.53 billion to $1.55 billion. Keep in mind that interest expense in Q2 will step up sequentially from the first quarter by about $20 million, reflecting the drawing of a term loan A at the quarter end to fund the acquisition as well as the interest related to the debt we have assumed from Verizon at the closing. We estimate that interest expense, excluding the Q1 portion of the interest expense on a $6.6 billion of acquisition-related debt, will be in the range of $1.34 billion to $1.36 billion. The adjusted free cash flow guidance range of $800 million to $925 million reflects this interest expense range.
Approximately 13% of our debt is at floating interest rates, so we have relatively minor exposure to fluctuations in variable interest rates.
In summary, Frontier's Q1 2016 operating results, our opportunities with the California, Texas, and Florida acquisition, our prudent capital investments and expense management all provide a strong base -- cash flow base and a solid financial platform for supporting and investing in the business. We have ample capital to invest in and enhance our competitive infrastructure, service our debt and comfortably sustain our dividend and maintain the dividend payout ratio superior to others in the telecom sector. 
With that, I'll pass the call back to the operator, who will open up the line for questions."

As part of the normal process, what we try to do is minimize additional variables that could be introduced into the first 2 months or so of operation of the property. And it's our -- it's kind of our standard to not introduce a lot of marketing calls. One because we were relying up until this week on third-party partners on the customer service side to answer a number of calls, but more importantly, we wanted to allow our field technicians, our support teams that are there helping them on a daily basis to get good at -- and proficient at using our systems. So as a result, what you tend to see in the first month or 2 of operation is the normal de-activity that's happening in the market. That could be everything from people moving out of a market to different individuals making decisions to go with a different provider, all of the gamut of why people disconnect and limited in where activity is associated with the marketing. So as a result, you actually will see a negative subscriber metric for Q2. And then we anticipate that changing to more normal rhythms as we exit the quarter and move in to Q3. So we wouldn't have the inward activity from a subscriber perspective and potentially inward activity revenue associated with a month or 2 of revenue with those customers.

I mean, CAF II can have some benefits in certain areas that may enable a slightly larger footprint availability in those markets, but it really -- it's not really the driver on the video. The video is really around leveraging the investment that we've made historically in the market from a transportation perspective and also from an electronics perspective. And the low cost deployment is really about how little it takes to enable a market from a video capability perspective. And generally, that is enabling what people refer to as a video head office in a market. And the technology, as we've described on the last call, really are -- have come down from a cost perspective on routing, on server architecture and also the codec around compression that's used in these markets really are what makes it very low cost as opposed to some of our peers in the past who might have been forced with -- to deal with much higher cost to enter a market. So we don't see a whole lot of loop shortening in the short term, so that really doesn't drive a lot of CapEx. And it's really about selecting where we think the highest opportunity are.

But we're -- we obviously have said publicly we're not -- we don't think that there's a real need for regulation on the Ethernet side of the business, and we still believe that today. And I think the FCC will see that as they move through it. On the special access side of the equation, it was really focused on TDM services that were -- what people referred to as DS1s and DS3s, so older file transport. It was not really focused on the IP-based services, and it was really, for us, limited to looking at some special tariffs that were filed by Verizon and AT&T that we inherit as part of the acquisition. From our perspective, any changes to that will be prospective. We don't anticipate any large impact to our revenue streams, and we will be working with the FCC moving forward as they make decisions on how to modify pricing terms for customers supporting them."

So as we come in, we'll be introducing a Frontier brand and competing for total solutions with customers from a CPE perspective as well as advanced Ethernet applications. And we anticipate beginning to offer those very quickly just as we establish the distribution channels. This is very different than the last Verizon acquisition, where we had to build out a network to be able to offer those products, and it took several years. In this case, the network is in very good shape with the capabilities existing currently. And it's a matter of marrying distribution strategy around capabilities and then executing. So we think that is a near-term opportunity, and we're working on it right now."

Good morning, and thank you for joining Frontier's First Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. I'm going to discuss our first quarter results, update you on our acquisition of California, Texas, and Florida markets and share our outlook for the remainder of the year.
Please turn to Slide 3. During the first quarter, we were intensely focused on preparing for the closing of our California, Texas, and Florida acquisition, an enormous undertaking in terms of size and complexity. I am pleased to report that during this period, we continued to execute on our key strategic initiatives, and we delivered a solid first quarter. We maintained our momentum on broadband growth with net additions of more than 24,000. Our progress with business customers continues to be positive with another quarter of sequentially stable SME results, and our video initiative received a positive reception during its introductory quarter in its first market.
In Q1, over half of the broadband activity was at speeds above the basic speed tier. We increased a portion of sales from alternate channels in Q1 to 45% so that contact center team members could attend training and prepare for system modifications necessary for our integration of the new properties.
I'm pleased with these results given the magnitude of changes we were implementing in Q1 in preparation for the deal closure. With this transaction completed, we have dramatically increased our scale with the addition of approximately 3.3 million voice customers, 2.1 million broadband connections and 1.2 million FiOS video subscribers as well as related businesses. We've also welcomed approximately 9,400 new employees to the Frontier team. 
The cutover that began in April 1 was the largest and most complex flash cut that has ever been executed in our industry that I'm proud to say that it's been very successful. We took lessons from previous cutovers and applied them to strengthen our processes and minimize service interruption. As with any transfer of this scale and complexity, there were some issues at the outset, but these affected less than 1% of our customers in total and much less than that at any point in time. As we move through the initial transition period, we identified and addressed a number of issues with imperfect data extracts and network complexities. We were able to modify our business practices and conduct additional rounds of employee training immediately because of our extensive preparation and the contingency procedures we had developed. This delayed the rate of reaching a normal business cadence, and as a result, we were slower in responding to customers and restoring service. This disappointed some customers and resulted in some negative publicity in the market. We now have these issues resolved and behind us. At this point, we have completed all business and residential billing cycles for the first month of ownership.
We know that disruptions of any kind are frustrating for customers, and our teams worked around-the-clock to resolve outstanding issues and restore service. This cutover required extensive training of more than 10,000 field technicians and customers service representatives, which can only take place after the transaction was closed.
During this training period, we relied on partners to help us support customer service requests. As of today, we have completed that training. We have our customer service teams back to full strength, and we will be reducing reliance on the temporary partner. We expect this to have a significant positive impact on the customer experience.
All service issues related to the conversion have been substantially resolved, and a level of reported outages is now trending at approximately the levels we expect for this property. We continue to monitor customer call trends closely and are doing everything we can to respond and improve the customer experience.
I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our customers for their patience throughout this process, and I would like to thank all of our employees for their outstanding efforts on this very challenging transformation.
I see a great deal of potential in these 3 new markets. In addition to increased scale, they each have significant growth opportunity. California, Texas, and Florida are projected to account for nearly half of the U.S. population growth over the next decade. We are expanding into these markets with leading-edge capabilities, including networks that are 55% FiOS-enabled. With the completion of this acquisition, we have begun to refine our expectations for 2016, and we are targeting a range of free cash flow of between $800 million and $925 million, and John will cover our guidance in additional detail momentarily.
As we continue to learn more about these markets and the employees who have joined us, we believe we will be in a strong position to drive significant additional benefits for our customers and shareholders.
I expect the second quarter to be impacted by integration in a few ways. As part of the integration plans, we minimized marketing efforts to allow our teams to gain proficiency in utilization of the Frontier systems to operate the business. This will impact the gross additions in these new operations. This was planned and necessary to ensure we were capable of meeting higher activity level. As a result, we anticipate that the customer metrics for the second quarter will most likely be negative as we begin to build our marketing campaigns over the coming week. 
Please turn to Slide 4. Let me review the opportunity for Frontier going forward. We will continue to be focused on increasing our broadband opportunities, both in FiOS and copper market. We are building out increased speed capabilities across our network using both our own funds as well as CAF II funds for rural areas. We have substantial opportunity to increase our broadband penetration, and we are at the beginning of a multiyear program to offer video service to an increasing portion of our footprint. We can service slightly over 30% of our 14.5 million household footprint with video today, and we anticipate that will grow to well in excess of half over the coming years. We believe that the expanded reach of our video capability will help us attract new customers to Frontier for both video and broadband service. We will continue expanding our capabilities for business customers, particularly in the newly acquired California, Texas, and Florida markets. This includes developing direct and indirect channels to service the opportunities we see in these markets. And we will continue to focus on improving customer retention. We anticipate that as these trends grow in their contribution, increasing availability of video through our compelling low-risk deployment plan, improving broadband speeds, increasing retention and broader availability of our compelling business offering that our revenue trends should improve. Furthermore, we continue to have a substantial opportunity to improve efficiencies across the business. 
This is an exciting time for Frontier. We appreciate the investment community's ongoing patience and confidence as we execute on the transformation of Frontier's business. 
I will now hand the call over to our CFO, John Jureller, who will go into more detail on our financial performance."

Frontier reported a loss per common share of $0.21 in the first quarter of 2016 after dividends on our preferred stock compared to a loss per common share of $0.14 in the fourth quarter of 2015 and a loss of $0.05 per common share in the f",1431,"Thank you, Dan. Frontier reported a loss per common share of $0.21 in the first quarter of 2016 after dividends on our preferred stock compared to a loss per common share of $0.14 in the fourth quarter of 2015 and a loss of $0.05 per common share in the first quarter of 2015.
Adjusting for dividends on preferred stock, acquisition-related interest expense, acquisition and integration costs, severance costs and certain tax items, our non-GAAP adjusted net income was $0.01 per share in the first quarter 2016 compared to $0.05 per share in the fourth quarter of 2015 and $0.02 per share in the first quarter of 2015. On May 2, the board declared a common dividend of $0.105 per share for the second quarter 2016 payable June 30, in line with the dividend rate in recent quarters. We will also be paying the regularly scheduled dividend on our preferred shares on June 30.
Please turn to Slide 5. First quarter revenue was $1.36 billion as compared to $1.41 billion in the fourth quarter. Revenue declined by $58 million, reflecting the anticipated sequential step-down in CAF II revenues of $39 million as well as the decline in voice services revenue, partially offset by an increase in data services revenue.
Customer revenue, up $1.19 billion was down $18 million sequentially or negative 1.5%, reflecting the sequential decline in voice revenue. Total residential customer revenue was $583 million was down $11 million as compared to Q4. The decline was primarily due to a decrease in voice revenue. During the quarter, we continue to migrate the Connecticut-based customers, who received the 1-year acquisition pricing offers beginning in late 2014 and through early 2015, back to the non-promotional pricing.
Business customer revenue of $606 million was down only $7 million sequentially. Within business, as Dan noted, SME revenue was stable sequentially. Approximately 1/2 of the quarterly sequential decline was due to the anticipated reduction in wireless backhaul revenue.
Total data and Internet services revenue declined slightly from the prior quarter. During the quarter, our residential, combined with SME, data and Internet services revenues continued to increase. This was offset by the decline in wireless backhaul and other carrier revenue. The rate of voice revenue decline improved from the fourth quarter. In Q1, we had a sequential improvement in the impact from residential rate migrations and a stable trend in residential voice disconnects.
Regulatory revenue for the quarter was $166 million, a sequential decrease of $40 million. This reflects the anticipated CAF II revenue recognition as we recognize revenue throughout the year as compared to 2015 when the incremental subsidy revenue recognition was concentrated in Q3 and Q4. Beginning in the second quarter, the regulatory revenue will increase by approximately $12 million per quarter due to the incremental CAF II subsidy revenue for California and Texas.
Residential average revenue per customer, or ARPC, was $62.64 for the first quarter of 2016, a decline of 0.8% sequentially. This reduction reflects a continued decline in the percentage of customers that bundle voice as well as the residual impact from the migration to Stay Connected rates that occurred in Q4. Prior years have shown that we see a return to Stay Connected residential voice revenue in Q2 and Q3. Business ARPC was up 0.6% sequentially. 
In Q1, our residential customer churn was 1.83% and expect a slight seasonal increase over 1.76% in Q4 but a material improvement as compared to the 1.97% in Q3 2015.
Cash operating expenses of $827 million represented an increase of $14 million sequentially. However, this is better than the sequential estimates we had provided on the fourth quarter earnings call. The improvements came from multiple areas, including operations, third-party services and benefits expense.
The adjusted operating cash flow or EBITDA margin in the first quarter was 38.9%, a decline from Q4 that we anticipated due to the lesser amount of CAF II revenue recognized in the respective quarters and from the estimated sequential increase in cash operating expenses.
Capital expenditures were $207 million in the first quarter, and we spent an additional $52 million in CapEx related to integration activities.
Please turn to Slide 6. Frontier's cash flow remains very healthy. Our adjusted free cash flow was $187 million in the first quarter. Our dividend payout ratio, adjusted to exclude the incremental dividends and interest expense on the capital raised for our transaction with Verizon, was 56% in the first quarter as compared to 43% in the fourth quarter of 2015. The adjusted dividend payout ratio excludes the incremental capital cost of the debt and equity capital for the acquisition and we believe remains the appropriate measure until we begin to include the operating cash flow from the acquisition.
Please turn to Slide 7. Our leverage ratio at the end of Q1 was 3.85x. Pro forma for the inclusion of the Verizon transaction and incremental debt, based upon our trailing 12-month results, the reported Verizon Separate Telephone Operations pro forma results for 2015 as filed in our recent 8-K and an estimated $600 million of annualized net cost synergies, the net debt-to-EBITDA ratio would have been approximately 4x.
Frontier's liquidity position remains robust. Excluding the restricted cash that was earmarked for our acquisition, we ended the quarter with approximately $1.25 billion in cash and credit availability. Our debt maturities schedule is well laddered, and we have the ability to comfortably manage the debt maturities coming due over the next few years.
Frontier's capital allocation framework remains unchanged. We will invest appropriately in our network infrastructure and operations, including our newly acquired operations, support our current dividend and utilize remaining cash flow to reduce debt in our leverage ratio. We are committed to maintaining our liquidity and reducing our leverage over time.
Please turn to Slide 8. With the California, Texas, and Florida acquisition completed effective April 1, let's look at Frontier's outlook for the full year 2016. We anticipate full year 2016 adjusted free cash flow, otherwise known as leveraged free cash flow, to be in the range of $800 million to $925 million. The adjusted free cash flow guidance range is after the deduction of dividends paid on the preferred shares. This includes the contribution from 3 quarters of the newly acquired operations. The adjusted free cash flow guidance includes the in year benefit of the cost synergies with respect to this transaction. This guidance estimate excludes our remaining integration spending in 2016, the majority of which is estimated to be completed in the second quarter.
Within this quarter, we will be filing the Verizon Separate Telephone Operations Q1 2016 financial results and pro forma adjustments, which will provide further information on the most recent operating trends in this business.
We anticipate capital expenditures of $1.25 billion to $1.4 billion in 2016, inclusive of our CAF II-related expenditures but excluding the integration spending.
We continue to estimate full year cash taxes in the range of $5 million to $15 million, including the impact of our acquisition. 
We estimate cash pension contributions for 2016 in the $15 million to $20 million range, inclusive of the pension funding obligations for the transferring employee workforce in California, Texas, and Florida.
We estimate that 2016 reported interest expense will be in the range of $1.53 billion to $1.55 billion. Keep in mind that interest expense in Q2 will step up sequentially from the first quarter by about $20 million, reflecting the drawing of a term loan A at the quarter end to fund the acquisition as well as the interest related to the debt we have assumed from Verizon at the closing. We estimate that interest expense, excluding the Q1 portion of the interest expense on a $6.6 billion of acquisition-related debt, will be in the range of $1.34 billion to $1.36 billion. The adjusted free cash flow guidance range of $800 million to $925 million reflects this interest expense range.
Approximately 13% of our debt is at floating interest rates, so we have relatively minor exposure to fluctuations in variable interest rates.
In summary, Frontier's Q1 2016 operating results, our opportunities with the California, Texas, and Florida acquisition, our prudent capital investments and expense management all provide a strong base -- cash flow base and a solid financial platform for supporting and investing in the business. We have ample capital to invest in and enhance our competitive infrastructure, service our debt and comfortably sustain our dividend and maintain the dividend payout ratio superior to others in the telecom sector. 
With that, I'll pass the call back to the operator, who will open up the line for questions."

As part of the normal process, what we try to do is minimize additional variables that could be introduced into the first 2 months or so of operation of the property. And it's our -- it's kind of our standard to not introduce a lot of marketing calls. One because we were relying up until this week on third-party partners on the customer service side to answer a number of calls, but more importantly, we wanted to allow our field technicians, our support teams that are there helping them on a daily basis to get good at -- and proficient at using our systems. So as a result, what you tend to see in the first month or 2 of operation is the normal de-activity that's happening in the market. That could be everything from people moving out of a market to different individuals making decisions to go with a different provider, all of the gamut of why people disconnect and limited in where activity is associated with the marketing. So as a result, you actually will see a negative subscriber metric for Q2. And then we anticipate that changing to more normal rhythms as we exit the quarter and move in to Q3. So we wouldn't have the inward activity from a subscriber perspective and potentially inward activity revenue associated with a month or 2 of revenue with those customers. That's what I was really trying to make sure everybody understood."

I mean, CAF II can have some benefits in certain areas that may enable a slightly larger footprint availability in those markets, but it really -- it's not really the driver on the video. The video is really around leveraging the investment that we've made historically in the market from a transportation perspective and also from an electronics perspective. And the low cost deployment is really about how little it takes to enable a market from a video capability perspective. And generally, that is enabling what people refer to as a video head office in a market. And the technology, as we've described on the last call, really are -- have come down from a cost perspective on routing, on server architecture and also the codec around compression that's used in these markets really are what makes it very low cost as opposed to some of our peers in the past who might have been forced with -- to deal with much higher cost to enter a market. So we don't see a whole lot of loop shortening in the short term, so that really doesn't drive a lot of CapEx. And it's really about selecting where we think the highest opportunity are.

So I think the reality is that the FCC will find many of the markets very competitive, and it won't have much of an impact at all. I think it's pretty premature at this point to predict what any final decision will look like because they're really in a fact-finding mode. But we're -- we obviously have said publicly we're not -- we don't think that there's a real need for regulation on the Ethernet side of the business, and we still believe that today. And I think the FCC will see that as they move through it. On the special access side of the equation, it was really focused on TDM services that were -- what people referred to as DS1s and DS3s, so older file transport. It was not really focused on the IP-based services, and it was really, for us, limited to looking at some special tariffs that were filed by Verizon and AT&T that we inherit as part of the acquisition. From our perspective, any changes to that will be prospective. We don't anticipate any large impact to our revenue streams, and we will be working with the FCC moving forward as they make decisions on how to modify pricing terms for customers supporting them."

And we anticipate beginning to offer those very quickly just as we establish the distribution channels. This is very different than the last Verizon acquisition, where we had to build out a network to be able to offer those products, and it took several years. In this case, the network is in very good shape with the capabilities existing currently. And it's a matter of marrying distribution strategy around capabilities and then executing.

This is a very significant and successful quarter for Frontier. Today, in addition to talking about the progress we have made during the quarter, we will update you",1452,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining Frontier's Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. This is a very significant and successful quarter for Frontier. 
Today, in addition to talking about the progress we have made during the quarter, we will update you on our strategy and operational plans going forward, review our synergy attainment within the quarter and share our outlook. 
Please turn to Slide 3. I'm particularly pleased to announce that following the successful cut over of the newly acquired assets, we achieved annualized integration cost synergies of $1 billion in the second quarter. This is a substantial out-performance relative to our original day 1 target $525 million. We have also raised our total synergy target to $1.25 billion, which is considerably above our prior $700 million target. 
We're particularly pleased that EBITDA from the acquisition met our expectations. Revenue for these assets was lower than anticipated as a result of a number of factors that John will discuss. But because of increased synergies, EBITDA remains in line with expectations. We have been very disciplined in our approach to operating the new markets. This included maintaining customer pricing and keeping promotions in line with those Verizon offered in these markets. Furthermore, we are utilizing retention offers similar to Verizon's, and we are managing the normal promotional expiration cycle well. The net result of these actions is illustrated by the relative stability of the revenue we achieved after Frontier became the owner of the properties. 
As we have discussed on our last call, during the cutover period, we temporarily suspended acquisition marketing activities. This resulted in an expected slowing in gross additions. We are now back to a typical level of marketing in the new properties that all customer service calls are now being handled domestically. As a result, we've seen good improvement in gross adds and expect it to reach normalized levels as we continue through this quarter. 
Turning to the commercial segment in the new markets. We have begun to implement our plans to build our direct and indirect commercial sales channel strategies. We expect to see traction in these channels in the fourth quarter time frame. As we focus on building our marketing programs in the consumer and commercial segments, we expect to drive revenue and free cash flow. We have also continued to execute our broadband network upgrade program in both existing and new markets. This program will result in the expansion of 50 megabits or higher broadband capability to 2 million homes over the next year. I'll discuss these exciting plans in more detail later in the call. 
With a full quarter of combined results, we also have narrowed our guidance range for this year, which John will discuss in more detail towards the end of our prepared remarks. 
And finally, we continue to be focused on cash generation, as illustrated by our common dividend payout ratio of 49% of free cash flow in the quarter. 
Please turn to Slide 4. Before we get into the details of the quarter, I'd like to take a moment to remind you of how well we are positioned moving forward. With the doubling of our size, Frontier now has the scale, technology and diversification to realize significant opportunities across our newly-expanded footprint. At the same time, we remain committed to our disciplined capital allocation strategy, including maintaining our sustainable, attractive dividend and delivering value to shareholders driven by recent strategic acquisitions and operational execution. 
Please turn to Slide 5 where I will discuss in more detail our plan to drive higher shareholder value from our significantly larger base of assets. We are expanding our revenue opportunities by transforming our network capabilities and creating long-term competitive advantage. In many of the non-FiOS areas, this will be the first time customers will have the ability to choose a competitive Internet service product. And we expect to see strong demand for these new capabilities. Our primary focus will be increasing broadband penetration and offering customers opportunities to access the new speeds and capabilities we will introduce. In addition, we will be offering a full suite of business solutions for the SME segment with expanded distribution channels. Within the FiOS markets, we have a very strong brand image and a product offering. We will continue to upgrade speeds and capacities to these markets to maintain our superior data and video offerings. And we believe we have further opportunity for market share gains. 
Our CAF II build remains underway, and we are on track to bring higher-speed capabilities to an additional 750,000 households over the coming years. Although the minimum speed in CAF II markets will be 10 megabits, many of these households will be served with higher speeds as we deploy the same leading-edge technology that is allowing us to improve the speed in our existing footprint. Our expansion of video service to new portions of our existing service territory is moving along very well. We expect to have video availability to about 0.5 million additional households by the end of this year. As we upgrade different markets in the new territories, we expect to introduce our Vantage TV product. This means that many non-FiOS areas in the new markets will become Vantage TV-enabled. As a result, our expansion of video will ultimately exceed the initial 3 million households previously announced. 
Our plans to upgrade broadband capabilities in the new markets and to introduce video creates a significant opportunity for revenue growth. The builds are extremely capital efficient and certainly far more capital efficient than the broadband and video upgrades undertaken by peer companies in the past. When complete, we will have great networks and capabilities in these markets, and we'll have created them at a capital intensity consistent with current guidance levels. 
On the commercial side, we are in the process of introducing distribution channels in the new markets. In addition, we are implementing our wholesale and retail product strategy with a focus on solutions for both FiOS and copper markets. 
Please turn to Slide 6. As we have promised, our revenue mix has been transformed as a result of this transaction. In doing so, we have dramatically increased our exposure to growing profitable market segments while reducing exposure to residential voice, which is down to just 14% of our revenue base. Furthermore, wireless backhaul is now less than 3% of revenue and will present less pressure going forward. As you consider our new broadband and video initiatives, they should result in higher growth of these categories over time. And you'll understand why we're so excited about the potential for revenue trends to improve going forward. 
Please turn to Slide 7. As we have completed our initial cutover efforts in the new properties, we have refocused the organization to develop plans to upgrade our speed offerings in our existing footprint and have begun to execute upgrade plans for the copper-based service in the new markets. The first phase of this upgrade will be accomplished over the coming quarters and will raise speeds in these upgraded areas from 7 megabits to 50 to 100 megabits. Following the upgrade, we will commence marketing and offering speed upgrades to current customers in these areas. 
In our current markets, we continue to invest in our network and in our management and provisioning platforms to expand higher-speed products. We expect to upgrade approximately 1.5 million homes to higher speeds over the next year. The combination of our plans to upgrade both the current and new markets improves our speed profile to approximately 2 million households. Following completion, over 40% of our households will be capable of receiving speeds in excess of 50 megabits. These upgrades improved a full 14% of our household path and provides a very competitive service offering. As we continue to develop our priorities for the new markets, we will update you on our deployment plans. The introduction of these new capabilities and the incorporation of the video capabilities in these markets using Vantage TV platform provides a tremendous opportunity to operate differentiated product set in areas that haven't had many competitive options. 
In summary, I am very pleased with the transition from integration to normal operations of the new markets. We have begun acquisition marketing and expect normal gross add levels to return over the coming quarter. We are also beginning to harvest the benefits in our existing markets from the system upgrades and enhancements needed for our Verizon integration efforts. As we pursue the revenue growth opportunities, we will also focus on improving our cost structure and realize the additional $250 million of cost savings over the next 3 years. 
And now I'll turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, John Jureller."
261171,372125793,1020603,"Frontier Communications Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 01, 2016",2016-08-01,"Earnings Calls","Frontier Communications Parent, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Dan. Please turn to Slide 8, where I'll start by going through key financial highlights. Second quarter revenue was $2.61 billion, up from $1.36 billion in the first quarter, with the acquisition of the new markets driving the substantial incre",1878,"Thank you, Dan. Please turn to Slide 8, where I'll start by going through key financial highlights. Second quarter revenue was $2.61 billion, up from $1.36 billion in the first quarter, with the acquisition of the new markets driving the substantial increase. We had a net loss to common shareholders of $80 million or $0.07 per share. Adjusted EBITDA of $1.03 billion represented a margin of 39.6%. We generated free cash flow of $250 million after payment of dividends on the preferred stock. 
Please turn to Slide 9. The second quarter revenue of $2.61 billion included $1.33 billion from the existing markets, down from $1.36 billion in the first quarter. Within our existing markets, the trend in residential is solid, with revenue down less than 1% sequentially, reflecting a full quarter benefit of the improved average revenue per customer, or ARPC, including from the roll-off of the Connecticut acquisition promotional pricing over the course of Q1 and Q2. We did see a sequential decline in business revenue, mostly driven by a decline in wholesale, including wireless backhaul. Adjusted operating expenses in Q2 in the existing markets improved by $6 million sequentially to $821 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $505 million for a margin of 38.1%. In terms of the new markets, the adjusted EBITDA of $527 million and a 41.2% margin met our expectations, with our superior performance in addressing the cost base of the acquired business offsetting the starting revenue received for the historical Verizon Separate Telephone Operations or VSTO business. 
Please turn to Slide 10. Let me take you through the revenue progression or jump-off as the acquired business came under our operational domain. It's important to have an appropriate starting point for these new markets and understand the results from activity under Frontier's ownership. 
We previously filed information with the historical VSTO financial performance. Today, we filed the same VSTO information for the first quarter of 2016. This information shows revenue of $1.394 billion in Q1 prior to any adjustments. 
Now let's go through the revenue block. First, as in previous filings, there was a pro forma adjustment for a minor amount of revenue and the reclassification of bad debt expense, a total of $16 million in that quarter. Second, upon closing, there was another $25 million of allocated revenue with no net impact to EBITDA that did not transfer. Third, we made certain strategic decisions to not take on contracts and customers, that while generating approximately $48 million in revenue, collectively resulted in a material improvement to our EBITDA. 
Next, there were approximately $26 million of temporary impacts to revenue, those that will recover, the largest being the accounting adjustment for deferred customer installation revenue, the suspension of late fee charges for this transitional quarter and minor customer outage credits. 
Finally, we had only a modest $9 million decline in revenue from operations under our ownership, notwithstanding, as we communicated, the hold on marketing efforts directed at new customer acquisition. 
For the last item under our control in the period, you'll note that there was an overall improvement to EBITDA in the quarter, reflecting a well-executed program of managing the roll-off of expiring promotional pricing for customers in the acquired base. 
In total, we recorded $1.282 billion of revenue in the quarter for the new markets. This does include approximately $12 million in additional regulatory revenue related to the CAF II increment above the historical present support levels in California and Texas for the pre-closing period, as prior arrangements with Verizon. Excluding this amount, one should consider $1.27 billion as the starting point for measuring our Q3 results. 
Please turn to Slide 11. Our customer trends for the existing markets showed improvement in Q2. Our residential customer churn decreased to 1.7% from 1.8%, and broadband net additions increased 3.5% to 25,500. We anticipate that as we roll out greater speed capabilities in the existing markets and increase the availability of video, our net addition trend should be further enhanced both through growth, improved gross additions and reduced churn. As we had anticipated and previously communicated, broadband net additions were negative in the new markets. 
Let's turn to Slide 12 for a further look at the activity in the new markets in the quarter. These charts disaggregate the net change in gross additions and deactivations for the period. As we discussed last quarter, our plan was to suspend new customer acquisition marketing during Q2. As a result, our FiOS gross adds in Q2 reflected a natural rate of customer inbound calls as there was no assistant -- assistance from outbound marketing. This intentional reduction of gross addition activity accounted for the largest reduction in net adds in Q2. We did it to free our technicians and call center reps to focus on existing customers during the transition. With the transition behind us, we have begun our marketing programs in Q3 and would expect a return to normal levels of FiOS gross adds over the course of the second half of the year. 
Our disconnect rate in Q2 was elevated slightly, which is to be expected during such a transition, but was not materially above the level experienced by Verizon in these markets in Q2 '15. This reinforces that the net customer add result in Q2 was a result of fewer gross adds and not an elevated level of churn among existing customers. Non-FiOS net adds were also negative, but within the historic trend that Verizon has had over the recent quarters. We expect this trend to continue until we get the upgraded non-FiOS equipment into the field, enabling service. Over time, we anticipate that our non-FiOS net adds will turn positive as a result of our plan broadband upgrades. 
Please turn to Slide 13. We are very pleased that we are able to achieve $1 billion in annualized cost synergies in Q2. This is a $400 million increase above our prior day 1 expectations or an incremental $100 million per quarter. Improvements came from cost to support the non-transferring allocated revenue and from the strategic decisions we made as we describe in the revenue block. Other amounts were a direct outcome of leveraging the further productivity and network improvements we decided to make, which were enabled by the higher onetime integration spending. The net of all of our integration activities and implementing the operating structure to support the acquired business is shown on Slide 14. In total, we are raising our cost-reduction estimates to $1.25 billion to be achieved by the end of year 3. This incremental $250 million above our day 1 achievement will be spread across both our existing business as well as the new markets. We are developing action plans for implementation of additional initiatives and are confident that these will be achieved. 
Please turn to Slide 15. In our existing markets, we achieved average revenue per customer, or ARPC, of $63.05 in the second quarter, representing an increase of $0.41 from the first quarter. There were several drivers of this increase with the most important being the benefits of the expiration of promotional pricing in Connecticut. Additionally, we have the return of Snowbird customers in northern markets, the continued migration of customers to higher-speed broadband tiers and growth in Frontier Secure. These items were partially offset by the continued decline in voice connections. On a combined basis, our ARPC was $83.20. The ARPC of the new markets is $110.30 because of the strong contribution of the FiOS triple-play customers. 
Please turn to Slide 16. Frontier's cash flow remains very healthy. Capital expenditures were $350 million in the second quarter, and we spent an additional $36 million in CapEx related to integration activities. Our adjusted free cash flow was $250 million in the second quarter. Our dividend payout ratio was 49%. 
On July 26, the board declared a common dividend of $0.105 per share for the third quarter of 2016, payable September 30, in line with expectations. We will also be paying the regularly scheduled dividend on our preferred shares on September 30. 
Please turn to Slide 17. Our leverage ratio at the end of Q2 was 3.71x, which is the trailing 12-month pro forma to reflect the inclusion of the Verizon transaction and $1 billion of the annualized cost synergies. We would expect a modest increase in the net leverage ratio as we roll forward over the next 3 quarters. This is due in part to the CAF II true-up amounts that we recorded in the third and fourth quarters of 2015. Thereafter, as we've indicated, we see the balance sheet deleveraging by 0.1 to 0.2x per year, beginning in 2017. 
Frontier's liquidity position remains robust. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.4 billion in cash and credit availability. Our debt is well laddered, and we have the ability to comfortably manage our debt maturities coming due over the next few years. 
Frontier's capital allocation framework remains unchanged. We will invest appropriately in our network infrastructure and operations, support our current dividend and utilize the remaining cash flow to reduce debt and our leverage ratio. We are committed to maintaining our liquidity and reducing our leverage over time. 
Please turn to Slide 18. Now that we have completed our first quarter of operating our new markets, we have updated our 2016 guidance ranges. We anticipate the full year 2016 adjusted free cash flow to be in the range of $825 million to $900 million. This includes the contribution from only 3 quarters of California, Texas and Florida. We anticipate capital expenditures of $1.275 billion to $1.325 billion in 2016, inclusive of our CAF II-related expenditures and excluding integration spending. We estimate full year cash taxes will be a net refund of $10 million to $20 million. Going forward over the next few years, we are currently estimating cash taxes to be near 0 with a substantial benefit being derived from a tax basis step-up negotiated as part of our transaction with Verizon. We estimate cash pension contributions for 2016 of $10 million to $15 million. We estimate that 2016 reported interest expense will be in the range of $1.53 billion to $1.55 billion. Interest expense increased sequentially in Q2 from the first quarter by about $13 million net, reflecting the drawing of the term loan A at the end of quarter -- at quarter-end to fund the acquisition and the interest related to the debt we assumed from Verizon after closing. We estimate that interest expense, including the Q1 portion of interest expense on the $6.6 billion of acquisition-related debt, will be in the range of approximately $1.34 billion to $1.36 billion. Finally, looking forward, we are currently estimating that full year 2017 adjusted EBITDA will be over $4 billion. 
In summary, Frontier's Q2 2016 operating results; our opportunities with the California, Texas and Florida acquisition; our prudent capital investments and expense management all provide a strong cash flow base and a solid financial platform for supporting and investing in the business. We have ample capital to invest in and enhance our competitive infrastructure, service our debt and comfortably sustain our dividend and maintain the dividend payout ratio superior to others in the telecom sector.

When you look at the new properties, I think you'd characterized it correctly. As we described it, it was a gross addition issue. There were some -- a little bit higher churn that was associated with the cut over, but really nothing worse than we have described before. We started acquisition marketing on July 1. As you can imagine, you don't just turn on marketing and you start to get similar levels of gross additions as what a well-primed [indiscernible] going for multiple years. So we're building right now. And with the current trajectory, we think, by the end of third quarter, we'll be at normal run rates. And the one caveat I would just add is that the copper markets in the new areas are really in the same condition as what we inherited. So while we do the upgrades, you should expect the trends in those areas to remain similar from the past. And then as we upgrade, unless we said 500,000 homes to higher speeds, we hope to change the trajectory there, and that would really be a big contributor to the new markets net [indiscernible] going positive going forward."

Now that it's tighter, you maintained the midpoint of the free cash flow guide, but CapEx is slightly lower and taxes -- or actually, the refund now, that helps.

But at the same time, we're going to start to realize other of our cost synergies during the course of the quarter. I think there will be a good balance. And we're very comfortable with that.

And as a result, our cost structure that we had first estimated could be improved just by further levels of automation. I'd say one of the bigger bang for the buck on the synergies, too, was our engineering team rethought the architecture for certain components of the data network for these properties. As they executed on that, it caused a little bit more expense and a little bit more CapEx from an integration perspective, but it was a substantial increase in synergies that was associated with moving to the new architecture.

And if you kind of do that math, it actually implies kind of in the back part of the year, you'll actually see a step-up in EBITDA from the run rate we got in 2Q. So I just wanted to kind of revisit that, if I could. And then the second piece was the delevering side of the story. I think you've talked about as much of a 0.2 deleveraging, which would imply free cash flow well into the mid-$1 billion range. I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit what the scenarios are that would get you that level."

With respect to the EBITDA guidance going forward, I think -- we think about $4 billion as sort of the baseline for where we're going to go. And as we develop that out, we'll see more. We do have certain of the trailing revenues that have rolled off our business, both as from strategically from our existing business and from the acquired business. And primarily, it's the voice revenue headwinds that we've had. So we always factor this in from a trailing perspective, but we do feel comfortable that we will have it -- a deleveraging path as we go forward. With respect to the -- your question, I think, on the allocated revenue, the strategic decisions that we took, these are things -- these are information that either we develop right as we're getting into a cutover or as we saw come as we -- the financial impact as we got throughout the entire quarter, but it's important to remember, though, that where [indiscernible] was a positive EBITDA outcome from all of these things. And that does not the include incremental synergies that we think about the business going forward as well as those incremental synergies, we've only started to bake into our forward thinking with respect to EBITDA.

As far as the special access is proceeding, I think it's too early to tell exactly what the impact is going to be to us. I do think that the Chairman desires to have something done on his watch, so to speak. And he'll push to do that. The comment period was just extended an additional 2 weeks based on the need to maybe modify some parts of the record around Ethernet and some other data. So I think it's a little too early to tell.

The other items that might fall into that bucket were things, for example, of late fees that we didn't charge during the quarter. We took the decision to be very customer-family as we did sort of a handover. And then there was a very modest amount of customer credits that we gave.

This was a very significant and successful quarter for Frontier.Today, in addition to talking about the progress we have made during the quarter, we will update you",1455,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining Frontier's Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. This was a very significant and successful quarter for Frontier.
Today, in addition to talking about the progress we have made during the quarter, we will update you on our strategy and operational plans going forward, review our synergy attainment within the quarter and share our outlook.
Please turn to Slide 3. I'm particularly pleased to announce that following the successful cutover of the newly-acquired assets, we achieved annualized integration cost synergies of $1 billion in the second quarter. This is a substantial outperformance relative to our original day one target of $525 million. We have also raised our total synergy target to $1.25 billion, which is considerably above our prior $700 million target.
We're particularly pleased that EBITDA from the acquisition met our expectations. Revenue for these assets was lower than anticipated as a result of a number of factors that John will discuss. But because of increased synergies, EBITDA remained in line with expectations.
We have been very disciplined in our approach to operating the new markets. This included maintaining customer pricing and keeping promotions in line with those that Verizon offers in these markets. Furthermore, we are utilizing retention offers similar to Verizon's and we are managing the normal promotional expiration cycle well. The net result of these actions is illustrated by the relative stability of the revenue we achieved after Frontier became the owner of the new properties.
As we have discussed on our last call, during the cutover period, we temporarily suspended acquisition marketing activities. This resulted in an expected slowing in gross additions. We are now back to a typical level of marketing in the new properties and all customer service calls are now being handled domestically. As a result, we have seen an improvement in gross adds and expect this to reach normalized levels as we continue through this quarter.
Turning to the commercial segment in the new markets. We have begun to implement our plans to build our direct and indirect commercial sales channel strategies. We expect to see traction in these channels in the fourth quarter time frame. As we focus on building our marketing programs in the consumer and commercial segments, we expect to drive revenue and free cash flow.
We have also continued to execute our broadband network upgrade program in both existing and new markets. This program will result in the expansion of 50 megabits or higher broadband capability to 2 million homes over the next year. I will discuss these exciting plans in more detail later in the call. 
With a full quarter of combined results, we also have narrowed our guidance range for this year, which John will discuss in more detail towards the end of our prepared remarks.
And finally, we continue to be focused on cash generation as illustrated by our common dividend payout ratio of 49% of free cash flow in the quarter.
Please turn to Slide 4. Before we get into the details of the quarter, I'd like to take a moment to remind you of how well we are positioned moving forward. With the doubling of our size, Frontier now has the scale, technology and diversification to realize significant opportunities across our newly-expanded footprint. At the same time, we remain committed to our disciplined capital allocation strategy, including maintaining our sustainable, attractive dividend and delivering value to shareholders driven by recent strategic acquisitions and operational execution.
Please turn to Slide 5 where I will discuss in more detail our plan to drive higher shareholder value from our significantly larger base of assets. We are expanding our revenue opportunities by transforming our network capabilities and creating long-term competitive advantage. In many of the non-FiOS areas, this will be the first time customers will have the ability to choose a competitive Internet service product, and we expect to see strong demand for these new capabilities. Our primary focus will be increasing broadband penetration and offering customers opportunities to access the new speeds and capabilities we will introduce. In addition, we will be offering a full suite of business solutions for the SME segment with expanded distribution channels.
Within the FiOS markets, we have a very strong brand image and a product offering. We will continue to upgrade speeds and capacities to these markets to maintain our superior data and video offerings. And we believe we have further opportunity for market share gains.
Our CAF II build remains underway, and we are on track to bring higher-speed capabilities to an additional 750,000 households over the coming years. Although the minimum speed in CAF II markets will be 10 megabits, many of these households will be served with higher speeds as we deploy the same leading-edge technology that is allowing us to improve the speed in our existing footprint.
Our expansion of video service to new portions of our existing service territory is moving along very well. We expect to have video availability to about 0.5 million additional households by the end of this year. As we upgrade different markets in the new territories, we expect to introduce our Vantage TV product. This means that many non-FiOS areas in the new markets will become Vantage TV-enabled. As a result, our expansion of video will ultimately exceed the initial 3 million households previously announced.
Our plans to upgrade broadband capabilities in the new markets and to introduce video creates a significant opportunity for revenue growth. The builds are extremely capital-efficient and certainly far more capital-efficient than the broadband and video upgrades undertaken by peer companies in the past. When complete, we will have great networks and capabilities in these markets, and we'll have created them at a capital intensity consistent with current guidance levels.
On the commercial side, we are in the process of introducing distribution channels in the new markets. In addition, we are implementing our wholesale and retail product strategy, with a focus on solutions for both FiOS and copper markets.
Please turn to Slide 6. As we have promised, our revenue mix has been transformed as a result of this transaction. In doing so, we have dramatically increased our exposure to growing profitable market segments while reducing exposure to residential voice, which is down to just 14% of our revenue base. Furthermore, wireless backhaul is now less than 3% of revenue and will present less pressure going forward. As you consider our new broadband and video initiatives, they should result in higher growth of these categories over time, and you'll understand why we are so excited about the potential for revenue trends to improve going forward.
Please turn to Slide 7. As we have completed our initial cutover efforts in the new properties, we have refocused the organization to develop plans to upgrade our speed offerings in our existing footprint and have begun to execute upgrade plans for the copper-based service in the new markets. The first phase of this upgrade will be accomplished over the coming quarters and will raise speeds in these upgraded areas from 7 megabits to 50 to 100 megabits. Following the upgrade, we will commence marketing and offering speed upgrades to current customers in these areas.
In our current markets, we continue to invest in our network and in our management and provisioning platforms to expand higher-speed products. We expect to upgrade approximately 1.5 million homes to higher speeds over the next year. The combination of our plans to upgrade both the current and new markets improves our speed profile to approximately 2 million households. Following completion, over 40% of our households will be capable of receiving speeds in excess of 50 megabits. These upgrades improve a full 14% of our households' past and provides a very competitive service offering.
As we continue to develop our priorities for the new markets, we will update you on our deployment plans. The introduction of these new capabilities and the incorporation of the video capabilities in these markets using our Vantage TV platform provides a tremendous opportunity to operate differentiated product set in areas that haven't had many competitive options.
In summary, I am very pleased with the transition from integration to normal operations in the new markets. We have begun acquisition marketing and expect normal gross add levels to return over the coming quarter. We are also beginning to harvest the benefits in our existing markets from the system upgrades and enhancements needed for our Verizon integration efforts.
As we pursue the revenue growth opportunities, we will also focus on improving our cost structure and realize the additional $250 million of cost savings over the next 3 years. 
And now I'll turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, John Jureller."
261171,372125793,1020701,"Frontier Communications Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 01, 2016",2016-08-01,"Earnings Calls","Frontier Communications Parent, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Dan. Please turn to Slide 8 where I'll start by going through key financial highlights. Second quarter revenue was $2.61 billion, up from $1.36 billion in the first quarter, with the acquisition of the new markets driving the substantial increa",1883,"Thank you, Dan. Please turn to Slide 8 where I'll start by going through key financial highlights. Second quarter revenue was $2.61 billion, up from $1.36 billion in the first quarter, with the acquisition of the new markets driving the substantial increase. We had a net loss to common shareholders of $80 million or $0.07 per share. Adjusted EBITDA of $1.03 billion represented a margin of 39.6%. We generated free cash flow of $250 million after payment of dividends on the preferred stock.
Please turn to Slide 9. The second quarter revenue of $2.61 billion included $1.33 billion from the existing markets, down from $1.36 billion in the first quarter. Within our existing markets, the trend in residential is solid, with revenue down less than 1% sequentially, reflecting a full quarter benefit of the improved average revenue per customer or ARPC, including from the roll-off of the Connecticut acquisition promotional pricing over the course of Q1 and Q2. We did see a sequential decline in business revenue, mostly driven by a decline in wholesale, including wireless backhaul. 
Adjusted operating expenses in Q2 in the existing markets improved by $6 million sequentially to $821 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $505 million for a margin of 38.1%.
In terms of the new markets, the adjusted EBITDA of $527 million and a 41.2% margin met our expectations, with our superior performance in addressing the cost base of the acquired business offsetting the starting revenue received for the historical Verizon Separate Telephone Operations or VSTO business. 
Please turn to Slide 10. Let me take you through the revenue progression or jump-off as the acquired business came under our operational domain. It's important to have an appropriate starting point for these new markets and understand the results from activity under Frontier's ownership.
We previously filed information with the historical VSTO financial performance. Today, we filed the same VSTO information for the first quarter of 2016. This information shows revenue of $1.394 billion in Q1 prior to any adjustments.
Now let's go through the revenue block. First, as in previous filings, there was a pro forma adjustment for a minor amount of revenue and the reclassification of bad debt expense, a total of $16 million in that quarter. Second, upon closing, there was another $25 million of allocated revenue with no net impact to EBITDA that did not transfer. Third, we made certain strategic decisions to not take on contracts and customers that, while generating approximately $48 million in revenue, collectively resulted in a material improvement to our EBITDA.
Next, there were approximately $26 million of temporary impacts to revenue, those that will recover, the largest being the accounting adjustment for deferred customer installation revenue, the suspension of late fee charges for this transitional quarter and minor customer outage credits.
Finally, we had only a modest $9 million decline in revenue from operations under our ownership, notwithstanding, as we communicated, the hold on marketing efforts directed at new customer acquisition.
For the last item under our control in the period, you'll note that there was an overall improvement to EBITDA in the quarter, reflecting a well-executed program of managing the roll-off of expiring promotional pricing for customers in the acquired base.
In total, we recorded $1.282 billion of revenue in the quarter for the new markets. This does include approximately $12 million in additional regulatory revenue related to the CAF II increment above the historical present support levels in California and Texas for the pre-closing period as per our arrangements with Verizon. Excluding this amount, one should consider $1.27 billion as the starting point for measuring our Q3 results.
Please turn to Slide 11. Our customer trends for the existing markets showed improvement in Q2. Our residential customer churn decreased to 1.7% from 1.8% and broadband net additions increased 3.5% to 25,500. We anticipate that as we roll out greater speed capabilities in the existing markets and increase the availability of video, our net addition trend should be further enhanced, both through growth -- improved gross additions and reduced churn. As we had anticipated and previously communicated, broadband net additions were negative in the new markets.
Let's turn to Slide 12 for a further look at the activity in the new markets in the quarter. These charts disaggregate the net change in gross additions and deactivations for the period. As we discussed last quarter, our plan was to suspend new customer acquisition marketing during Q2. As a result, our FiOS gross adds in Q2 reflected a natural rate of customer inbound calls as there was no assistant -- assistance from outbound marketing. This intentional reduction of gross addition activity accounted for the large reduction in net adds in Q2. We did it to free our technicians and call center reps to focus on existing customers during the transition. With the transition behind us, we have begun our marketing programs in Q3 and would expect a return to normal levels of FiOS gross adds over the course of the second half of the year.
Our disconnect rate in Q2 was elevated slightly, which is to be expected during such a transition, but was not materially above the level experienced by Verizon in these markets in Q2 '15. This reinforces that the net customer add result in Q2 was a result of fewer gross adds and not an elevated level of churn among existing customers.
Non-FiOS net adds were also negative, but within the historic trend that Verizon has had over the recent quarters. We expect this trend to continue until we get the upgraded non-FiOS equipment into the field, enabling service. Over time, we anticipate that our non-FiOS net adds will turn positive as a result of our planned broadband upgrades.
Please turn to Slide 13. We are very pleased that we are able to achieve $1 billion in annualized cost synergies in Q2. This is a $400 million increase above our prior day one expectations or an incremental $100 million per quarter. Improvements came from cost to support the non-transferring allocated revenue and from the strategic decisions we made as we described in the revenue block. Other amounts were a direct outcome of leveraging the further productivity and network improvements we decided to make, which were enabled by the higher onetime integration spending.
The net of all of our integration activities and implementing the operating structure to support the acquired business is shown on Slide 14. In total, we are raising our cost reduction estimates to $1.25 billion to be achieved by the end of year 3. This incremental $250 million above our day one achievement will be spread across both our existing business as well as the new markets. We are developing action plans for implementation of additional initiatives and are confident that these will be achieved.
Please turn to Slide 15. In our existing markets, we achieved average revenue per customer or ARPC of $63.05 in the second quarter, representing an increase of $0.41 from the first quarter. There were several drivers of this increase, with the most important being the benefits of the expiration of promotional pricing in Connecticut. Additionally, we have the return of snow bird customers in northern markets, the continued migration of customers to higher-speed broadband tiers and growth in Frontier Secure. These items were partially offset by the continued decline in voice connections.
On a combined basis, our ARPC was $83.20. The ARPC of the new markets is $110.30 because of the strong contribution of the FiOS triple play customers.
Please turn to Slide 16. Frontier's cash flow remains very healthy. Capital expenditures were $350 million in the second quarter and we spent an additional $36 million in CapEx related to integration activities. Our adjusted free cash flow was $250 million in the second quarter. Our dividend payout ratio was 49%.
On July 26, the board declared a common dividend of $0.105 per share for the third quarter of 2016, payable September 30, in line with expectations. We will also be paying the regularly scheduled dividend on our preferred shares on September 30.
Please turn to Slide 17. Our leverage ratio at the end of Q2 was 3.71x, which is the trailing 12-month pro forma to reflect the inclusion of the Verizon transaction and $1 billion of the annualized cost synergies. We would expect a modest increase in the net leverage ratio as we roll forward over the next 3 quarters. This is due in part to the CAF II true-up amounts that we recorded in the third and fourth quarters of 2015. Thereafter, as we've indicated, we see the balance sheet deleveraging by 0.1x to 0.2x turns per year, beginning in 2017.
Frontier's liquidity position remains robust. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.4 billion in cash and credit availability. Our debt is well-laddered and we have the ability to comfortably manage our debt maturities coming due over the next few years.
Frontier's capital allocation framework remains unchanged. We will invest appropriately in our network infrastructure and operations, support our current dividend and utilize the remaining cash flow to reduce debt and our leverage ratio. We are committed to maintaining our liquidity and reducing our leverage over time.
Please turn to Slide 18. Now that we have completed our first quarter of operating our new markets, we have updated our 2016 guidance ranges. We anticipate the full year 2016 adjusted free cash flow to be in the range of $825 million to $900 million. This includes the contribution from only 3 quarters of California, Texas and Florida.
We anticipate capital expenditures of $1.275 billion to $1.325 billion in 2016, inclusive of our CAF II-related expenditures and excluding integration spending.
We estimate full year cash taxes will be a net refund of $10 million to $20 million. Going forward over the next few years, we are currently estimating cash taxes to be near 0, with a substantial benefit being derived from a tax basis step-up negotiated as part of our transaction with Verizon.
We estimate cash pension contributions for 2016 of $10 million to $15 million.
We estimate that 2016 reported interest expense will be in the range of $1.53 billion to $1.55 billion. Interest expense increased sequentially in Q2 from the first quarter by about $13 million net, reflecting the drawing of the term loan A at the end of quarter -- at quarter-end to fund the acquisition and the interest related to the debt we assumed from Verizon after closing. We estimate that interest expense, including the Q1 portion of interest expense on the $6.6 billion of acquisition-related debt, will be in the range of approximately $1.34 billion to $1.36 billion.
Finally, looking forward, we are currently estimating that full year 2017 adjusted EBITDA will be over $4 billion.
In summary, Frontier's Q2 2016 operating results, our opportunities with the California, Texas and Florida acquisition, our prudent capital investments and expense management all provide a strong cash flow base and a solid financial platform for supporting and investing in the business. We have ample capital to invest in and enhance our competitive infrastructure, service our debt and comfortably sustain our dividend and maintain the dividend payout ratio superior to others in the telecom sector.
I will pass the call back to the operator, who will open up the line for questions."

We are seeing similar results, and we're expecting those results to stay stable as we go through the remainder of the year.
When you look at the new properties, I think you'd characterized it correctly. As we described it, it was a gross addition issue. There were some -- a little bit higher churn that was associated with the cutover, but really nothing worse than we have described before. We started acquisition marketing on July 1. As you can imagine, you don't just turn on marketing and you start to get similar levels of gross additions as what a well-primed government [ph] going for multiple years. So we're building right now. And with the current trajectory, we think, by the end of third quarter, we'll be at normal run rates.
And the one caveat I would just add is that the copper markets in the new areas are really in the same condition as what we inherited. So while we do the upgrades, you should expect the trends in those areas to remain similar from the past. And then, as we upgrade, unless we said 500,000 homes to higher speeds, we hope to change the trajectory there and that would really be a big contributor to the new markets networked then [ph] going positive going forward."

Now that it's tighter, you maintained the midpoint of the free cash flow guide, but CapEx is slightly lower and taxes -- or actually, the refund now, that helps. What does that imply in terms of, I guess, EBITDA slightly lower than you had expected, even though second quarter came in kind of in line with your expectations?

But at the same time, we're going to start to realize other of our cost synergies during the course of the quarter. So I think there will be a good balance and we're very comfortable with that.

And as a result, our cost structure that we had first estimated could be improved just by further levels of automation.
I'd say one of the bigger bang for the buck on the synergies, too, was our engineering team rethought the architecture for a certain component of the data network for these properties. As they executed on that, it caused a little bit more expense and a little bit more CapEx from an integration perspective, but it was a substantial increase in synergies that was associated with moving to the new architecture.

So within that strategic decision bucket is we looked at some of the contracts that we have the opportunity to bring across and, when we parsed through them, we saw that the cost to support those contracts just made no financial sense. They were effectively breakeven in their nature. Some of the other contractual revenue actually related to the network architecture that Dan described as improving, and so yes, there were certain -- certain of that revenue that didn't come across. But at the same time, as we took out more expense because we had reoriented our network architecture, so by making that decision, we actually drove a better EBITDA outcome.
There were a couple of things like that where we just sort of sat back and made some discrete decisions and did what we thought was best for the business. But net-net is that strategic decision bucket resulted in an improvement in EBITDA for us on a go-forward basis."

I'll start off with a couple of things and then let Dan come back in. This has multi parts. I'm going to try to remember the different pieces.
With respect to the EBITDA guidance going forward, I think -- we think about $4 billion as sort of the baseline for where we're going to go. And as we develop that out, we'll see more. We do have certain of the trailing revenues that have rolled off our business, both from -- strategically from our existing business and from the acquired business. And primarily, it's the voice revenue headwinds that we've had. So we always factor this in from a trailing perspective, but we do feel comfortable that we will have it -- a deleveraging path as we go forward.
With respect to the -- your question, I think, on the allocated revenue or the strategic decisions that we took, these are things -- these are information that either we develop right as we were getting into a cutover or as we saw -- as we -- the financial impact as we got throughout the entire quarter. But it's important to remember, though, that what we drove was a positive EBITDA outcome from all of these things and that does not include the incremental synergies that we think about the business going forward as well as those incremental synergies we've only started to bake in to our forward thinking with respect to EBITDA.
So some of this information developed -- was developed just immediately prior to close, some throughout the course of the quarter that we could really quantify in a more specific way, but we do feel comfortable in our business as we go forward."

As far as the special access proceeding, I think it's too early to tell exactly what the impact is going to be to us. I do think that the Chairman desires to have something done on his watch, so to speak. And he'll push to do that. The comment period was just extended an additional 2 weeks based on the need to maybe modify some parts of the record around Ethernet and some other data. So I think it's a little too early to tell.

The other items that might fall into that bucket were things, for example, late fees that we didn't charge during the quarter. We took the decision to be very customer-friendly as we did sort of a handover. And then, there was a very modest amount of customer credits that we gave.

So we were conservative in assuming that there were costs that we were going to have to replace.

This was a very significant and successful quarter for Frontier.Today, in addition to talking about the progress we have made during the quarter, we will update you",1458,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining Frontier's Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. This was a very significant and successful quarter for Frontier.
Today, in addition to talking about the progress we have made during the quarter, we will update you on our strategy and operational plans going forward, review our synergy attainment within the quarter and share our outlook.
Please turn to Slide 3. I'm particularly pleased to announce that following the successful cutover of the newly acquired assets, we achieved annualized integration cost synergies of $1 billion in the second quarter. This is a substantial outperformance relative to our original day 1 target of $525 million. We have also raised our total synergy target to $1.25 billion, which is considerably above our prior $700 million target.
We're particularly pleased that EBITDA from the acquisition met our expectations. Revenue for these assets was lower than anticipated as a result of a number of factors that John will discuss. But because of increased synergies, EBITDA remained in line with expectations.
We have been very disciplined in our approach to operating the new markets. This included maintaining customer pricing and keeping promotions in line with those that Verizon offers in these markets. Furthermore, we are utilizing retention offers similar to Verizon's and we are managing the normal promotional expiration cycle well. The net result of these actions is illustrated by the relative stability of the revenue we achieved after Frontier became the owner of the new properties.
As we have discussed on our last call, during the cutover period, we temporarily suspended acquisition marketing activities. This resulted in an expected slowing in gross additions. We are now back to a typical level of marketing in the new properties and all customer service calls are now being handled domestically. As a result, we have seen an improvement in gross adds and expect this to reach normalized levels as we continue through this quarter.
Turning to the commercial segment in the new markets. We have begun to implement our plans to build our direct and indirect commercial sales channel strategies. We expect to see traction in these channels in the fourth quarter time frame. As we focus on building our marketing programs in the consumer and commercial segments, we expect to drive revenue and free cash flow.
We have also continued to execute our broadband network upgrade program in both existing and new markets. This program will result in the expansion of 50 megabits or higher broadband capability to 2 million homes over the next year. I will discuss these exciting plans in more detail later in the call. 
With a full quarter of combined results, we also have narrowed our guidance range for this year, which John will discuss in more detail towards the end of our prepared remarks.
And finally, we continue to be focused on cash generation as illustrated by our common dividend payout ratio of 49% of free cash flow in the quarter.
Please turn to Slide 4. Before we get into the details of the quarter, I'd like to take a moment to remind you of how well we are positioned moving forward. With the doubling of our size, Frontier now has the scale, technology and diversification to realize significant opportunities across our newly expanded footprint. At the same time, we remain committed to our disciplined capital allocation strategy, including maintaining our sustainable, attractive dividend and delivering value to shareholders, driven by recent strategic acquisitions and operational execution.
Please turn to Slide 5, where I will discuss in more detail our plan to drive higher shareholder value from our significantly larger base of assets. We are expanding our revenue opportunities by transforming our network capabilities and creating long-term competitive advantage. In many of the non-FiOS areas, this will be the first time customers will have the ability to choose a competitive Internet service product, and we expect to see strong demand for these new capabilities. Our primary focus will be increasing broadband penetration and offering customers opportunities to access the new speeds and capabilities we will introduce. In addition, we will be offering a full suite of business solutions for the SME segment, with expanded distribution channels.
Within the FiOS markets, we have a very strong brand image and a product offering. We will continue to upgrade speeds and capacities to these markets to maintain our superior data and video offerings. And we believe we have further opportunity for market share gains.
Our CAF II build remains underway, and we are on track to bring higher-speed capabilities to an additional 750,000 households over the coming years. Although the minimum speed in CAF II markets will be 10 megabits, many of these households will be served with higher speeds as we deploy the same leading-edge technology that is allowing us to improve the speed in our existing footprint.
Our expansion of video service to new portions of our existing service territory is moving along very well. We expect to have video availability to about 0.5 million additional households by the end of this year. As we upgrade different markets in the new territories, we expect to introduce our Vantage TV product. This means that many non-FiOS areas in the new markets will become Vantage TV-enabled. As a result, our expansion of video will ultimately exceed the initial 3 million households previously announced.
Our plans to upgrade broadband capabilities in the new markets and to introduce video creates a significant opportunity for revenue growth. The builds are extremely capital-efficient and certainly far more capital-efficient than the broadband and video upgrades undertaken by peer companies in the past. When complete, we will have great networks and capabilities in these markets, and we'll have created them at a capital intensity consistent with current guidance levels.
On the commercial side, we are in the process of introducing distribution channels in the new markets. In addition, we are implementing our wholesale and retail product strategy, with a focus on solutions for both FiOS and copper markets.
Please turn to Slide 6. As we have promised, our revenue mix has been transformed as a result of this transaction. In doing so, we have dramatically increased our exposure to growing profitable market segments while reducing exposure to residential voice, which is down to just 14% of our revenue base. Furthermore, wireless backhaul is now less than 3% of revenue and will present less pressure going forward. As you consider our new broadband and video initiatives, they should result in higher growth of these categories over time, and you'll understand why we are so excited about the potential for revenue trends to improve going forward.
Please turn to Slide 7. As we have completed our initial cutover efforts in the new properties, we have refocused the organization to develop plans to upgrade our speed offerings in our existing footprint and have begun to execute upgrade plans for the copper-based service in the new markets. The first phase of this upgrade will be accomplished over the coming quarters and will raise speeds in these upgraded areas from 7 megabits to 50 to 100 megabits. Following the upgrade, we will commence marketing and offering speed upgrades to current customers in these areas.
In our current markets, we continue to invest in our network and in our management and provisioning platforms to expand higher-speed products. We expect to upgrade approximately 1.5 million homes to higher speeds over the next year. The combination of our plans to upgrade both the current and new markets improves our speed profile to approximately 2 million households. Following completion, over 40% of our households will be capable of receiving speeds in excess of 50 megabits. These upgrades improve a full 14% of our households passed and provides a very competitive service offering.
As we continue to develop our priorities for the new markets, we will update you on our deployment plans. The introduction of these new capabilities and the incorporation of the video capabilities in these markets using our Vantage TV platform provides a tremendous opportunity to operate a differentiated product set in areas that haven't had many competitive options.
In summary, I am very pleased with the transition from integration to normal operations in the new markets. We have begun acquisition marketing and expect normal gross add levels to return over the coming quarter. We are also beginning to harvest the benefits in our existing markets from the system upgrades and enhancements needed for our Verizon integration efforts.
As we pursue the revenue growth opportunities, we will also focus on improving our cost structure and realize the additional $250 million of cost savings over the next 3 years. 
And now I'll turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, John Jureller."
261171,372125793,1020745,"Frontier Communications Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 01, 2016",2016-08-01,"Earnings Calls","Frontier Communications Parent, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Dan. Please turn to Slide 8, where I'll start by going through key financial highlights. Second quarter revenue was $2.61 billion, up from $1.36 billion in the first quarter, with the acquisition of the new markets driving the substantial incre",1883,"Thank you, Dan. Please turn to Slide 8, where I'll start by going through key financial highlights. Second quarter revenue was $2.61 billion, up from $1.36 billion in the first quarter, with the acquisition of the new markets driving the substantial increase. We had a net loss to common shareholders of $80 million or $0.07 per share. Adjusted EBITDA of $1.03 billion represented a margin of 39.6%. We generated free cash flow of $250 million after payment of dividends on the preferred stock.
Please turn to Slide 9. The second quarter revenue of $2.61 billion included $1.33 billion from the existing markets, down from $1.36 billion in the first quarter. Within our existing markets, the trend in residential is solid, with revenue down less than 1% sequentially, reflecting a full quarter benefit of the improved average revenue per customer or ARPC, including from the roll-off of the Connecticut acquisition promotional pricing over the course of Q1 and Q2. We did see a sequential decline in business revenue, mostly driven by a decline in wholesale, including wireless backhaul. 
Adjusted operating expenses in Q2 in the existing markets improved by $6 million sequentially to $821 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $505 million for a margin of 38.1%.
In terms of the new markets, the adjusted EBITDA of $527 million and a 41.2% margin met our expectations, with our superior performance in addressing the cost base of the acquired business offsetting the starting revenue received for the historical Verizon Separate Telephone Operations or VSTO business. 
Please turn to Slide 10. Let me take you through the revenue progression or jump-off as the acquired business came under our operational domain. It's important to have an appropriate starting point for these new markets and understand the results from activity under Frontier's ownership.
We previously filed information with the historical VSTO financial performance. Today, we filed the same VSTO information for the first quarter of 2016. This information shows revenue of $1.394 billion in Q1 prior to any adjustments.
Now let's go through the revenue block. First, as in previous filings, there was a pro forma adjustment for a minor amount of revenue and the reclassification of bad debt expense, a total of $16 million in that quarter. Second, upon closing, there was another $25 million of allocated revenue with no net impact to EBITDA that did not transfer. Third, we made certain strategic decisions to not take on contracts and customers that, while generating approximately $48 million in revenue, collectively resulted in a material improvement to our EBITDA.
Next, there were approximately $26 million of temporary impacts to revenue, those that will recover, the largest being the accounting adjustment for deferred customer installation revenue, the suspension of late fee charges for this transitional quarter and minor customer outage credits.
Finally, we had only a modest $9 million decline in revenue from operations under our ownership, notwithstanding, as we communicated, the hold on marketing efforts directed at new customer acquisition.
For the last item under our control in the period, you'll note that there was an overall improvement to EBITDA in the quarter, reflecting a well-executed program of managing the roll-off of expiring promotional pricing for customers in the acquired base.
In total, we recorded $1.282 billion of revenue in the quarter for the new markets. This does include approximately $12 million in additional regulatory revenue related to the CAF II increment above the historical present support levels in California and Texas for the pre-closing period as per our arrangements with Verizon. Excluding this amount, one should consider $1.27 billion as the starting point for measuring our Q3 results.
Please turn to Slide 11. Our customer trends for the existing markets showed improvement in Q2. Our residential customer churn decreased to 1.7% from 1.8% and broadband net additions increased 3.5% to 25,500. We anticipate that as we roll out greater speed capabilities in the existing markets and increase the availability of video, our net addition trend should be further enhanced, both through growth -- improved gross additions and reduced churn. As we had anticipated and previously communicated, broadband net additions were negative in the new markets.
Let's turn to Slide 12 for a further look at the activity in the new markets in the quarter. These charts disaggregate the net change in gross additions and deactivations for the period. As we discussed last quarter, our plan was to suspend new customer acquisition marketing during Q2. As a result, our FiOS gross adds in Q2 reflected a natural rate of customer inbound calls as there was no assistant -- assistance from outbound marketing. This intentional reduction of gross addition activity accounted for the large reduction in net adds in Q2. We did it to free our technicians and call center reps to focus on existing customers during the transition. With the transition behind us, we have begun our marketing programs in Q3 and would expect a return to normal levels of FiOS gross adds over the course of the second half of the year.
Our disconnect rate in Q2 was elevated slightly, which is to be expected during such a transition, but was not materially above the level experienced by Verizon in these markets in Q2 '15. This reinforces that the net customer add result in Q2 was a result of fewer gross adds and not an elevated level of churn among existing customers.
Non-FiOS net adds were also negative, but within the historic trend that Verizon has had over the recent quarters. We expect this trend to continue until we get the upgraded non-FiOS equipment into the field, enabling service. Over time, we anticipate that our non-FiOS net adds will turn positive as a result of our planned broadband upgrades.
Please turn to Slide 13. We are very pleased that we are able to achieve $1 billion in annualized cost synergies in Q2. This is a $400 million increase above our prior day 1 expectations or an incremental $100 million per quarter. Improvements came from cost to support the non-transferring allocated revenue and from the strategic decisions we made, as we described in the revenue block. Other amounts were a direct outcome of leveraging the further productivity and network improvements we decided to make, which were enabled by the higher onetime integration spending.
The net of all of our integration activities and implementing the operating structure to support the acquired business is shown on Slide 14. In total, we are raising our cost reduction estimates to $1.25 billion to be achieved by the end of year 3. This incremental $250 million above our day 1 achievement will be spread across both our existing business as well as the new markets. We are developing action plans for implementation of additional initiatives and are confident that these will be achieved.
Please turn to Slide 15. In our existing markets, we achieved average revenue per customer or ARPC of $63.05 in the second quarter, representing an increase of $0.41 from the first quarter. There were several drivers of this increase, with the most important being the benefits of the expiration of promotional pricing in Connecticut. Additionally, we have the return of snow bird customers in northern markets, the continued migration of customers to higher-speed broadband tiers and growth in Frontier Secure. These items were partially offset by the continued decline in voice connections.
On a combined basis, our ARPC was $83.20. The ARPC of the new markets is $110.30 because of the strong contribution of the FiOS triple-play customers.
Please turn to Slide 16. Frontier's cash flow remains very healthy. Capital expenditures were $350 million in the second quarter and we spent an additional $36 million in CapEx related to integration activities. Our adjusted free cash flow was $250 million in the second quarter. Our dividend payout ratio was 49%.
On July 26, the board declared a common dividend of $0.105 per share for the third quarter of 2016, payable September 30, in line with expectations. We will also be paying the regularly scheduled dividend on our preferred shares on September 30.
Please turn to Slide 17. Our leverage ratio at the end of Q2 was 3.71x, which is the trailing 12-month pro forma to reflect the inclusion of the Verizon transaction and $1 billion of the annualized cost synergies. We would expect a modest increase in the net leverage ratio as we roll forward over the next 3 quarters. This is due in part to the CAF II true-up amounts that we recorded in the third and fourth quarters of 2015. Thereafter, as we've indicated, we see the balance sheet deleveraging by 0.1x to 0.2x turns per year, beginning in 2017.
Frontier's liquidity position remains robust. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.4 billion in cash and credit availability. Our debt is well laddered and we have the ability to comfortably manage our debt maturities coming due over the next few years.
Frontier's capital allocation framework remains unchanged. We will invest appropriately in our network infrastructure and operations, support our current dividend and utilize the remaining cash flow to reduce debt and our leverage ratio. We are committed to maintaining our liquidity and reducing our leverage over time.
Please turn to Slide 18. Now that we have completed our first quarter of operating our new markets, we have updated our 2016 guidance ranges. We anticipate the full year 2016 adjusted free cash flow to be in the range of $825 million to $900 million. This includes the contribution from only 3 quarters of California, Texas and Florida.
We anticipate capital expenditures of $1.275 billion to $1.325 billion in 2016, inclusive of our CAF II-related expenditures and excluding integration spending.
We estimate full year cash taxes will be a net refund of $10 million to $20 million. Going forward over the next few years, we are currently estimating cash taxes to be near 0, with a substantial benefit being derived from the tax basis step-up negotiated as part of our transaction with Verizon.
We estimate cash pension contributions for 2016 of $10 million to $15 million.
We estimate that 2016 reported interest expense will be in the range of $1.53 billion to $1.55 billion. Interest expense increased sequentially in Q2 from the first quarter by about $13 million net, reflecting the drawing of the term loan A at the end of quarter -- at quarter-end to fund the acquisition and the interest related to the debt we assumed from Verizon after closing. We estimate that interest expense, including the Q1 portion of interest expense on the $6.6 billion of acquisition-related debt, will be in the range of approximately $1.34 billion to $1.36 billion.
Finally, looking forward, we are currently estimating that full year 2017 adjusted EBITDA will be over $4 billion.
In summary, Frontier's Q2 2016 operating results; our opportunities with the California, Texas and Florida acquisition; our prudent capital investments and expense management all provide a strong cash flow base and a solid financial platform for supporting and investing in the business. We have ample capital to invest in and enhance our competitive infrastructure, service our debt and comfortably sustain our dividend and maintain a dividend payout ratio superior to others in the telecom sector.
I will pass the call back to the operator, who will open up the line for questions."

We are seeing similar results, and we're expecting those results to stay stable as we go through the remainder of the year.
When you look at the new properties, I think you'd characterized it correctly. As we described it, it was a gross addition issue. There were some -- a little bit higher churn that was associated with the cutover, but really nothing worse than we have described before. We started acquisition marketing on July 1. As you can imagine, you don't just turn on marketing and you start to get similar levels of gross additions as what a well-primed program had going for multiple years. So we're building right now. And with the current trajectory, we think, by the end of third quarter, we'll be at normal run rates.
And the one caveat I would just add is that the copper markets in the new areas are really in the same condition as what we inherited. So while we do the upgrades, you should expect the trends in those areas to remain similar to the past. And then, as we upgrade, as we said, 500,000 homes to higher speeds, we hope to change the trajectory there and that would really be a big contributor to the new markets' net broadband positive going forward."

Now that it's tighter, you maintained the midpoint of the free cash flow guide, but CapEx is slightly lower and taxes are actually a refund now, that helps. What does that imply in terms of, I guess, EBITDA slightly lower than you had expected, even though second quarter came in kind of in line with your expectations? Is it the timing of the incremental synergies coming in? Or do you expect more spending, like you mentioned on the marketing side, to offset that?

But at the same time, we're going to start to realize other of our cost synergies during the course of the quarter. So I think there will be a good balance and we're very comfortable with that.

As they executed on that, it caused a little bit more expense and a little bit more CapEx from an integration perspective, but it was a substantial increase in synergies that was associated with moving to the new architecture.
Those are probably 2 of the biggest improvements from what we originally thought we were going to be able to obtain to what we delivered on day one."

They were effectively breakeven in their nature. Some of the other contractual revenue actually related to the network architecture that Dan described as improving. And so yes, there were certain -- certain of that revenue that didn't come across. But at the same time, as we took out more expense because we had reoriented our network architecture, so by making that decision, we actually drove a better EBITDA outcome.
There were a couple of things like that where we just sort of sat back and made some discrete decisions and did what we thought was best for the business. But net-net is that strategic decision bucket resulted in an improvement in EBITDA for us on a go-forward basis."

With respect to the EBITDA guidance going forward, I think -- we think about $4 billion as sort of the baseline for where we're going to go. And as we develop that out, we'll see more. We do have certain of the trailing revenues that have rolled off our business, both from -- strategically from our existing business and from the acquired business. And primarily, it's the voice revenue headwinds that we've had. So we always factor this in from a trailing perspective, but we do feel comfortable that we will have it -- a deleveraging path as we go forward.
With respect to the -- your question, I think, on the allocated revenue or the strategic decisions that we took, these are things -- these are information that either we developed right as we were getting into cutover or as we saw -- as we -- the financial impact as we got throughout the entire quarter. But it's important to remember, though, that what we drove was a positive EBITDA outcome from all of these things, and that does not include the incremental synergies that we think about the business going forward as well as those incremental synergies we've only started to bake in to our forward thinking with respect to EBITDA.
So some of this information developed -- was developed just immediately prior to close, some throughout the course of the quarter that we could really quantify in a more specific way, but we do feel comfortable in our business as we go forward."

As far as the special access proceeding, I think it's too early to tell exactly what the impact is going to be to us. I do think that the Chairman desires to have something done on his watch, so to speak, and he'll push to do that. The comment period was just extended an additional 2 weeks based on the need to maybe modify some parts of the record around Ethernet and some other data. So I think it's a little too early to tell.

The other items that might fall into that bucket were things, for example, late fees that we didn't charge during the quarter. We took the decision to be very customer-friendly as we did sort of a handover. And then, there was a very modest amount of customer credits that we gave.

And we do think that, as we go forward, we should get to positive growth on the video subs.
So in closing, we had very solid results and execution in the first quarter of ownership of assets that doubled our size. I am proud of the accomplishments of our teams and very pleased that we enter the second half on firm footing to begin executing against our opportunities and goals as a combined entity.

This was a very significant and successful quarter for Frontier.Today, in addition to talking about the progress we have made during the quarter, we will update you",1458,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining Frontier's Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. This was a very significant and successful quarter for Frontier.
Today, in addition to talking about the progress we have made during the quarter, we will update you on our strategy and operational plans going forward, review our synergy attainment within the quarter and share our outlook.
Please turn to Slide 3. I'm particularly pleased to announce that following the successful cutover of the newly acquired assets, we achieved annualized integration cost synergies of $1 billion in the second quarter. This is a substantial outperformance relative to our original day 1 target of $525 million. We have also raised our total synergy target to $1.25 billion, which is considerably above our prior $700 million target.
We're particularly pleased that EBITDA from the acquisition met our expectations. Revenue for these assets was lower than anticipated as a result of a number of factors that John will discuss. But because of increased synergies, EBITDA remained in line with expectations.
We have been very disciplined in our approach to operating the new markets. This included maintaining customer pricing and keeping promotions in line with those that Verizon offers in these markets. Furthermore, we are utilizing retention offers similar to Verizon's and we are managing the normal promotional expiration cycle well. The net result of these actions is illustrated by the relative stability of the revenue we achieved after Frontier became the owner of the new properties.
As we have discussed on our last call, during the cutover period, we temporarily suspended acquisition marketing activities. This resulted in an expected slowing in gross additions. We are now back to a typical level of marketing in the new properties and all customer service calls are now being handled domestically. As a result, we have seen an improvement in gross adds and expect this to reach normalized levels as we continue through this quarter.
Turning to the commercial segment in the new markets. We have begun to implement our plans to build our direct and indirect commercial sales channel strategies. We expect to see traction in these channels in the fourth quarter time frame. As we focus on building our marketing programs in the consumer and commercial segments, we expect to drive revenue and free cash flow.
We have also continued to execute our broadband network upgrade program in both existing and new markets. This program will result in the expansion of 50 megabits or higher broadband capability to 2 million homes over the next year. I will discuss these exciting plans in more detail later in the call. 
With a full quarter of combined results, we also have narrowed our guidance range for this year, which John will discuss in more detail towards the end of our prepared remarks.
And finally, we continue to be focused on cash generation as illustrated by our common dividend payout ratio of 49% of free cash flow in the quarter.
Please turn to Slide 4. Before we get into the details of the quarter, I'd like to take a moment to remind you of how well we are positioned moving forward. With the doubling of our size, Frontier now has the scale, technology and diversification to realize significant opportunities across our newly expanded footprint. At the same time, we remain committed to our disciplined capital allocation strategy, including maintaining our sustainable, attractive dividend and delivering value to shareholders, driven by recent strategic acquisitions and operational execution.
Please turn to Slide 5, where I will discuss in more detail our plan to drive higher shareholder value from our significantly larger base of assets. We are expanding our revenue opportunities by transforming our network capabilities and creating long-term competitive advantage. In many of the non-FiOS areas, this will be the first time customers will have the ability to choose a competitive Internet service product, and we expect to see strong demand for these new capabilities. Our primary focus will be increasing broadband penetration and offering customers opportunities to access the new speeds and capabilities we will introduce. In addition, we will be offering a full suite of business solutions for the SME segment, with expanded distribution channels.
Within the FiOS markets, we have a very strong brand image and a product offering. We will continue to upgrade speeds and capacities to these markets to maintain our superior data and video offerings. And we believe we have further opportunity for market share gains.
Our CAF II build remains underway, and we are on track to bring higher-speed capabilities to an additional 750,000 households over the coming years. Although the minimum speed in CAF II markets will be 10 megabits, many of these households will be served with higher speeds as we deploy the same leading-edge technology that is allowing us to improve the speed in our existing footprint.
Our expansion of video service to new portions of our existing service territory is moving along very well. We expect to have video availability to about 0.5 million additional households by the end of this year. As we upgrade different markets in the new territories, we expect to introduce our Vantage TV product. This means that many non-FiOS areas in the new markets will become Vantage TV-enabled. As a result, our expansion of video will ultimately exceed the initial 3 million households previously announced.
Our plans to upgrade broadband capabilities in the new markets and to introduce video creates a significant opportunity for revenue growth. The builds are extremely capital-efficient and certainly far more capital-efficient than the broadband and video upgrades undertaken by peer companies in the past. When complete, we will have great networks and capabilities in these markets, and we'll have created them at a capital intensity consistent with current guidance levels.
On the commercial side, we are in the process of introducing distribution channels in the new markets. In addition, we are implementing our wholesale and retail product strategy, with a focus on solutions for both FiOS and copper markets.
Please turn to Slide 6. As we have promised, our revenue mix has been transformed as a result of this transaction. In doing so, we have dramatically increased our exposure to growing profitable market segments while reducing exposure to residential voice, which is down to just 14% of our revenue base. Furthermore, wireless backhaul is now less than 3% of revenue and will present less pressure going forward. As you consider our new broadband and video initiatives, they should result in higher growth of these categories over time, and you'll understand why we are so excited about the potential for revenue trends to improve going forward.
Please turn to Slide 7. As we have completed our initial cutover efforts in the new properties, we have refocused the organization to develop plans to upgrade our speed offerings in our existing footprint and have begun to execute upgrade plans for the copper-based service in the new markets. The first phase of this upgrade will be accomplished over the coming quarters and will raise speeds in these upgraded areas from 7 megabits to 50 to 100 megabits. Following the upgrade, we will commence marketing and offering speed upgrades to current customers in these areas.
In our current markets, we continue to invest in our network and in our management and provisioning platforms to expand higher-speed products. We expect to upgrade approximately 1.5 million homes to higher speeds over the next year. The combination of our plans to upgrade both the current and new markets improves our speed profile to approximately 2 million households. Following completion, over 40% of our households will be capable of receiving speeds in excess of 50 megabits. These upgrades improve a full 14% of our households passed and provides a very competitive service offering.
As we continue to develop our priorities for the new markets, we will update you on our deployment plans. The introduction of these new capabilities and the incorporation of the video capabilities in these markets using our Vantage TV platform provides a tremendous opportunity to operate a differentiated product set in areas that haven't had many competitive options.
In summary, I am very pleased with the transition from integration to normal operations in the new markets. We have begun acquisition marketing and expect normal gross add levels to return over the coming quarter. We are also beginning to harvest the benefits in our existing markets from the system upgrades and enhancements needed for our Verizon integration efforts.
As we pursue the revenue growth opportunities, we will also focus on improving our cost structure and realize the additional $250 million of cost savings over the next 3 years. 
And now I'll turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, John Jureller."
261171,372125793,1020941,"Frontier Communications Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 01, 2016",2016-08-01,"Earnings Calls","Frontier Communications Parent, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Dan. Please turn to Slide 8, where I'll start by going through key financial highlights. Second quarter revenue was $2.61 billion, up from $1.36 billion in the first quarter, with the acquisition of the new markets driving the substantial incre",1883,"Thank you, Dan. Please turn to Slide 8, where I'll start by going through key financial highlights. Second quarter revenue was $2.61 billion, up from $1.36 billion in the first quarter, with the acquisition of the new markets driving the substantial increase. We had a net loss to common shareholders of $80 million or $0.07 per share. Adjusted EBITDA of $1.03 billion represented a margin of 39.6%. We generated free cash flow of $250 million after payment of dividends on the preferred stock.
Please turn to Slide 9. The second quarter revenue of $2.61 billion included $1.33 billion from the existing markets, down from $1.36 billion in the first quarter. Within our existing markets, the trend in residential is solid, with revenue down less than 1% sequentially, reflecting a full quarter benefit of the improved average revenue per customer or ARPC, including from the roll-off of the Connecticut acquisition promotional pricing over the course of Q1 and Q2. We did see a sequential decline in business revenue, mostly driven by a decline in wholesale, including wireless backhaul. 
Adjusted operating expenses in Q2 in the existing markets improved by $6 million sequentially to $821 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $505 million for a margin of 38.1%.
In terms of the new markets, the adjusted EBITDA of $527 million and a 41.2% margin met our expectations, with our superior performance in addressing the cost base of the acquired business offsetting the starting revenue received for the historical Verizon Separate Telephone Operations or VSTO business. 
Please turn to Slide 10. Let me take you through the revenue progression or jump-off as the acquired business came under our operational domain. It's important to have an appropriate starting point for these new markets and understand the results from activity under Frontier's ownership.
We previously filed information with the historical VSTO financial performance. Today, we filed the same VSTO information for the first quarter of 2016. This information shows revenue of $1.394 billion in Q1 prior to any adjustments.
Now let's go through the revenue block. First, as in previous filings, there was a pro forma adjustment for a minor amount of revenue and the reclassification of bad debt expense, a total of $16 million in that quarter. Second, upon closing, there was another $25 million of allocated revenue with no net impact to EBITDA that did not transfer. Third, we made certain strategic decisions to not take on contracts and customers that, while generating approximately $48 million in revenue, collectively resulted in a material improvement to our EBITDA.
Next, there were approximately $26 million of temporary impacts to revenue, those that will recover, the largest being the accounting adjustment for deferred customer installation revenue, the suspension of late fee charges for this transitional quarter and minor customer outage credits.
Finally, we had only a modest $9 million decline in revenue from operations under our ownership, notwithstanding, as we communicated, the hold on marketing efforts directed at new customer acquisition.
For the last item under our control in the period, you'll note that there was an overall improvement to EBITDA in the quarter, reflecting a well-executed program of managing the roll-off of expiring promotional pricing for customers in the acquired base.
In total, we recorded $1.282 billion of revenue in the quarter for the new markets. This does include approximately $12 million in additional regulatory revenue related to the CAF II increment above the historical present support levels in California and Texas for the pre-closing period as per our arrangements with Verizon. Excluding this amount, one should consider $1.27 billion as the starting point for measuring our Q3 results.
Please turn to Slide 11. Our customer trends for the existing markets showed improvement in Q2. Our residential customer churn decreased to 1.7% from 1.8% and broadband net additions increased 3.5% to 25,500. We anticipate that as we roll out greater speed capabilities in the existing markets and increase the availability of video, our net addition trend should be further enhanced, both through growth -- improved gross additions and reduced churn. As we had anticipated and previously communicated, broadband net additions were negative in the new markets.
Let's turn to Slide 12 for a further look at the activity in the new markets in the quarter. These charts disaggregate the net change in gross additions and deactivations for the period. As we discussed last quarter, our plan was to suspend new customer acquisition marketing during Q2. As a result, our FiOS gross adds in Q2 reflected a natural rate of customer inbound calls as there was no assistant -- assistance from outbound marketing. This intentional reduction of gross addition activity accounted for the large reduction in net adds in Q2. We did it to free our technicians and call center reps to focus on existing customers during the transition. With the transition behind us, we have begun our marketing programs in Q3 and would expect a return to normal levels of FiOS gross adds over the course of the second half of the year.
Our disconnect rate in Q2 was elevated slightly, which is to be expected during such a transition, but was not materially above the level experienced by Verizon in these markets in Q2 '15. This reinforces that the net customer add result in Q2 was a result of fewer gross adds and not an elevated level of churn among existing customers.
Non-FiOS net adds were also negative, but within the historic trend that Verizon has had over the recent quarters. We expect this trend to continue until we get the upgraded non-FiOS equipment into the field, enabling service. Over time, we anticipate that our non-FiOS net adds will turn positive as a result of our planned broadband upgrades.
Please turn to Slide 13. We are very pleased that we are able to achieve $1 billion in annualized cost synergies in Q2. This is a $400 million increase above our prior day 1 expectations or an incremental $100 million per quarter. Improvements came from cost to support the non-transferring allocated revenue and from the strategic decisions we made, as we described in the revenue block. Other amounts were a direct outcome of leveraging the further productivity and network improvements we decided to make, which were enabled by the higher onetime integration spending.
The net of all of our integration activities and implementing the operating structure to support the acquired business is shown on Slide 14. In total, we are raising our cost reduction estimates to $1.25 billion to be achieved by the end of year 3. This incremental $250 million above our day 1 achievement will be spread across both our existing business as well as the new markets. We are developing action plans for implementation of additional initiatives and are confident that these will be achieved.
Please turn to Slide 15. In our existing markets, we achieved average revenue per customer or ARPC of $63.05 in the second quarter, representing an increase of $0.41 from the first quarter. There were several drivers of this increase, with the most important being the benefits of the expiration of promotional pricing in Connecticut. Additionally, we have the return of snow bird customers in northern markets, the continued migration of customers to higher-speed broadband tiers and growth in Frontier Secure. These items were partially offset by the continued decline in voice connections.
On a combined basis, our ARPC was $83.20. The ARPC of the new markets is $110.30 because of the strong contribution of the FiOS triple-play customers.
Please turn to Slide 16. Frontier's cash flow remains very healthy. Capital expenditures were $350 million in the second quarter and we spent an additional $36 million in CapEx related to integration activities. Our adjusted free cash flow was $250 million in the second quarter. Our dividend payout ratio was 49%.
On July 26, the board declared a common dividend of $0.105 per share for the third quarter of 2016, payable September 30, in line with expectations. We will also be paying the regularly scheduled dividend on our preferred shares on September 30.
Please turn to Slide 17. Our leverage ratio at the end of Q2 was 3.71x, which is the trailing 12-month pro forma to reflect the inclusion of the Verizon transaction and $1 billion of the annualized cost synergies. We would expect a modest increase in the net leverage ratio as we roll forward over the next 3 quarters. This is due in part to the CAF II true-up amounts that we recorded in the third and fourth quarters of 2015. Thereafter, as we've indicated, we see the balance sheet deleveraging by 0.1x to 0.2x turns per year, beginning in 2017.
Frontier's liquidity position remains robust. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.4 billion in cash and credit availability. Our debt is well laddered and we have the ability to comfortably manage our debt maturities coming due over the next few years.
Frontier's capital allocation framework remains unchanged. We will invest appropriately in our network infrastructure and operations, support our current dividend and utilize the remaining cash flow to reduce debt and our leverage ratio. We are committed to maintaining our liquidity and reducing our leverage over time.
Please turn to Slide 18. Now that we have completed our first quarter of operating our new markets, we have updated our 2016 guidance ranges. We anticipate the full year 2016 adjusted free cash flow to be in the range of $825 million to $900 million. This includes the contribution from only 3 quarters of California, Texas and Florida.
We anticipate capital expenditures of $1.275 billion to $1.325 billion in 2016, inclusive of our CAF II-related expenditures and excluding integration spending.
We estimate full year cash taxes will be a net refund of $10 million to $20 million. Going forward over the next few years, we are currently estimating cash taxes to be near 0, with a substantial benefit being derived from the tax basis step-up negotiated as part of our transaction with Verizon.
We estimate cash pension contributions for 2016 of $10 million to $15 million.
We estimate that 2016 reported interest expense will be in the range of $1.53 billion to $1.55 billion. Interest expense increased sequentially in Q2 from the first quarter by about $13 million net, reflecting the drawing of the term loan A at the end of quarter -- at quarter-end to fund the acquisition and the interest related to the debt we assumed from Verizon after closing. We estimate that interest expense, including the Q1 portion of interest expense on the $6.6 billion of acquisition-related debt, will be in the range of approximately $1.34 billion to $1.36 billion.
Finally, looking forward, we are currently estimating that full year 2017 adjusted EBITDA will be over $4 billion.
In summary, Frontier's Q2 2016 operating results; our opportunities with the California, Texas and Florida acquisition; our prudent capital investments and expense management all provide a strong cash flow base and a solid financial platform for supporting and investing in the business. We have ample capital to invest in and enhance our competitive infrastructure, service our debt and comfortably sustain our dividend and maintain a dividend payout ratio superior to others in the telecom sector.
I will pass the call back to the operator, who will open up the line for questions."

We are seeing similar results, and we're expecting those results to stay stable as we go through the remainder of the year.
When you look at the new properties, I think you'd characterized it correctly. As we described it, it was a gross addition issue. There were some -- a little bit higher churn that was associated with the cutover, but really nothing worse than we have described before. We started acquisition marketing on July 1. As you can imagine, you don't just turn on marketing and you start to get similar levels of gross additions as what a well-primed program had going for multiple years. So we're building right now. And with the current trajectory, we think, by the end of third quarter, we'll be at normal run rates.
And the one caveat I would just add is that the copper markets in the new areas are really in the same condition as what we inherited. So while we do the upgrades, you should expect the trends in those areas to remain similar to the past. And then, as we upgrade, as we said, 500,000 homes to higher speeds, we hope to change the trajectory there and that would really be a big contributor to the new markets' net broadband positive going forward."

Now that it's tighter, you maintained the midpoint of the free cash flow guide, but CapEx is slightly lower and taxes are actually a refund now, that helps. What does that imply in terms of, I guess, EBITDA slightly lower than you had expected, even though second quarter came in kind of in line with your expectations? Is it the timing of the incremental synergies coming in? Or do you expect more spending, like you mentioned on the marketing side, to offset that?

And as a result, our cost structure that we had first estimated could be improved just by further levels of automation.
I'd say one of the bigger bang for the buck on the synergies, too, was our engineering team rethought the architecture for a certain component of the data network for these properties. As they executed on that, it caused a little bit more expense and a little bit more CapEx from an integration perspective, but it was a substantial increase in synergies that was associated with moving to the new architecture.
Those are probably 2 of the biggest improvements from what we originally thought we were going to be able to obtain to what we delivered on day one."

And so yes, there were certain -- certain of that revenue that didn't come across. But at the same time, as we took out more expense because we had reoriented our network architecture, so by making that decision, we actually drove a better EBITDA outcome.
There were a couple of things like that where we just sort of sat back and made some discrete decisions and did what we thought was best for the business. But net-net is that strategic decision bucket resulted in an improvement in EBITDA for us on a go-forward basis."

With respect to the EBITDA guidance going forward, I think -- we think about $4 billion as sort of the baseline for where we're going to go. And as we develop that out, we'll see more. We do have certain of the trailing revenues that have rolled off our business, both from -- strategically from our existing business and from the acquired business. And primarily, it's the voice revenue headwinds that we've had. So we always factor this in from a trailing perspective, but we do feel comfortable that we will have it -- a deleveraging path as we go forward.
With respect to the -- your question, I think, on the allocated revenue or the strategic decisions that we took, these are things -- these are information that either we developed right as we were getting into cutover or as we saw -- as we -- the financial impact as we got throughout the entire quarter. But it's important to remember, though, that what we drove was a positive EBITDA outcome from all of these things, and that does not include the incremental synergies that we think about the business going forward as well as those incremental synergies we've only started to bake in to our forward thinking with respect to EBITDA.
So some of this information developed -- was developed just immediately prior to close, some throughout the course of the quarter that we could really quantify in a more specific way, but we do feel comfortable in our business as we go forward."

As far as the special access proceeding, I think it's too early to tell exactly what the impact is going to be to us. I do think that the Chairman desires to have something done on his watch, so to speak, and he'll push to do that. The comment period was just extended an additional 2 weeks based on the need to maybe modify some parts of the record around Ethernet and some other data. So I think it's a little too early to tell.

The other items that might fall into that bucket were things, for example, late fees that we didn't charge during the quarter.

About 3 years ago, we embarked on a substantial transformation of our business, starting with our Connecticut acquisition and more recently the acquisition of our new m",2194,"Good afternoon, and thank you for joining Frontier's Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. About 3 years ago, we embarked on a substantial transformation of our business, starting with our Connecticut acquisition and more recently the acquisition of our new markets in California, Texas and Florida. Through this process, we have more than doubled the size and scale of the company, improved the quality of our asset, substantially diversified our revenue streams and geographic footprint and expanded the sophistication and attractiveness of our product offering. We have taken on a challenge of this magnitude and complexity in such a short period of time, and I'm very proud of our overarching accomplishments and pleased that in the just-completed third quarter we made substantial progress. 
Nonetheless, important aspects of our third quarter financial results are disappointing and illustrate how much further we have to go. I want to assure you that I am focused on addressing and resolving the issues hindering our performance. I am fully aware that the third quarter results underscore the urgent need for our expanded business to perform at the higher level where I know it can and should. And you have my personal commitment that we will do so. 
Let me go right to the issue of our revenue results. Third quarter revenues were $2.52 billion. This total reflects our taking on $20 million reserve associated with resumption of customer credit treatment in CTF during the third quarter. Excluding this and adjusting for the onetime recognition of $12 million in CAF II funds for the CTF states in the second quarter, revenue declined $52 million sequentially. This decline is unacceptable and reflects a level of performance that I am committed to changing. And during this call, I will discuss some of the means that we are using to make this change. 
Let me also highlight that today we had announced the new customer-focused organizational structure and the creation of commercial and consumer business units. This change is designed to improve our execution and operational effectiveness, increase its expansive control in the organization and make us more nimble, while at the same time eliminating duplicative costs associated with our former structure. In the first months of operating our new properties, it became apparent that this change was necessary, and I'll talk more about this realignment in a few moments. 
Please turn to Slide 3. Highlights for the quarter included the following: We achieved adjusted EBITDA of $1 billion, in line with the target that we had outlined for you previously. When we saw a decline in revenue, we made real-time adjustments to our cost structure, and we will continue work on both revenue and expense levels to ensure we deliver EBITDA at or above the $4 billion level we have provided as our estimate for 2017. We will provide formal guidance for 2017 during our Q4 earnings call, following approval of our annual budget by our Board of Directors. 
CTF subscriber trends improved substantially in the third quarter, although it is not yet at the rate we are targeting. This lower rate resulted because we began marketing during the seasonally slowest sales period. We on-shored our customer contact centers, which initially impacted our principal sales channel negatively, and we resumed customer collection processes. The last point began in the final month of the quarter and will have an impact in Q4 as well. This is a normal part of our integration process. We plan on addressing this by the end of Q4, at which point, receivables will be at a normal level. We will provide a breakout so that you can monitor our progress on these key metric.
Although our net subscriber performance affected Q3 revenues in CTF, we remain disciplined in our base management processes and did not experience revenue or margin erosion as customers migrated from promotional pricing to normal price points. This was a key focus for the company, and we executed well on that front. As we ramp marketing and adjust our offers, we expect continued improvements in net subscriber performance in the fourth quarter. We anticipate exiting the year at or close to normal levels of customer activity that would support a more stable revenue performance in CTF. 
Let me take a moment to address the Q3 impact in both legacy and CTF of the on-shoring of our customer care function. During Q3, the new contract center reps were still building competency in use of our systems as well as intimacy with our product. As a result, our call centers, our most important channel, underperformed our expectations. We believe we have completed this transition successfully at this time and are beginning to see improved results. 
So in summary, as it relates to subscriber performance, I anticipate that legacy broadband net additions will be positive again in Q4, but it is too early to determine if it will be back to historic levels. A positive in Q3 was a revenue enhancement program we put in place in our legacy property. This program contributed to improved ARPC and also helped drive improved sequential result in Q3 despite the weak net addition. We were pleased with our ability to raise pricing in line with the market on select customer segments. This represents on net a benefit of approximately $12 million to quarterly legacy revenue, a portion of which was realized in Q3. The full run rate amount will be realized in Q4. The negative impact of any associated churn with this will be isolated to Q3. 
I am pleased to report that this was our 11th sequential quarter of roughly stable SME revenue. This is a very impressive result, particularly when compared against the trends and peers. I believe this remains one of our best opportunities. And with the new organizational structure, we plan on increasing our focus and alignment of resources to improve our commercial trends. 
The final highlight involves network speed improvement. Last quarter, we outlined our plans to expand our speed capabilities so that approximately 2 million additional addressable households will be enabled for 50 megabits or higher speeds. To date, we have enabled in excess of 800,000 households, so this project is well underway, and we are beginning to market these incremental capabilities in the upgraded area. 
Please turn to Slide 4. In September, we raised our synergy target to $1.4 billion per year, up from $1.25 billion target outlined in the second quarter earnings report. Yet-to-be-obtained cost synergies of $250 million are anticipated to be achieved by midyear 2017 with the incremental $150 million anticipated to be achieved by midyear 2019. As I noted earlier, we are now seeing a new organizational structure. Among the highlights of this is the creation of a distinct customer-facing units for consumer and commercial. The benefits of these new units are greater focus on the differing needs of consumer and business customers, a more efficient allocation of resources and more standardization of business processes, which will allow greater automation and further cost reduction. The same is associated with our new organizational structure will be partially realized in Q4 and will be largely in place as we start the new year. We will continue to leverage the strengths of the regionalized organizational structure that has served us so well, and we are adapting it to allow us to keep pace with the dynamic competitive markets we serve. Operational leadership in each state will continue to have the objective of delivering high-quality service by exceeding our customers' expectations. They will also act as a connection to the various communities to ensure we have local paths for community engagement. Functions that are not customer-facing, including engineering, finance, human resources, communications and marketing will be centralized, increasing efficiency and effectiveness. Our focus in the consumer market has not changed. We will pursue opportunities aggressively in all of our FiOS market. We have begun the process of upgrading broadband capabilities in non-FiOS areas of CTF. In fact, we will have the first 300,000 households upgraded over the next 90 days and open for sale. We are continuing to expand our Vantage products footprint, and we are planning a relaunch of our legacy FiOS areas, following the successful conversion of the base to the new and improved interactive media guide and integration of our improved VOD library. And we are in track for our CAF II deployments to offer broadband to these underserved markets as quickly as practical. We will have 170,000 households open for marketing by year-end and another 90,000 non-CAF II households in adjacent areas. 
For commercial, we have realized sales, marketing and commercial product management under a single leader reporting directly to me, which is a significant change from our practice over the last few years. This builds on the substantial improvements we have been making behind the scenes over the last 12 months in revamping both our sales and support staff and our commercial marketing platform. Even before these changes, we had compiled an impressive, consistent steady performance track record in the SME portion of commercial. Our increased focus and emphasis on the commercial market will enable us to be a more nimble, responsive competitor. Another benefit of our new organizational structure will be more efficient capital management. The new structure will allow us to allocate capital more dynamically, prioritizing the highest return opportunity. The near-term priorities will be supporting the areas that I highlighted earlier and on IC enhancements that will drive improvements in our cost structure. 
Please turn to Slide 5. In contrast to the second and third quarters' focus on cutover integration and building organizational competency, we have now shifted our focus to the following: first, we will continue to improve our performance in the CTF market, most notably in the FiOS portion of consumer. Second, as we enable new broadband capabilities in CTF and legacy markets, we will begin ramping marketing and sales accordingly. Third, we will drive commercial sales after spending much of 2016 building prospect pipelines in the new market. And finally, we will implement our new organizational structure and implement our synergy and efficiency projects to drive improved cost structures in both legacy and CTF markets. These are our top priorities of the entire organization, and the senior management will be held accountable for delivering these results. 
As we have discussed consistently, our company has been in integration mode for nearly 3 years. As we move forward, we will have a laser focus on ensuring our cost structure is continually evaluated and adjusted in keeping with the realities of the marketplace. Let me assure you that we will continue to manage our cost structure to match the revenue trends, and we are firmly committed to our objective of exceeding $4 billion in adjusted EBITDA in 2017. 
Let me say a few words about the FCC's potential changes in the pricing of business data services. On October 7, the FCC released a fact sheet highlighting details of its proposed changes. Frontier remains opposed to the current framework, and we will continue building support for the proposal that we submitted in conjunction with Sprint and Windstream. As a reminder, if the factsheet framework is adopted for implementation in July 2017, we project an impact of $10 million in 2017 and an additional impact of $20 million in each of 2018 and 2019, with lesser impacts in the following years. If the FCC implements this rate reduction, we will mitigate any revenue declines with additional cost reductions. Last week, the FCC [indiscernible] one of its agenda for a vote in its opening morning scheduled for November 17. 
To summarize my comments, we have completed the bulk of the integration of the new markets. This includes achieving completion of the on-shoring of the contact center resources for both tech support and customer care faster than originally planned. We are working to improve performance from all of our distribution channels to move our sales to a more normal trend in Q4 time frame. Our organizational restructuring is under way, and we will enhance our ability to execute in the consumer and commercial segments, while significantly improving our cost structure. As you can tell, this is a very busy time at Frontier. The focus moving forward is all about execution and driving sales and aligning our cost structure to the realities of the current market, and I'm confident that we will begin to see the benefits of all this focus over the coming months. 
Before I turn this call over to our new CFO, I wanted to thank John Jureller for his service and dedication to the company. As we stated on September 12, John made significant contributions during our Connecticut and CTF acquisition, particularly in connection with the renegotiation of deals and associated financing transaction. I've known Perley for almost 16 years and worked directly with him for almost 10 of those years. He is the right CFO for us at this time because he's laser focused on operational excellence and cost management. He will be invaluable to the company and me as we move forward. 
And now I'll turn the call over to Perley to review the financial results."

Let's turn to Slide 6, and I will begin with the key financial highlights of the quarter. Third quarter revenue of $2.52 billion declined $84 million from the $2.61 billion reported in the second quarter. Cu",1772,"Thank you, Dan, and good afternoon, everyone. 
Let's turn to Slide 6, and I will begin with the key financial highlights of the quarter. Third quarter revenue of $2.52 billion declined $84 million from the $2.61 billion reported in the second quarter. Customer revenue of $2.32 billion declined $62 million, and I will provide some greater detail shortly. Switched access and subsidy revenue of $205 million declined $22 million sequentially, with $12 million of this decline related to the onetime recognition of CAF II revenue in the second quarter, which did not recur in Q3. Another $6 million of the decline was related to the schedule step-down of switched access rate, and $3 million of the decline was related to the CAF II phase-down. In other words, only $1 million of the $22 million was related to the displacement of minutes of use. Adjusted EBITDA of $1 billion was in line with the outlook we provided on September 21. This represented a margin of 39.6%, which was stable with the second quarter. We've generated free cash flow of $168 million after payment of dividends on our preferred stock. Adjusted free cash flow was down sequentially, in part because of the sequential increase in CapEx. 
On Slide 7, we showed the breakout of customer revenue between legacy and CTF. In legacy, customer revenue of $1.16 billion was down $7 million or 0.6% sequentially, which is a significant improvement from the 2% sequential decline we experienced in Q2. The factors driving the change in Q3 were a $9 million sequential decline in residential, partly offset by a $2 million sequential increase in business. As Dan mentioned, our revenue enhancement program underway in the quarter contributed to Q3 legacy residential revenue, and we expect an additional incremental benefit in Q4. We're investing to enhance and expand our broadband and video capabilities, and we expect these investments to contribute to an improved revenue trend over time. 
Moving to CTF. Customer revenue of $1.16 billion was down 4.5% from the $1.21 billion reported in the second quarter. The primary factor in the decline was residential revenue, which was down 6.8%. Business revenue of $456 million was down only 0.9% sequentially. In business, our legacy ARPC was up $13 sequentially as a result of an improved revenue trend in Q3. Business ARPC in CTF of $615 was also up sequentially but is still substantially below the level of legacy ARPC. The new commercial business unit that we announced today will improve our ability to differentiate our services for business customers and tailor solutions to unique needs of various segments of the market. We have already made solid progress in this area. 
The CTF product deal provides more color on the drivers behind the revenue decline in the quarter, with video down 6.5% sequentially and voice down 3.4% sequentially. Residential subscriber declines are the primary driver of this revenue trend, and we are focused on achieving improved trends. 
In contrast to the video revenue trend, data and Internet was up slightly sequentially in Q3, and this was consistent across both residential and business. The $12 million sequential decline in CTF other revenue includes the $20 million decline related to the receivable reserve we have taken in CTF, which Dan mentioned. This is offset by an increase in anticipated late fees, reflecting recovery to normal trends as we were not charging late fees in Q2 due to the transition. 
Turning to Slide 8. We see that growth additions for legacy were down in Q3. As Dan outlined, the issues were typical third quarter seasonality and the transition of the call centers as a result of the on-shoring that occurred in Q3. Broadband churn in legacy in Q3 was up slightly, reflecting the disruption of the call centers as well as the impact of the revenue enhancement program. Video churn was more stable, but still elevated compared to the first quarter of 2016. 
Within CTF, gross additions improved sequentially for data and video, but have not returned to the level achieved on the Verizon, as illustrated in the graph. Returning these metrics to pre-acquisition level is a top priority. CTF video churn increased in Q3, but data churn was relatively stable, yet still elevated compared to pre-close levels. 
Finally, in terms of the total customer churn, in legacy markets, it was approximately 1.9%, up about 20 bps sequentially. Customer churn in CTF was up about 10 bps sequentially. Longer term, we anticipate the expansion of video in the legacy markets to have a positive influence on customer churn. 
On Slide 9, residential ARPC in our legacy markets of $63.41 was up $0.36 sequentially. The principal driver of this increase was the revenue enhancement program that Dan discussed earlier. In CTF, residential ARPC of $108.69 was down $1.61 sequentially. Excluding the receivables reserve, it would have been up $0.64 sequentially. On a combined basis, our ARPC was $82.34, down from $83.20. However, excluding the receivables impact, it would have been up slightly. 
Turning to Slide 10. Our Q3 adjusted operating expenses in legacy improved by $22 million sequentially to $799 million, more than offsetting the modest decline in revenue. These expense reductions were achieved through better management of outside vendors and variable cost reduction. As a result, adjusted EBITDA in legacy was $513 million, up 1.6% sequentially despite the decline in revenue. The adjusted EBITDA margin in legacy was 39.2%, up 110 basis points from the prior quarter. Adjusted operating expenses in CTF declined about $29 million sequentially, or 3.8%, due in part to lower content cost. Adjusted EBITDA in CTF of $486 million was down about $41 million sequentially. This represented an adjusted EBITDA margin of 40.0%. Excluding the receivables reserve, adjusted EBITDA margin would have only decreased 20 bps from the 41.2% experienced in Q2. We are committed to adjusting the expense base of the business and respond to changes in revenue trends and intend to drive overall margins higher over time. Our plan is to achieve $250 million expense synergies by midyear 2017 and a total of $400 million by midyear 2019. As we demonstrated in Q3, we can also attain expense reductions that are not synergy-related. 
As we move to Slide 11, in Q3, our capital spending was $403 million, up from $350 million in Q2. The increase was related to seasonal capital projects and a delay in CTF capital spending post close in Q2. We are updating our capital spending guidance for 2016 to a range of $1.25 billion to $1.275 billion, which implies a sequential decline in fourth quarter capital spending. Growth initiatives account for approximately half of our 2016 capital expenditures, most significant are the numerous broadband enhancement and expansion programs we have underway, including the more than 800,000 additional homes that have been enabled for 50 megs or greater capability as well as the new broadband builds in the covered areas of CTS. About 300,000 of the 500,000 new builds should be complete by the first quarter. Also included in this category are the CAF II homes that Dan discussed as well as the targeted fiber-to-the-home expansions we are doing. For business, we continue to expand and enhance our Ethernet capabilities and make additional investments to expand new services to business customers. The video builds we commenced will reach 150,000 households in 3 markets this year. We're also making advancement in IT capabilities that are directly related to driving incremental revenue. The remainder of our capital spending is a combination of IT investments related to productivity enhancements and maintenance-related projects. 
Looking toward next year, our capital spending plan for 2017 is in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion. While this is a decline, our larger size has enabled greater efficiencies, including better pricing in procuring goods and services. Additionally, our CapEx spend on integration has allowed us to transform our operating support systems and provisioning platforms. These investments have positioned us well, which will also allow us greater flexibility in 2017. So despite the lower absolute spending, we expect to have an equally robust capital program in 2017. 
Please turn to Slide 12. Our leverage ratio at the end of Q3 was 3.86x, which is the trailing 12-month pro forma, including run rate cost synergies. We expect a modest increase in the leverage ratio as we move forward over the next 2 quarters, which is due in part to the substantial CAF II true-up amount that impacted EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2015. We have a healthy cash balance, strong liquidity and a manageable maturity schedule. In 2017, we have approximately $500 million in maturities and slightly over $700 million in 2018, the majority of which is due in Q4 of '18. Net debt is $17.6 billion. And existing liquidity, together with ongoing cash flow from operations, will enable us to meet these maturities and reduce additional debt and leverage over time. I want to reiterate that we are very focused on delevering the business. 
On Slide 13, our trailing 12 months dividend payout ratio was 54%, which remains one of the most attractive in the telecoms sector. The board has declared a common dividend of $0.105 per share for the fourth quarter of 2016, payable December 31. We will also pay the regularly scheduled dividend on our preferred shares on December 30. 
Please turn to Slide 14. We are refining 2016 guidance as follows: fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA to be $1 billion or more; full year capital spending of $1,250,000,000 to $1,275,000,000. Cash taxes are expected to be a refund of $100 million to $110 million. Cash pension contribution would be in a range of $10 million to $15 million. We anticipate interest expense of $1.53 billion to $1.54 billion. For the purposes of our adjusted free cash flow guidance, interest related to the CTF transaction is excluded from Q1, the quarter we didn't get to own the asset, to $1.34 billion to $1.35 billion would be the interest expense that would correspond to our free cash flow guidance. And we anticipate 2016 adjusted free cash flow to be in the range of $920 million to $950 million. 
Lastly, on Slide 15. Formal guidance for 2017 will come in February after we have completed our planning for the year. In the meantime, we are providing an outlook for items we have visibility. We anticipate 2017 adjusted EBITDA to be $4 billion or higher. As mentioned, capital spending is in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, and cash taxes should be near 0.

So can you talk about what is not going as planned? And why you're deciding to make these operational changes, a little bit more providing more specifics around it? And just one final one and a quick follow-up. On the integration expense had been elevated for the last 2 quarters. Now that that process is done, can we assume that expense goes down substantially?"

So on the broadband side, probably the biggest change from last quarter was on the legacy side, where we did see those losses. The biggest impact for both the CTF side and also the legacy side was when we on-shored our call center. That remains probably 55% of our sales channel at any period. And as we've brought people on, it created some disruption and lack of performance in that area. And that really was probably the biggest issue. I think we were disappointed that we were not able to accelerate sales further on the CTF side. We certainly started in what is usually a fairly slow period for us, but we didn't see as good performance as we hoped. We're starting to see, as I said, improvement in October, but it's too early to call the fourth quarter, whether or not we're going to get there this month or next month or really, December. We'll have a lot better visibility as we execute on our fourth quarter offer in November and December. On the revenue side, we absolutely took the precautions that we've talked about, and we locked down the ability for the variable around migrations that occurred in Connecticut. So we have not seen that happen. I think we've been very successful in that front. The real -- where we're not being successful was on adding the gross adds on subscriber side on CTF. That's really where we're making the changes on everything from product offers to marketing tactics and channels. And where -- as I said, we're starting to see improvements on that. So I expect, as we improve the trends on the FiOS product set in CTF, we'll start to see much better improvement on the revenue trends. And then on the integration side, we did spend extensively to really on-shore our call centers much faster than originally planned. Original plans were that to happen through -- slowly through the balance of the year. We spent a lot of money extra on training, redundant resources to bring that back in. We're expecting to see integration spend trail off as we get into the fourth quarter. And then finally, as we looked at operating the business at the expanded scale and the ability to use different offers and look at the markets as we were originally constructing them, we felt that we would be much more efficient because the new markets are very homogeneous when it comes to the product sets that will be offered. We can take advantage of the scale around the markets as well as that standardization of what the product offers will be in Texas, Florida and California. And we looked at our normal business, our legacy business. We started to see that we will be a gaining a lot of benefit from taking out the duplicative cost structure there. So we're starting to look at it maybe 2 months ago, 3 months ago, and then we refined our plan and adjusted it accordingly over the last 30 to 60 days."

And we expect, as we introduce our holiday offer, which is really slated to hit the markets before Thanksgiving over the next week or 2 that we'll see improved performance even more. Probably the single biggest improvement, though, was getting to a point where 4,000 new reps that came into the company as we on-shored were selling effectively and efficiently using the tools. And you can't fully train everyone in the first month or 2. And we made a trade-off that accelerated that to improve -- to improve the customer experience from an offshore perspective to onshore. But the trade-off really was that they weren't as good at selling initially, and that's improving each and every day. So the combination of the enhanced offer that we're putting in the market as well as the improved competency did see that the trends continue to improve steadily in the fourth quarter."

And I think that there's really 3 stories that go along with that. Number one would be, Perley, that you came in and John left and somehow that had something to do with new eyes coming in and maybe having to cut the dividend. If you could kind of talk a little bit about what do you think your capacity to keeping the dividend, and the commitment of the company overall is to it, from your perspective, would be great. The second issue on the half the cut seems to be that we've got about, a call it, $250 million midpoint synergy run rate by next year, prorated over the year, it's about $125 million of benefit. And you've given this $4 billion or better guidance number, which leaves out there the possibility that everything outside synergies could come down another  $125 million. And then when the synergies start to peter out and the business is still declining at $125 million a year, we don't -- and we will put more pressure on the dividend. So could you kind of reconcile a $4 billion or better guidance number for next year relative to the $4 billion run rate you have right now, given that you think all the synergies are coming through? And the final piece, I think, to this leverage question that just got asked, there's a lot of confusion about the 4.5x leverage test that goes along with the restricted payments basket and whether you can or can't pay the dividend and when that occurs in the future, if at all. Could you talk directly to that calculation and how that impacts -- how we should think about the dividend being covered?"

I think most of your questions are probably going for Perley. But from my perspective, when it comes to that question on the dividend cut, we don't see that at the same risk that others are obviously factoring in. From our perspective, we have ample ability to control our cost structure. We are executing on that, even as we speak today. We'll be driving that through the fourth quarter into the first quarter and then trying to accelerate the additional synergies even faster. But more importantly, we're working to really change that revenue line item, and that's really what ultimately is going to solve that issue that you highlighted. And when you look at changing the CTF, it's based on performance, which is what we're all focused on right now. You look at all the substantial opportunity on the commercial side, which we've spent a year really building the funnel in the new property. But the new properties, quite frankly, have much more opportunity than the commercial ones and our legacy property. And then you look at the investments that we've made to enable better performance on our broadband side, each one of those is a unique opportunity that we can use to drive incremental revenue and start to really move the EBITDA line. I think you saw in this quarter we really -- our focus is very heavily on making sure that we heard loud and clear from -- different investors over time we have not been active in adjusting our cost structure. And we really went after it with [indiscernible] and we'll continue to do that. And if we see further pressure on the revenue side, we'll make the right decisions on the cost structure to really offset that.

Each one of the regions had its own resources that included marketing, finance, engineering, human resources. And in doing that, we -- when we were a much smaller entity. It really did serve us well at that point in time. The more we looked at it today, the less differences there are in a lot of the markets and the way we were going to market, whether it's around Vantage products or throughout FiOS or around next-generation broadband products. So when we look at it, we did a really a trade-off on it. So we essentially eliminated all of that redundancy in the organization. The impact is approximately 1,000 individuals leaving the organization, and that translates directly into cost savings. And the nice part about it, too, is enhanced focus on commercial as well consumer, and Frontier historically been a very consumer-focused organization. We've done well on the commercial side, but I really believe we can do much better with more focus, more attention and really putting the resources on those opportunities and making it that's what they do every day, when they get up and they come to work, all they're trying to do is grow the commercial revenue base. So that's really what we've done. It does change the focus of the field operations to really be engaged with the communities as well as providing excellent service to customers and being that bridge.

And I really think it's an accelerating issue, and it's our to fix. And we're fixing it. So I think you'll see us improve from a revenue stability as we do a better job of executing going forward. And I'm convinced that as we get those trends back to where we know they can be, because it is a great product set, and it's very competitive obviously the market, that we'll start to see that stability. I think the key areas that we're focusing on -- if you look at the commercial opportunity in these areas, we think that is a very large opportunity that we haven't even begun to tap yet. And people are always looking for a different way of solving their needs of their businesses, and we're starting to build robust pipelines around that right now. The sales pipeline tend to build over a 6- to 9-month period and then you really start to harvest all the fruits of those efforts. So those will all be incremental growth opportunities for us in these markets, especially on the CTF. I think on the legacy side, what we need to do is really do a better job of selling in the areas that we've upgraded or opened for sale. And those are in the speed upgrades as well as the CAF opportunity. When you look at the amount of CAF homes at the level opened for sale by the end of the year, that is a really good opportunity for us to really help change the trends on the legacy properties. In addition to that, we are, as we talked about on previous calls, opening markets throughout the end of this year and into next year around the Vantage platform. Vantage is not only video, but it's really enhanced broadband speeds, and it offers different commercial opportunities in the market. So we'll be capitalizing on all those things as we go forward. One final thing that will help us, too, I think, is really as we change the product availability in some of the copper markets for the new states we go from essentially a 6 meg product that hasn't been opened for sale in years, to a 50-plus meg product that's very competitive in the marketplace and offers customer a choice that they never had before. So we think that's an exciting opportunity. When you put all those things together, it really does give us the leverage we need to really push on the revenue side, but it really does start with improving in the CTF area, and that's where the laser focus is on the whole team right now."

About 3 years ago, we embarked on a substantial transformation of our business, starting with our Connecticut acquisition and more recently the acquisition of our new markets in California, Texas and Florida. Through this process, we have more than doubled the size and scale of the company, improved the quality of our assets, substantially diversified our revenue streams and geographic footprint, and expanded the sophistication and attractiveness of our product offering. We have taken on a challenge of this magnitude and complexity in such a short period of time, and I'm very proud of our overarching accomplishments and pleased that in the just-completed third quarter we made substantial progress. 
Nonetheless, important aspects of our third quarter financial results are disappointing and illustrate how much further we have to go. I want to assure you that I am focused on addressing and resolving the issues hindering our performance. I am fully aware that the third quarter results underscore the urgent need for our expanded business to perform at the higher level where I know it can and should, and you have my personal commitment that we will do so. 
Let me go right to the issue of our revenue results. Third quarter revenues were $2.52 billion. This total reflects our taking a $20 million reserve associated with resumption of customer credit treatment in CTF during the third quarter. Excluding this and adjusting for the onetime recognition of $12 million in CAF II funds for the CTF states in the second quarter, revenue declined $52 million sequentially. This decline is unacceptable and reflects a level of performance that I am committed to changing. And during this call, I will discuss some of the means that we are using to make this change. 
Let me also highlight that today we had announced a new customer-focused organizational structure and the creation of commercial and consumer business units. This change is designed to improve our execution and operational effectiveness, increase its spans of control on the organization and makes us more nimble, while at the same time eliminating duplicative costs associated with our former structure. In the first months of operating our new properties, it became apparent that this change was necessary. And I'll talk more about this realignment in a few moments. 
Please turn to Slide 3. Highlights for the quarter included the following: We achieved adjusted EBITDA of $1 billion, in line with the target that we had outlined for you previously. When we saw a decline in revenue, we made real-time adjustments to our cost structure, and we will continue work on both revenue and expense levels to ensure we deliver EBITDA at or above the $4 billion level we have provided as our estimate for 2017. We will provide formal guidance for 2017 during our Q4 earnings call, following approval of our annual budget by our Board of Directors. 
CTF subscriber trends improved substantially in the third quarter, although it is not yet at the rate we are targeting. This lower rate resulted because we began marketing during the seasonally slowest sales period. We on-shored our customer contact centers, which initially impacted our principal sales channel negatively, and we resumed customer collection processes. The last point began in the final month of the quarter and will have an impact in Q4 as well. This is a normal part of our integration process. We plan on addressing this by the end of Q4, at which point, receivables will be at a normal level. We will provide a breakout so that you can monitor our progress on these key metrics.
Although our net subscriber performance affected Q3 revenues in CTF, we remain disciplined in our base management processes and did not experience revenue or margin erosion as customers migrated from promotional pricing to normal price points. This was a key focus for the company, and we executed well on that front. As we ramp marketing and adjust our offers, we expect continued improvements in net subscriber performance in the fourth quarter. We anticipate exiting the year at or close to normal levels of customer activity that would support a more stable revenue performance in CTF. 
Let me take a moment to address the Q3 impact in both legacy and CTF of the on-shoring of our customer care function. During Q3, the new contract center reps were still building competency in the use of our systems as well as intimacy with our product. As a result, our call centers, our most important channel, underperformed our expectations. We believe we have completed this transition successfully at this time and are beginning to see improved results.
So in summary, as it relates to subscriber performance, I anticipate that legacy broadband net additions will be positive again in Q4, but it is too early to determine if it will be back to historic levels.
A positive in Q3 was the revenue enhancement program we put in place in our legacy properties. This program contributed to improved ARPC and also helped drive improved sequential result in Q3 despite the weak net addition. We were pleased with our ability to raise pricing in line with the market on select customer segments. This represents on net a benefit of approximately $12 million to quarterly legacy revenue, a portion of which was realized in Q3. The full run rate amount will be realized in Q4. The negative impact of any associated churn with this will be isolated to Q3. 
I am pleased to report that this was our 11th sequential quarter of roughly stable SME revenue. This is a very impressive result, particularly when compared against the trends and peers. I believe this remains one of our best opportunities. And with the new organizational structure, we plan on increasing our focus and alignment of resources to improve our commercial trends. 
The final highlight involves network speed improvement. Last quarter, we outlined our plans to expand our speed capabilities so that approximately 2 million additional addressable households would be enabled for 50 megabits or higher speeds. To date, we have enabled in excess of 800,000 households. So this project is well underway, and we are beginning to market these incremental capabilities in the upgraded area. 
Please turn to Slide 4. In September, we raised our synergy target to $1.4 billion per year, up from $1.25 billion target outlined in the second quarter earnings report. Yet-to-be-obtained cost synergies of $250 million are anticipated to be achieved by midyear 2017 with the incremental $150 million anticipated to be achieved by midyear 2019.
As I noted earlier, we are announcing a new organization structure. Among the highlights of this is the creation of a distinct customer-facing units for consumer and commercial. The benefits of these new units are greater focus on the differing needs of consumer and business customers, a more efficient allocation of resources and more standardization of business processes, which will allow greater automation and further cost reduction. The same is associated with our new organizational structure will be partially realized in Q4 and will be largely in place as we start the new year.
We will continue to leverage the strengths of the regionalized organizational structure that has served us so well, and we are adapting it to allow us to keep pace with the dynamic competitive markets we serve. Operational leadership in each state will continue to have the objective of delivering high-quality service by exceeding our customers' expectations.
They will also act as a connection to the various communities to ensure we have local paths for community engagement. Functions that are not customer-facing, including engineering, finance, human resources, communications and marketing will be centralized, increasing efficiency and effectiveness.
Our focus in the consumer market has not changed. We will pursue opportunities aggressively in all of our FiOS market. We have begun the process of upgrading broadband capabilities in non-FiOS areas of CTF. In fact, we will have the first 300,000 households upgraded over the next 90 days and open for sale.
We are continuing to expand our Vantage products footprint, and we are planning a relaunch of our legacy FiOS areas, following the successful conversion of the base to the new and improved interactive media guide and the integration of our improved VOD library. And we are in track for our CAF II deployments to offer broadband to these underserved markets as quickly as practical. We will have 170,000 households open for marketing by year-end and another 90,000 non-CAF II households in adjacent areas. 
For commercial, we have realized sales, marketing and commercial product management under a single leader reporting directly to me, which is a significant change from our practice over the last few years. This builds on the substantial improvements we have been making behind the scenes over the last 12 months in revamping both our sales and support staff and our commercial marketing platform. Even before these changes, we had compiled an impressive, consistent, steady performance track record in the SME portion of commercial. Our increased focus and emphasis on the commercial market will enable us to be a more nimble, responsive competitor.
Another benefit of our new organizational structure will be more efficient capital management. The new structure will allow us to allocate capital more dynamically, prioritizing the highest return opportunity. The near-term priorities will be supporting the areas that I highlighted earlier and on IC enhancements that will drive improvements in our cost structure. 
Please turn to Slide 5. In contrast to the second and third quarters' focus on cutover integration and building organizational competency, we have now shifted our focus to the following: first, we will continue to improve our performance in the CTF market, most notably in the FiOS portion of the consumer. Second, as we enable new broadband capabilities in CTF and legacy markets, we will begin ramping marketing and sales accordingly. Third, we will drive commercial sales after spending much of 2016 building prospect pipelines in the new market. And finally, we will implement our new organizational structure and implement our synergy and efficiency projects to drive improved cost structures in both legacy and CTF markets. These are our top priorities of the entire organization, and the senior management will be held accountable for delivering these results. 
As we have discussed consistently, our company has been in integration mode for nearly 3 years. As we move forward, we will have a laser focus on ensuring our cost structure is continually evaluated and adjusted in keeping with the realities of the marketplace. Let me assure you that we will continue to manage our cost structure to match the revenue trends, and we are firmly committed to our objective of exceeding $4 billion in adjusted EBITDA in 2017. 
Let me say a few words about the FCC potential changes in the pricing of business data services. On October 7, the FCC released a fact sheet highlighting details of its proposed changes. Frontier remains opposed to the current framework, and we will continue building support for the proposal that we submitted in conjunction with Sprint and Windstream. As a reminder, if the factsheet framework is adopted for implementation in July 2017, we project an impact of $10 million in 2017 and an additional impact of $20 million in each of 2018 and 2019, with lesser impacts in the following years. If the FCC implements this rate reduction, we will mitigate any revenue declines with additional cost reductions. Last week, the FCC placed this item on its agenda for a vote and its open meeting scheduled for November 17. 
To summarize my comments, we have completed the bulk of the integration of the new markets. This includes achieving completion of the on-shoring of the contact center resources for both tech support and customer care faster than originally planned. We are working to improve performance from all of our distribution channels to move our sales to a more normal trend in Q4 time frame. Our organizational restructuring is underway, and we will enhance our ability to execute in the consumer and commercial segments, while significantly improving our cost structure. As you can tell, this is a very busy time at Frontier. The focus moving forward is all about execution and driving sales and aligning our cost structure to the realities of the current markets, and I'm confident that we will begin to see the benefits of all this focus over the coming months. 
Before I turn this call over to our new CFO, I wanted to thank John Jureller for his service and dedication to the company. As we stated on September 12, John made significant contributions during our Connecticut and CTF acquisition, particularly in connection with the renegotiation of deals and associated financing transaction. I've known Perley for almost 16 years and worked directly with him for almost 10 of those years. He is the right CFO for us at this time because he's laser focused on operational excellence and cost management. He will be invaluable to the company and me as we move forward. 
And now I'll turn the call over to Perley to review the financial results."

Let's turn to Slide 6, and I will begin with the key financial highlights of the quarter. Third quarter revenue of $2.52 billion declined $84 million from the $2.61 billion reported in the second quarter. Cu",1775,"Thank you, Dan, and good afternoon, everyone. 
Let's turn to Slide 6, and I will begin with the key financial highlights of the quarter. Third quarter revenue of $2.52 billion declined $84 million from the $2.61 billion reported in the second quarter. Customer revenue of $2.32 billion declined $62 million, and I'll discuss this in greater detail shortly. Switched access and subsidy revenue of $205 million declined $22 million sequentially, with $12 million of this decline related to the onetime recognition of CAF II revenue in the second quarter, which did not recur in Q3. Another $6 million of the decline was related to the scheduled step-down of the switched access rate, and $3 million of the decline was related to the CAF II phase-down. In other words, only $1 million of the $22 million was related to the displacement of minutes of use.
Adjusted EBITDA of $1 billion was in line with the outlook we provided on September 21. This represented a margin of 39.6%, which was stable with the second quarter. We generated free cash flow of $168 million after payment of dividends on our preferred stock. Adjusted free cash flow was down sequentially, in part because of the sequential increase in CapEx. 
On Slide 7, we show the breakout of customer revenue between legacy and CTF. In legacy, customer revenue of $1.16 billion was down $7 million or 0.6% sequentially, which is a significant improvement from the 2% sequential decline we experienced in Q2. The factors driving the change in Q3 were a $9 million sequential decline in residential, partly offset by a $2 million sequential increase in business. As Dan mentioned, our revenue enhancement program underway in the quarter contributed to Q3 legacy residential revenue, and we expect an additional incremental benefit in Q4. We are investing to enhance and expand our broadband and video capabilities, and we expect these investments to contribute to an improved revenue trend over time. 
Moving to CTF. Customer revenue of $1.16 billion was down 4.5% from the $1.21 billion reported in the second quarter. The primary factor in the decline was residential revenue, which was down 6.8%. Business revenue of $456 million was down only 0.9% sequentially. In business, our legacy ARPC was up $13 sequentially as a result of an improved revenue trend in Q3. Business ARPC in CTF of $615 was also up sequentially but is still substantially below the level of legacy ARPC. The new commercial business unit that we announced today will improve our ability to differentiate our services for business customers and tailor solutions to the unique needs of various segments of the market. We have already made solid progress in this area. 
The CTF product deal provides more color on the drivers behind the revenue decline in the quarter, with video down 6.5% sequentially and voice down 3.4% sequentially. Residential subscriber declines are the primary driver of this revenue trend, and we are focused on achieving improved trends. 
In contrast to the video revenue trend, data and Internet was up slightly sequentially in Q3, and this was consistent across both residential and business. The $12 million sequential decline in CTF other revenue includes the $20 million decline related to the receivable reserve we have taken in CTF, which Dan mentioned. This is offset by an increase in anticipated late fees, reflecting recovery to normal trends as we were not charging late fees in Q2 due to the transition.
Turning to Slide 8. We see that growth additions for legacy were down in Q3. As Dan outlined, the issues were typical third quarter seasonality and the transition of the call centers as a result of the on-shoring that occurred in Q3. Broadband churn in legacy in Q3 was up slightly, reflecting the disruption in the call centers as well as the impact of the revenue enhancement program. Video churn was more stable, but still elevated compared to the first quarter of 2016. 
Within CTF, gross additions improved sequentially for data and video, but have not returned to the level achieved under Verizon, as illustrated in the graph. Returning these metrics to preacquisition levels is a top priority. CTF video churn increased in Q3, but data churn was relatively stable, yet still elevated compared to preclose levels. 
Finally, in terms of the total customer churn, in legacy markets, it was approximately 1.9%, up about 20 bps sequentially. Customer churn in CTF was up about 10 bps sequentially. Longer term, we anticipate the expansion of video in the legacy markets to have a positive influence on customer churn. 
On Slide 9, residential ARPC in our legacy markets of $63.41 was up $0.36 sequentially. The principal driver of this increase was the revenue enhancement program that Dan discussed earlier. In CTF, residential ARPC of $108.69 was down $1.61 sequentially. Excluding the receivables reserve, it would have been up $0.64 sequentially. On a combined basis, our ARPC was $82.34, down from $83.20. However, excluding the receivables impact, it would have been up slightly. 
Turning to Slide 10. Our Q3 adjusted operating expenses in legacy improved by $22 million sequentially to $799 million, more than offsetting the modest decline in revenue. These expense reductions were achieved through better management of outside vendors and variable cost reductions. As a result, adjusted EBITDA in legacy was $513 million, up 1.6% sequentially despite the decline in revenue. The adjusted EBITDA margin in legacy was 39.2%, up 110 basis points from the prior quarter.
Adjusted operating expenses in CTF declined about $29 million sequentially, or 3.8%, due in part to lower content cost. Adjusted EBITDA in CTF of $486 million was down about $41 million sequentially. This represented an adjusted EBITDA margin of 40.0%. Excluding the receivables reserve, adjusted EBITDA margin would have only decreased 20 bps from the 41.2% experienced in Q2. We are committed to adjusting the expense base of the business in response to changes in revenue trends and intend to drive overall margins higher over time. Our plan is to achieve $250 million of expense synergies by midyear 2017 and a total of $400 million by midyear 2019. As we demonstrated in Q3, we can also attain expense reductions that are not synergy related. 
As we move to Slide 11, in Q3, our capital spending was $403 million, up from $350 million in Q2. The increase was related to seasonal capital projects and a delay in CTF capital spending postclose in Q2. We are updating our capital spending guidance for 2016 to a range of $1.25 billion to $1.275 billion, which implies a sequential decline in fourth quarter capital spending.
Growth initiatives account for approximately half of our 2016 capital expenditures, most significant are the numerous broadband enhancement and expansion programs we have underway, including the more than 800,000 additional homes that have been enabled for 50 megs or greater capability as well as the new broadband builds in the corporate areas of CTS. About 300,000 of the 500,000 new builds should be complete by the first quarter.
Also included in this category are the CAF II homes that Dan discussed as well as the targeted fiber-to-the-home expansions we are doing. For business, we continue to expand and enhance our Ethernet capabilities and make additional investments to expand new services to business customers. The video build we commenced will reach 150,000 households in 3 markets this year. We're also making investments in IT capabilities that are directly related to driving incremental revenue. The remainder of our capital spending is a combination of IT investments related to productivity enhancements and maintenance-related projects. 
Looking toward next year, our capital spending plan for 2017 is in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion. While this is a decline, our larger size has enabled greater efficiencies, including better pricing in procuring goods and services. Additionally, our CapEx spend on integration has allowed us to transform our operating support systems and provisioning platforms. These investments have positioned us well, which also allows us greater flexibility in 2017. So despite the lower absolute spending, we expect to have an equally robust capital program in 2017. 
Please turn to Slide 12. Our leverage ratio at the end of Q3 was 3.86x, which is the trailing 12-month pro forma, including run rate cost synergies. We expect a modest increase in the leverage ratio as we move forward over the next 2 quarters, which is due in part to the substantial CAF II true-up amount that impacted EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2015.
We have a healthy cash balance, strong liquidity and a manageable maturity schedule. In 2017, we have approximately $500 million in maturities and slightly over $700 million in 2018, the majority of which is due in Q4 of '18. Net debt is $17.6 billion. And existing liquidity, together with ongoing cash flow from operations, will enable us to meet these maturities and reduce additional debt and leverage over time. I want to reiterate that we are very focused on delevering the business. 
On Slide 13, our trailing 12 months dividend payout ratio was 54%, which remains one of the most attractive in the telecom sector. The board has declared a common dividend of $0.105 per share for the fourth quarter of 2016, payable December 31. We will also pay the regularly scheduled dividend on our preferred shares on December 30. 
Please turn to Slide 14. We are refining 2016 guidance as follows: fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA to be $1 billion or more; full year capital spending of $1,250 million to $1,275 million. Cash taxes are expected to be a refund of $100 million to $110 million. Cash pension contribution will be in the range of $10 million to $15 million. We anticipate interest expense of $1.53 billion to $1.54 billion.
For the purposes of our adjusted free cash flow guidance, interest related to the CTF transaction is excluded from Q1, the quarter we didn't yet own the asset. So $1.34 billion to $1.35 billion would be the interest expense that would correspond to our free cash flow guidance. And we anticipate 2016 adjusted free cash flow to be in the range of $920 million to $950 million. 
Lastly, on Slide 15. Formal guidance for 2017 will come in February after we have completed our planning for the year. In the meantime, we are providing an outlook for items we have visibility. We anticipate 2017 adjusted EBITDA to be $4 billion or higher. As mentioned, capital spending is in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, and cash taxes should be near 0. 
I'll now pass the call back to the operator, who will open the line for questions."

You've mentioned that gross adds are improving in the acquired territories. Can you provide a bit more guidance why did we see accelerating losses altogether? I understand that there was some disruption on the legacy side, but I think the reduction was higher than we thought about. Then second on the revenues. I believe a year ago when you closed the Connecticut deal, you had mentioned that you're taking -- there was a bit of disruption on the revenue line, and you are taking precaution not to repeat that with this acquisition. So can you talk about what is not going as planned? And why you're deciding to make these operational changes, a little bit more providing more specifics around it? And just one final one and a quick follow-up. On the integration expense, it had been elevated for the last 2 quarters. Now that, that process is done, can we assume that expense goes down substantially?"

So on the broadband side, probably the biggest change from last quarter was on the legacy side, where we did see those losses. The biggest impact for both the CTF side and also the legacy side was when we on-shored our call center. That remains probably 55% of our sales channel in any period. And as we've brought people on, it created some disruption and lack of performance in that area. That really was probably the biggest issue. I think we were disappointed that we were not able to accelerate sales further on the CTF side. We certainly started in what is usually a fairly slow period for us, but we didn't see as good performance as we hoped. We're starting to see, as I said, improvements in October, but it's too early to call the fourth quarter, whether or not we're going to get there this month or next month or really December. We'll have a lot better visibility as we execute on our fourth quarter offer in November and December. On the revenue side, we absolutely took the precautions that we've talked about, and we locked down the ability for the variable around migrations that occurred in Connecticut. So we have not seen that happen. I think we've been very successful in that front. The real -- where we're not being successful was on adding the gross adds of subscriber side on CTF. That's really where we're making the changes on everything from product offers to marketing tactics and channels. And where -- as I said, we're starting to see improvements on that. So I expect, as we improve the trends on the FiOS product set in CTF, we'll start to see much better improvement on the revenue trends. And then on the integration side, we did spend extensively to really on-shore our call centers much faster than originally planned. Original plans were to have that happen that through -- slowly through the balance of the year. We spent a lot of money extra on training, redundant resources to bring that back in. We're expecting to see integration spend trail off as we get into the fourth quarter. And then finally, as we looked at operating the business at the expanded scale and the ability to use different offers and look at the markets as we were originally constructing them, we felt that we would be much more efficient because the new markets are very homogeneous when it comes to the product sets that will be offered. We can take advantage of the scale around the markets as well as that standardization of what the product offers will be in Texas, Florida and California. And we looked at our normal business, our legacy business. We started to see that we will be gaining a lot of benefit from taking out the duplicative cost structure there. So we're starting to look at it maybe 2 months ago, 3 months ago, and then we refined our plans and adjusted it accordingly over the last 30 to 60 days."

And we expect, as we introduce our holiday offer, which is really slated to hit the markets before Thanksgiving over the next week or 2 that we'll see improved performance even more. Probably the single biggest improvement, though, was getting to the point where 4,000 new reps that came into the company as we on-shored we're selling effectively and efficiently using the tools. And you can't fully train everyone in that first month or 2. And we need to trade-off that, accelerated that to improve -- to improve the customer experience from an offshore perspective to onshore. But the trade-off really was that they weren't as good at selling initially, and that's improving each and every day. So the combination of the enhanced offer that we're putting in the market as well as the improved competency did see that the trends continue to improve steadily in the fourth quarter."

And I think that there's really 3 stories that go along with that. Number one would be, Perley, that you came in and John left and somehow that had something to do with new eyes coming in and maybe having to cut the dividend. So if you could kind of talk a little bit about what you think your capacity to pay the dividend, and the commitment of the company overall is to it, from your perspective, would be great. The second issue on the half the cut seems to be that we've got about, a call it, $250 million midpoint synergy run rate by next year, pro rate that over the year, it's about $125 million of benefit. And you've given this $4 billion or better guidance number, which leaves out the possibility that everything outside synergies could come down another$125 million. And then when the synergies start to peter out and the business is still declining at $125 million a year, we don't -- and we will put more pressure on the dividend. So could you kind of reconcile a $4 billion or better guidance number for next year relative to the $4 billion run rate you have right now, given that you think all the synergies are coming through? And the final piece, I think, to this leverage question that just got asked is a lot of confusion about the 4.5x leverage test that goes along with the restricted payments basket and whether you can or can't pay the dividend and when that occurs in the future, if at all. Could you talk directly to that calculation and how that impacts -- how we should think about the dividend being covered?"

But from my perspective, when it comes to that question on the dividend cut, we don't see that at the same risk that others are obviously factoring in. From our perspective, we have ample ability to control our cost structure. We're executing on that, even as we speak today. We'll be driving that through the fourth quarter into the first quarter and then trying to accelerate the additional synergies even faster. But more importantly, we're working to really change that revenue line item, and that's really what ultimately is going to solve that issue that you highlighted. And when you look at changing the CTF just based on performance, which is what we're all focused on right now, you look at all the substantial opportunity on the commercial side, which we've spent a year really building the funnel in the new properties. And the new properties, quite frankly, have much more opportunity than the commercial ones and our legacy property. And then you look at the investments that we've made to enable better performance on our broadband side, each one of those is a unique opportunity that we can use to drive incremental revenue and start to really move the EBITDA line. I think you saw in this quarter we really -- our focus is very heavily on making sure that we heard loud and clear fromdifferent investors over time that we had not been active in adjusting our cost structure. And we really went after it with the gusto, and we'll continue to do that. And if we see further pressure on the revenue side, we'll make the right decisions on the cost structure to really offset that.

Each one of the regions had its own resources that included marketing, finance, engineering, human resources. And in doing that, we -- when we were a much smaller entity, it really did serve us well at that point in time. The more we looked at it today, the less differences there are in a lot of the markets and the way we were going to market, whether it's around a Vantage product or it's around FiOS or it's around next-generation broadband product. So when we looked at it, we did a really a trade-off on it. So we've essentially eliminated all of that redundancy in the organization. The impact is approximately 1,000 individuals leaving the organization, and that translates directly into cost savings. And the nice part about it, too, is that the enhanced focus on commercial as well as consumer, and Frontier has historically been a very consumer-focused organization. We've done well on the commercial side, but I really believe we can do much better with more focus, more attention and really putting the resources on those opportunities and making it that's what they do every day when they get up and they come to work, all they're trying to do is grow the commercial revenue base. So that's really what we've done. It does change the focus of the field operations to really be engaged with the communities as well as providing excellent service to customers and being that bridge. But really, sales for both consumer and commercial are more centralized in a way that we can apply better resources and do it in a more efficient manner."

I really think this is our execution issue, and it's our to fix, and we're fixing it. So I think you'll see us improve from a revenue stability as we do a better job of executing going forward. And I'm convinced that as we get those trends back to where we know they can be, because it is a great product set, and it's very competitive obviously in the market, that we'll start to see that stability. I think the key areas that we're focusing on, if you look at the commercial opportunity in these areas, we think that is a very large opportunity that we haven't even begun to tap yet. And people are always looking for a different way of solving their needs of their businesses, and we're starting to build robust pipelines around that right now. The sales pipeline tend to build over a 6- to 9-month period and then you really start to harvest all the fruits of those efforts. So those will all be incremental growth opportunities for us in these markets, especially on the CTF. I think on the legacy side, what we need to do is really do a better job of selling in the areas that we've upgraded or opened for sale. And those are in the speed upgrades as well as the CAF opportunity. When you look at the amount of CAF homes [indiscernible] opened for sale by the end of the year, that is a really good opportunity for us to really help change the trends on the legacy properties. In addition to that, we are, as we talked about on previous calls, opening markets throughout the end of this year and into next year around the Vantage platform. Vantage is not only video, but it's really enhanced broadband speeds, and it offers different commercial opportunities in the market. So we'll be capitalizing on all those things as we go forward. One final thing that will help us, too, I think, is really as we change the product availability in some of the copper markets for the new states we go from essentially a 6-meg product that hasn't been opened for sale in years, to a 50-plus meg product that's very competitive in the marketplace and offers customer a choice that they never had before. So we think that's an exciting opportunity. When you put all those things together, it really does give us the leverage we need to really push on the revenue side, but it really does start with improving in the CTF area, and that's where the laser focus is on the whole team right now."

About 3 years ago, we embarked on a substantial transformation of our business, starting with our Connecticut acquisition and more recently, the acquisition of our new markets in California, Texas and Florida. Through this process, we have more than doubled the size and scale of the company, improved the quality of our assets, substantially diversified our revenue streams and geographic footprint, and expanded the sophistication and attractiveness of our product offering. Few have taken on a challenge of this magnitude and complexity in such a short period of time, and I'm very proud of our overarching accomplishments and pleased that in the just-completed third quarter we made substantial progress. 
Nonetheless, important aspects of our third quarter financial results are disappointing and illustrate how much further we have to go. I want to assure you that I am focused on addressing and resolving the issues hindering our performance. I am fully aware that the third quarter results underscore the urgent need for our expanded business to perform at the higher level where I know it can and should. And you have my personal commitment that we will do so. 
Let me go right to the issue of our revenue results. Third quarter revenues were $2.52 billion. This total reflects our taking a $20 million reserve associated with resumption of customer credit treatment in CTF during the third quarter. Excluding this and adjusting for the onetime recognition of $12 million in CAF II funds for the CTF states in the second quarter, revenue declined $52 million sequentially. This decline is unacceptable and reflects a level of performance that I am committed to changing. And during this call, I will discuss some of the means that we are using to make this change. 
Let me also highlight that today we had announced a new customer-focused organizational structure and the creation of commercial and consumer business units. This change is designed to improve our execution and operational effectiveness, increases spans of control in the organization and makes us more nimble, while at the same time eliminating duplicative costs associated with our former structure. In the first months of operating our new properties, it became apparent that this change was necessary. And I'll talk more about this realignment in a few moments. 
Please turn to Slide 3. Highlights for the quarter included the following: we achieved adjusted EBITDA of $1 billion, in line with the target that we had outlined for you previously. When we saw a decline in revenue, we made real-time adjustments to our cost structure, and we will continue to work on both revenue and expense levels to ensure we deliver EBITDA at or above the $4 billion level we have provided as our estimate for 2017. We will provide formal guidance for 2017 during our Q4 earnings call, following approval of our annual budget by our Board of Directors. 
CTF subscriber trends improved substantially in the third quarter, although it is not yet at the rate we are targeting. This lower rate resulted because we began marketing during the seasonally slowest sales period. We on-shored our customer contact centers, which initially impacted our principal sales channel negatively, and we resumed customer collection processes. The last point began in the final month of the quarter and will have an impact in Q4 as well. This is a normal part of our integration process. We plan on addressing this by the end of Q4, at which point receivables will be at a normal level. We will provide a breakout so that you can monitor our progress on these key metrics.
Although our net subscriber performance affected Q3 revenues in CTF, we remain disciplined in our base management processes and did not experience revenue or margin erosion as customers migrated from promotional pricing to normal price points. This was a key focus for the company, and we executed well on that front. As we ramp marketing and adjust our offers, we expect continued improvements in net subscriber performance in the fourth quarter. We anticipate exiting the year at or close to normal levels of customer activity that would support a more stable revenue performance in CTF. 
Let me take a moment to address the Q3 impact in both legacy and CTF of the on-shoring of our customer care function. During Q3, the new contract center reps were still building competency in the use of our systems as well as intimacy with our products. As a result, our call centers, our most important channel, underperformed our expectations. We believe we have completed this transition successfully at this time and are beginning to see improved results.
So in summary, as it relates to subscriber performance, I anticipate that legacy broadband net additions will be positive again in Q4, but it is too early to determine if it will be back to historic levels.
A positive in Q3 was the revenue enhancement program we put in place in our legacy properties. This program contributed to improved ARPC and also helped drive an improved sequential result in Q3 despite the weak net additions. We were pleased with our ability to raise pricing in line with the market on select customer segments. This represents on net a benefit of approximately $12 million to quarterly legacy revenue, a portion of which was realized in Q3. The full run rate amount will be realized in Q4. The negative impact of any associated churn with this will be isolated to Q3. 
I am pleased to report that this was our 11th sequential quarter of roughly stable SME revenue. This is a very impressive result, particularly when compared against the trends at peers. I believe this remains one of our best opportunities. And with the new organizational structure, we plan on increasing our focus and alignment of resources to improve our commercial trends. 
The final highlight involves network speed improvement. Last quarter, we outlined our plans to expand our speed capabilities so that approximately 2 million additional addressable households would be enabled for 50 megabits or higher speeds. To date, we have enabled in excess of 800,000 households. So this project is well underway, and we are beginning to market these incremental capabilities in the upgraded area. 
Please turn to Slide 4. In September, we raised our synergy target to $1.4 billion per year, up from $1.25 billion, target outlined in the second quarter earnings report. Yet-to-be-obtained cost synergies of $250 million are anticipated to be achieved by midyear 2017 with the incremental $150 million anticipated to be achieved by midyear 2019.
As I noted earlier, we are announcing a new organization structure. Among the highlights of this is the creation of a distinct customer-facing units for consumer and commercial. The benefits of these new units are a greater focus on the differing needs of consumer and business customers, a more efficient allocation of resources and more standardization of business processes, which will allow greater automation and further cost reduction. The savings associated with our new organizational structure will be partially realized in Q4 and will be largely in place as we start the new year.
We will continue to leverage the strengths of the regionalized organizational structure that has served us so well, and we are adapting it to allow us to keep pace with the dynamic competitive markets we serve. Operational leadership in each state will continue to have the objective of delivering high-quality service by exceeding our customers' expectations.
They will also act as a connection to the various communities to ensure we have local paths for community engagement. Functions that are not customer-facing, including engineering, finance, human resources, communications and marketing will be centralized, increasing efficiency and effectiveness.
Our focus in the consumer market has not changed. We will pursue opportunities aggressively in all of our FiOS market. We have begun the process of upgrading broadband capabilities in non-FiOS areas of CTF. In fact, we will have the first 300,000 households upgraded over the next 90 days and open for sale.
We are continuing to expand our Vantage product footprint, and we are planning a relaunch of our legacy FiOS areas, following the successful conversion of the base to the new and improved interactive media guide and the integration of our improved VOD library. And we are on track for our CAF II deployments to offer broadband to these underserved markets as quickly as practical. We will have 170,000 households open for marketing by year-end and another 90,000 non-CAF II households in adjacent areas. 
For commercial, we have realized sales, marketing and commercial product management under a single leader reporting directly to me, which is a significant change from our practice over the last few years. This builds on the substantial improvements we have been making behind the scenes over the last 12 months in revamping both our sales and support staff and our commercial marketing platform. Even before these changes, we had compiled an impressive, consistent, steady performance track record in the SME portion of commercial. Our increased focus and emphasis on the commercial market will enable us to be a more nimble, responsive competitor.
Another benefit of our new organizational structure will be more efficient capital management. The new structure will allow us to allocate capital more dynamically, prioritizing the highest return opportunity. The near-term priorities will be supporting the areas that I highlighted earlier and on IT enhancements that will drive improvements in our cost structure. 
Please turn to Slide 5. In contrast to the second and third quarters' focus on cutover integration and building organizational competency, we have now shifted our focus to the following: first, we will continue to improve our performance in the CTF market, most notably in the FiOS portion of the consumer; second, as we enable new broadband capabilities in CTF and legacy markets, we will begin ramping marketing and sales accordingly; third, we will drive commercial sales after spending much of 2016 building prospect pipelines in the new market. And finally, we will implement our new organizational structure and implement our synergy and efficiency projects to drive improved cost structures in both legacy and CTF markets. These are our top priorities of the entire organization, and the senior management will be held accountable for delivering these results. 
As we have discussed consistently, our company has been in integration mode for nearly 3 years. As we move forward, we will have a laser focus on ensuring our cost structure is continually evaluated and adjusted in keeping with the realities of the marketplace. Let me assure you that we will continue to manage our cost structure to match the revenue trends, and we are firmly committed to our objective of exceeding $4 billion in adjusted EBITDA in 2017. 
Let me say a few words about the FCC potential changes in the pricing of business data services. On October 7, the FCC released a fact sheet highlighting details of its proposed changes. Frontier remains opposed to the current framework, and we will continue building support for the proposal that we submitted in conjunction with Sprint and Windstream. As a reminder, if the factsheet framework is adopted for implementation in July 2017, we project an impact of $10 million in 2017 and an additional impact of $20 million in each of 2018 and 2019, with lesser impacts in the following years. If the FCC implements this rate reduction, we will mitigate any revenue declines with additional cost reductions. Last week, the FCC placed this item on its agenda for a vote at its open meeting scheduled for November 17. 
To summarize my comments, we have completed the bulk of the integration of the new markets. This includes achieving completion of the on-shoring of the contact center resources for both tech support and customer care faster than originally planned. We are working to improve performance from all of our distribution channels to move our sales to a more normal trend in Q4 time frame. Our organizational restructuring is underway, and we will enhance our ability to execute in the consumer and commercial segments, while significantly improving our cost structure. As you can tell, this is a very busy time at Frontier. The focus moving forward is all about execution in driving sales and aligning our cost structure to the realities of the current markets. And I am confident that we will begin to see the benefits of all this focus over the coming months. 
Before I turn this call over to our new CFO, I wanted to thank John Jureller for his service and dedication to the company. As we stated on September 12, John made significant contributions during our Connecticut and CTF acquisition, particularly in connection with the negotiation of deals and associated financing transaction. I've known Perley for almost 16 years and worked directly with him for almost 10 of those years. He is the right CFO for us at this time because he is laser focused on operational excellence and cost management. He will be invaluable to the company and me as we move forward. 
And now I'll turn the call over to Perley to review the financial results."

Third quarter revenue of $2.52 billion declined $84 million from the $2.61 billion reported in the second quarter. Customer revenue of $2.32 billion declined $62 million, and I'll discuss this in greater detail shortly. Switched access and subsidy revenue of $205 million declined $22 million sequentially, with $12 million of this decline related to the onetime recognition of CAF II revenue in the second quarter, which did not recur in Q3. Another $6 million of the decline was related to the scheduled step-down of the switched access rate, and $3 million of the decline was related to the CAF II phase-down. In other words, only $1 million of the $22 million was related to displacement of minutes of use.
Adjusted EBITDA of $1 billion was in line with the outlook we provided on September 21. This represented a margin of 39.6%, which was stable with the second quarter. We generated free cash flow of $168 million after payment of dividends on our preferred stock. Adjusted free cash flow was down sequentially, in part because of the sequential increase in CapEx. 
On Slide 7, we show the breakout of customer revenue between legacy and CTF. In legacy, customer revenue of $1.16 billion was down $7 million or 0.6% sequentially, which is a significant improvement from the 2% sequential decline we experienced in Q2. The factors driving the change in Q3 were a $9 million sequential decline in residential, partly offset by a $2 million sequential increase in business. As Dan mentioned, our revenue enhancement program underway in the quarter contributed to Q3 legacy residential revenue, and we expect an additional incremental benefit in Q4. We are investing to enhance and expand our broadband and video capabilities, and we expect these investments to contribute to an improved revenue trend over time. 
Moving to CTF. Customer revenue of $1.16 billion was down 4.5% from the $1.21 billion reported in the second quarter. The primary factor in the decline was residential revenue, which was down 6.8%. Business revenue of $456 million was down only 0.9% sequentially. In business, our legacy ARPC was up $13 sequentially as a result of an improved revenue trend in Q3. Business ARPC in CTF of $615 was also up sequentially but is still substantially below the level of legacy ARPC. The new commercial business unit that we announced today will improve our ability to differentiate our services for business customers and tailor solutions to the unique needs of various segments of the market. We have already made solid progress in this area. 
The CTF product view provides more color on the drivers behind the revenue decline in the quarter, with video down 6.5% sequentially and voice down 3.4% sequentially. Residential subscriber declines are the primary driver of this revenue trend, and we are focused on achieving improved trends. 
In contrast to the video revenue trend, data and Internet was up slightly sequentially in Q3, and this was consistent across both residential and business. The $12 million sequential decline in CTF other revenue includes the $20 million decline related to the receivable reserve we have taken in CTF, which Dan mentioned. This is offset by an increase in anticipated late fees, reflecting recovery to normal trends as we were not charging late fees in Q2 due to the transition.
Turning to Slide 8. We see that growth additions for legacy were down in Q3. As Dan outlined, the issues were typical third quarter seasonality and the transition of the call centers as a result of the on-shoring that occurred in Q3. Broadband churn in legacy in Q3 was up slightly, reflecting the disruption in the call centers as well as the impact of the revenue enhancement program. Video churn was more stable, but still elevated compared to the first quarter of 2016. 
Within CTF, gross additions improved sequentially for data and video, but have not returned to the level achieved under Verizon, as illustrated in the graph. Returning these metrics to preacquisition levels is a top priority. CTF video churn increased in Q3, but data churn was relatively stable, yet still elevated compared to preclose levels. 
Finally, in terms of the total customer churn, in legacy markets it was approximately 1.9%, up about 20 bps sequentially. Customer churn in CTF was up about 10 bps sequentially. Longer term, we anticipate the expansion of video in the legacy markets to have a positive influence on customer churn. 
On Slide 9, residential ARPC in our legacy markets of $63.41 was up $0.36 sequentially. The principal driver of this increase was the revenue enhancement program that Dan discussed earlier. In CTF, residential ARPC of $108.69 was down $1.61 sequentially. Excluding the receivables reserve, it would have been up $0.64 sequentially. On a combined basis, our ARPC was $82.34, down from $83.20. However, excluding the receivables impact, it would have been up slightly. 
Turning to Slide 10. Our Q3 adjusted operating expenses in legacy improved by $22 million sequentially to $799 million, more than offsetting the modest decline in revenue. These expense reductions were achieved through better management of outside vendors and variable cost reductions. As a result, adjusted EBITDA in legacy was $513 million, up 1.6% sequentially despite the decline in revenue. The adjusted EBITDA margin in legacy was 39.2%, up 110 basis points from the prior quarter.
Adjusted operating expenses in CTF declined about $29 million sequentially, or 3.8%, due in part to lower content cost. Adjusted EBITDA in CTF of $486 million was down about $41 million sequentially. This represented an adjusted EBITDA margin of 40.0%. Excluding the receivables reserve, adjusted EBITDA margin would have only decreased 20 bps from the 41.2% experienced in Q2. We are committed to adjusting the expense base of the business in response to changes in revenue trends and intend to drive overall margins higher over time. Our plan is to achieve $250 million of expense synergies by midyear 2017 and a total of $400 million by midyear 2019. As we demonstrated in Q3, we can also attain expense reductions that are not synergy related. 
As we move to Slide 11, in Q3, our capital spending was $403 million, up from $350 million in Q2. The increase was related to seasonal capital projects and a delay in CTF capital spending post close in Q2. We are updating our capital spending guidance for 2016 to a range of $1.25 billion to $1.275 billion, which implies a sequential decline in fourth quarter capital spending.
Growth initiatives account for approximately half of our 2016 capital expenditures, most significant are the numerous broadband enhancement and expansion programs we have underway, including the more than 800,000 additional homes passed that have been enabled for 50 megs or greater capability as well as the new broadband builds in the corporate areas of CTF. About 300,000 of the 500,000 new builds should be complete by the first quarter.
Also included in this category are the CAF II homes that Dan discussed as well as the targeted fiber-to-the-home expansions we are doing. For business, we continue to expand and enhance our Ethernet capabilities and make additional investments to expand new services to business customers. The video build we commenced will reach 150,000 households in 3 markets this year. We're also making investments in IT capabilities that are directly related to driving incremental revenue. The remainder of our capital spending is a combination of IT investments related to productivity enhancements and maintenance-related projects. 
Looking toward next year, our capital spending plan for 2017 is in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion. While this is a decline, our larger size has enabled greater efficiencies, including better pricing in procuring goods and services. Additionally, our CapEx spend on integration has allowed us to transform our operating support systems and provisioning platforms. These investments have positioned us well, which also allows us greater flexibility in 2017. So despite the lower absolute spending, we expect to have an equally robust capital program in 2017. 
Please turn to Slide 12. Our leverage ratio at the end of Q3 was 3.86x, which is the trailing 12-month pro forma, including run rate cost synergies. We expect a modest increase in the leverage ratio as we move forward over the next 2 quarters, which is due in part to the substantial CAF II true-up amount that impacted EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2015.
We have a healthy cash balance, strong liquidity and a manageable maturity schedule. In 2017, we have approximately $500 million in maturities and slightly over $700 million in 2018, the majority of which is due in Q4 of '18. Net debt is $17.6 billion. And existing liquidity, together with ongoing cash flow from operations, will enable us to meet these maturities and reduce additional debt and leverage over time. I want to reiterate that we are very focused on delevering the business. 
On Slide 13, our trailing 12 month dividend payout ratio was 54%, which remains one of the most attractive in the telecom sector. The board has declared a common dividend of $0.105 per share for the fourth quarter of 2016, payable December 31. We will also pay the regularly scheduled dividend on our preferred shares on December 30. 
Please turn to Slide 14. We are refining 2016 guidance as follows: fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA to be $1 billion or more; full year capital spending of $1,250 million to $1,275 million. Cash taxes are expected to be a refund of $100 million to $110 million. Cash pension contribution will be in the range of $10 million to $15 million. We anticipate interest expense of $1.53 billion to $1.54 billion.
For the purposes of our adjusted free cash flow guidance, interest related to the CTF transaction is excluded from Q1, the quarter we didn't yet own the asset. So $1.34 billion to $1.35 billion would be the interest expense that would correspond to our free cash flow guidance. And we anticipate 2016 adjusted free cash flow to be in the range of $920 million to $950 million. 
Lastly, on Slide 15. Formal guidance for 2017 will come in February after we have completed our planning for the year. In the meantime, we are providing an outlook for items where we have visibility. We anticipate 2017 adjusted EBITDA to be $4 billion or higher. As mentioned, capital spending is in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, and cash taxes should be near 0. 
I'll now pass the call back to the operator, who will open the line for questions."

You've mentioned that gross adds are improving in the acquired territories. Can you provide a bit more guidance, why did we see accelerating losses altogether? I understand that there was some disruption on the legacy side, but I think the reduction is higher than we thought about. Then second on the revenues. I believe a year ago when you closed the Connecticut deal, you had mentioned that you're taking -- there was a bit of disruption on the revenue line, and you're taking precaution not to repeat that with this acquisition. So can you talk about what is not going as planned? And why you're deciding to make these operational changes, a little bit more -- providing more specifics around it? And just one final one, a quick follow-up. On the integration expense, it had been elevated for the last 2 quarters. Now that, that process is done, can we assume that expense goes down substantially?"

So on the broadband side, probably the biggest change from last quarter was on the legacy side, where we did see those losses. The biggest impact for both the CTF side and also the legacy side was when we on-shored our call center. That remains probably 55% of our sales channel in any period. And as we've brought people on, it created some disruption and lack of performance in that area. That really was probably the biggest issue. I think we were disappointed that we were not able to accelerate sales further on the CTF side. We certainly started in what is usually a fairly slow period for us, but we didn't see as good performance as we hoped. We're starting to see, as I said, improvements in October. But it's too early to call the fourth quarter, whether or not we're going to get there this month or next month or, really, December. We'll have a lot better visibility as we execute on our fourth quarter offer in November and December. On the revenue side, we absolutely took the precautions that we've talked about, and we locked down the ability for the variable around migrations that occurred in Connecticut. So we have not seen that happen. I think we've been very successful on that front. The real -- where we're not being successful was on adding the gross adds on the subscriber side on CTF. That's really where we're making the changes on everything from product offers to marketing tactics and channels. And where, as I said, we're starting to see improvements on that. So I expect, as we improve the trends on the FiOS product set in CTF, we'll start to see much better improvement on the revenue trends. And then on the integration side, we did spend extensively to really on-shore our call centers much faster than originally planned. Our original plans were to have that happen through -- slowly through the balance of the year. We spent a lot of money, extra, on training, redundant resources to bring that back in. We're expecting to see integration spend trail off as we get into the fourth quarter. And then finally, as we looked at operating the business at the expanded scale and the ability to use different offers and look at the markets as we were originally constructing them, we felt that we would be much more efficient because the new markets are very homogeneous when it comes to the product sets that will be offered. We can take advantage of the scale around the markets as well as that standardization of what the product offers will be in Texas, Florida and California. And we looked at our normal business, our legacy business. We started to see that we will be gaining a lot of benefit from taking out the duplicative cost structure there. So we started to look at it maybe 2 months ago, 3 months ago, and then we refined our plans and adjusted it accordingly over the last 30 to 60 days."

We saw an improvement on the gross adds in Q3, but that was really from virtually no marketing in Q2. What we started to see already in Q4 was a step up comparable to what we saw in the whole third quarter. So a material change. And we expect, as we introduce our holiday offer, which is really slated to hit the markets before Thanksgiving over the next week or 2, that we'll see improved performance even more. Probably the single biggest improvement, though, was getting to the point where 4,000 new reps that came into the company as we on-shored were selling effectively and efficiently using the tools. And you can't fully train everyone in that first month or 2. And we made a trade-off that accelerated that to improve the customer experience from an offshore perspective to onshore. But the trade-off really was that they weren't as good at selling initially, and that's improving each and every day. So the combination of the enhanced offer that we're putting in the market as well as the improved competency did see that the trends continued to improve steadily in the fourth quarter."

A",336,"I guess -- I mean just to kind of address the elephant in the room, with the stock at 10-plus percent yield, everyone -- it seems like the market is really suggesting that either Frontier will choose to cut the dividend or will have to cut the dividend. And I think that there's really 3 stories that go along with that. Number one would be, Perley, that you came in and John left and somehow that had something to do with new eyes coming in and maybe having to cut the dividend. So if you could kind of talk a little bit about what you think your capacity to keep paying the dividend, and the commitment of the company overall is to it, from your perspective, would be great. The second issue on the have-to-cut seems to be that we've got about a, call it, $250 million midpoint synergy run rate by next year. Pro rate that over the year, it's about $125 million of benefit. And you've given this $4 billion or better guidance number, which leaves out there the possibility that everything outside synergies could come down another $125 million. And then when the synergies start to peter out, then the business is still declining at $125 million a year and we don't -- and then we would put more pressure on the dividend. So could you kind of reconcile a $4 billion or better guidance number for next year relative to the $4 billion run rate you have right now, given that you think all these are synergies are coming through? And the final piece, I think, to this leverage question that just got asked is a lot of confusion about the 4.5x leverage test that goes along with the restricted payments basket and whether you can or can't pay the dividend and when that occurs in the future, if at all. Could you talk directly to that calculation and how that impacts -- how we should think about the dividend being covered?"

But from my perspective, when it comes to that question on the dividend cut, we don't see that at the same risk that others are obviously factoring in. From our perspective, we have ample ability to control our cost structure. We're executing on that, even as we speak today. We'll be driving that through the fourth quarter into the first quarter and then trying to accelerate the additional synergies even faster. But more importantly, we're working to really change that revenue line item, and that's really what ultimately is going to solve that issue that you highlighted. And when you look at changing the CTF statistics on performance, which is what we're all focused on right now, you look at the substantial opportunity on the commercial side, which we've spent a year really building the funnel and the new properties. And the new properties, quite frankly, have much more opportunity on the commercial ones than our legacy property. And then you look at the investments that we've made to enable better performance on our broadband side, each one of those is a unique opportunity that we can use to drive incremental revenue and start to really move the EBITDA line. I think you saw in this quarter we really -- our focus is very heavily on making sure that we heard loud and clear from different investors over time that we had not been active in adjusting our cost structure. And we really went after it with a gusto, and we'll continue to do that. And if we see further pressure on the revenue side, we'll make the right decisions on the cost structure to really offset that. So I wanted to get that in before Perley really gave you his point of view coming in."

And so focus is definitely on cost and taking costs out of the business. I have an acute focus on that. And we have to make sure that every dollar that we're spending is really going towards our growth initiatives. That's capital dollars. That's expense dollars, even integration dollars. And because -- I'm very much focused on delevering the business. I -- our leverage must be -- our leverage will not go over above 4.5x. It needs to stay below 4.5x.

I was hoping you can provide just a little bit more color on what exactly that entails? And it sounds like there's managers in each state or each region. And how many regions are there?

Each one of the regions had its own resources that included marketing, finance, engineering, human resources. And in doing that, we -- when we were a much smaller entity, it really did serve us well at that point in time. The more we looked at it today, the less differences there are in a lot of the markets and in the way we're going to market, whether it's around a Vantage product or it's around FiOS or it's around next-generation broadband product. So when we looked at it, we did a, really, a trade-off on it. So we've essentially eliminated all of that redundancy in the organization. The impact is approximately 1,000 individuals that'll be leaving the organization, and that translates directly into cost savings. And the nice part about it, too, is that the enhanced focus on commercial as well as consumer -- and Frontier has historically been a very consumer-focused organization. We've done well on the commercial side, but I really believe we can do much better with more focus, more attention and really putting the resources on those opportunities and making it: that's what they do every day when they get up and they come to work. All they're trying to do is grow the commercial revenue base. So that's really what we've done. It does change the focus of the field operations to really be engaged with the communities as well as provide an excellent service to customers and being that bridge. But really, sales for both consumer and commercial are more centralized in a way that we can apply better resources and do it in a more efficient manner."

I really think this is our execution issue. And it's ours to fix, and we're fixing it. So I think you'll see us improve from a revenue stability as we do a better job of executing going forward. And I'm convinced that as we get those trends back to where we know they can be, because it is a great product set, and it's very competitive, obviously, in the market, that we'll start to see that stability. I think the key areas that we're focusing on, if you look at the commercial opportunity in these areas, we think that is a very large opportunity that we haven't even begun to tap yet. And people are always looking for a different way of solving their needs of their businesses, and we're starting to build robust pipelines around that right now. The sales pipelines tend to build over a 6- to 9-month period and then you really start to harvest all the fruits of those efforts. So those will all be incremental growth opportunities for us in these markets, especially on the CTF. I think on the legacy side, what we need to do is really do a better job of selling in the areas that we've upgraded or opened for sale. And those are in the speed upgrades as well as the CAF opportunity. When you look at the amount of CAF homes that we'll have open for sale by the end of the year, that is a really good opportunity for us to really help change the trends on the legacy property. In addition to that, we are, as we talked about on previous calls, opening markets throughout the end of this year and into next year around the Vantage platform. Vantage is not only video, but it's really enhanced broadband speeds and it offers different commercial opportunities in a market. So we'll be capitalizing on all those things as we go forward. One final thing that will help us, too, I think, is really as we change the product availability in some of the copper markets for the new states we go from, essentially, a 6-meg product that hasn't been opened for sale in years, to a 50-plus meg product that's very competitive in the marketplace and offers customer a choice that they never had before. So we think that's an exciting opportunity. When you put all those things together, it really does give us the leverage we need to really push on the revenue side. But it really does start with improving in the CTF area, and that's where the laser focus is on the whole team right now."

About 3 years ago, we embarked on a substantial transformation of our business, starting with our Connecticut acquisition and more recently, the acquisition of our new markets in California, Texas and Florida. Through this process, we have more than doubled the size and scale of the company, improved the quality of our assets, substantially diversified our revenue streams and geographic footprint, and expanded the sophistication and attractiveness of our product offering. Few have taken on a challenge of this magnitude and complexity in such a short period of time, and I'm very proud of our overarching accomplishments and pleased that in the just-completed third quarter we made substantial progress. 
Nonetheless, important aspects of our third quarter financial results are disappointing and illustrate how much further we have to go. I want to assure you that I am focused on addressing and resolving the issues hindering our performance. I am fully aware that the third quarter results underscore the urgent need for our expanded business to perform at the higher level where I know it can and should. And you have my personal commitment that we will do so. 
Let me go right to the issue of our revenue results. Third quarter revenues were $2.52 billion. This total reflects our taking a $20 million reserve associated with resumption of customer credit treatment in CTF during the third quarter. Excluding this and adjusting for the onetime recognition of $12 million in CAF II funds for the CTF states in the second quarter, revenue declined $52 million sequentially. This decline is unacceptable and reflects a level of performance that I am committed to changing. And during this call, I will discuss some of the means that we are using to make this change. 
Let me also highlight that today we had announced a new customer-focused organizational structure and the creation of commercial and consumer business units. This change is designed to improve our execution and operational effectiveness, increases spans of control in the organization and makes us more nimble, while at the same time eliminating duplicative costs associated with our former structure. In the first months of operating our new properties, it became apparent that this change was necessary. And I'll talk more about this realignment in a few moments. 
Please turn to Slide 3. Highlights for the quarter included the following: we achieved adjusted EBITDA of $1 billion, in line with the target that we had outlined for you previously. When we saw a decline in revenue, we made real-time adjustments to our cost structure, and we will continue to work on both revenue and expense levels to ensure we deliver EBITDA at or above the $4 billion level we have provided as our estimate for 2017. We will provide formal guidance for 2017 during our Q4 earnings call, following approval of our annual budget by our Board of Directors. 
CTF subscriber trends improved substantially in the third quarter, although it is not yet at the rate we are targeting. This lower rate resulted because we began marketing during the seasonally slowest sales period. We on-shored our customer contact centers, which initially impacted our principal sales channel negatively, and we resumed customer collection processes. The last point began in the final month of the quarter and will have an impact in Q4 as well. This is a normal part of our integration process. We plan on addressing this by the end of Q4, at which point receivables will be at a normal level. We will provide a breakout so that you can monitor our progress on these key metrics.
Although our net subscriber performance affected Q3 revenues in CTF, we remain disciplined in our base management processes and did not experience revenue or margin erosion as customers migrated from promotional pricing to normal price points. This was a key focus for the company, and we executed well on that front. As we ramp marketing and adjust our offers, we expect continued improvements in net subscriber performance in the fourth quarter. We anticipate exiting the year at or close to normal levels of customer activity that would support a more stable revenue performance in CTF. 
Let me take a moment to address the Q3 impact in both legacy and CTF of the on-shoring of our customer care function. During Q3, the new contract center reps were still building competency in the use of our systems as well as intimacy with our products. As a result, our call centers, our most important channel, underperformed our expectations. We believe we have completed this transition successfully at this time and are beginning to see improved results.
So in summary, as it relates to subscriber performance, I anticipate that legacy broadband net additions will be positive again in Q4, but it is too early to determine if it will be back to historic levels.
A positive in Q3 was the revenue enhancement program we put in place in our legacy properties. This program contributed to improved ARPC and also helped drive an improved sequential result in Q3 despite the weak net additions. We were pleased with our ability to raise pricing in line with the market on select customer segments. This represents on net a benefit of approximately $12 million to quarterly legacy revenue, a portion of which was realized in Q3. The full run rate amount will be realized in Q4. The negative impact of any associated churn with this will be isolated to Q3. 
I am pleased to report that this was our 11th sequential quarter of roughly stable SME revenue. This is a very impressive result, particularly when compared against the trends at peers. I believe this remains one of our best opportunities. And with the new organizational structure, we plan on increasing our focus and alignment of resources to improve our commercial trends. 
The final highlight involves network speed improvement. Last quarter, we outlined our plans to expand our speed capabilities so that approximately 2 million additional addressable households would be enabled for 50 megabits or higher speeds. To date, we have enabled in excess of 800,000 households. So this project is well underway, and we are beginning to market these incremental capabilities in the upgraded area. 
Please turn to Slide 4. In September, we raised our synergy target to $1.4 billion per year, up from $1.25 billion, target outlined in the second quarter earnings report. Yet-to-be-obtained cost synergies of $250 million are anticipated to be achieved by midyear 2017 with the incremental $150 million anticipated to be achieved by midyear 2019.
As I noted earlier, we are announcing a new organization structure. Among the highlights of this is the creation of a distinct customer-facing units for consumer and commercial. The benefits of these new units are a greater focus on the differing needs of consumer and business customers, a more efficient allocation of resources and more standardization of business processes, which will allow greater automation and further cost reduction. The savings associated with our new organizational structure will be partially realized in Q4 and will be largely in place as we start the new year.
We will continue to leverage the strengths of the regionalized organizational structure that has served us so well, and we are adapting it to allow us to keep pace with the dynamic competitive markets we serve. Operational leadership in each state will continue to have the objective of delivering high-quality service by exceeding our customers' expectations.
They will also act as a connection to the various communities to ensure we have local paths for community engagement. Functions that are not customer-facing, including engineering, finance, human resources, communications and marketing will be centralized, increasing efficiency and effectiveness.
Our focus in the consumer market has not changed. We will pursue opportunities aggressively in all of our FiOS market. We have begun the process of upgrading broadband capabilities in non-FiOS areas of CTF. In fact, we will have the first 300,000 households upgraded over the next 90 days and open for sale.
We are continuing to expand our Vantage product footprint, and we are planning a relaunch of our legacy FiOS areas, following the successful conversion of the base to the new and improved interactive media guide and the integration of our improved VOD library. And we are on track for our CAF II deployments to offer broadband to these underserved markets as quickly as practical. We will have 170,000 households open for marketing by year-end and another 90,000 non-CAF II households in adjacent areas. 
For commercial, we have realized sales, marketing and commercial product management under a single leader reporting directly to me, which is a significant change from our practice over the last few years. This builds on the substantial improvements we have been making behind the scenes over the last 12 months in revamping both our sales and support staff and our commercial marketing platform. Even before these changes, we had compiled an impressive, consistent, steady performance track record in the SME portion of commercial. Our increased focus and emphasis on the commercial market will enable us to be a more nimble, responsive competitor.
Another benefit of our new organizational structure will be more efficient capital management. The new structure will allow us to allocate capital more dynamically, prioritizing the highest return opportunity. The near-term priorities will be supporting the areas that I highlighted earlier and on IT enhancements that will drive improvements in our cost structure. 
Please turn to Slide 5. In contrast to the second and third quarters' focus on cutover integration and building organizational competency, we have now shifted our focus to the following: first, we will continue to improve our performance in the CTF market, most notably in the FiOS portion of the consumer; second, as we enable new broadband capabilities in CTF and legacy markets, we will begin ramping marketing and sales accordingly; third, we will drive commercial sales after spending much of 2016 building prospect pipelines in the new market. And finally, we will implement our new organizational structure and implement our synergy and efficiency projects to drive improved cost structures in both legacy and CTF markets. These are our top priorities of the entire organization, and the senior management will be held accountable for delivering these results. 
As we have discussed consistently, our company has been in integration mode for nearly 3 years. As we move forward, we will have a laser focus on ensuring our cost structure is continually evaluated and adjusted in keeping with the realities of the marketplace. Let me assure you that we will continue to manage our cost structure to match the revenue trends, and we are firmly committed to our objective of exceeding $4 billion in adjusted EBITDA in 2017. 
Let me say a few words about the FCC potential changes in the pricing of business data services. On October 7, the FCC released a fact sheet highlighting details of its proposed changes. Frontier remains opposed to the current framework, and we will continue building support for the proposal that we submitted in conjunction with Sprint and Windstream. As a reminder, if the factsheet framework is adopted for implementation in July 2017, we project an impact of $10 million in 2017 and an additional impact of $20 million in each of 2018 and 2019, with lesser impacts in the following years. If the FCC implements this rate reduction, we will mitigate any revenue declines with additional cost reductions. Last week, the FCC placed this item on its agenda for a vote at its open meeting scheduled for November 17. 
To summarize my comments, we have completed the bulk of the integration of the new markets. This includes achieving completion of the on-shoring of the contact center resources for both tech support and customer care faster than originally planned. We are working to improve performance from all of our distribution channels to move our sales to a more normal trend in Q4 time frame. Our organizational restructuring is underway, and we will enhance our ability to execute in the consumer and commercial segments, while significantly improving our cost structure. As you can tell, this is a very busy time at Frontier. The focus moving forward is all about execution in driving sales and aligning our cost structure to the realities of the current markets. And I am confident that we will begin to see the benefits of all this focus over the coming months. 
Before I turn this call over to our new CFO, I wanted to thank John Jureller for his service and dedication to the company. As we stated on September 12, John made significant contributions during our Connecticut and CTF acquisition, particularly in connection with the negotiation of deals and associated financing transaction. I've known Perley for almost 16 years and worked directly with him for almost 10 of those years. He is the right CFO for us at this time because he is laser focused on operational excellence and cost management. He will be invaluable to the company and me as we move forward. 
And now I'll turn the call over to Perley to review the financial results."

Let's turn to Slide 6, and I will begin with the key financial highlights of the quarter. Third quarter revenue of $2.52 billion declined $84 million from the $2.61 billion reported in the second quarter. Cu",1777,"Thank you, Dan, and good afternoon, everyone. 
Let's turn to Slide 6, and I will begin with the key financial highlights of the quarter. Third quarter revenue of $2.52 billion declined $84 million from the $2.61 billion reported in the second quarter. Customer revenue of $2.32 billion declined $62 million, and I'll discuss this in greater detail shortly. Switched access and subsidy revenue of $205 million declined $22 million sequentially, with $12 million of this decline related to the onetime recognition of CAF II revenue in the second quarter, which did not recur in Q3. Another $6 million of the decline was related to the scheduled step-down of the switched access rate, and $3 million of the decline was related to the CAF II phase-down. In other words, only $1 million of the $22 million was related to displacement of minutes of use.
Adjusted EBITDA of $1 billion was in line with the outlook we provided on September 21. This represented a margin of 39.6%, which was stable with the second quarter. We generated free cash flow of $168 million after payment of dividends on our preferred stock. Adjusted free cash flow was down sequentially, in part because of the sequential increase in CapEx. 
On Slide 7, we show the breakout of customer revenue between legacy and CTF. In legacy, customer revenue of $1.16 billion was down $7 million or 0.6% sequentially, which is a significant improvement from the 2% sequential decline we experienced in Q2. The factors driving the change in Q3 were a $9 million sequential decline in residential, partly offset by a $2 million sequential increase in business. As Dan mentioned, our revenue enhancement program underway in the quarter contributed to Q3 legacy residential revenue, and we expect an additional incremental benefit in Q4. We are investing to enhance and expand our broadband and video capabilities, and we expect these investments to contribute to an improved revenue trend over time. 
Moving to CTF. Customer revenue of $1.16 billion was down 4.5% from the $1.21 billion reported in the second quarter. The primary factor in the decline was residential revenue, which was down 6.8%. Business revenue of $456 million was down only 0.9% sequentially. In business, our legacy ARPC was up $13 sequentially as a result of an improved revenue trend in Q3. Business ARPC in CTF of $615 was also up sequentially but is still substantially below the level of legacy ARPC. The new commercial business unit that we announced today will improve our ability to differentiate our services for business customers and tailor solutions to the unique needs of various segments of the market. We have already made solid progress in this area. 
The CTF product view provides more color on the drivers behind the revenue decline in the quarter, with video down 6.5% sequentially and voice down 3.4% sequentially. Residential subscriber declines are the primary driver of this revenue trend, and we are focused on achieving improved trends. 
In contrast to the video revenue trend, data and Internet was up slightly sequentially in Q3, and this was consistent across both residential and business. The $12 million sequential decline in CTF other revenue includes the $20 million decline related to the receivable reserve we have taken in CTF, which Dan mentioned. This is offset by an increase in anticipated late fees, reflecting recovery to normal trends as we were not charging late fees in Q2 due to the transition.
Turning to Slide 8. We see that growth additions for legacy were down in Q3. As Dan outlined, the issues were typical third quarter seasonality and the transition of the call centers as a result of the on-shoring that occurred in Q3. Broadband churn in legacy in Q3 was up slightly, reflecting the disruption in the call centers as well as the impact of the revenue enhancement program. Video churn was more stable, but still elevated compared to the first quarter of 2016. 
Within CTF, gross additions improved sequentially for data and video, but have not returned to the level achieved under Verizon, as illustrated in the graph. Returning these metrics to preacquisition levels is a top priority. CTF video churn increased in Q3, but data churn was relatively stable, yet still elevated compared to preclose levels. 
Finally, in terms of the total customer churn, in legacy markets it was approximately 1.9%, up about 20 bps sequentially. Customer churn in CTF was up about 10 bps sequentially. Longer term, we anticipate the expansion of video in the legacy markets to have a positive influence on customer churn. 
On Slide 9, residential ARPC in our legacy markets of $63.41 was up $0.36 sequentially. The principal driver of this increase was the revenue enhancement program that Dan discussed earlier. In CTF, residential ARPC of $108.69 was down $1.61 sequentially. Excluding the receivables reserve, it would have been up $0.64 sequentially. On a combined basis, our ARPC was $82.34, down from $83.20. However, excluding the receivables impact, it would have been up slightly. 
Turning to Slide 10. Our Q3 adjusted operating expenses in legacy improved by $22 million sequentially to $799 million, more than offsetting the modest decline in revenue. These expense reductions were achieved through better management of outside vendors and variable cost reductions. As a result, adjusted EBITDA in legacy was $513 million, up 1.6% sequentially despite the decline in revenue. The adjusted EBITDA margin in legacy was 39.2%, up 110 basis points from the prior quarter.
Adjusted operating expenses in CTF declined about $29 million sequentially, or 3.8%, due in part to lower content cost. Adjusted EBITDA in CTF of $486 million was down about $41 million sequentially. This represented an adjusted EBITDA margin of 40.0%. Excluding the receivables reserve, adjusted EBITDA margin would have only decreased 20 bps from the 41.2% experienced in Q2. We are committed to adjusting the expense base of the business in response to changes in revenue trends and intend to drive overall margins higher over time. Our plan is to achieve $250 million of expense synergies by midyear 2017 and a total of $400 million by midyear 2019. As we demonstrated in Q3, we can also attain expense reductions that are not synergy related. 
As we move to Slide 11, in Q3, our capital spending was $403 million, up from $350 million in Q2. The increase was related to seasonal capital projects and a delay in CTF capital spending post close in Q2. We are updating our capital spending guidance for 2016 to a range of $1.25 billion to $1.275 billion, which implies a sequential decline in fourth quarter capital spending.
Growth initiatives account for approximately half of our 2016 capital expenditures, most significant are the numerous broadband enhancement and expansion programs we have underway, including the more than 800,000 additional homes passed that have been enabled for 50 megs or greater capability as well as the new broadband builds in the corporate areas of CTF. About 300,000 of the 500,000 new builds should be complete by the first quarter.
Also included in this category are the CAF II homes that Dan discussed as well as the targeted fiber-to-the-home expansions we are doing. For business, we continue to expand and enhance our Ethernet capabilities and make additional investments to expand new services to business customers. The video build we commenced will reach 150,000 households in 3 markets this year. We're also making investments in IT capabilities that are directly related to driving incremental revenue. The remainder of our capital spending is a combination of IT investments related to productivity enhancements and maintenance-related projects. 
Looking toward next year, our capital spending plan for 2017 is in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion. While this is a decline, our larger size has enabled greater efficiencies, including better pricing in procuring goods and services. Additionally, our CapEx spend on integration has allowed us to transform our operating support systems and provisioning platforms. These investments have positioned us well, which also allows us greater flexibility in 2017. So despite the lower absolute spending, we expect to have an equally robust capital program in 2017. 
Please turn to Slide 12. Our leverage ratio at the end of Q3 was 3.86x, which is the trailing 12-month pro forma, including run rate cost synergies. We expect a modest increase in the leverage ratio as we move forward over the next 2 quarters, which is due in part to the substantial CAF II true-up amount that impacted EBITDA in the fourth quarter of 2015.
We have a healthy cash balance, strong liquidity and a manageable maturity schedule. In 2017, we have approximately $500 million in maturities and slightly over $700 million in 2018, the majority of which is due in Q4 of '18. Net debt is $17.6 billion. And existing liquidity, together with ongoing cash flow from operations, will enable us to meet these maturities and reduce additional debt and leverage over time. I want to reiterate that we are very focused on delevering the business. 
On Slide 13, our trailing 12 month dividend payout ratio was 54%, which remains one of the most attractive in the telecom sector. The board has declared a common dividend of $0.105 per share for the fourth quarter of 2016, payable December 31. We will also pay the regularly scheduled dividend on our preferred shares on December 30. 
Please turn to Slide 14. We are refining 2016 guidance as follows: fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA to be $1 billion or more; full year capital spending of $1,250 million to $1,275 million. Cash taxes are expected to be a refund of $100 million to $110 million. Cash pension contribution will be in the range of $10 million to $15 million. We anticipate interest expense of $1.53 billion to $1.54 billion.
For the purposes of our adjusted free cash flow guidance, interest related to the CTF transaction is excluded from Q1, the quarter we didn't yet own the asset. So $1.34 billion to $1.35 billion would be the interest expense that would correspond to our free cash flow guidance. And we anticipate 2016 adjusted free cash flow to be in the range of $920 million to $950 million. 
Lastly, on Slide 15. Formal guidance for 2017 will come in February after we have completed our planning for the year. In the meantime, we are providing an outlook for items where we have visibility. We anticipate 2017 adjusted EBITDA to be $4 billion or higher. As mentioned, capital spending is in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion, and cash taxes should be near 0. 
I'll now pass the call back to the operator, who will open the line for questions."

You've mentioned that gross adds are improving in the acquired territories. Can you provide a bit more guidance, why did we see accelerating losses altogether? I understand that there was some disruption on the legacy side, but I think the reduction is higher than we thought about. Then second on the revenues. I believe a year ago when you closed the Connecticut deal, you had mentioned that you're taking -- there was a bit of disruption on the revenue line, and you're taking precaution not to repeat that with this acquisition. So can you talk about what is not going as planned? And why you're deciding to make these operational changes, a little bit more -- providing more specifics around it? And just one final one, a quick follow-up. On the integration expense, it had been elevated for the last 2 quarters. Now that, that process is done, can we assume that expense goes down substantially?"

So on the broadband side, probably the biggest change from last quarter was on the legacy side, where we did see those losses. The biggest impact for both the CTF side and also the legacy side was when we on-shored our call center. That remains probably 55% of our sales channel in any period. And as we've brought people on, it created some disruption and lack of performance in that area. That really was probably the biggest issue. I think we were disappointed that we were not able to accelerate sales further on the CTF side. We certainly started in what is usually a fairly slow period for us, but we didn't see as good performance as we hoped. We're starting to see, as I said, improvements in October. But it's too early to call the fourth quarter, whether or not we're going to get there this month or next month or, really, December. We'll have a lot better visibility as we execute on our fourth quarter offer in November and December. On the revenue side, we absolutely took the precautions that we've talked about, and we locked down the ability for the variable around migrations that occurred in Connecticut. So we have not seen that happen. I think we've been very successful on that front. The real -- where we're not being successful was on adding the gross adds on the subscriber side on CTF. That's really where we're making the changes on everything from product offers to marketing tactics and channels. And where, as I said, we're starting to see improvements on that. So I expect, as we improve the trends on the FiOS product set in CTF, we'll start to see much better improvement on the revenue trends. And then on the integration side, we did spend extensively to really on-shore our call centers much faster than originally planned. Our original plans were to have that happen through -- slowly through the balance of the year. We spent a lot of money, extra, on training, redundant resources to bring that back in. We're expecting to see integration spend trail off as we get into the fourth quarter. And then finally, as we looked at operating the business at the expanded scale and the ability to use different offers and look at the markets as we were originally constructing them, we felt that we would be much more efficient because the new markets are very homogeneous when it comes to the product sets that will be offered. We can take advantage of the scale around the markets as well as that standardization of what the product offers will be in Texas, Florida and California. And we looked at our normal business, our legacy business. We started to see that we will be gaining a lot of benefit from taking out the duplicative cost structure there. So we started to look at it maybe 2 months ago, 3 months ago, and then we refined our plans and adjusted it accordingly over the last 30 to 60 days."

We saw an improvement on the gross adds in Q3, but that was really from virtually no marketing in Q2. What we started to see already in Q4 was a step up comparable to what we saw in the whole third quarter. So a material change. And we expect, as we introduce our holiday offer, which is really slated to hit the markets before Thanksgiving over the next week or 2, that we'll see improved performance even more. Probably the single biggest improvement, though, was getting to the point where 4,000 new reps that came into the company as we on-shored were selling effectively and efficiently using the tools. And you can't fully train everyone in that first month or 2. And we made a trade-off that accelerated that to improve the customer experience from an offshore perspective to onshore. But the trade-off really was that they weren't as good at selling initially, and that's improving each and every day. So the combination of the enhanced offer that we're putting in the market as well as the improved competency did see that the trends continued to improve steadily in the fourth quarter."

A",336,"I guess -- I mean just to kind of address the elephant in the room, with the stock at 10-plus percent yield, everyone -- it seems like the market is really suggesting that either Frontier will choose to cut the dividend or will have to cut the dividend. And I think that there's really 3 stories that go along with that. Number one would be, Perley, that you came in and John left and somehow that had something to do with new eyes coming in and maybe having to cut the dividend. So if you could kind of talk a little bit about what you think your capacity to keep paying the dividend, and the commitment of the company overall is to it, from your perspective, would be great. The second issue on the have-to-cut seems to be that we've got about a, call it, $250 million midpoint synergy run rate by next year. Pro rate that over the year, it's about $125 million of benefit. And you've given this $4 billion or better guidance number, which leaves out there the possibility that everything outside synergies could come down another $125 million. And then when the synergies start to peter out, then the business is still declining at $125 million a year and we don't -- and then we would put more pressure on the dividend. So could you kind of reconcile a $4 billion or better guidance number for next year relative to the $4 billion run rate you have right now, given that you think all these are synergies are coming through? And the final piece, I think, to this leverage question that just got asked is a lot of confusion about the 4.5x leverage test that goes along with the restricted payments basket and whether you can or can't pay the dividend and when that occurs in the future, if at all. Could you talk directly to that calculation and how that impacts -- how we should think about the dividend being covered?"

But from my perspective, when it comes to that question on the dividend cut, we don't see that at the same risk that others are obviously factoring in. From our perspective, we have ample ability to control our cost structure. We're executing on that, even as we speak today. We'll be driving that through the fourth quarter into the first quarter and then trying to accelerate the additional synergies even faster. But more importantly, we're working to really change that revenue line item, and that's really what ultimately is going to solve that issue that you highlighted. And when you look at changing the CTF statistics on performance, which is what we're all focused on right now, you look at the substantial opportunity on the commercial side, which we've spent a year really building the funnel and the new properties. And the new properties, quite frankly, have much more opportunity on the commercial ones than our legacy property. And then you look at the investments that we've made to enable better performance on our broadband side, each one of those is a unique opportunity that we can use to drive incremental revenue and start to really move the EBITDA line. I think you saw in this quarter we really -- our focus is very heavily on making sure that we heard loud and clear from different investors over time that we had not been active in adjusting our cost structure. And we really went after it with a gusto, and we'll continue to do that. And if we see further pressure on the revenue side, we'll make the right decisions on the cost structure to really offset that. So I wanted to get that in before Perley really gave you his point of view coming in."

There's definitely a need to improve the execution of the business, and there's definitely a need to improve our financial profile of the business, absolutely. And so focus is definitely on cost and taking costs out of the business. I have an acute focus on that. And we have to make sure that every dollar that we're spending is really going towards our growth initiatives. That's capital dollars. That's expense dollars, even integration dollars. And because -- I'm very much focused on delevering the business. I -- our leverage must be -- our leverage will not go over above 4.5x. It needs to stay below 4.5x.

So essentially, there's a step-down after those 2 factors, is that step-down, effectively, the revenue and margin decline that we're talking about here? Are there any of the moving parts that I'm missing? And then the next question, just on the organization structure. I was hoping you can provide just a little bit more color on what exactly that entails? And it sounds like there's managers in each state or each region. And how many regions are there?

Each one of the regions had its own resources that included marketing, finance, engineering, human resources. And in doing that, we -- when we were a much smaller entity, it really did serve us well at that point in time. The more we looked at it today, the less differences there are in a lot of the markets and in the way we're going to market, whether it's around a Vantage product or it's around FiOS or it's around next-generation broadband product. So when we looked at it, we did a, really, a trade-off on it. So we've essentially eliminated all of that redundancy in the organization. The impact is approximately 1,000 individuals that'll be leaving the organization, and that translates directly into cost savings. And the nice part about it, too, is that the enhanced focus on commercial as well as consumer -- and Frontier has historically been a very consumer-focused organization. We've done well on the commercial side, but I really believe we can do much better with more focus, more attention and really putting the resources on those opportunities and making it: that's what they do every day when they get up and they come to work. All they're trying to do is grow the commercial revenue base. So that's really what we've done. It does change the focus of the field operations to really be engaged with the communities as well as provide an excellent service to customers and being that bridge. But really, sales for both consumer and commercial are more centralized in a way that we can apply better resources and do it in a more efficient manner."

I really think this is our execution issue. And it's ours to fix, and we're fixing it. So I think you'll see us improve from a revenue stability as we do a better job of executing going forward. And I'm convinced that as we get those trends back to where we know they can be, because it is a great product set, and it's very competitive, obviously, in the market, that we'll start to see that stability. I think the key areas that we're focusing on, if you look at the commercial opportunity in these areas, we think that is a very large opportunity that we haven't even begun to tap yet. And people are always looking for a different way of solving their needs of their businesses, and we're starting to build robust pipelines around that right now. The sales pipelines tend to build over a 6- to 9-month period and then you really start to harvest all the fruits of those efforts. So those will all be incremental growth opportunities for us in these markets, especially on the CTF. I think on the legacy side, what we need to do is really do a better job of selling in the areas that we've upgraded or opened for sale. And those are in the speed upgrades as well as the CAF opportunity. When you look at the amount of CAF homes that we'll have open for sale by the end of the year, that is a really good opportunity for us to really help change the trends on the legacy property. In addition to that, we are, as we talked about on previous calls, opening markets throughout the end of this year and into next year around the Vantage platform. Vantage is not only video, but it's really enhanced broadband speeds and it offers different commercial opportunities in a market. So we'll be capitalizing on all those things as we go forward. One final thing that will help us, too, I think, is really as we change the product availability in some of the copper markets for the new states we go from, essentially, a 6-meg product that hasn't been opened for sale in years, to a 50-plus meg product that's very competitive in the marketplace and offers customer a choice that they never had before. So we think that's an exciting opportunity. When you put all those things together, it really does give us the leverage we need to really push on the revenue side. But it really does start with improving in the CTF area, and that's where the laser focus is on the whole team right now."
