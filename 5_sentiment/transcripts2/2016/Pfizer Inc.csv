We finished 2015 with strong financial and operational performance. For the full year, we exceeded our 2015 revenue guidance and met the top end of our adjusted diluted EPS guidance. And we achieved our first",1477,"Thank you, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. We finished 2015 with strong financial and operational performance. For the full year, we exceeded our 2015 revenue guidance and met the top end of our adjusted diluted EPS guidance. And we achieved our first year of operational revenue growth in 5 years. Frank will take you through the numbers. Before he does, I have a few brief comments about what is driving our performance, some thoughts regarding where we expect to see pipeline advancements during the year and I'll close with a few comments about Allergan. 
Throughout the year, and especially in the fourth quarter, our business executed flawlessly despite the challenging operational environment. We ended 2015 with solid momentum in both developed and emerging markets. Specifically, in developed markets, during the year we gained incremental market penetration driven by continued success of products that are early in their life cycles, including Prevnar 13 in Adults, IBRANCE, Eliquis, Xeljanz. And we saw steady growth from key in-line products in 2015, specifically Lyrica in markets where it remains patent-protected. 
And during the year, in Emerging Markets, we saw operational revenue growth primarily due to the performance of Prevnar, LIPITOR and Enbrel as well as from the addition of legacy Hospira products. 
The integration of our Hospira business into Pfizer Global Established Pharma business is on track, and we look forward to this business being an attractive potential growth driver. This acquisition is indeed proving to be an excellent strategic fit and we're seeing the expected value contribution to our GEP business that we anticipated. 
Frank will speak to our 2016 guidance in a moment. We expect to deliver operational revenue growth in 2016. Our key growth drivers will continue to be IBRANCE, Eliquis and Xeljanz. And we believe that Prevnar Adult global revenues will be comparable to the strong results we achieved in 2015. Additionally, we believe our near-term pipeline will help accelerate this ongoing growth forward. 
In looking at the year ahead, we expect our businesses will continue to execute well, they're competitively positioned within their markets and are performing strong against their competitive set. 
Regarding the pipeline, we anticipate advancing many of our Phase III programs during the year. For bococizumab, we reported today that the first of our 6 Phase III efficacy studies achieved its primary endpoint and we expect readouts of the remaining 5 bococizumab studies to [indiscernible] during 2016. 
For ertugliflozin, this year, we and our partners Merck will begin to deliver results from our comprehensive Phase III clinical program. In 2016, the Alliance expect to submit applications to regulatory approval in the U.S. for both monotherapy and 2 fixed dose combination tablets using data from 8 clinical trials. 
The document we expect results in the second half of the year for Phase III study in first-line EGFR mutant non-small cell lung cancer and will discuss our regulatory strategy with the FDA. 
For Xeljanz, in the first half of this year, we expect top line results for our Phase III program in psoriatic arthritis. We believe Xeljanz can potentially fill a significant unmet need in the psoriatic arthritis market where nonbiologic not proven success and where there are currently fewer alternative for patients who have inadequate responses to anti-TNF therapy. 
In addition, in the first half of the year, we anticipate the decision of the FDA for our once a day daily formulation for rheumatoid arthritis and we remain on track to refile our application for RA in EU. 
For IBRANCE, we expect to see the top line PALOMA-2 study results in first-line advanced breast cancer in combination with letrozole. And we have an April PDUFA date for second and third line treatment for advanced breast cancer based on the PALOMA-3 data. We could also see a regulatory decision for IBRANCE in EU by year-end. 
Additionally, in the oncology business, we have a PDUFA date this year in the U.S. with Xalkori in ROS1 non-small cell lung cancer and we expect to file for approval of inotuzumab for acute lymphoblastic leukemia in the U.S. 
And in immuno-oncology, we now have a broad portfolio of compounds that we believe has the potential to support the development of a strong deep competitive market position. We now have 5 immuno-oncology assets in the clinic and expect to have up to 10 in the clinic by the end of 2016. As a result of our partnership with Merck KGaA, as of the end of 2015, we had 28 ongoing clinical development programs for avelumab, with 7 of them being pivotal registrational studies. We anticipate some of these studies will give us potential registration to areas like Merkel cell, ovarian, bladder, gastric and lung cancer. Of these 7 studies, we expect to present data in cell this year and to see data from the other tumor types in the following 2 years. 
And we continue to believe that the winners in this space will be those who have a breadth portfolio, assets that support rationale combinations. We have a range of assets to combine with avelumab when compared to other companies' assets and we have already initiated 6 combination studies with avelumab. 
In 2016, we expect to see data from 4-1BB in combination with and in combination with avelumab in various tumors. 4-1BB in combination with rituximab in lymphoma. A combination of, our next generation ALK inhibitor with avelumab in ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer. And data from the light our renal cell carcinoma. Finally, we may see data from as a single agent this year. 
Taking all of this into account, we believe we are well on our way to be a leading player in the space. 
And now a few comments with our proposed combination with Allergan. We're excited about bringing 2 great companies together that have a strong strategic fit. The transactions are accelerating growth potential in our Innovative Businesses and strengthening our Established Business and more efficiently allocating our capital around the world. We are confident that we are taking appropriate steps so that we can achieve the key milestones needed to complete the transaction and continue expect close in the second half of 2016. 
Since the announcement, we have been working closely with and his team at Allergan and have been delighted by the engagement and report is occurring. We've seen number of potential opportunities after closing as we continue to learn more about each other's portfolio. For example, we see complementarity in information in gastroenterology. And we have a broader presence in cardiovascular disease with Eliquis and. In neuroscience, Allergan's work in Alzheimer's, schizophrenia and major depressive orders will be highly complementary to Pfizer's promising early work in such areas as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. 
When you look at over the next few years, we expect both companies will continue to contribute several potential new drugs to launch. We also continue to be excited about the international potential. 
By coming together, we're harnessing category leadership throughout our complementary in line portfolio and the combined pipeline with great late stage and mid-stage assets across each of our key therapeutic areas. Both companies bring being great deal of scientific and product expertise to the proposed combination and a shared philosophy in our approach to research and development.
Upon the close of the transaction, the combined company will be an influential player in the industry with a comparative product portfolio with several leadership positions, robust pipeline, compelling capital structure and financial position and aligned cultures that are based on ownership and entrepreneurial spirit, creating shareholder value and meeting patients' needs. This combination is about investing in our business. It's about accelerating our existing strategy while preserving our options putting the company into an Innovative business and an Established Business. If we determine that is the best way to unlock the most value for our shareholders. 
By the end of the current quarter, our integration teams will be fully engaged and we anticipate announcing post-closing leadership positions. Throughout the year, we'll continue to keep you updated in our progress. 
In summary, we are looking at a year ahead. We have a sound strategy and a strong business. Our outlook and financial guidance for the year takes into account the benefit of anticipated positive organic growth from key products as well as the impact from foreign exchange. We have a solid portfolio of market-leading in-line products and healthy pipeline. We expect to further strengthen the growth potential of the business with the pending addition of Allergan. We will continue to have the means by which we can create value for our shareholders and bring innovative medicines to patients by producing expected topline growth, progressing key pipeline assets, pursuing strategic business development and returning capital to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. 
Now I'll turn over to Frank for additional details on the quarter and our 2016 financial guidance."
162270,320188641,924616,"Pfizer Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2016",2016-02-02,"Earnings Calls","Pfizer Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ian. Good day, everyone. As always, the charts we're reviewing today are included in our webcast. As a reminder, because we completed the acquisition of Hospira on September 3, 2015, Pfizer's full-year financial results for the year ended December",1732,"Thanks, Ian. Good day, everyone. As always, the charts we're reviewing today are included in our webcast. As a reminder, because we completed the acquisition of Hospira on September 3, 2015, Pfizer's full-year financial results for the year ended December 31, 2015, include 4 months of legacy Hospira U.S. operations and 3 months of legacy Hospira international operations. Financial results for the fourth quarter 2015 include 3 months of legacy Hospira global operations. By comparison, financial results for full-year and fourth quarter 2014 do not include any contribution from legacy Hospira operations. 
Now moving onto the financials. Fourth quarter 2015 reported revenues were approximately $14 billion and reflect year-over-year operational growth of $1.9 billion or 14%, mainly driven by the addition of legacy Hospira operations, the continued strong performance on products that are early in their life cycles such as Prevnar 13 Adult, IBRANCE, Eliquis and Xeljanz, Lyrica primarily in the U.S. and 5% operational growth in Emerging Markets, mainly from legacy Hospira operations, Prevnar 13 and certain other products. 
Reported revenues continue to be unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of $934 million or 7%. Excluding the inclusion of legacy Hospira operations of $1.2 billion, the negative impact of foreign exchange, and to a much lesser extent the inclusion of $35 million of revenues associated with vaccines acquired from Baxter, Pfizer stand-alone achieved operational growth of $646 million or 5% while at the same time absorbing a $720 million negative operational impact from product loss of exclusivity. 
Fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS was $0.53 versus $0.54 in the year-ago quarter. The decrease is primarily due to an aggregate operational increase in adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses and adjusted R&D expenses of $1.8 billion or 21%, $0.07 due to foreign exchange and the continued product losses of exclusivity in certain geographies. These were partially offset by revenue growth of certain new in-line and acquired products, a lower effective tax rate and fewer diluted weighted average shares outstanding, which declined by 125 million shares versus the year ago quarter due to our share repurchase program, which includes the impact of our $5 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement executed in February 2015 and completed in July. 
Reported diluted EPS was $0.10 compared with $0.19 in the year-ago quarter due to the previously mentioned factors and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency losses related to Venezuela, increased purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs, restructuring charges and asset impairment charges versus the prior year quarter and nonrecurring charges related to pension settlements, which were partially offset by the nonrecurrence of a charge associated with the global strategic alliance formed with Merck KGaA in November 2014 to jointly develop and commercialize avelumab, lower charges for certain legal matters and lower effective tax rate.
Foreign exchange negatively impacted fourth quarter reported revenues by approximately $934 million or 7% and positively impacted adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses and adjusted R&D expenses in the aggregate by $435 million or 5%. As a result, foreign exchange negatively impacted fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS by approximately $0.07 compared with the year ago quarter.
Now moving on to the financial highlights of our business segments. In the fourth quarter, Global Innovative Pharmaceutical revenues increased 10% operationally year-over-year due to the strong performance of recently launched products, including Eliquis globally and Xeljanz in the U.S. and the strong performance of Lyrica in the U.S. and Japan. Income before taxes increased 17% operationally due to the increase in revenues and a 5% operational decrease in cost of sales. Cost of sales as a percentage of revenue decreased 1.7 percentage points operationally because of lower royalty expenses and increased alliance revenue is with no associated cost of sales. IBD was unfavorably impacted by a 4% operational increase and SI&A expenses as a result of additional investment in Eliquis, Xeljanz and 11% operational increase in R&D reflecting investments in our late-stage pipeline, primarily for bococizumab and
Fourth quarter VOC revenues increased 38% operationally reflecting operational revenue growth in each business. Global Vaccine revenues grew 53% operationally driven by 102% increase of Prevnar 13 U.S. revenues due to strong uptake among adults. Global oncology revenues grew 61% operationally driven by IBRANCE in the U.S. and to a lesser extent by Sutent and Xalkori globally. And Consumer Healthcare revenues grew 4% operationally due to Nexium 24HR in the U.S. 
Income before taxes increased 33% operationally, mainly due to increased revenues associated improvement in gross margin, which were partially offset by a 66% operational increase and SI&A expenses as a result of higher promotional expenses in the U.S. for newly launched Consumer Healthcare products, IBRANCE and Prevnar 13 Adult. 
And the 46% operational increase in R&D expenses due to increased cost associated with our oncology programs, primarily our alliance with Merck KGaA and IBRANCE. 
Fourth quarter Global Established Pharmaceutical revenues increased 5% operationally, mainly due to the previously mentioned inclusion of legacy Hospira revenues contributing $1.2 billion, which was partially offset by loss of exclusivity and generic competition for Celebrex in the U.S. and certain other developed markets, Lyrica in most developed markets in Europe and Zyvox in the U.S. 
Emerging-market revenues were flat operationally, which reflected the positive impact of the inclusion of legacy Hospira operations and continued strong growth in China, offset by declines in certain markets in the Middle East. 
Income before taxes declined 12% operationally reflecting the unfavorable impact of a 4.7 percentage point operational increase in the cost of sales as a percentage of revenues due to the inclusion of Hospira operations and the impact of losses of exclusivity.
A 24% operational increase in SI&A expenses driven in part by the addition of Hospira operations and a 53% operational increase in R&D expenses due to an increased legacy Hospira development programs. 
We had exceeded to the top of our guidance range expectations for 2015 reported revenues by approximately $400 million. Adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenues was 18.% versus 18.7%, at the low end of our guidance range due to increased alliance revenues and sales volumes. And we exceeded our expectation for our effective tax rate on adjusted income as a result of a favorable change in our jurisdictional mix of earnings. We met our expectations for adjusted R&D expenses and achieved the top end of our adjusted diluted EPS. Adjusted SI&A expenses of $14.3 billion were higher than our guidance range due to increased expenses for recently launched products such as Prevnar 13 Adult and IBRANCE, other in-line products and certain Consumer Healthcare brands.
We recorded adjusted other income of $409 million versus our expectation of approximately $500 million. Finally, reported diluted EPS was $1.24 versus our expected range of $1.37 to $1.43, mainly as a result of increased purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs and restructuring charges primarily related to the acquisition of Hospira, the negative impact of currency losses related to Venezuela and nonrecurring charges related to pension settlements. 
Now I'd like to walk you through the 2016 guidance ranges for reported revenues, reported diluted EPS and adjusted diluted EPS relative to our 2015 actual results. First, it's important to note that our 2016 financial guidance excludes the impact of our pending combination with Allergan. Our 2016 reported revenue guidance range reflects anticipated strong growth of certain new, in-line and acquired products that is partially offset by an anticipated $2.3 billion negative impact due to continuing product losses of exclusivity. I want to point out that within this range, and consistent with our previous comments, we expect full year Prevnar 13 Adult global revenues to be comparable with its full year 2015 global revenue level. We expect adverse changes in foreign exchange based on mid-January 2016 rates relative to the U.S. dollar compared with actual foreign exchange rates in 2015 to have an additional $2.3 billion negative impact on recorded revenues including an estimated $800 million negative currency impact related to Venezuela. 
Consequently, we expect 2016 reported revenues to be in the range of $49 billion to $51 billion. Reported diluted EPS and adjusted diluted EPS guidance also include the negative impact from product losses of exclusivity as well as an expected $0.09 negative impact from foreign exchange rates and a $0.07 negative currency impact related to Venezuela. As a result, we expect reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.54 to $1.67 and adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.20 to $2.30. 
In addition, I want to remind everyone that guidance ranges for both reported and adjusted diluted EPS incorporate $5 billion of anticipated share repurchases in 2016, which consists of our previously announced intention to execute a $5 billion accelerated share repurchase program in the first half of 2016. These repurchases are expected to more than offset the potential dilution related to employee compensation programs. 
In summary, if you exclude anticipated foreign change impacts, including the negative currency impact related to Venezuela, full year 2016 revenue and adjusted EPS guidance midpoints are 7% and 10% greater than actual full year 2015 levels, respectively.
The remaining elements of our 2016 financial guidance are set forth on this chart.
Now moving on to key takeaways. We had a very strong financial performance in 2015, and we achieved operational revenue growth every quarter, including 14% operational growth in the fourth quarter. For the full year 2015, we achieved 6% operational revenue growth that was mainly driven by new products that are early in their life cycles, and we achieved this growth despite a $3.2 billion negative impact from product losses of exclusivity. Our full year 2016 reported revenue guidance range of $49 billion to $51 billion absorbs a $4.6 billion combined negative impact of product losses of exclusivity, adverse changes in foreign exchange rates and the negative currency impact related to Venezuela. And the adjusted diluted EPS guidance rates includes an anticipated $0.16 negative impact from foreign exchange, including Venezuela. We announced our proposed combination with Allergan and continue to expect the transaction to close in the second half of 2016. And we continue to create shareholder value through prudent capital allocation. In 2015 we returned $13.1 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And we expect to execute a $5 billion accelerated share repurchase program in the first half of 2016. Finally, we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2016 and beyond. 
Now I'll turn it back to Chuck."

Let me provide some insight to help you understand the situation moving forward. In the U.S. obviously we have done an excellent job with a catch-up opportunity, we achieved 86% market share, 92% at retailers, we have 90% awareness of the recommendation at healthcare practitioner. And as a result of the 45 million adults eligible at the time of recommendation for vaccination, we have already captured about 1/3 of them. Now while many adults remain, this cohort is more difficult to capture as the low-hanging fruit is gone. It will require more innovative strategies, but we all have in place. But even if we assume a similar or higher penetration rate this year, it would be on a much smaller pool of adults. However, expected this would be mitigated by Europe, which has a very different growth profile. Even with prices lower than U.S., the demographics are very favorable with a much larger eligible population. And we have already received pneumonia in our label in 2015, and we are working to obtain broad recommendations and following that, reimbursement from the authorities. Now this will be phased likely over a 2 years window period because in Europe, this is done country by country and sometimes, region by region within the same country. But all in all, we expect very strong growth in Europe next year. Now let me move on IBRANCE and to your question about competition on particularly Lilly's drug. And lilies drug, while in the same class is for indication. The refractory patient population for which they have received breakthrough designation is a very small population with few options available. In fact, the average refractory patient undergo 7 lines of treatment. So they are in high need. Now speaking generally on competition, there is only limited clinical data on the public domain. And we need to see more efficacy and safety data to make comparisons. What I can tell you is about our strategic position. We are the only company with a registered product in the U.S. and 6 other countries and other accepted filing in Europe where we may obtain registration as early as next year. We have very good clinical experience with the product. IBRANCE has been prescribed by 5,000 physicians in more than 20,000 patients. And so far, feedback is very positive, particularly on patient's quality of life. We are having a very heavy clinical program with 2 pivotal studies in first-line metastatic breast cancer, 2 studies in recurrent metastatic breast cancer and 3 in early breast cancer, PENELOPE-B, PALLAS and PALOMA. IBRANCE is part of 88 investigational trials, approximately 15 breast cancer and 38 in other tumor types. So as you can see, we are investing heavily to stay ahead of the competition."

So we ended the full year at 18.5% in terms of cost of sales, so I'll do the cost of sales, the reciprocal obviously is gross margin. We guided for next year cost of sales number of 21% to 22%. So if you take the midpoint of that 21% to 22%, just to make the math easy, that's 21.5% from our 18.5%, that's a 3%, 300 basis point increase in our cost of sales as a percentage of revenues. By the way, that's being driven by a few factors, but one of which clearly is Hospira. In terms of I think your question which is why wasn't even more. I think the answer is, our ongoing productivity and cost reduction initiatives. When you think about our factories, our manufacturing capabilities, we really manage that from a cost perspective. First of all, we focus that on quality, service and cost. If you think about that as a triangle, quality is at the top of the triangle, but there's 4 major buckets right, there is a number of facilities, there's the numerous quality initiatives we have within each facility, there's the purchasing that we can get from a leverage perspective. And finally, there's the incentive cost that resides outside of the factories. We manage all 4 of those very aggressively to basically manage our cost structure and manufacturing. But that gives you a feel for what the numbers were and why they are what they are."

So obviously again we're very excited about the opportunity that's afforded us by the combination of our 2 businesses. And I think we've talked about biosimilars already and the opportunities we see in that marketplace. Let me just touch briefly on sterile injectables. Obviously, it's a very -- it's a large, it's a growing market. It's somewhere between $50 billion to $70 billion currently globally. And one of the features of that market is it's very concentrated, particularly in the U.S. but also in a few ex- U.S. markets such as Western Europe and particularly China. So one of the things that we are very focused on is going to be revenue synergy. We obviously have a strong commercial presence in China and also in the hospital segment in developed Europe and emerging Europe. So essentially, the lag time since September when we closed this transaction, we have been focused really on making sure that we have our blocking and tackling in place to be very systematic with our highest value molecules that really sort of meet market needs most appropriately to be very focused on registering and bringing those molecules to market. So and the biggest opportunity that we have in China, that is going to take time, as you are very well aware, drug lag in China is a significant issue, but we are very encouraged by the progress that the CFDA are making to accelerate access to important new medicines in China. But that will take time. But we do see opportunities both in the short term as well as medium, long-term to deliver significant growth ex U.S. through the sterile injectable business in the combination of Hospira portfolio footprint."

I think you said you would make a decision by the end of 2018. I just want to put out there that the stock has pulled back quite a bit since you announced the Allergan deal. And I would think despite clearly the market is excited about this. But I would think that, that would --  the difference in that even growing gap an evaluation between where your stock is in should help you to accelerate your decision to move in that direction. And if you could just comment on that, please. And then just thirdly on revenue growth. I mean clearly there have been tons of pushes and pulls in your numbers, mostly currency and patent expirations. Can you remind us when you expect, and this excludes the acquisition from Allergan, but when you expect your reported revenue growth just talk about operationally revenue growth, when we should start to see a positive inflection point? Because it has when I look at my models, revenues have been in decline for many years. And some of that's divestitures and spins, but really since 2013, we've had revenue sort of flat to down. When is that going to change? What's going to drive that change just talking from Pfizer standpoint?"

We'll have good growth from our in-line products and our newly launched products that we'd still be to [indiscernible] a couple of billion of LOEs. So I think you can begin to see as we launch -- as we begin to get more traction with more clinical trials in IBRANCE, as we begin to see ertugliflozin launch, as we begin to see our NextWave approach get approved, you'll see us return to a very robust growth. But obviously, Jami, one of the reasons of doing the Allergan deal was in fact to ensure that we had robust growth in our Innovative business. So we are aware of that issue. Now this is the breakup timing. Number one, I'd point out that while the stock is down, I don't think it's specifically down more than the DRG. I think it's roughly the same as the DRG. And in fact, given the odd pressure that one would expect in the stock, I'm actually never like to see the stock go down, it certainly was expected to come under pressure from the community. Now the breakup timing is an issue of we are focused on integrating this company and the 2 companies together and we have laid out the 4 questions that we need to answer. And I think any shareholder would want those quenches answered. So can we run the businesses successfully inside Pfizer? And we brought Hospira, you've seen sterile injectables, got the biosimilars, you're beginning to see if you strip out the LOEs stabilization of the core business, which we expect to return to growth. But that being said, we can run it well inside Pfizer. Can it be run better outside Pfizer? Is there trapped value and can we unlock the trapped value in a tax efficient manner? These are very serious questions. These are very large companies. And I think that by innovating, we will be well positioned to make that decision in the best interest of our shareholders and, frankly, don't particular see a way of short-circuiting that just because of the amount of work that has to be done and integration and getting the transaction of Allergan right. I do understand your wish for more speedy decision, but I think we're taking the right approach to shareholder value here."

Two things, first, I want to just to point out is somewhat different from palbo and Novartis CDK drug in that it seems to be less selective and has a different adverse event profile, likely due to hitting multiple CDKs, particularly being reported significant GI issues. So it's a different profile. And we, as Albert very well pointed out, have been extremely pleased with the favorable profile that allow patients to benefit from IBRANCE with very good tolerability. Now you asked about this late-stage population studies by and how that population in the future will evolve. We anticipate, as IBRANCE is having a very nice uptick in the marketplace in first-line metastatic and some also more advanced lines, and hopefully with a PALOMA-3 approval, IBRANCE is likely to be used in multiple lines. Hence, monotherapy with another CDK will, of course, have the potential to face patient population that have seen a CDK inhibitor. And that's why we are developing a strategy for how we can see patient benefit from a drug like IBRANCE at various stages with different anti- and which now studying IBRANCE in triple therapy.

We said, Ian said when he answered Jami's question that revenue excluding Hospira on a year-over-year basis was essentially flat operationally while absorbing $2.3 billion in LOEs for 2016. The data point I think to help you answer the question is, remember, we did $1.5 billion in Hospira sales this year. So when we say that the bulk of the growth is from Hospira, you understand it's incremental growth on top of the $1.5 billion that we printed in 2015.

We had about $39 billion of debt, short-term and long-term debt. So to your point, call that one-to-one essentially. And what we said when we announced the Allergan deal, what I said was we could take the leverage ratio, your point, up to about 2.5 to 3. And then obviously, once we took the deal, we want to see what kind are rhythms that created relative to the company, the operations supporting the company. And that we take it there but that we'd still want access to commercial paper. We'd be willing to take a 1 notch downgrade, but we still want to have access to commercial paper. But in terms of your math and your calculation, that 2.5 to 3, that's right, that's basically what I talked about when we announced the Allergan deal. So your math was good."

If you look at the quarter, we had a big spending in SG&A, $4.6 billion all in. 3 major factors there, right. One obviously the inclusion of Hospira, which added a couple hundred million. Two, sequentially if you think about the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, we had a lot more selling days in the quarter. So internationally, we had 6 more selling days. Domestically, we had 2 more selling days. So sequentially, Q3 of '15 to Q4 of '15, we had more selling days so obviously that helps revenue also increases the spend on the line items. And then we had obviously I alluded to in my comments increased promotional spend in many areas of the business. Now if you take that 4.6 and you annualize it times 2 is what, 9.2 times 2 is 18.4. If you look at the guidance we gave for next year and SI&A, it's $13.2 billion to $14.2 billion. So you can't take that Q4 number and annualize it. You get to a number that's nothing close to what our guidance is for 2016. It was just a combination of the Hospira numbers, the selling days and then the increased spent in the quarter. But if you look at it for next year, got a number that on an annual basis is significantly lower than what that annualized number would be."

So any commentary around that? Two additional questions. One on CDK 4/6, this one's for Mikael. Mikael, when you look at preclinical models, is there any argument or hypothesis around a drug that has to be given intermittently that it might have less efficacy than one that's given on a continuous dosing? And is that supported by any preclinical models? And then the last question just had to do with Xeljanz. Obviously, a very important asset for you. Not only in the U.S. But on the EU timing for filing, I think you indicated you wanted to have that filed before the end of the year. Just any update on what Europe is looking for within that filing to secure approval in Europe? And then on psoriasis in the U.S, antidevelopment there and on the modified release from a regulatory standpoint.

So we started out with the accretion dilution, we said neutral in year 1, modestly accretive in year 2, more than 10% in year 3 and then high teens in year 4. We gave what the beginning share count number of the combined company would be, it was 10.6 billion shares. We said we have 5.9 billion in Allergan, we have 4.7 billion.

We finished 2015 with strong financial and operational performance. For the full year, we exceeded our 2015 revenue guidance and met the top end of our adjusted diluted EPS guidance. Excuse me. And we achieved",1512,"Thank you, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. We finished 2015 with strong financial and operational performance. For the full year, we exceeded our 2015 revenue guidance and met the top end of our adjusted diluted EPS guidance. Excuse me. And we achieved our first year of operational revenue growth in 5 years. Frank will take you through the numbers. Before he does, I have a few brief comments about what is driving our performance, some thoughts regarding where we expect to see pipeline advancements during the year, and I'll close with a few comments about Allergan. 
Throughout the year and especially in the fourth quarter, our business executed flawlessly despite a challenging operational environment. We ended 2015 with solid momentum in both developed and emerging markets. Specifically in developed markets, during the year, we gained incremental market penetration, driven by continued success of products that are early in their life cycles, including Prevnar 13 in adults, IBRANCE, Eliquis, Xeljanz. And we still saw steady growth from key in-line products in 2015, specifically Lyrica in markets where it remains patent protected. 
And during the year, in Emerging Markets, we saw operational revenue growth, primarily due to the performance of Prevnar, LIPITOR and Enbrel as well as from the addition of legacy Hospira products. 
The integration of the Hospira business into Pfizer Global Established Pharma business is on track, and we look forward to this business being an attractive potential growth driver. This acquisition is indeed proving to be an excellent strategic fit, and we're seeing the expected value contribution to our GEP business that we anticipated. 
Frank will speak to our 2016 guidance in a moment. We expect to deliver operational revenue growth in 2016. Our key growth drivers will continue to be IBRANCE, Eliquis and Xeljanz. And we believe that Prevnar Adult global revenues will be comparable to the strong results we achieved in 2015. Additionally, we believe our near-term pipeline will help accelerate this ongoing growth forward. 
In looking at the year ahead, we expect our businesses will continue to execute well. They are competitively positioned within their markets and are performing strongly against their competitive set. 
Regarding the pipeline, we anticipate advancing many of our Phase III programs during the year. For bococizumab, we reported today that the first of our 6 Phase III efficacy studies achieved its primary endpoint, and we expect readouts of the remaining 5 bococizumab lipid lowering studies to be had [ph] during 2016. 
For ertugliflozin, this year, we and our partners, Merck, will begin to deliver results from our comprehensive Phase III clinical program. In 2016, the alliance expects to submit applications to regulatory approval in the U.S. for both monotherapy and 2 fixed-dose combination tablets using data from 8 clinical trials. 
For dacomitinib, we expect results in the second half of the year for Phase III study in first-line EGFR mutant non-small cell lung cancer, and we discussed our regulatory strategy with the FDA. 
For Xeljanz, in the first half of this year, we expect top line results for our Phase III program in the psoriatic arthritis. We believe Xeljanz can potentially fill a significant unmet need in the psoriatic arthritis market when nonbiologic d-mods do not have proven success and where there are currently fewer alternative for patients who have inadequate responses to anti-TNF therapy. In addition, in the first half of the year, we anticipate the decision from the FDA for our once-a-day daily Xeljanz formulation for rheumatoid arthritis, and we remain on track to refile our application for RA in EU. 
For IBRANCE, we expect to see the top line PALOMA-2 study results in first-line advanced breast cancer in combination with letrozole. And we have an April PDUFA date for second and third-line treatment for advanced breast cancer based on the PALOMA-3 data. We could also see a regulatory decision for IBRANCE in EU by year end. 
Additionally, in the Oncology business, we have a PDUFA date this year in the U.S. of Xalkori in ROS1 non-small cell lung cancer. And we expect to file for approval of inotuzumab for acute lymphoblastic leukemia in the U.S. 
And in immuno-oncology, we now have a broad portfolio of compounds that we believe has the potential to support the development of a strong, deep competitive market position. We now have 5 immuno-oncology assets in the clinic and expect to have up to 10 in the clinic by the end of 2016. As a result of our partnership with Merck KGaA, as of the end of 2015, we had 28 ongoing clinical development programs for avelumab, with 7 of them being pivotal registrational studies. We anticipate some of these studies will give us potential registration to -- in areas like Merkel cell, ovarian, bladder, gastric and lung cancer. Of these 7 studies, we expect to present data in Merkel cell this year and to see data from the other tumor types in the following 2 years. 
And we continue to believe that the winners in this space will be those who have a breadth of portfolio, assets to support rational combinations. We have a range of assets to combine with avelumab when compared to other companies' assets. And we have already initiated 6 combination studies with avelumab. In 2016, we expect to see data from 4-1BB in combination with KEYTRUDA and in combination with avelumab in various tumors. 4-1BB in combination with rituximab in lymphoma. A combination of lorlatinib, our next generation ALK inhibitor, with avelumab in ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer. And data from Inlyta with avelumab in renal cell carcinoma. Finally, we may see data from OX40 as a single agent this year. Taking of all of this into account, we believe we're well on our way to being a leading player in this space. 
And now a few comments about our proposed combination with Allergan. We're excited about bringing 2 great companies together that have a strong strategic fit. The transaction is about accelerating growth potential in our Innovative businesses and strengthening our Established business and more efficiently allocating our capital around the world. We are confident that we are taking the appropriate steps so that we can achieve the key milestones needed to complete the transaction and continue to expect close in the second half of 2016. 
Since the announcement, we have been working closely with Brent Saunders and his team at Allergan and have been delighted by the engagement and report is [ph] occurring. We see a number of potential opportunities after closing as we continue to learn more about each other's portfolio. For example, we see complementarity in inflammation and gastroenterology. And we have a -- we want to have a broader presence in cardiovascular disease with Eliquis in bystolic. In neuroscience, Allergan's work in Alzheimer's, schizophrenia and major depressive orders will be highly complementary to Pfizer's promising early work in such areas as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. When you look at over the next few years, we expect both companies will continue -- contribute, sorry, several potential new drugs to launch. We also continue to be excited about the international potential. 
And by coming together, we're enhancing category leadership throughout our complementary in-line portfolio and a combined pipeline of great late-stage and mid-stage assets across each of our key therapeutic areas. Both companies bring a great deal of scientific and product expertise to the proposed combination and a shared philosophy in our approach to research and development.
Upon the close of the transaction, the combined company will be an influential player in the industry with a comparative product portfolio with several leadership positions, robust pipeline, compelling capital structure and financial position and aligned cultures that are based on ownership and entrepreneurial spirit, creating shareholder value and meeting patients' needs. This combination is about investing in our business. It's about accelerating our existing strategy while preserving our options with putting the company into an Innovative business and an Established Business if we determine that is the best way to unlock the most value for our shareholders. 
By the end of the current quarter, our integration teams will be fully engaged, and we anticipate announcing post-closing leadership positions. Throughout the year, we'll continue to keep you updated on our progress. 
In summary, we are looking at a year ahead. We have a sound strategy and a strong business. Our outlook and financial guidance for the year takes into account the benefit of anticipated positive organic growth from key products as well as the impact from foreign exchange. We have a solid portfolio of market-leading in-line products, a healthy pipeline. We expect to further strengthen the growth potential of the business with the pending addition of Allergan.

162270,320188641,924804,"Pfizer Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2016",2016-02-02,"Earnings Calls","Pfizer Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ian. Good day, everyone. As always, the charts we're reviewing today are included in our webcast. As a reminder, because we completed the acquisition of Hospira on September 3, 2015, Pfizer's full year financial results for the year ended December",1741,"Thanks, Ian. Good day, everyone. As always, the charts we're reviewing today are included in our webcast. As a reminder, because we completed the acquisition of Hospira on September 3, 2015, Pfizer's full year financial results for the year ended December 31, 2015, include 4 months of legacy Hospira U.S. operations and 3 months of legacy Hospira international operations. Financial results for the fourth quarter 2015 include 3 months of legacy Hospira global operations. By comparison, financial results for full year and fourth quarter 2014 do not include any contribution from legacy Hospira operations. 
Now moving on to the financials. Fourth quarter 2015 reported revenues were approximately $14 billion and reflect year-over-year operational growth of $1.9 billion or 14%, mainly driven by the addition of legacy Hospira operations, the continued strong performance of products that are early in their life cycles such as Prevnar 13 Adult, IBRANCE, Eliquis and Xeljanz, Lyrica primarily in the U.S. and 5% operational growth in Emerging Markets, mainly from legacy Hospira operations, Prevnar 13 and certain other products. 
Reported revenues continued to be unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of $934 million or 7%. Excluding the inclusion of legacy Hospira operations of $1.2 billion, the negative impact of foreign exchange and to a much lesser extent the inclusion of $35 million of revenues associated with vaccines acquired from Baxter, Pfizer stand-alone achieved operational growth of $646 million or 5%, while at the same time, absorbing a $720 million negative operational impact from product losses of exclusivity. 
Fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS was $0.53 versus $0.54 in the year-ago quarter. The decrease is primarily due to an aggregate operational increase in adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses and adjusted R&D expenses of $1.8 billion or 21%, $0.07 due to foreign exchange and the continued product losses of exclusivity in certain geographies. These were partially offset by revenue growth of certain new in-line and acquired products, a lower effective tax rate and fewer diluted weighted average shares outstanding, which declined by 125 million shares versus the year-ago quarter due to our share repurchase program, which includes the impact over our $5 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement executed in February 2015 and completed in July. 
Reported diluted EPS was $0.10 compared with $0.19 in the year-ago quarter due to the previously mentioned factors and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency losses related to Venezuela, increased purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition-related cost, restructuring charges and asset impairment charges versus the prior year quarter and nonrecurring charges related to pension settlements, which were partially offset by the nonrecurrence of a charge associated with the global strategic alliance formed with Merck KGaA in November 2014 to jointly develop and commercialize avelumab, lower charges for certain legal matters and a lower effective tax rate.
Foreign exchange negatively impacted fourth quarter reported revenues by approximately $934 million or 7% and positively impacted adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses and adjusted R&D expenses in the aggregate by $435 million or 5%. As a result, foreign exchange negatively impacted fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS by approximately $0.07 compared with the year-ago quarter.
Now moving on to the financial highlights of our business segments. In the fourth quarter, Global Innovative Pharmaceutical revenues increased 10% operationally year-over-year due to the strong performance of recently launched products, including Eliquis globally and Xeljanz in the U.S. and the strong performance of Lyrica in the U.S. and Japan. Income before taxes increased 17% operationally due to the increase in revenues and a 5% operational decrease in cost of sales. 
Cost of sales as a percentage of revenue decreased 1.7 percentage points operationally because of lower royalty expenses and increased alliance revenues with no associated cost of sales. IBT was unfavorably impacted by a 4% operational increase and SI&A expenses as a result of additional investment in Eliquis, Xeljanz and CHANTIX and 11% operational increase in R&D, reflecting investments in our late-stage pipeline, primarily for bococizumab and tanezumab.
Fourth quarter VOC revenues increased 38% operationally, reflecting operational revenue growth in each business. Global Vaccine revenues grew 53% operationally, driven by 102% increase of Prevnar 13 U.S. revenues due to strong uptake among adults. Global Oncology revenues grew 61% operationally, driven by IBRANCE in the U.S. and to a lesser extent by Sutent and Xalkori globally. And Consumer Healthcare revenues grew 4% operationally due to Nexium 24HR in the U.S. 
Income before taxes increased 33% operationally, mainly due to increased revenues on an associated improvement in gross margin, which were partially offset by a 66% operational increase and SI&A expenses as a result of higher promotional expenses in the U.S. for newly launched Consumer Healthcare products, IBRANCE and Prevnar 13 Adult. And the 46% operational increase in R&D expenses due to increased cost associated with our oncology programs, primarily our alliance with Merck KGaA and IBRANCE. 
Fourth quarter Global Established Pharmaceutical revenues increased 5% operationally, mainly due to the previously mentioned inclusion of legacy Hospira revenues contributing $1.2 billion, which was partially offset by the loss of exclusivity and generic competition for Celebrex in the U.S. and certain other developed markets, Lyrica in most developed markets in Europe and Zyvox in the U.S. 
Emerging Market revenues were flat operationally, which reflected the positive impact of the inclusion of legacy Hospira operations and continued strong growth in China, offset by declines in certain markets in the Middle East. 
Income before taxes declined 12% operationally, reflecting the unfavorable impact of a 4.7 percentage point operational increase in cost of sales as a percentage of revenues due to the inclusion of Hospira operations and the impact of losses of exclusivity. A 24% operational increase in SI&A expenses, driven in part by the addition of Hospira operations and the 53% operational increase in R&D expenses due to an increased legacy Hospira development programs. 
We exceeded to the top of our guidance range and expectations for 2015 reported revenues by approximately $400 million. Adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenues was 18.5% versus 18.7%, at the low end of our guidance range due to increased alliance revenues and sales volumes. And we exceeded our expectation for our effective tax rate on adjusted income as a result of a favorable change in our jurisdictional mix of earnings. We met our expectations for adjusted R&D expenses and achieved the top end of our adjusted diluted EPS. Adjusted SI&A expenses of $14.3 billion were higher than our guidance range due to increased expenses for recently launched products, such as Prevnar 13 Adult and IBRANCE, other in-line products and certain Consumer Healthcare brands.
We recorded adjusted other income of $409 million versus our expectation of approximately $500 million. Finally, reported diluted EPS was $1.24 versus our expected range of $1.37 to $1.43, mainly as a result of increased purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition-related cost and restructuring charges primarily related to the acquisition of Hospira, the negative impact of foreign currency losses related to Venezuela and nonrecurring charges related to pension settlements. 
Now I'd like to walk you through the 2016 guidance ranges for reported revenues, reported diluted EPS and adjusted diluted EPS relative to our 2015 actual results. First, it's important to note that our 2016 financial guidance excludes the impact of our pending combination with Allergan. 
Our 2016 reported revenue guidance range reflects anticipated strong growth of certain new, in-line and acquired products that is partially offset by an anticipated $2.3 billion negative impact due to continuing product losses of exclusivity. I want to point out that within this range and consistent with our previous comments, we expect full year Prevnar 13 Adult global revenues to be comparable with its full year 2015 global revenue level. We expect adverse changes in foreign exchange based on mid-January 2016 rates relative to the U.S. dollar compared with actual foreign exchange rates in 2015 to have an additional $2.3 billion negative impact on reported revenues, including an estimated $800 million negative currency impact related to Venezuela. Consequently, we expect 2016 reported revenues to be in the range of $49 billion to $51 billion. 
Reported diluted EPS and adjusted diluted EPS guidance also include the negative impact from product losses of exclusivity as well as an expected $0.09 negative impact from foreign exchange rates and the $0.07 negative currency impact related to Venezuela. As a result, we expect reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.54 to $1.67 and adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.20 to $2.30. 
In addition, I want to remind everyone that guidance ranges for both reported and adjusted diluted EPS incorporate $5 billion of anticipated share repurchases in 2016, which consists of our previously announced intention to execute a $5 billion accelerated share repurchase program in the first half of 2016. These repurchases are expected to more than offset the potential dilution related to employee compensation programs. In summary, if you exclude anticipated foreign change impacts, including the negative currency impact related to Venezuela, full year 2016 revenue and adjusted EPS guidance midpoints are 7% and 10% greater than actual full year 2015 levels, respectively. The remaining elements of our 2016 financial guidance are set forth on this chart.
Now moving on to key takeaways. We had a very strong financial performance in 2015, and we achieved operational revenue growth every quarter, including 14% operational growth in the fourth quarter. For the full year 2015, we achieved the 6% operational revenue growth that was mainly driven by new products that are early in their life cycles, and we achieved this growth despite a $3.2 billion negative impact from product losses of exclusivity. Our full year 2016 reported revenue guidance range of $49 billion to $51 billion absorbs a $4.6 billion combined negative impact of product losses of exclusivity, adverse changes in foreign exchange rates and the negative currency impact related to Venezuela. And the adjusted diluted EPS guidance range includes an anticipated $0.16 negative impact from foreign exchange, including Venezuela. 
We announced our proposed combination with Allergan and continue to expect the transaction to close in the second half of 2016. And we continue to create shareholder value through prudent capital allocation. In 2015, we returned $13.1 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And we expect to execute a $5 billion accelerated share repurchase program in the first half of 2016. Finally, we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2016 and beyond. 
Now I'll turn it back to Chuck."

In the U.S., obviously, we have done an excellent job with a catch-up opportunity. We have achieved 86% market share, 92% at retailers. We have 90% awardness [ph] of the recommendation at healthcare practitioner. And as a result of the 45 million adults eligible at the time of recommendation for vaccination, we have already captured about 1/3 of them. Now while many adults remain, this cohort is more difficult to capture as the low-hanging fruit is gone. It will require more innovative strategies, but we all have in place. But even if we assume a similar or higher penetration rate this year, it would be on a much smaller pool of adults. However, we expect this would be mitigated by Europe, which has a very different growth profile. Even with prices lower than U.S., the demographics are very favorable with a much larger eligible population. And we have already received pneumonia on our label in 2015, and we are working to obtain broad recommendations, and following that, reimbursement from the authorities. Now this will be phased likely over a 2 years window period, because in Europe, this is done country-by-country, and sometimes, region by region within the same country. But all in all, we expect very strong growth in Europe next year. Now let me move on IBRANCE and to your question about competition on particularly Lilly's drug. Look, Lilly's drug, while in the same class, is for an syndicate indication. The refractory patient population for which they have received breakthrough designation is a very small population with few options available. In fact, the average refractory patient undergoes 7 lines of treatment. So it's a -- they are in high need. Now speaking generally on competition, there is only limited clinical data on the public domain, and we need to see more efficacy and safety data to make comparisons. What I can tell you is about our strategic position. We are the only company with a registered product in U.S. and 6 other countries and then accepted file in Europe, where we may obtain registration as early as next year. We have very good clinical experience with the product. IBRANCE has been prescribed by 5,000 physicians in more than 20,000 patients. And so far, feedback is very positive, particularly on patients' quality of life. We are having a very heavy clinical program. We have 2 pivotal studies in first-line metastatic breast cancer, 2 studies in recurrent metastatic breast cancer and 3 in early breast cancer, PENELOPE-B, PALLAS and PEARL. IBRANCE is part of 88 investigational MCIT [ph] trials, approximately 15 breast cancer and 38 in other tumor types. So as you can see, we are investing heavily to stay ahead of the competition."

So I'll do the cost of sales. The reciprocal obviously is gross margin. We guided for next year cost of sales number of 21% to 22%. So if you take the midpoint of that 21% to 22%, just to make the math easy, that's 21.5% from our 18.5%, that's a 3%, 300 basis point increase in our cost of sales as a percentage of revenues. By the way, that's being driven by a few factors, but one of which clearly is Hospira. In terms of -- I think your question, which is why it wasn't even more, I think the answer is, our ongoing productivity and cost reduction initiatives. When you think about our factories, our manufacturing capabilities, we really manage that from a cost perspective. First of all, we focus that on quality, service and cost. If you think about that as a triangle, quality is at the top of the triangle, but there's 4 major buckets, right. There's the number of facilities. There's the numerous quality initiatives we have within each facility. There's the purchasing that we can get from a leverage perspective. And then finally, there's the center cost that resides outside of the factories. We manage all 4 of those very aggressively to basically -- to manage our cost structure and manufacturing. But that gives you a feel for what the numbers were and why they are what they are."

It's a growing market. It's somewhere between $50 billion to $70 billion currently globally. And one of the sort of features of that market is it's very concentrated, particularly in the U.S., but also in a few ex- U.S. markets, such as Western Europe and particularly China. So one of the things that we are very focused on is going to be revenue synergy. We obviously have a strong commercial presence in China and also in the hospital segment in developed Europe and emerging Europe. So essentially, the lag time since September, when we closed this transaction, we've been focused really on making sure that we have our blocking and tackling in place to be very systematic with our highest value molecules that really sort of meet market needs most appropriately to be very focused on registering and bringing those molecules to market. So -- and the biggest opportunity that we have in China, that is going to take time, as you are very well aware. Drug lag in China is a significant issue, but we're very encouraged by the progress that the CFDA are making to accelerate access to important new medicines in China. But that will take time. But we do see opportunities both in the short term as well as medium and long term to deliver significant growth ex U.S. through the sterile injectable business and the combination of Hospira's portfolio into our commercial footprint."

Just back on this whole breakup thesis and the timing, I think investors initially were disappointed by the timing that you laid out at the time that you announced the Allergan deal. I think you said you would make a decision by the end of 2018. And just want to put out there that the stock has pulled back quite a bit since you announced the Allergan deal. And I would think despite clearly the market is excited about this. But I would think that, that would --  the difference in that even growing gap in valuation between where your stock in -- is in an SOTP should help you to accelerate your decision to move in that direction. And if you could just comment on that, please. And then just thirdly on revenue growth. I mean, clearly there have been tons of pushes and pulls in your numbers, mostly currency and patent expirations. Can you remind us when you expect, and this excludes the acquisition from Allergan, but when you expect your reported revenue growth? Just talk about operationally revenue growth. When we should start to see a positive inflection point? Because it has -- when I look at my models, revenues have been in decline for many years, and some of that's divestitures and spins. But really since 2013, we've had revenue sort of flat to down. When is that going to change, and what's going to drive that change just talking from Pfizer standpoint?"

We expect it to be flat, and that's because we had a huge growth from adult vaccine in '15 and will hold that franchise. We want to grow it again. We'll have good growth from our in-line products and our newly launched products. We still deal with a couple of billion of LOEs. So I think you can begin to see, as we launch -- as we begin to get more traction with more clinical trials in IBRANCE, as we begin to see ertugliflozin launch, as we begin to see our next wave of products get approved, you'll see us returning to a very robust growth. But obviously, Jami, one of the reasons of doing the Allergan deal was in fact to ensure that we had robust growth in our Innovative Business. So we're aware of that issue. Now this is the breakup timing. Number one, I'd point out that while the stock is down, I don't think it's specifically down more than the DRG. In fact, I think it's roughly the same as the DRG. And in fact, given the OB pressure that one would expect in the stock, I'm actually -- well, never like to see the stock go down, it certainly was expected to come under pressure from the OB community. Now the breakup timing is an issue of we are focused on integrating this company and the 2 companies together, and we have laid out the 4 questions that we need to answer. And I think any shareholder would want those questions answered. So can we run the businesses successfully inside Pfizer? And the -- and we bought Hospira. You've seeing the sterile injectables. You've got the biosimilars. You're beginning to see, if you strip out the LOEs, a stabilization of the core business, which we expect to return to growth. But that being said, we can run it well inside Pfizer. Can it be run better outside Pfizer? Is there trapped value and can we unlock the trapped value in a tax efficient manner? And these are very serious questions. These are very large companies. And I think that by innovating, we will be well positioned to make that decision in the best interest of our shareholders, and frankly, don't particular see a way of short-circuiting that just because of the amount of work that has to be done in integration and getting the transaction of Allergan right. I do understand your wish for more speedy decision, but I think we're taking the right approach for shareholder value here."

Two things. First, I want to just to point out that abemaciclib is somewhat different from palbo and Novartis CDK drug in that it seems to be less selective and has a different adverse event profile, likely due to hitting multiple CDKs, particularly being reported significant GI issues. So it's a different profile. And we, as Albert very well pointed out, have been extremely pleased with the favorable profile that allow patients to benefit from IBRANCE with very good tolerability. Now you asked about this late-stage population studies by  abemaciclib and how that population in the future will evolve. We anticipate, as IBRANCE is having a very nice uptick in the marketplace in first-line metastatic and some -- also more advanced lines, and hopefully, with a PALOMA-3 approval, IBRANCE is likely to be used in multiple lines. Hence, monotherapy with another CDK will, of course, have the potential to face the patient population that have seen a CDK inhibitor. And that's why we are developing a strategy for how we can see patients benefit from a drug like IBRANCE at various stages with different antihormonals and we're also now starting IBRANCE in triple therapy. So I think you can see that multiple drugs is likely to be the preferred as patients become more advanced."

And it seems that generic exposure and currency cannot be the explanations, because the predictive $4.6 billion hurdle in 2016 from these factors is well less than the $6 billion plus predicted in 2015 at this time last year. So actually, the comparison on generic exposure on currency is improving and more than offset the year-over-year increase in Prevnar. So any thoughts on that would be appreciated.

Just we'll use the midpoint. If you take $50.3 billion, compare that to the 48.9 that we printed in 2015, all now at the same foreign exchange, so purely operational, that's an increase of about $3.5 billion. We said -- Ian said when he answered Jami's question that revenue excluding Hospira, on a year-over-year basis, was essentially flat operationally while absorbing $2.3 billion in LOEs for 2016. The other data point I think that help you answer the question is, remember, we did $1.5 billion in Hospira sales this year. So when we say that the bulk of the growth is from Hospira, you understand it's incremental growth on top of the $1.5 billion that we printed in 2015.

I think you indicated you wanted to have that filed before the end of the year. Just any update on what Europe is looking for within that filing to secure approval in Europe? And then on psoriasis in the U.S., any developments there and on the modified release from a regulatory standpoint? And then obviously, with Enbrel seeing generic competition, what have you done with your infrastructure in Europe to still keep some infrastructure in place to support Xeljanz if and when it gets approved?"

Significant reductions at both companies, I think, efficiently run companies. Two, not a lot of therapeutic area overlap, which is obviously a kind of a trigger for synergy opportunities. Third, if you look at the Allergan cost of goods sold, 2/3 of that, from my perspective, from a synergy perspective, was unaddressable as they ran the business and then royalties. So really not a lot we could do there. But all that said and done, we are working now with the Allergan teams with Brent, with Bob Stewart, with Tessa, Ian, myself, our leadership team here at Pfizer, we've already launched a couple of operational teams. And we're starting to dig into these in much more detail. If there's more there, please know we're going to get it, and we'll tell you about it. So I think, on a synergy front, just more to come."

In terms of what we did on buybacks, we try to provide information when we announced the deal to give you all the data you needed, so that when you connected the dots, you coul model what the buyback numbers would be, right? So we started out with the accretion dilution. We said neutral in year 1, modestly accretive in year 2, more than 10% in year 3 and then high teens in year 4. We gave what the beginning share count number of the combined company would be, it was 10.6 billion shares. We said we have 5.9 billion in Allergan, we have 4.7 billion. And then we gave the tax rate, which was 17% to 18%. So with those data points, we thought we provided the information that you needed in order to model what the buybacks would be. And then just to the 2.5 to 3, clearly, there could be some extra juice if we took the leverage ratio up to that level."

We finished 2015 with strong financial and operational performance. For the full year, we exceeded our 2015 revenue guidance and met the top end of our adjusted diluted EPS guidance. Excuse me. And we achieved",1507,"Thank you, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. We finished 2015 with strong financial and operational performance. For the full year, we exceeded our 2015 revenue guidance and met the top end of our adjusted diluted EPS guidance. Excuse me. And we achieved our first year of operational revenue growth in 5 years. Frank will take you through the numbers. Before he does, I have a few brief comments about what is driving our performance, some thoughts regarding where we expect to see pipeline advancements during the year, and I'll close with a few comments about Allergan. 
Throughout the year and especially in the fourth quarter, our business executed flawlessly despite a challenging operational environment. We ended 2015 with solid momentum in both developed and emerging markets. Specifically in developed markets, during the year, we gained incremental market penetration, driven by continued success of products that are early in their life cycles, including Prevnar 13 in adults, IBRANCE, Eliquis, Xeljanz. And we still saw steady growth from key in-line products in 2015, specifically Lyrica in markets where it remains patent protected. 
And during the year, in Emerging Markets, we saw operational revenue growth, primarily due to the performance of Prevnar, LIPITOR and Enbrel as well as from the addition of legacy Hospira products. 
The integration of the Hospira business into Pfizer Global Established Pharma business is on track, and we look forward to this business being an attractive potential growth driver. This acquisition is indeed proving to be an excellent strategic fit, and we're seeing the expected value contribution to our GEP business that we anticipated. 
Frank will speak to our 2016 guidance in a moment. We expect to deliver operational revenue growth in 2016. Our key growth drivers will continue to be IBRANCE, Eliquis and Xeljanz. And we believe that Prevnar Adult global revenues will be comparable to the strong results we achieved in 2015. Additionally, we believe our near-term pipeline will help accelerate this ongoing growth forward. 
In looking at the year ahead, we expect our businesses will continue to execute well. They are competitively positioned within their markets and are performing strongly against their competitive set. 
Regarding the pipeline, we anticipate advancing many of our Phase III programs during the year. For bococizumab, we reported today that the first of our 6 Phase III efficacy studies achieved its primary endpoint, and we expect readouts of the remaining 5 bococizumab lipid lowering studies to end during 2016. 
For ertugliflozin, this year, we and our partners, Merck, will begin to deliver results from our comprehensive Phase III clinical program. In 2016, the alliance expects to submit applications to regulatory approval in the U.S. for both monotherapy and 2 fixed-dose combination tablets using data from 8 clinical trials. 
For dacomitinib, we expect results in the second half of the year for Phase III study in first-line EGFR mutant non-small cell lung cancer, and we discussed our regulatory strategy with the FDA. 
For Xeljanz, in the first half of this year, we expect top line results for our Phase III program in psoriatic arthritis. We believe Xeljanz can potentially fill a significant unmet need in the psoriatic arthritis market when nonbiologic d-mods do not have proven success and where there are currently fewer alternative for patients who have inadequate responses to anti-TNF therapy. In addition, in the first half of the year, we anticipate the decision from the FDA for our once-a-day daily Xeljanz formulation for rheumatoid arthritis, and we remain on track to refile our application for RA in EU. 
For IBRANCE, we expect to see the top line PALOMA-2 study results in first-line advanced breast cancer in combination with letrozole. And we have an April PDUFA date for second and third-line treatment for advanced breast cancer based on the PALOMA-3 data. We could also see a regulatory decision for IBRANCE in EU by year end. 
Additionally, in the Oncology business, we have a PDUFA date this year in the U.S. of Xalkori in ROS1 non-small cell lung cancer. And we expect to file for approval of inotuzumab for acute lymphoblastic leukemia in the U.S. 
And in immuno-oncology, we now have a broad portfolio of compounds that we believe has the potential to support the development of a strong, deep competitive market position. We now have 5 immuno-oncology assets in the clinic and expect to have up to 10 in the clinic by the end of 2016. As a result of our partnership with Merck KGaA, as of the end of 2015, we had 28 ongoing clinical development programs for avelumab, with 7 of them being pivotal registrational studies. We anticipate some of these studies will give us potential registration to -- in areas like Merkel cell, ovarian, bladder, gastric and lung cancer. Of these 7 studies, we expect to present data in Merkel cell this year and to see data from the other tumor types in the following 2 years. 
And we continue to believe that the winners in this space will be those who have a breadth of portfolio, assets to support rational combinations. We have a range of assets to combine with avelumab when compared to other companies' assets. And we have already initiated 6 combination studies with avelumab. In 2016, we expect to see data from 4-1BB in combination with KEYTRUDA and in combination with avelumab in various tumors. 4-1BB in combination with rituximab in lymphoma. A combination of lorlatinib, our next generation ALK inhibitor, with avelumab in ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer. And data from Inlyta with avelumab in renal cell carcinoma. Finally, we may see data from OX40 as a single agent this year. Taking up all of this into account, we believe we're well on our way to being a leading player in this space. 
And now a few comments about our proposed combination with Allergan. We're excited about bringing 2 great companies together that have a strong strategic fit. The transaction is about accelerating growth potential in our Innovative businesses and strengthening our Established business and more efficiently allocating our capital around the world. We are confident that we are taking appropriate steps so that we can achieve the key milestones needed to complete the transaction and continue to expect close in the second half of 2016. 
Since the announcement, we have been working closely with Brent Saunders and his team at Allergan and have been delighted by the engagement and rapport that is occurring. We see a number of potential opportunities after closing as we continue to learn more about each other's portfolio. For example, we see complementarity in inflammation and gastroenterology. And we have a -- we want to have a broader presence in cardiovascular disease with Eliquis in bystolic. In neuroscience, Allergan's work in Alzheimer's, schizophrenia and major depressive orders will be highly complementary to Pfizer's promising early work in such areas as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. When you look out over the next few years, we expect both companies will continue -- contribute, sorry, several potential new drugs to launch. We also continue to be excited about the international potential. 
And by coming together, we're enhancing category leadership throughout our complementary in-line portfolio and a combined pipeline with great late-stage and mid-stage assets across each of our key therapeutic areas. Both companies bring a great deal of scientific and product expertise to the proposed combination and a shared philosophy in our approach to research and development.
Upon the close of the transaction, the combined company will be an influential player in the industry with a comparative product portfolio with several leadership positions, robust pipeline, compelling capital structure and financial position and aligned cultures that are based on ownership and entrepreneurial spirit, creating shareholder value and meeting patients' needs. This combination is about investing in our business. It's about accelerating our existing strategy while preserving our options as putting the company into an Innovative business and an Established Business if we determine that is the best way to unlock the most value for our shareholders. 
By the end of the current quarter, our integration teams will be fully engaged, and we anticipate announcing post-closing leadership positions. Throughout the year, we will continue to keep you updated on our progress. 
In summary, we are looking at year ahead. We have a sound strategy and a strong business. Our outlook and financial guidance for the year takes into account the benefit of anticipated positive organic growth from key products as well as the impact from foreign exchange. We have a solid portfolio of market-leading in-line products, a healthy pipeline. We expect to further strengthen the growth potential of business with the pending addition of Allergan. We will continue to have the means by which we can create value for our shareholders and bring innovative medicines to patients by producing expected topline growth, progressing key pipeline assets, pursuing strategic business development and returning capital to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. 
Now I'll turn it over to Frank for additional details on the quarter and our 2016 financial guidance."

As always, the charts we're reviewing today are included in our webcast. As a reminder, because we completed the acquisition of Hospira on September 3, 2015, Pfizer's full year financial results for the year ended December",1740,"Thanks, Ian. Good day, everyone. As always, the charts we're reviewing today are included in our webcast. As a reminder, because we completed the acquisition of Hospira on September 3, 2015, Pfizer's full year financial results for the year ended December 31, 2015, include 4 months of legacy Hospira U.S. operations and 3 months of legacy Hospira international operations. Financial results for the fourth quarter 2015 include 3 months of legacy Hospira global operations. By comparison, financial results for full year and fourth quarter 2014 do not include any contribution from legacy Hospira operations. 
Now moving on to the financials. Fourth quarter 2015 reported revenues were approximately $14 billion and reflect year-over-year operational growth of $1.9 billion or 14%, mainly driven by the addition of legacy Hospira operations, the continued strong performance of products that are early in their life cycles such as Prevnar 13 Adult, IBRANCE, Eliquis and Xeljanz, Lyrica primarily in the U.S. and 5% operational growth in Emerging Markets, mainly from legacy Hospira operations, Prevnar 13 and certain other products. 
Reported revenues continued to be unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of $934 million or 7%. Excluding the inclusion of legacy Hospira operations of $1.2 billion, the negative impact of foreign exchange and to a much lesser extent the inclusion of $35 million of revenues associated with vaccines acquired from Baxter, Pfizer stand-alone achieved operational growth of $646 million or 5%, while at the same time, absorbing a $720 million negative operational impact from product losses of exclusivity. 
Fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS was $0.53 versus $0.54 in the year-ago quarter. The decrease is primarily due to an aggregate operational increase in adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses and adjusted R&D expenses of $1.8 billion or 21%, $0.07 due to foreign exchange and the continued product losses of exclusivity in certain geographies. These were partially offset by revenue growth of certain new in-line and acquired products, a lower effective tax rate and fewer diluted weighted average shares outstanding, which declined by 125 million shares versus the year-ago quarter due to our share repurchase program, which includes the impact over our $5 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement executed in February 2015 and completed in July. 
Reported diluted EPS was $0.10 compared with $0.19 in the year-ago quarter due to the previously mentioned factors and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency losses related to Venezuela, increased purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition-related cost, restructuring charges and asset impairment charges versus the prior year quarter and nonrecurring charges related to pension settlements, which were partially offset by the nonrecurrence of a charge associated with the global strategic alliance formed with Merck KGaA in November 2014 to jointly develop and commercialize avelumab, lower charges for certain legal matters and a lower effective tax rate.
Foreign exchange negatively impacted fourth quarter reported revenues by approximately $934 million or 7% and positively impacted adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses and adjusted R&D expenses in the aggregate by $435 million or 5%. As a result, foreign exchange negatively impacted fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS by approximately $0.07 compared with the year-ago quarter.
Now moving on to the financial highlights of our business segments. In the fourth quarter, Global Innovative Pharmaceutical revenues increased 10% operationally year-over-year due to the strong performance of recently launched products, including Eliquis globally and Xeljanz in the U.S. and the strong performance of Lyrica in the U.S. and Japan. Income before taxes increased 17% operationally due to the increase in revenues and a 5% operational decrease in cost of sales. 
Cost of sales as a percentage of revenue decreased 1.7 percentage points operationally because of lower royalty expenses and increased alliance revenues with no associated cost of sales. IBT was unfavorably impacted by a 4% operational increase and SI&A expenses as a result of additional investment in Eliquis, Xeljanz and Chantix and 11% operational increase in R&D, reflecting investments in our late-stage pipeline, primarily for bococizumab and tanezumab.
Fourth quarter VOC revenues increased 38% operationally, reflecting operational revenue growth in each business. Global Vaccine revenues grew 53% operationally, driven by a 102% increase of Prevnar 13 U.S. revenues due to strong uptake among adults. Global Oncology revenues grew 61% operationally, driven by IBRANCE in the U.S. and to a lesser extent by Sutent and Xalkori globally. And Consumer Healthcare revenues grew 4% operationally due to Nexium 24HR in the U.S. 
Income before taxes increased 33% operationally, mainly due to increased revenues on an associated improvement in gross margin, which were partially offset by a 66% operational increase in SI&A expenses as a result of higher promotional expenses in the U.S. for newly launched Consumer Healthcare products, IBRANCE and Prevnar 13 Adult. And the 46% operational increase in R&D expenses due to increased cost associated with our oncology programs, primarily our alliance with Merck KGaA and IBRANCE. 
Fourth quarter Global Established Pharmaceutical revenues increased 5% operationally, mainly due to the previously mentioned inclusion of legacy Hospira revenues contributing $1.2 billion, which was partially offset by the loss of exclusivity and generic competition for Celebrex in the U.S. and certain other developed markets, Lyrica in most developed markets in Europe and Zyvox in the U.S. 
Emerging Market revenues were flat operationally, which reflected the positive impact of the inclusion of legacy Hospira operations and continued strong growth in China, offset by declines in certain markets in the Middle East. 
Income before taxes declined 12% operationally, reflecting the unfavorable impact of a 4.7 percentage point operational increase in cost of sales as a percentage of revenues due to the inclusion of Hospira operations and the impact of losses of exclusivity. A 24% operational increase in SI&A expenses, driven in part by the addition of Hospira operations and the 53% operational increase in R&D expenses due to an increased legacy Hospira development programs. 
We exceeded to the top of our guidance range expectations for 2015 reported revenues by approximately $400 million. Adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenues was 18.5% versus 18.7% at the low end of our guidance range due to increased alliance revenues and sales volumes. And we exceeded our expectation for our effective tax rate on adjusted income as a result of a favorable change in our jurisdictional mix of earnings. We met our expectations for adjusted R&D expenses and achieved the top end of our adjusted diluted EPS. Adjusted SI&A expenses of $14.3 billion were higher than our guidance range due to increased expenses for recently launched products, such as Prevnar 13 Adult and IBRANCE, other in-line products and certain Consumer Healthcare brands.
We recorded adjusted other income of $409 million versus our expectation of approximately $500 million. Finally, reported diluted EPS was $1.24 versus our expected range of $1.37 to $1.43, mainly as a result of increased purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition-related cost and restructuring charges primarily related to the acquisition of Hospira, the negative impact of foreign currency losses related to Venezuela and nonrecurring charges related to pension settlements. 
Now I'd like to walk you through the 2016 guidance ranges for reported revenues, reported diluted EPS and adjusted diluted EPS relative to our 2015 actual results. First, it's important to note that our 2016 financial guidance excludes the impact of our pending combination with Allergan. 
Our 2016 reported revenue guidance range reflects anticipated strong growth of certain new, in-line and acquired products that is partially offset by an anticipated $2.3 billion negative impact due to continuing product losses of exclusivity. I want to point out that within this range and consistent with our previous comments, we expect full year Prevnar 13 Adult global revenues to be comparable with its full year 2015 global revenue level. We expect adverse changes in foreign exchange based on mid-January 2016 rates relative to the U.S. dollar compared with actual foreign exchange rates from 2015 to have an additional $2.3 billion negative impact on reported revenues, including an estimated $800 million negative currency impact related to Venezuela. Consequently, we expect 2016 reported revenues to be in the range of $49 billion to $51 billion. 
Reported diluted EPS and adjusted diluted EPS guidance also include the negative impact from product losses of exclusivity as well as an expected $0.09 negative impact from foreign exchange rates and the $0.07 negative currency impact related to Venezuela. As a result, we expect reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.54 to $1.67 and adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.20 to $2.30. 
In addition, I want to remind everyone that guidance ranges for both reported and adjusted diluted EPS incorporate $5 billion of anticipated share repurchases in 2016, which consists of our previously announced intention to execute a $5 billion accelerated share repurchase program in the first half of 2016. These repurchases are expected to more than offset the potential dilution related to employee compensation programs. In summary, if you exclude anticipated foreign exchange impacts, including the negative currency impact related to Venezuela, full year 2016 revenue and adjusted EPS guidance midpoints are 7% and 10% greater than actual full year 2015 levels, respectively. The remaining elements of our 2016 financial guidance are set forth on this chart.
Now moving on to key takeaways. We had a very strong financial performance in 2015, and we achieved operational revenue growth every quarter, including 14% operational growth in the fourth quarter. For the full year 2015, we achieved 6% operational revenue growth that was mainly driven by new products that are early in their life cycles, and we achieved this growth despite a $3.2 billion negative impact from product losses of exclusivity. Our full year 2016 reported revenue guidance range of $49 billion to $51 billion absorbs a $4.6 billion combined negative impact of product losses of exclusivity, adverse changes in foreign exchange rates and the negative currency impact related to Venezuela. And the adjusted diluted EPS guidance range includes an anticipated $0.16 negative impact from foreign exchange, including Venezuela. 
We announced our proposed combination with Allergan and continue to expect the transaction to close in the second half of 2016. And we continue to create shareholder value through prudent capital allocation. In 2015, we returned $13.1 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And we expect to execute a $5 billion accelerated share repurchase program in the first half of 2016. Finally, we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2016 and beyond. 
Now I'll turn it back to Chuck."

In the U.S., obviously, we have done an excellent job with a catch-up opportunity. We have achieved 86% market share, 92% at retailers. We have 90% awareness of the recommendation of healthcare practitioner. And as a result of the 45 million adults eligible at the time of recommendation for vaccination, we have already captured about 1/3 of them. Now while many adults remain, this cohort is more difficult to capture as the low-hanging fruit is gone. It will require more innovative strategies, but we all have in place. But even if we assume a similar or higher penetration rate this year, it would be on a much smaller pool of adults. However, we expect this would be mitigated by Europe, which has a very different growth profile. Even with prices lower than U.S., the demographics are very favorable with a much larger eligible population. And we have already received pneumonia on our label in 2015, and we are working to obtain broad recommendations, and following that, reimbursement from the authorities. Now this will be phased likely over a 2 years’ window period, because in Europe, this is done country-by-country, and sometimes, region by region within the same country. But all in all, we expect very strong growth in Europe next year. Now let me move on IBRANCE and to your question about competition on particularly Lilly's drug. Look, Lilly's drug, while in the same class, is for an syndicate [ph] indication. The refractory patient population for which they have received breakthrough designation is a very small population with few options available. In fact, the average refractory patient undergoes 7 lines of treatment. So it's a -- they are in high need. Now speaking generally on competition, there is only limited clinical data on the public domain, and we need to see more efficacy and safety data to make comparisons. What I can tell you is about our strategic position. We are the only company with a registered product in U.S. and 6 other countries and then accepted file in Europe, where we may obtain registration as early as next year. We have very good clinical experience with the product. IBRANCE has been prescribed by 5,000 physicians in more than 20,000 patients. And so far, feedback is very positive, particularly on patients' quality of life. We are having a very heavy clinical program. We have 2 pivotal studies in first-line metastatic breast cancer, 2 studies in recurrent metastatic breast cancer and 3 in early breast cancer, PENELOPE-B, PALLAS and PEARL. IBRANCE is part of 88 investigational MCIT [ph] trials, approximately 15 breast cancer and 38 in other tumor types. So as you can see, we are investing heavily to stay ahead of the competition."

By the way, that's being driven by a few factors, but one of which clearly is Hospira. In terms of -- I think your question, which is why it wasn't even more, I think the answer is, our ongoing productivity and cost reduction initiatives. When you think about our factories, our manufacturing capabilities, we really manage that from a cost perspective. First of all, we focus that on quality, service and cost. If you think about that as a triangle, quality is at the top of the triangle, but there's 4 major buckets, right. There's the number of facilities. There's the numerous quality initiatives we have within each facility. There's the purchasing that we can get from a leverage perspective. And then finally, there's the center cost that resides outside of the factories. We manage all 4 of those very aggressively to basically -- to manage our cost structure and manufacturing.

So obviously, again, we're very excited by the opportunities afforded us by the combination of our 2 businesses. And I think I've talked about biosimilars already and the opportunities we see in the marketplace. So let me just touch briefly on sterile injectables. Obviously, it's a very -- it's a large, it's a growing market. It's somewhere between $50 billion to $70 billion currently globally. And one of the set of features of that market is it's very concentrated, particularly in the U.S., but also in a few ex U.S. markets, such as Western Europe and particularly China. So one of the things that we are very focused on is going to be revenue synergy. We obviously have a strong commercial presence in China and also in the hospital segment in developed Europe and emerging Europe. So essentially, the lag time since September, when we closed this transaction, we've been focused really on making sure that we have our blocking and tackling in place to be very systematic with our highest value molecules that really sort of meet market needs most appropriately to be very focused on registering and bringing those molecules to market. So -- and the biggest opportunity that we have in China, that is going to take time, as you are very well aware. Drug lag in China is a significant issue, but we're very encouraged by the progress that the CFDA are making to accelerate access to important new medicines in China. But that will take time. But we do see opportunities both in the short term as well as medium and long term to deliver significant growth ex U.S. through the sterile injectable business and the combination of Hospira's portfolio into our commercial footprint."

I think you said you would make a decision by the end of 2018. And just want to put out there that the stock has pulled back quite a bit since you announced the Allergan deal. And I would think despite clearly the market is excited about this. But I would think that, that would -- the difference in that even growing gap in valuation between where your stock in -- is in an SOTP should help you to accelerate your decision to move in that direction. And if you could just comment on that, please. And then just thirdly on revenue growth. I mean, clearly there have been tons of pushes and pulls in your numbers, mostly currency and patent expirations. Can you remind us when you expect, and this excludes the acquisition from Allergan, but when you expect your reported revenue growth? Just talk about operationally revenue growth. When we should start to see a positive inflection point? Because it has -- when I look at my models, revenues have been in decline for many years, and some of that's divestitures and spins. But really since 2013, we've had revenue sort of flat to down. When is that going to change, and what's going to drive that change just talking from Pfizer's standpoint?"

'16, we expect it to be operationally now, right, Hospira -- we expected to be Hospira and Allergan. We expect it to be flat, and that's because we had a huge growth from adult vaccine in '15 and will hold that franchise. We won't grow it again. We'll have good growth from our in-line products and our newly launched products but we still deal with a couple of billion of LOEs. So I think you can begin to see, as we launch -- as we begin to get more traction with more clinical trials in IBRANCE, as we begin to see ertugliflozin launch, as we begin to see our next wave of products get approved, you'll see us returning to a very robust growth. But obviously, Jami, one of the reasons of doing the Allergan deal was in fact to ensure that we had robust growth in our Innovative Business. So we're aware of that issue. Now this is the breakup timing. Number one, I'd point out that while the stock is down, I don't think it's specifically down more than a DRG. In fact, I think it's roughly the same as a DRG. And in fact, given the OB pressure that one would expect in the stock, I'm actually -- well, never like to see the stock go down, it certainly was expected to come under pressure from the OB community. Now the breakup timing is an issue of we are focused on integrating this company and the 2 companies together, and we have laid out the 4 questions that we need to answer. And I think any shareholder would want those questions answered. So can we run the businesses successfully inside Pfizer? And the -- and we bought Hospira. You've seeing the sterile injectables. You've got the biosimilars. You're beginning to see, if you strip out the LOEs, a stabilization of the core business, which we expect to return to growth. But that being said, we can run it well inside Pfizer. Can it be run better outside Pfizer? Is there trapped value and can we unlock the trapped value in a tax efficient manner? And these are very serious questions. These are very large companies. And I think that by innovating, we will be well positioned to make that decision in the best interest of our shareholders, and frankly, don't particular see a way of short-circuiting that just because of the amount of work that has to be done in integration and getting the transaction of Allergan right. I do understand your wish for a more speedy decision, but I think we're taking the right approach for shareholder value here."

Two things. First, I want to just to point out that abemaciclib is somewhat different from palbo and Novartis CDK drug in that it seems to be less selective and has a different adverse event profile, likely due to hitting multiple CDKs, particularly being reported significant GI issues. So it's a different profile. And we, as Albert very well pointed out, have been extremely pleased with the favorable profile that allow patients to benefit from IBRANCE with very good tolerability. Now you asked about this late-stage population studies by abema and how that population in the future will evolve. We anticipate, as IBRANCE is having a very nice uptake in the marketplace in first-line metastatic and some -- also more advanced lines, and hopefully, with a PALOMA-3 approval, IBRANCE is likely to be used in multiple lines. Hence, monotherapy with another CDK will, of course, have the potential to face a patient population that have seen a CDK inhibitor. And that's why we are developing a strategy for how we can see patients benefit from a drug like IBRANCE at various stages with different antihormonals and we're also now starting IBRANCE in triple therapy.

Does it any way sort of maybe make more sense then to keep Pfizer as a single entity as opposed to splitting up and then needing to rebuild the commercial infrastructure for your biosimilars in those similar areas where you do have innovative products?"

First, apologies if I missed the explanation, but the 2016 guidance includes roughly an incremental $4 billion in revenue and $0.08 in earnings from Hospira, implying down to significantly down underlying sales for the legacy Pfizer and flattish to down EPS. And it seems that generic exposure and currency cannot be the explanations, because the predicted $4.6 billion hurdle in 2016 from these factors is well less than the $6 billion plus predicted in 2015 at this time last year. So actually, the comparison on generic exposure on currency is improving and more than offsets the year-over-year increase in Prevnar. So any thoughts on that would be appreciated. And one more, how should we think about the long-term outlook for Sutent, particularly given the competition from immuno-oncology agents? Do you think Sutent will soon become a declining asset?

Just first, we don't give a specific number for Hospira revenues for 2016. But that said, I believe I can still answer the question. So the way I think about this is, if you went to the midpoint of the guidance prior to foreign exchange in Venezuela, which was part of the basis of your question, the midpoint of the guidance would be $52.3 billion. Just we'll use the midpoint. If you take $50.3 billion, compare that to the $48.9 billion that we printed in 2015, all now at the same foreign exchange, so purely operational, that's an increase of about $3.5 billion. We said -- Ian said when he answered Jami's question that revenue excluding Hospira, on a year-over-year basis, was essentially flat operationally while absorbing $2.3 billion in LOEs for 2016. The other data point I think to help you answer the question is, remember, we did $1.5 billion in Hospira sales this year. So when we say that the bulk of the growth is from Hospira, you understand it's incremental growth on top of the $1.5 billion that we printed in 2015. So that's how I think -- that's how you get to the numbers we said and why we said operationally the numbers were essentially flat if you left Hospira out of the equation."

Two was, sequentially, if you think about the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, we had a lot more selling days in the quarter. So internationally, we had 6 more selling days. Domestically, we had 2 more selling days. So sequentially, Q3 of '15 to Q4 of '15, we had more selling days. So, obviously, that helps revenue, it also increases the spend on online items. And then we had -- obviously, I alluded to in my comments, increased promotional spend in many areas of the business. Now if you take that $4.6 billion and you annualize it x2 is what -- 9.2, x 2 is $18.4 billion. If you look at the guidance we gave for next year in SI&A, it's $13.2 billion to $14.2 billion. So you can't take that Q4 number and annualize it. You get to a number that's nothing close to what our guidance is for 2016.

So my question on this is, when you look at analyst models, are there particular revenue line items or products or divisions where you think consensus is too high unrelated to foreign exchange? Second question, you mentioned the 4-1BB with Merck and showing combination data with KEYTRUDA. That's Phase I data, so as such it's unblinded. I'm wondering if you can give us a preview of the tumor types here you think are most promising and also any preliminary safety findings.

I think 2 major pieces in terms of the gap. One is, clearly, the Venezuela adjustment we made in 2016 wouldn't have been in the $52.4 billion. So that's an $800 million adjustment. That would take a $52.4 billion to $51.6 billion. And then I think when you look at the line items, I think the big difference, if you ask me to point out one single place, is Prevnar 13. The growth expectations in Prevnar 13 '16 versus our modeling for '16 where I said in my comments and Albert punctuated in some of his detailed remarks about we're expecting that to be essentially comparable to 2015 levels.

The 4-1BB antibody, the Pfizer antibody, shows very good tolerability when combined with other biological agents, and its clinical performance suggests also a very interesting favorable clinical activity on top of other biologicals, such as rituximab and PD-1 KEYTRUDA. We will share the data from this first cohort this year likely at ASCO. We are quite excited about 4-1BB and also OX40 that's in our pipeline, and you will see 4-1BB avelumab data likely late this year as well as OX40 mono data and early next year several doublets and triplets, which makes me very enthusiastic as I look forward how we advance the strategy of combination therapy.

We finished 2015 with strong financial and operational performance. For the full year, we exceeded our 2015 revenue guidance and met the top end of our adjusted diluted EPS guidance. Excuse me. And we achieved",1507,"Thank you, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. We finished 2015 with strong financial and operational performance. For the full year, we exceeded our 2015 revenue guidance and met the top end of our adjusted diluted EPS guidance. Excuse me. And we achieved our first year of operational revenue growth in 5 years. Frank will take you through the numbers. Before he does, I have a few brief comments about what is driving our performance, some thoughts regarding where we expect to see pipeline advancements during the year, and I'll close with a few comments about Allergan. 
Throughout the year and especially in the fourth quarter, our business executed flawlessly despite a challenging operational environment. We ended 2015 with solid momentum in both developed and emerging markets. Specifically in developed markets, during the year, we gained incremental market penetration, driven by continued success of products that are early in their life cycles, including Prevnar 13 in adults, IBRANCE, Eliquis, Xeljanz. And we still saw steady growth from key in-line products in 2015, specifically Lyrica in markets where it remains patent protected. 
And during the year, in Emerging Markets, we saw operational revenue growth, primarily due to the performance of Prevnar, LIPITOR and Enbrel as well as from the addition of legacy Hospira products. 
The integration of the Hospira business into Pfizer Global Established Pharma business is on track, and we look forward to this business being an attractive potential growth driver. This acquisition is indeed proving to be an excellent strategic fit, and we're seeing the expected value contribution to our GEP business that we anticipated. 
Frank will speak to our 2016 guidance in a moment. We expect to deliver operational revenue growth in 2016. Our key growth drivers will continue to be IBRANCE, Eliquis and Xeljanz. And we believe that Prevnar Adult global revenues will be comparable to the strong results we achieved in 2015. Additionally, we believe our near-term pipeline will help accelerate this ongoing growth forward. 
In looking at the year ahead, we expect our businesses will continue to execute well. They are competitively positioned within their markets and are performing strongly against their competitive set. 
Regarding the pipeline, we anticipate advancing many of our Phase III programs during the year. For bococizumab, we reported today that the first of our 6 Phase III efficacy studies achieved its primary endpoint, and we expect readouts of the remaining 5 bococizumab lipid lowering studies to end during 2016. 
For ertugliflozin, this year, we and our partners, Merck, will begin to deliver results from our comprehensive Phase III clinical program. In 2016, the alliance expects to submit applications to regulatory approval in the U.S. for both monotherapy and 2 fixed-dose combination tablets using data from 8 clinical trials. 
For dacomitinib, we expect results in the second half of the year for Phase III study in first-line EGFR mutant non-small cell lung cancer and will discuss our regulatory strategy with the FDA. 
For Xeljanz, in the first half of this year, we expect top line results for our Phase III program in psoriatic arthritis. We believe Xeljanz can potentially fill a significant unmet need in the psoriatic arthritis market when nonbiologic DMARDS do not have proven success and where there are currently few alternatives for patients who have inadequate responses to anti-TNF therapy. In addition, in the first half of the year, we anticipate the decision from the FDA for our once-a-day daily Xeljanz formulation for rheumatoid arthritis, and we remain on track to refile our application for RA in EU. 
For IBRANCE, we expect to see the top line PALOMA-2 study results in first-line advanced breast cancer in combination with letrozole. And we have an April PDUFA date for second and third-line treatment for advanced breast cancer based on the PALOMA-3 data. We could also see a regulatory decision for IBRANCE in EU by year end. 
Additionally, in the Oncology business, we have a PDUFA date this year in the U.S. of Xalkori in ROS1 non-small cell lung cancer. And we expect to file for approval of inotuzumab for acute lymphoblastic leukemia in the U.S. 
And in immuno-oncology, we now have a broad portfolio of compounds that we believe has the potential to support the development of a strong, deep competitive market position. We now have 5 immuno-oncology assets in the clinic and expect to have up to 10 in the clinic by the end of 2016. As a result of our partnership with Merck KGaA, as of the end of 2015, we had 28 ongoing clinical development programs for avelumab, with 7 of them being pivotal registrational studies. We anticipate some of these studies will give us potential registration to -- in areas like Merkel cell, ovarian, bladder, gastric and lung cancer. Of these 7 studies, we expect to present data in Merkel cell this year and to see data from the other tumor types in the following 2 years. 
And we continue to believe that the winners in this space will be those who have a breadth of portfolio, assets to support rational combinations. We have a range of assets to combine with avelumab when compared to other companies' assets. And we have already initiated 6 combination studies with avelumab. In 2016, we expect to see data from 4-1BB in combination with KEYTRUDA and in combination with avelumab in various tumors. 4-1BB in combination with rituximab in lymphoma. A combination of lorlatinib, our next generation ALK inhibitor, with avelumab in ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer. And data from Inlyta with avelumab in renal cell carcinoma. Finally, we may see data from OX40 as a single agent this year. Taking up all of this into account, we believe we're well on our way to being a leading player in this space. 
And now a few comments about our proposed combination with Allergan. We're excited about bringing 2 great companies together that have a strong strategic fit. The transaction is about accelerating growth potential in our Innovative businesses and strengthening our Established business and more efficiently allocating our capital around the world. We are confident that we are taking appropriate steps so that we can achieve the key milestones needed to complete the transaction and continue to expect close in the second half of 2016. 
Since the announcement, we have been working closely with Brent Saunders and his team at Allergan and have been delighted by the engagement and rapport that is occurring. We see a number of potential opportunities after closing as we continue to learn more about each other's portfolio. For example, we see complementarity in inflammation and gastroenterology. And we have a -- we want to have a broader presence in cardiovascular disease with Eliquis and Bystolic. In neuroscience, Allergan's work in Alzheimer's, schizophrenia and major depressive orders will be highly complementary to Pfizer's promising early work in such areas as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. When you look out over the next few years, we expect both companies will continue -- contribute, sorry, several potential new drugs to launch. We also continue to be excited about the international potential. 
And by coming together, we're enhancing category leadership throughout our complementary in-line portfolio and a combined pipeline with great late-stage and mid-stage assets across each of our key therapeutic areas. Both companies bring a great deal of scientific and product expertise to the proposed combination and a shared philosophy in our approach to research and development.
Upon the close of the transaction, the combined company will be an influential player in the industry with a competitive product portfolio with several leadership positions, robust pipeline, compelling capital structure and financial position and aligned cultures that are based on ownership and entrepreneurial spirit, creating shareholder value and meeting patients' needs. This combination is about investing in our business. It's about accelerating our existing strategy while preserving our options as putting the company into an Innovative business and an Established Business if we determine that is the best way to unlock the most value for our shareholders. 
By the end of the current quarter, our integration teams will be fully engaged, and we anticipate announcing post-closing leadership positions. Throughout the year, we will continue to keep you updated on our progress. 
In summary, we are looking at year ahead. We have a sound strategy and a strong business. Our outlook and financial guidance for the year takes into account the benefit of anticipated positive organic growth from key products as well as the impact from foreign exchange. We have a solid portfolio of market-leading in-line products, a healthy pipeline. We expect to further strengthen the growth potential of business with the pending addition of Allergan. We will continue to have the means by which we can create value for our shareholders and bring innovative medicines to patients by producing expected topline growth, progressing key pipeline assets, pursuing strategic business development and returning capital to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. 
Now I'll turn it over to Frank for additional details on the quarter and our 2016 financial guidance."

As always, the charts we're reviewing today are included in our webcast. As a reminder, because we completed the acquisition of Hospira on September 3, 2015, Pfizer's full year financial results for the year ended December",1740,"Thanks, Ian. Good day, everyone. As always, the charts we're reviewing today are included in our webcast. As a reminder, because we completed the acquisition of Hospira on September 3, 2015, Pfizer's full year financial results for the year ended December 31, 2015, include 4 months of legacy Hospira U.S. operations and 3 months of legacy Hospira international operations. Financial results for the fourth quarter 2015 include 3 months of legacy Hospira global operations. By comparison, financial results for full year and fourth quarter 2014 do not include any contribution from legacy Hospira operations. 
Now moving on to the financials. Fourth quarter 2015 reported revenues were approximately $14 billion and reflect year-over-year operational growth of $1.9 billion or 14%, mainly driven by the addition of legacy Hospira operations, the continued strong performance of products that are early in their life cycles such as Prevnar 13 Adult, IBRANCE, Eliquis and Xeljanz, Lyrica primarily in the U.S. and 5% operational growth in Emerging Markets, mainly from legacy Hospira operations, Prevnar 13 and certain other products. 
Reported revenues continued to be unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of $934 million or 7%. Excluding the inclusion of legacy Hospira operations of $1.2 billion, the negative impact of foreign exchange and to a much lesser extent the inclusion of $35 million of revenues associated with vaccines acquired from Baxter, Pfizer stand-alone achieved operational growth of $646 million or 5%, while at the same time, absorbing a $720 million negative operational impact from product losses of exclusivity. 
Fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS was $0.53 versus $0.54 in the year-ago quarter. The decrease is primarily due to an aggregate operational increase and adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses and adjusted R&D expenses of $1.8 billion or 21%, $0.07 due to foreign exchange and the continued product losses of exclusivity in certain geographies. These were partially offset by revenue growth of certain new in-line and acquired products, a lower effective tax rate and fewer diluted weighted average shares outstanding, which declined by 125 million shares versus the year-ago quarter due to our share repurchase program, which includes the impact of our $5 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement executed in February 2015 and completed in July. 
Reported diluted EPS was $0.10 compared with $0.19 in the year-ago quarter due to the previously mentioned factors and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency losses related to Venezuela, increased purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition-related cost, restructuring charges and asset impairment charges versus the prior year quarter and nonrecurring charges related to pension settlements, which were partially offset by the nonrecurrence of a charge associated with the global strategic alliance formed with Merck KGaA in November 2014 to jointly develop and commercialize avelumab, lower charges for certain legal matters and a lower effective tax rate.
Foreign exchange negatively impacted fourth quarter reported revenues by approximately $934 million or 7% and positively impacted adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses and adjusted R&D expenses in the aggregate by $435 million or 5%. As a result, foreign exchange negatively impacted fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS by approximately $0.07 compared with the year-ago quarter.
Now moving on to the financial highlights of our business segments. In the fourth quarter, Global Innovative Pharmaceutical revenues increased 10% operationally year-over-year due to the strong performance of recently launched products, including Eliquis globally and Xeljanz in the U.S. and the strong performance of Lyrica in the U.S. and Japan. Income before taxes increased 17% operationally due to the increase in revenues and a 5% operational decrease in cost of sales. 
Cost of sales as a percentage of revenue decreased 1.7 percentage points operationally because of lower royalty expenses and increased alliance revenues with no associated cost of sales. IBT was unfavorably impacted by a 4% operational increase and SI&A expenses as a result of additional investment in Eliquis, Xeljanz and Chantix and 11% operational increase in R&D, reflecting investments in our late-stage pipeline, primarily for bococizumab and tanezumab.
Fourth quarter VOC revenues increased 38% operationally, reflecting operational revenue growth in each business. Global Vaccine revenues grew 53% operationally, driven by a 102% increase of Prevnar 13 U.S. revenues due to strong uptake among adults. Global Oncology revenues grew 61% operationally, driven by IBRANCE in the U.S. and to a lesser extent by Sutent and Xalkori globally. And Consumer Healthcare revenues grew 4% operationally due to Nexium 24HR in the U.S. 
Income before taxes increased 33% operationally, mainly due to increased revenues and an associated improvement in gross margin, which were partially offset by a 66% operational increase in SI&A expenses as a result of higher promotional expenses in the U.S. for newly launched Consumer Healthcare products, IBRANCE and Prevnar 13 Adult. And the 46% operational increase in R&D expenses due to increased cost associated with our oncology programs, primarily our alliance with Merck KGaA and IBRANCE. 
Fourth quarter Global Established Pharmaceutical revenues increased 5% operationally, mainly due to the previously mentioned inclusion of legacy Hospira revenues contributing $1.2 billion, which was partially offset by the loss of exclusivity and generic competition for Celebrex in the U.S. and certain other developed markets, Lyrica in most developed markets in Europe and Zyvox in the U.S. 
Emerging Market revenues were flat operationally, which reflected the positive impact of the inclusion of legacy Hospira operations and continued strong growth in China, offset by declines in certain markets in the Middle East. 
Income before taxes declined 12% operationally, reflecting the unfavorable impact of a 4.7 percentage point operational increase in cost of sales as a percentage of revenues due to the inclusion of Hospira operations and the impact of losses of exclusivity. A 24% operational increase in SI&A expenses, driven in part by the addition of Hospira operations and the 53% operational increase in R&D expenses due to an increased legacy Hospira development programs. 
We exceeded to the top of our guidance range expectations for 2015 reported revenues by approximately $400 million. Adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenues was 18.5% versus 18.7% at the low end of our guidance range due to increased alliance revenues and sales volumes. And we exceeded our expectation for our effective tax rate on adjusted income as a result of a favorable change in our jurisdictional mix of earnings. We met our expectations for adjusted R&D expenses and achieved the top end of our adjusted diluted EPS. Adjusted SI&A expenses of $14.3 billion were higher than our guidance range due to increased expenses for recently launched products, such as Prevnar 13 Adult and IBRANCE, other in-line products and certain Consumer Healthcare brands.
We recorded adjusted other income of $409 million versus our expectation of approximately $500 million. Finally, reported diluted EPS was $1.24 versus our expected range of $1.37 to $1.43, mainly as a result of increased purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition-related cost and restructuring charges primarily related to the acquisition of Hospira, the negative impact of foreign currency losses related to Venezuela and nonrecurring charges related to pension settlements. 
Now I'd like to walk you through the 2016 guidance ranges for reported revenues, reported diluted EPS and adjusted diluted EPS relative to our 2015 actual results. First, it's important to note that our 2016 financial guidance excludes the impact of our pending combination with Allergan. 
Our 2016 reported revenue guidance range reflects anticipated strong growth of certain new, in-line and acquired products that is partially offset by an anticipated $2.3 billion negative impact due to continuing product losses of exclusivity. I want to point out that within this range and consistent with our previous comments, we expect full year Prevnar 13 Adult global revenues to be comparable with its full year 2015 global revenue level. We expect adverse changes in foreign exchange based on mid-January 2016 rates relative to the U.S. dollar compared with actual foreign exchange rates from 2015 to have an additional $2.3 billion negative impact on reported revenues, including an estimated $800 million negative currency impact related to Venezuela. Consequently, we expect 2016 reported revenues to be in the range of $49 billion to $51 billion. 
Reported diluted EPS and adjusted diluted EPS guidance also include the negative impact from product losses of exclusivity as well as an expected $0.09 negative impact from foreign exchange rates and the $0.07 negative currency impact related to Venezuela. As a result, we expect reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.54 to $1.67 and adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.20 to $2.30. 
In addition, I want to remind everyone that guidance ranges for both reported and adjusted diluted EPS incorporate $5 billion of anticipated share repurchases in 2016, which consists of our previously announced intention to execute a $5 billion accelerated share repurchase program in the first half of 2016. These repurchases are expected to more than offset the potential dilution related to employee compensation programs. In summary, if you exclude anticipated foreign exchange impacts, including the negative currency impact related to Venezuela, full year 2016 revenue and adjusted EPS guidance midpoints are 7% and 10% greater than actual full year 2015 levels, respectively. The remaining elements of our 2016 financial guidance are set forth on this chart.
Now moving on to key takeaways. We had a very strong financial performance in 2015, and we achieved operational revenue growth every quarter, including 14% operational growth in the fourth quarter. For the full year 2015, we achieved 6% operational revenue growth that was mainly driven by new products that are early in their life cycles, and we achieved this growth despite a $3.2 billion negative impact from product losses of exclusivity. Our full year 2016 reported revenue guidance range of $49 billion to $51 billion absorbs a $4.6 billion combined negative impact of product losses of exclusivity, adverse changes in foreign exchange rates and the negative currency impact related to Venezuela. And the adjusted diluted EPS guidance range includes an anticipated $0.16 negative impact from foreign exchange, including Venezuela. 
We announced our proposed combination with Allergan and continue to expect the transaction to close in the second half of 2016. And we continue to create shareholder value through prudent capital allocation. In 2015, we returned $13.1 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. And we expect to execute a $5 billion accelerated share repurchase program in the first half of 2016. Finally, we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2016 and beyond. 
Now I'll turn it back to Chuck."

In the U.S., obviously, we have done an excellent job with a catch-up opportunity. We have achieved 86% market share, 92% at retailers. We have 90% awareness of the recommendation of healthcare practitioner. And as a result of the 45 million adults eligible at the time of recommendation for vaccination, we have already captured about 1/3 of them. Now while many adults remain, this cohort is more difficult to capture as the low-hanging fruit is gone. It will require more innovative strategies, but we all have in place. But even if we assume a similar or higher penetration rate this year, it would be on a much smaller pool of adults. However, we expect this would be mitigated by Europe, which has a very different growth profile. Even with prices lower than U.S., the demographics are very favorable with a much larger eligible population. And we have already received pneumonia on our label in 2015, and we are working to obtain broad recommendations, and following that, reimbursement from the authorities. Now this will be phased likely over a 2 years’ window period, because in Europe, this is done country-by-country, and sometimes, region by region within the same country. But all in all, we expect very strong growth in Europe next year. Now let me move on IBRANCE and to your question about competition on particularly Lilly's drug. Look, Lilly's drug, while in the same class, is for any indication. The refractory patient population for which they have received breakthrough designation is a very small population with few options available. In fact, the average refractory patient undergoes 7 lines of treatment. So it's a -- they are in high need. Now speaking generally on competition, there is only limited clinical data on the public domain, and we need to see more efficacy and safety data to make comparisons. What I can tell you is about our strategic position. We are the only company with a registered product in U.S. and 6 other countries and then accepted file in Europe, where we may obtain registration as early as next year. We have very good clinical experience with the product. IBRANCE has been prescribed by 5,000 physicians in more than 20,000 patients. And so far, feedback is very positive, particularly on patients' quality of life. We are having a very heavy clinical program.

By the way, that's being driven by a few factors, but one of which clearly is Hospira. In terms of -- I think your question which is why was it even more, I think the answer is, our ongoing productivity and cost reduction initiatives. When you think about our factories, our manufacturing capabilities, we really manage that from a cost perspective. First of all, we focus that on quality, service and cost. If you think about that as a triangle, quality is at the top of the triangle, but there's 4 major buckets, right. There's the number of facilities. There's the numerous quality initiatives we have within each facility. There's the purchasing that we can get from a leverage perspective. And then finally, there's the center cost that resides outside of the factories. We manage all 4 of those very aggressively to basically -- to manage our cost structure and manufacturing.

So obviously, again, we're very excited by the opportunities afforded us by the combination of our 2 businesses.

Obviously, it's a very -- it's a large, it's a growing market. It's somewhere between $50 billion to $70 billion currently globally. And one of the set of features of that market is it's very concentrated, particularly in the U.S., but also in a few ex U.S. markets, such as Western Europe and particularly China. So one of the things that we are very focused on is going to be revenue synergy. We obviously have a strong commercial presence in China and also in the hospital segment in developed Europe and emerging Europe. So essentially, the lag time since September, when we closed this transaction, we've been focused really on making sure that we have our blocking and tackling in place to be very systematic with our highest value molecules that really sort of meet market needs most appropriately to be very focused on registering and bringing those molecules to market. So -- and the biggest opportunity that we have in China, that is going to take time, as you are very well aware. Drug lag in China is a significant issue, but we're very encouraged by the progress that the CFDA are making to accelerate access to important new medicines in China. But that will take time. But we do see opportunities both in the short term as well as medium and long term to deliver significant growth ex U.S. through the sterile injectable business and the combination of Hospira's portfolio into our commercial footprint."

Just back on this whole breakup thesis and the timing, I think investors initially were disappointed by the timing that you laid out at the time that you announced the Allergan deal. I think you said you would make a decision by the end of 2018. And just want to put out there that the stock has pulled back quite a bit since you announced the Allergan deal. And I would think despite clearly the market is excited about this. But I would think that, that would -- the difference in that even growing gap in valuation between where your stock in -- is in an SOTP should help you to accelerate your decision to move in that direction. And if you could just comment on that, please. And then just thirdly on revenue growth. I mean, clearly there have been tons of pushes and pulls in your numbers, mostly currency and patent expirations. Can you remind us when you expect, and this excludes the acquisition from Allergan, but when you expect your reported revenue growth? Just talk about operationally revenue growth. When we should start to see a positive inflection point? Because it has -- when I look at my models, revenues have been in decline for many years, and some of that's divestitures and spins. But really since 2013, we've had revenue sort of flat to down. When is that going to change, and what's going to drive that change just talking from Pfizer's standpoint?"

'16, we expect it to be operationally now, right, Hospira -- we expected to be Hospira and Allergan. We expect it to be flat, and that's because we had a huge growth from adult vaccine in '15 and will hold that franchise. We won't grow it again. We'll have good growth from our in-line products and our newly launched products but we still deal with a couple of billion of LOEs. So I think you can begin to see, as we launch -- as we begin to get more traction with more clinical trials in IBRANCE, as we begin to see ertugliflozin launch, as we begin to see our next wave of products get approved, you'll see us returning to a very robust growth. But obviously, Jami, one of the reasons of doing the Allergan deal was in fact to ensure that we had robust growth in our Innovative Business. So we're aware of that issue. Now vis-a-vis, the breakup timing. Number one, I'd point out that while the stock is down, I don't think it's specifically down more than a DRG. In fact, I think it's roughly the same as a DRG. And in fact, given the arb pressure that one would expect in the stock, I'm actually -- well, never like to see the stock go down, it certainly was expected to come under pressure from the arb community. Now the breakup timing is an issue of we are focused on integrating this company and the 2 companies together, and we have laid out the 4 questions that we need to answer. And I think any shareholder would want those questions answered. So can we run the businesses successfully inside Pfizer? And the -- and we bought Hospira. You've seeing the sterile injectables. You've got the biosimilars. You're beginning to see, if you strip out the LOEs, a stabilization of the core business, which we expect to return to growth. But that being said, we can run it well inside Pfizer. Can it be run better outside Pfizer? Is there trapped value and can we unlock the trapped value in a tax efficient manner? And these are very serious questions. These are very large companies. And I think that by end of '18, we will be well positioned to make that decision in the best interest of our shareholders, and frankly, don't particularly see a way of short-circuiting that just because of the amount of work that has to be done in integration and getting the transaction of Allergan right. I do understand your wish for a more speedy decision, but I think we're taking the right approach for shareholder value here."

Two things. First, I want to just to point out that abemaciclib is somewhat different from palbo and Novartis CDK drug in that it seems to be less selective and has a different adverse event profile, likely due to hitting multiple CDKs, particularly being reported significant GI issues. So it's a different profile. And we, as Albert very well pointed out, have been extremely pleased with the favorable profile that allow patients to benefit from IBRANCE with very good tolerability. Now you asked about this late-stage population studies by abema and how that population in the future will evolve. We anticipate, as IBRANCE is having a very nice uptake in the marketplace in first-line metastatic and some -- also more advanced lines, and hopefully, with a PALOMA-3 approval, IBRANCE is likely to be used in multiple lines. Hence, monotherapy with another CDK will, of course, have the potential to face a patient population that have seen a CDK inhibitor. And that's why we are developing a strategy for how we can see patients benefit from a drug like IBRANCE at various stages with different antihormonals and we're also now starting IBRANCE in triple therapy.

Just first, we don't give a specific number for Hospira revenues for 2016. With that said, I believe I can still answer the question. So the way I think about this is, if you went to the midpoint of the guidance prior to foreign exchange in Venezuela, which was part of the basis of your question, the midpoint of the guidance would be $52.3 billion. Just we'll use the midpoint. If you take $50.3 billion, compare that to the $48.9 billion that we printed in 2015, all now at the same foreign exchange, so purely operational, that's an increase of about $3.5 billion. We said -- Ian said when he answered Jami's question that revenue excluding Hospira, on a year-over-year basis, was essentially flat operationally while absorbing $2.3 billion in LOEs for 2016. The other data point I think to help answer the question is, remember, we did $1.5 billion in Hospira sales this year. So when we say that the bulk of the growth is from Hospira, you understand it's incremental growth on top of the $1.5 billion that we printed in 2015. So that's how I think -- that's how you get to the numbers we said and why we said operationally the numbers were essentially flat if you left Hospira out of the equation."

Two was, sequentially, if you think about the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, we had a lot more selling days in the quarter. So internationally, we had 6 more selling days. Domestically, we had 2 more selling days. So sequentially, Q3 of '15 to Q4 of '15, we had more selling days. So, obviously, that helps revenue, it also increases the spend on online items. And then we had -- obviously, I alluded to in my comments, increased promotional spend in many areas of the business. Now if you take that $4.6 billion and you annualize it x2 is what -- 9.2, x 2 is $18.4 billion. If you look at the guidance we gave for next year in SI&A, it's $13.2 billion to $14.2 billion. So you can't take that Q4 number and annualize it. You get to a number that's nothing close to what our guidance is for 2016. It was just a combination of the Hospira numbers, the selling days and then the increased spend in the quarter. But if we look at it for next year, we've got a number that on an annual basis is significantly lower than what that annualized number would be."

Mikael, when you look at preclinical models, is there any argument or hypothesis around a drug that has to be given intermittently that it might have less efficacy than one that's given on a continuous dosing?

And then on psoriasis in the U.S., any developments there and on the modified release from a regulatory standpoint?

So we started out with the accretion dilution. We said neutral in year 1, modestly accretive in year 2, more than 10% in year 3 and then high teens in year 4. We gave what the beginning share count number of the combined company would be, it was 10.6 billion shares. We said we'd have 5.9 billion and Allergan would have 4.7 billion.

As we referenced in our earnings release, a portion of the growth in the quarter was attributable to additional selling days compared to the year-ago quarter, which will be offset in the fourth quarter from a growth perspective. We nonetheless had a strong quarter financially even without that impact, exceeding our internal projections and incorporated the strong operational performance as well as the recent weakening of the dollar into our updated financial guidance for the year. 
And compared to the first quarter, we expect that our LOE impact from Lyrica, Rebif Enbrel will be more pronounced in the remaining quarters of the year. Additionally, new product launch expenses and R&D investment are also phased higher for the remainder of the year. Frank will provide more details in a few minutes. 
Overall, looking at the quarter, on a revenue basis, Pfizer stand-alone business, excluding Hospira grew 15% operationally, and 26% operationally with the inclusion of Hospira. Our Innovative business generated impressive operational revenue growth of 28%, driven by the performance of Eliquis globally and IBRANCE, Prevnar 13, Lyrica, Xeljanz, Chantix and Nexium 24HR, principally in the U.S. 
Of particular note, IBRANCE has already earned broad patient and physician acceptance. Since launch in the U.S. last year, about 6,800 prescribers have treated approximately 28,000 women with HR positive HER2- metastatic breast cancer and the feedback continuously very encouraging, particularly around the efficacy and tolerability profile and impact on the overall quality of life.
Recently, we announced that the confirmatory Phase III PALOMA-2 trial for IBRANCE in first-line metastatic breast cancer met its primary endpoints of improving progression free survival. Detail results will be presented at ASCO in early June.
We're also seeing continued strong operational growth from Eliquis, which is yielding increased market penetration and market share gains in the U.S. and Japan. The contribution of Eliquis to our alliance revenue line more than doubled year-over-year. 
For the Prevnar 13 adult indication, while there was a year-over-year growth as expected, we saw a sequential quarterly decline in revenues given the rapid penetration we achieved in the U.S. market during 2015. The pediatric indication remains strong, and we anticipate that global revenues for the Prevnar 13 franchise in full year 2016 will be comparable to 2015. 
And we were pleased that the results from the EAGLES study, the largest global clinical trial smoking cessation medicines were published in The Lancet. The study was designed to compare the neuropsychiatric safety of Chantix and with placebo and nicotine patch in adult smokers with and without a history of psychiatric disorders. The concluded that the study did not show a significant increase in serious neuropsychiatric events with Chantix for bupropion relative to placebo or nicotine patch. The study also found that smokers who Chantix have significantly higher quit rates than those treated with the bupropion, nicotine patch or placebo.
Turning now to our Established Business, it grew 24% operationally, primarily due to the additional revenues from Legacy Hospira products. Without Hospira and the impact of foreign exchange, the business grew 1%. In particular, we saw strong performance from sterile injectables portfolio. The addition of Hospira's leading generic injectables portfolio with Pfizer's legacy branded injectables establishes Pfizer as the #1 sterile injectables company globally. We now have one of the broadest and most diverse offerings of manufacturers sterile injectable medicines, which are critically important for patients around the world. This leading market position, combined with our expanded biosimilar-s offering and the continued growth of Pfizer's legacy branded portfolio in Emerging Markets will help us to move the Established Pharmaceutical business from a period of loss of exclusivity driven decline to potential growth. 
The Hospira acquisition was a clear growth driver, and the integration continues to proceed well. We have addressed specific issues related to legacy Hospira's manufacturing and have developed a plan to implement Pfizer quality standards at the sites. And we have dedicated resources to support the sites as they complete their transition to the Pfizer network.
Based on Hospira's excellent strategic with our Established Business and our intense focus on integration of Hospira, we expect to exceed our original synergy targets of $800 million in annual cost savings by 2018 and now expect to achieve approximately $1 billion in cost savings. 
As you are aware, in early April, we decided not to move forward with the Allergan transaction due to the actions of the U.S. Treasury Department. Given these actions and the current political climate, we do not see any potential for a transaction involving emerging in the near term. While the outcome was disappointing, we always view the potential Allergan transaction not as a new strategy but rather as a way to accelerate our existing strategy, which remains unchanged. Our strategy is anchored by several elements, namely, improving the company's revenue growth profile so that a greater proportion of our earnings per share growth is driven by incremental revenue opportunities. Our latest product launches, including Eliquis, Xalkori, Xeljanz, IBRANCE and Prevnar 13 Adult have now become meaningful revenue contributors. In addition, the FDA's decision to improve Xeljanz biosimilar and across eligible indications marks a critical and positive step forward in helping to create a pathway for biosimilars in the U.S. We hold exclusive commercialization rights to this product in the U.S. While launch timing of Inflectra will ultimately depend upon a number of factors, such as marketplace dynamics and intellectual property considerations, we are continuing with the preparation of our launch plans for 2016. 
Our current biosimilars portfolio includes 3 commercialized products available in select markets outside the U.S. Inflectra, lovastatin and Retacrit. We believe that biosimilars represent an attractive revenue growth opportunity for expanding patient access to important treatments. 
We also see continued opportunities for our Established Pharma Business in Emerging Markets robust portfolio position to compete in these markets. GEP revenues in Emerging Markets increased 10% operationally this quarter and companywide revenues in Emerging Markets increased 14% operationally. Emerging Markets revenues represented nearly 20% of our total company's revenue base.
We are also continuing to make significant progress in securing potential future growth drivers across the advancement of our pipeline. Specific examples include the planned submission for ulcerative colitis for Xeljanz which is on track to occur in first half of 2017. The acceptance review of the Xeljanz EU filing for rheumatoid arthritis. We have completed enrollment of the bococizumab trial. While it can be hard to predict duration of trial of time to events trial, we currently anticipate a potential completion of this outcome study in the second half of 2017. 
Presentation of the [indiscernible] Phase III data at the American Diabetes Association meeting in June and a potential regulatory filing in the U.S. [indiscernible] Phase III program where we're now conducting trials for osteoarthritis, chronic low back pain and cancer pain medications. 
A potential regulatory decision in the EU for IBRANCE in combination and therapy for the treatment of HR positive HER2- advanced metastatic breast cancer. And for inotuzumab for adult patients with relapsed refractory positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We are in discussions with the FDA on our next steps to bringing this important medicine to patients. 
Behind these assets is a strong and early mid-stage pipeline, most notably, a broad portfolio of IO compounds which continue to advance. Our avelumab PD-L1 program with Merck KGaA has ramped up rapidly and now has last 30 programs ongoing, both as monotherapy and in combination with other portfolio of assets, 8 of which are potentially registration-enabling. We continue to expect that the key advances in IO will come from novel combinations, both double and triple combination regimes, and technologies that may have the potential to treat more patients with immunotherapy are ultimately transform the cancer treatment paradigm. We have several combination studies that are already in the clinic of our key combination assets being 4-1BB and [indiscernible] 40. 
We also have a range of immune oncology assets moving into the clinic, including our halogen a program in collaboration with select and a small molecule immunotherapy asset either I in collaboration with and our biospecific antibody p [indiscernible]. 
Recently, we presented Phase II data at the AACR annual meeting, showing that IBRANCE was effective in slowing the modification of cancer cells in patients diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer who received no prior therapy. And we also expect that a proof of concept readout next generation ALK inhibitor [indiscernible] in ALK-positive nonsmall cell lung cancer patients towards the end of the year. Neratinib is our follow-on drug to Xalkori. 
In neuroscience, we began a Phase II proof of concept study this quarter for our novel dopamine modulation asset for Parkinson's disease. If successful, this may have the potential to replace the standard of care in Parkinson's. 
In addition, through a collaboration with Genesis Therapeutics, we have a second compound being investigated in Parkinson's and expect to have a proof of concept study readout in the second half of the year. The compound is a GDNF protein and may have the potential to provide the first disease modifying treatment that slows the progressive decline in Parkinson's patients. 
In Vaccines, we expect to have C. difficile 
Proof of concept readout towards the end of the year. C. difficile [indiscernible] was treatment infection in the hospital and long-term care setting. Currently, there are no vaccines available to prevent the disease and the infection control practice are challenging to implement. 
Overall, we are anticipating a steady stream of pipeline updates throughout 2016. Our strategy will also capitalize on the opportunities and specific expertise resulting from a distinct, competitive and growing businesses, namely our Innovative and Established business, which is led by strong leaders with experience and know-how to effectively direct and grow these organizations. 
In addition to capitalizing on the strength of our pipeline, our strategy includes allocating our capital to shareholder-friendly initiatives with an eye towards sustainable value creation. This includes continuing to look for ways other than inversions to improve our tax rate. It also includes pursuing business development opportunities that use our capital efficiently in ways that create meaningful shareholder value, that have the potential for near-term solid creation, that strengthen our individual businesses with capabilities in key assets and enhance our leadership position in the most attractive core areas. 
As you know, we're also considering a potential separation of our Innovative and Established business. No decision has been made at this point, and we recently announced we plan to make an assessment of the merits of the separation by the end of 2016. By this time, we'll be completing our third and final year of building the required seventh financial to support any split, and we'll also be in a position to complete the necessary financial analysis needed if the time is right to move forward with a split. If we determine the time is right, then we expect to be in a position to execute a split by the end of 2017. And if we determine through the process that a split isn't appropriate, we will continue to have the flexibility to assess the option and proceed if and when we deem the time is right. 
Our decision framework has not changed. It continues to be based on these 4 questions. Are the business well in Pfizer? Could the business perform well as stand-alone entities? Is it attract value in the combined entity? And can attract value be unlocked efficiently? Throughout the year, we'll be assessing our performance in each of these factors. 
In summary, the business is performing well, driven by a sound strategy. The outlook for the year is strong based on a demonstrated ability of the Innovate and Established business to execute against this goal. We have a healthy pipeline with strong candidates every stage of the pipeline, and we have the financial flexibility and several options for creating short-term and long-term value for shareholders. 
I'll now turn it over to Frank, and thank you."

As always, the charts I'm reviewing today are included in our webcast. As a reminder, because we completed the acquisition of Hospira in September 3, 2015, Pfizer's first quarter 2016 financial results include 3 months of",1061,"Thanks, Ian. Good day, everyone. As always, the charts I'm reviewing today are included in our webcast. As a reminder, because we completed the acquisition of Hospira in September 3, 2015, Pfizer's first quarter 2016 financial results include 3 months of Legacy Hospira global operations compared to the first quarter 2015 results, which do not include any Legacy Hospira operations.
Now moving on to the financials. We had a good quarter. First quarter 2016 reported revenues were approximately $13 billion and reflect year-over-year operational growth of $2.9 billion or 26%, of which $1.2 billion or 11% is attributable to the inclusion of Legacy Hospira operations and approximately $900 million or 8% is attributable to 5 additional selling days in the U.S. and 4 additional selling days in the international markets in the first quarter of '16 versus the year-ago quarter. Excluding legacy Hospira operations and these additional selling days, reported revenues grew $800 million or 7% operationally, which reflects continued strong performance of IBRANCE, Prevnar 13, Eliquis, Xeljanz, Lyrica and Chantix, and a 14% operational growth in Emerging Markets, which were partially offset by the absorption of an approximately $300 million negative operational impact due to product losses of exclusivity. 
With respect to selling days, I want to point out that because of our accounting calendar, there was greater variability of selling days during the quarters of '15 than there will be in 2016. But this will not impact total number of selling days or our revenue for 2016. To illustrate, there were 5 more U.S. and 4 more international selling days in the first quarter of '16 compared with the year ago quarter, and there are 4 fewer U.S. and 3 fewer international selling days in the fourth quarter of '16 versus the fourth quarter 2015. So the imbalance in selling days we saw in the first quarter will be offset in the fourth quarter 2016, and there will be essentially the same number of selling days in full-year '16 as in full year 2015. Consequently, the only impact will be to the quarterly year-over-year comparisons notably for the first and fourth quarters. 
Reported revenues continued to be unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of $729 million or 7%, including losses related to the Venezuelan Bolivar. 
First quarter adjusted diluted EPS was $0.67 versus $0.51 in the year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to increased revenues, the inclusion of Hospira operations, a lower effective tax rates and a fewer diluted weighted average shares outstanding, which declined by 78 million shares versus the year-ago quarter, due to our share repurchase program, which includes the impact of our $5 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement executed in February of 2015 and completed in July of '15 and by another 136 million shares associated with a partial quarter benefit from an accelerated share repurchase agreement executed in March of 2016, which were partially offset by an aggregate operational increase and adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses and adjusted R&D expenses of $1.1 billion or 16%; $0.07 negative impact due to foreign exchange and continuing product losses of exclusivity. 
Reported diluted EPS was $0.49 compared with $0.38 in the year-ago quarter due to the previously mentioned factors and the favorable impact of lower charges for business and legal entity alignment activities incurred during the first quarter, which were partially offset by higher acquisition-related costs, legal charges, purchase accounting adjustments and higher asset impairment charges. 
Foreign exchange negatively impacted first quarter reported revenues by approximately $729 million or 7% and positively impacted adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A and adjusted R&D expenses, in the aggregate, by $197 million or 3%. As a result, foreign exchange negatively impacted first quarter adjusted diluted EPS by approximately $0.07 compared with the year-ago quarter. 
The results for the GIP, VOC and GEP businesses are available and can be found at the end of the presentation, that is posted on our website. 
Moving on to our 2016 financial guidance. We are updating our 2016 reported revenues and adjusted diluted EPS ranges due to our strong performance to date and improved business outlook for 2016 as well as the favorable impact from foreign exchange rates since mid-January 2016. Consequently, we raised the midpoint of our 2016 revenue guidance by $2 billion and the midpoint of our 2016 adjusted diluted EPS guidance range by $0.18. We now expect 2016 reported revenues to be in the range of $51 billion to $53 billion versus our previous expectation of $49 billion to $51 billion. And we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.38 to $2.48 versus our previous expectation of $2.20 to $2.30. 
I want to punctuate what Ian said previously. Operational factors, such as our strong performance to date in 2016, in addition to our improved business outlook for 2016, favorably impacted the midpoint of reported revenue guidance range by approximately $1 billion and the adjusted diluted EPS guidance range by $0.12. Favorable changes in foreign exchange rates since mid-January 2016 also favorably impacted the midpoint of the reported revenue guidance range by approximately $1 billion and the adjusted diluted EPS guidance range by $0.06. 
Finally, given our first quarter results and the benefit of continued support of recently launched products as well as foreign exchange, we are raising the midpoint of our adjusted SI&A guidance range by $500 million. Consequently, we now expect adjusted SI&A expenses to be in the range of $13.7 billion to $14.7 billion.
Moving on to key takeaways. This quarter marks our sixth consecutive quarter of Pfizer stand-alone operational revenue growth, which was primarily driven by new products that are early in their life cycles, such as IBRANCE, Prevnar 13, Eliquis, Xeljanz and Lyrica and additional selling days during the first quarter. As I just mentioned, we raised the midpoints of our 2016 reported revenues and adjusted diluted EPS guidance ranges to reflect strong operational performance to date, favorable changes in foreign exchange rates and improved business outlook for 2016. We accomplished several key R&D milestones during the first quarter. We continued to deliver significant value to shareholders in the form of $1.9 billion in the first quarter 2016 dividends and a $5 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement executed in March 2016. And finally, we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2016 and beyond. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Chuck."

On the  on whether we can unleash trapped value, we'll obviously use outside advisers. But one of the classic methods would simply be look at some of the parts because much as we can establish by disaggregating our business the same way as we do view information to do, so we can take those businesses and compare them to stand-alone businesses and see what a potential evaluation would be with parts and compare to the sum. That is one way of looking at trapped value. Another is to look historically at what has happened to the company's, whether the spun or they've been spun in an unforced manner, i.e. because of management's decision and not because of activist pressure and see what has happened to the shares of those companies subsequently. And of course, we'll also have to look at what are the tax implications, which really circles back to stand-alone abilities if companies are disadvantaged in a more specific way because of their tax situation compared to their competitors."

We have a novel ADC called PTK-7 that we'll also see some really interesting response rate. In the immuno inflammation field, in addition to Xeljanz, we now have 4 different immunokinases going into Phase II with several highly specific JAKs going to inflammatory bowel disease, dermatological inflammation and lupus. So we will share more data around those, but I think they will really move the entire JAK field over time into new areas and with the new profiles.

And Ian mentioned in his introduction that we have built some interesting asset in Parkinson with a completely novel dopamine modulator and also have an interesting [indiscernible] study together with MedGenesis. And finally, in the rare disease, I'll exemplify that we have a growing sickle-cell franchise with [indiscernible] and a plan to start PD 9 as a way to prevent occurrence of difficult to treat rare disease episode. So you can see our opportunity spans multiple therapeutic areas. XELJANZ in Europe, I think, is based on a very comprehensive file. We have 6 complete clinical trials, with 2 upper label extension. And all our program contains more than 19,000 patients here, more than 6,000 patients, and long-term extension up to 8 year. And please, I want to just remind everyone that XELJANZ has been used by more than 6,500 physician and more than 50,000 patients in U.S. with a very favorable profile.

And the value of the patients our society. But there's also an element of total affordability. So I think the ability of companies to have the complete regime, like in Pfizer's case, the PD-L1, the OX40, the 4-1BB or a small molecule, will enable offerings to pay that I think society will find acceptable from a cost-benefit return as distinct from looking at the complications of acquiring all of those elements separately in the marketplace. On pricing itself, I do -- I agree with you, there is a large amount of rhetoric given the election year and there is concerns from individuals about accessing pharmaceuticals. This is extremely complex. It's in great part due to the pressure on plants that have been transformed away from having the ability to really be an insurance company and become somewhat more a benefit administrators and insurers. It has to do with the quality of insurance and also to do with the value of these specialty products. So I expect a robust discussion, but I expect that, in the end, the United States will continue to support innovation and find ways to make sure that innovation is supported and products get to patients. And that will obviously be a robust policy discussion. But I do think in the end, that's where the United States will end up in that discussion. On PBMs, in a market-based system, PBMs provide value by aggregating volumes and negotiating discounts. To the extent those discounts are passed on to the end user or the end payer or an appropriate amount is passed on and they're serving a valid market function, as the market changes, they may have a larger or smaller role. But I think what I would emphasize is, I like to see a marketplace work. I like to see incentives in the marketplace and ensure it works. And I like to see the appropriate amount of transparency. So that's really what I can really comment on that."

And more recently, we are also studying [indiscernible] mutant lung cancer combining IBRANCE with our own triple 7 5 [indiscernible] inhibitor. Also within breast cancer, we see opportunities and having initiated triple therapy based on IBRANCE as well as we are looking at the novel segment of breast cancer that may go from ER into double positive segments. So substantial opportunities. And of course, our enthusiast growing as we see how well IBRANCE is performing, the patient experience is so good and our studies  confirmatory studies deliver real encouraging data."

During my remarks this morning, I will briefly recap the highlights from the quarter and comment on our strategies, including expected pipeline development this year, our approach to business development in light of our decision not to move forward with Allergan and the steps we expect to take to assess the potential split of the company. 
2016 is off to a good start, with solid performance across both the Innovative and Established businesses. Notably, Prevnar 13, IBRANCE, Eliquis and Chantix are performing better than we initially projected. 
As we referenced in our earnings release, a portion of the growth in the quarter was attributable to additional selling days compared to the year-ago quarter, which will be offset in the fourth quarter from a growth perspective. We nonetheless had a strong quarter financially even without that impact, exceeding our internal projections and incorporated the strong operational performance as well as the recent weakening of the dollar into our updated financial guidance for the year. 
And compared to the first quarter, we expect that our LOE impact from Lyrica, Rebif, Enbrel will be more pronounced in the remaining quarters of the year. Additionally, new product launch expenses and R&D investment are also phased higher for the remainder of the year. Frank will provide more details in a few minutes. 
Overall, looking at the quarter, on a revenue basis, Pfizer stand-alone business, excluding Hospira grew 15% operationally, and 26% operationally with the inclusion of Hospira. Our Innovative business generated impressive operational revenue growth of 28%, driven by the performance of Eliquis globally and IBRANCE, Prevnar 13, Lyrica, Xeljanz, Chantix and Nexium 24HR, principally in the U.S. 
Of particular note, IBRANCE has already earned broad patient and physician acceptance. Since launch in the U.S. last year, about 6,800 prescribers have treated approximately 28,000 women with HR+, HER2- metastatic breast cancer, and the feedback continues to be very encouraging, particularly around the efficacy and tolerability profile and impact on the overall quality of life.
Recently, we announced that the confirmatory Phase III PALOMA-2 trial for IBRANCE in first-line metastatic breast cancer met its primary endpoints of improving progression-free survival. Detailed results will be presented at ASCO in early June.
We're also seeing continued strong operational growth from Eliquis, which is yielding increased market penetration and market share gains in the U.S. and Japan. The contribution of Eliquis to our alliance revenue line more than doubled year-over-year. 
For the Prevnar 13 adult indication, while there was a year-over-year growth as expected, we saw a sequential quarterly decline in revenues given the rapid penetration we achieved in the U.S. market during 2015. The pediatric indication remains strong, and we anticipate that global revenues for the Prevnar 13 franchise in full year 2016 will be comparable to 2015. 
And we were pleased that the results from the EAGLES Study, the largest global clinical trial of smoking cessation medicines were published in The Lancet. The study was designed to compare the neuropsychiatric safety of Chantix and bupropion with placebo and nicotine patch in adult smokers with and without a history of psychiatric disorders. 
The authors concluded that the study did not show a significant increase in serious neuropsychiatric events with Chantix or bupropion relative to placebo or nicotine patch. The study also found that smokers treated with Chantix had significantly higher quit rates than those treated with bupropion, nicotine patch or placebo.
Turning now to our Established Business. It grew 24% operationally, primarily due to the additional revenues from legacy Hospira products. Without Hospira and the impact of foreign exchange, the business grew 1%. In particular, we saw strong performance from sterile injectables portfolio. The addition of Hospira's leading generic injectables portfolio with Pfizer's legacy branded injectables establishes Pfizer as the #1 in sterile injectables company globally. 
We now have one of the broadest and most diverse offerings of difficult to manufacture sterile injectable medicines, which are critically important for patients around the world. This leading market position, combined with our expanded biosimilars offering and the continued growth of Pfizer's legacy branded portfolio in Emerging Markets will help us to move the Established Pharmaceuticals business from a period of loss of exclusivity-driven decline to potential growth. 
The Hospira acquisition was a clear growth driver, and the integration continues to proceed well. We have addressed specific issues related to legacy Hospira's manufacturing and have developed a plan to implement Pfizer quality standards at the sites. And we have dedicated resources to support the sites as they complete their transition to the Pfizer network.
Based on Hospira's excellent strategic fit with our Established Business and our intense focus on integration of Hospira, we expect to exceed our original synergy targets of $800 million in annual cost savings by 2018 and now expect to achieve approximately $1 billion in cost savings. 
As you are aware, in early April, we decided not to move forward with the Allergan transaction due to the actions of the U.S. Treasury Department. Given these actions and the current political climate, we do not see any potential for a transaction involving inversions in the near term. 
While the outcome was disappointing, we always view the potential Allergan transaction not as a new strategy, but rather as a way to accelerate our existing strategy, which remains unchanged. Our strategy is anchored by several elements, namely, improving the company's revenue growth profile so the greater proportion of our earnings per share growth is driven by incremental revenue opportunities. 
Our latest product launches, including Eliquis, Xalkori, Xeljanz, IBRANCE and Prevnar 13 Adult have now become meaningful revenue contributors. In addition, the FDA's decision to approve Celltrion's biosimilar infliximab across all eligible indications marks a critical and positive step forward in helping to create a pathway for biosimilars in the U.S. We hold exclusive commercialization rights to this product in the U.S. 
While launch timing of Inflectra will ultimately depend upon a number of factors such as marketplace dynamics and intellectual property considerations, we are continuing with the preparation of our launch plans for 2016. 
Our current biosimilars portfolio includes 3 commercialized products available in select markets outside the U.S.: Inflectra, lovastatin and Retacrit. We believe that biosimilars represent an attractive revenue growth opportunity for expanding patient access to important treatments. 
We also see continued opportunities for our Established Pharm Business in Emerging Markets, with a robust portfolio positioned to compete in these markets. GEP revenues in Emerging Markets increased 10% operationally this quarter, and company-wide revenues in Emerging Markets increased 14% operationally. Emerging Markets revenues represented nearly 20% of our total company's revenue base.
We are also continuing to make significant progress in securing potential future growth drivers across the advancement of our pipeline. Specific examples include the planned submissions for ulcerative colitis for Xeljanz, which is on track to occur in first half of 2017; the acceptance for review of the Xeljanz EU filing for rheumatoid arthritis. We have completed enrollment of the bococizumab SPIRE-2 outcomes trial. While it can be hard to predict duration of trial of time to events trial, we currently anticipate the potential completion of this outcome study in the second half of 2017. 
Presentation of ertugliflozin's Phase III data at the American Diabetes Association meeting in June and a potential regulatory filing in the U.S.: the tanezumab Phase III program, where we are now conducting trials for osteoarthritis, chronic low back pain and cancer pain indications; a potential regulatory decision in the EU for IBRANCE in combination with endocrine therapy for the treatment of HR+, HER2- advanced metastatic breast cancer; and for inotuzumab for adult patients with relapsed or refractory CD22-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We are in discussions with the FDA on our next steps to bringing this important medicine to patients. 
Behind these assets is a strong and early mid-stage pipeline, most notably, a broad portfolio of IO compounds which continue to advance. Our avelumab PD-L1 program with Merck KGaA has ramped up rapidly and now has last 30 programs ongoing, both as monotherapy and in combination with other portfolio of assets, 8 of which are potentially registration-enabling. 
We continue to expect that the key advances in IO will come from novel combinations, both double and triple combination regimes, and technologies that may have the potential to treat more patients with immunotherapy ultimately transform the cancer treatment paradigm. We have several combination studies that are already in the clinic with our key combination assets being 4-1BB and OX40. 
We also have a range of immuno-oncology assets moving into the clinic, including our allogeneic CAR-T program in collaboration with Cellectis and Servier; and a small molecule immunotherapy asset, IDO1, in collaboration with iTeos and our bispecific antibody P-cadherin.
Recently, we presented Phase II data at the AACR annual meeting, showing that IBRANCE was effective in slowing the multiplication of cancer cells in patients diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer who received no prior therapy. And we also expect that proof of concept readout with our next-generation ALK inhibitor, lorlatinib, in ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer patients towards the end of the year. Lorlatinib is our investigational follow-on drug to Xalkori. 
In neuroscience, we began a Phase II proof of concept study this quarter for our novel dopamine modulation asset for Parkinson's disease. If successful, this may have the potential to replace the standard of care in Parkinson's. 
In addition, through a collaboration with MedGenesis Therapeutix, we have a second compound being investigated in Parkinson's and expect to have a proof of concept study readout in the second half of the year. The compound is a GDNF protein and may have the potential to provide the first disease modifying treatment that slows the progressive decline in Parkinson's patients. 
In Vaccines, we expect to have C. difficile proof of concept readout towards the end of the year. C. difficile is a growing, hard-to-treat infection in the hospital and long-term care setting. Currently, there are no vaccines available to prevent the disease, and the infection control practice are challenging to implement. 
Overall, we are anticipating a steady stream of pipeline updates throughout 2016. Our strategy will also capitalize on the opportunities and specific expertise resulting from a distinct, competitive and growing businesses, namely our Innovative and Established business, each is led by strong leaders with the experience and know-how to effectively direct and grow these organizations. 
In addition to capitalizing on the strength of our pipeline, our strategy includes allocating our capital to shareholder-friendly initiatives with an eye towards sustainable value creation. This includes continuing to look for ways other than inversions to improve our tax rate. It also includes pursuing business development opportunities that use our capital efficiently in ways that create meaningful shareholder value, that have the potential for near-term solid creation, that strengthen our individual businesses with capabilities in key assets and enhance our leadership position in the most attractive core areas. 
As you know, we're also considering a potential separation of our Innovative and Established business. No decision has been made at this point, and we recently announced we plan to make an assessment of the merits of the separation by the end of 2016. By this time, we'll be completing our third and our final year of building the required seventh financials to support any split, and we'll also be in a position to complete the necessary financial analysis needed to determine if the time is right to move forward with the split. 
If we determine the time is right, then we expect to be in a position to execute a split by the end of 2017. And if we determine through our process that a split isn't appropriate, we will continue to have the flexibility to assess the option and proceed if and when we deem the time is right. 
Our decision framework has not changed. It continues to be based on these 4 questions. Are the business performing well within Pfizer? Could the business perform well as stand-alone entities? Is there a trapped value in the combined entity? And can a trapped value be unlocked efficiently? Throughout the year, we'll be assessing our performance in each of these factors. 
In summary, the business is performing well, driven by a sound strategy. The outlook for the year is strong based on a demonstrated ability of the Innovative and Established business to execute against this goal. We have a healthy pipeline with strong candidates at every stage of the pipeline, and we have the financial flexibility and several options to creating short-term and long-term value for shareholders. 
I'll now turn it over to Frank, and thank you."

As always, the charts I am reviewing today are included in our webcast. As a reminder, because we completed the acquisition of Hospira in September 3, 2015, Pfizer's first quarter 2016 financial results include 3 months of legacy Hospira global operations compared to the first quarter 2015 results, which do not include any legacy Hospira operations.
Now moving on to the financials. We had a good quarter. First quarter 2016 reported revenues were approximately $13 billion and reflect year-over-year operational growth of $2.9 billion or 26%, of which $1.2 billion or 11% is attributable to the inclusion of legacy Hospira operations and approximately $900 million or 8% is attributable to 5 additional selling days in the U.S. and 4 additional selling days in the international markets in the first quarter of '16 versus the year-ago quarter. 
Excluding legacy Hospira operations and these additional selling days, reported revenues grew $800 million or 7% operationally, which reflects continued strong performance of IBRANCE, Prevnar 13, Eliquis, Xeljanz, Lyrica and Chantix, and a 14% operational growth in Emerging Markets, which were partially offset by the absorption of an approximately $300 million negative operational impact due to product losses of exclusivity. 
With respect to selling days, I want to point out that because of our accounting calendar, there was a  greater variability of selling days during the quarters in '15 than there will be in 2016, but this will not impact total number of selling days or our revenue for 2016. To illustrate, there were 5 more U.S. and 4 more international selling days in the first quarter of '16 compared with the year-ago quarter, and there are 4 fewer U.S. and 3 fewer international selling days in the fourth quarter of '16 versus the fourth quarter 2015. 
So the imbalance in selling days we saw in the first quarter will be offset in the fourth quarter 2016, and there will be essentially the same number of selling days in full-year '16 as in full year 2015. Consequently, the only impact will be to the quarterly year-over-year comparisons notably for the first and fourth quarters. 
Reported revenues continue to be unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of $729 million or 7%, including losses related to the Venezuelan bolivar. 
First quarter adjusted diluted EPS was $0.67 versus $0.51 in the year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to increased revenues, the inclusion of Hospira operations, a lower effective tax rates and fewer diluted weighted average shares outstanding, which declined by 78 million shares versus the year-ago quarter, due to our share repurchase program, which includes the impact of our $5 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement executed in February of 2015 and completed in July of '15 and by another 136 million shares associated with a partial quarter benefit from an accelerated share repurchase agreement executed in March of 2016, which were partially offset by an aggregate operational increase and adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses and adjusted R&D expenses of $1.1 billion or 16%; $0.07 negative impact due to foreign exchange and continuing product losses of exclusivity. 
Reported diluted EPS was $0.49 compared with $0.38 in the year-ago quarter due to the previously mentioned factors and the favorable impact of lower charges for business and legal entity alignment activities incurred during the first quarter, which were partially offset by higher acquisition-related costs, legal charges, purchase accounting adjustments and higher asset impairment charges. 
Foreign exchange negatively impacted first quarter reported revenues by approximately $729 million or 7% and positively impacted adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses and adjusted R&D expenses, in the aggregate, by $197 million or 3%. As a result, foreign exchange negatively impacted first quarter adjusted diluted EPS by approximately $0.07 compared with the year-ago quarter. 
The results for the GIP, VOC and GEP businesses are available and can be found at the end of the presentation, that is posted on our website. 
Moving on to our 2016 financial guidance. We are updating our 2016 reported revenues and adjusted diluted EPS ranges due to our strong performance to date and improved business outlook for 2016 as well as the favorable impact from foreign exchange rates since mid-January 2016. 
Consequently, we raised the midpoint of our 2016 revenue guidance by $2 billion and the midpoint of our 2016 adjusted diluted EPS guidance range by $0.18. We now expect 2016 reported revenues to be in the range of $51 billion to $53 billion versus our previous expectation of $49 billion to $51 billion, and we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.38 to $2.48 versus our previous expectation of $2.20 to $2.30. 
I want to punctuate what Ian said previously. Operational factors, such as our strong performance to date in 2016, in addition to our improved business outlook for 2016, favorably impacted the midpoint of reported revenue guidance range by approximately $1 billion and the adjusted diluted EPS guidance range by $0.12. Favorable changes in foreign exchange rates since mid-January 2016 also favorably impacted the midpoint of the reported revenue guidance range by approximately $1 billion and the adjusted diluted EPS guidance range by $0.06. 
Finally, given our first quarter results and the benefit of continued support of recently launched products as well as foreign exchange, we are raising the midpoint of our adjusted SI&A guidance range by $500 million. Consequently, we now expect adjusted SI&A expenses to be in the range of $13.7 billion to $14.7 billion.
Moving on to key takeaways. This quarter marks our sixth consecutive quarter of Pfizer stand-alone operational revenue growth, which was primarily driven by new products that are early in their life cycles such as IBRANCE, Prevnar 13, Eliquis, Xeljanz and Lyrica and additional selling days during the first quarter. 
As I just mentioned, we raised the midpoints of our 2016 reported revenues and adjusted diluted EPS guidance ranges to reflect strong operational performance to date, favorable changes in foreign exchange rates and improved business outlook for 2016. We accomplished several key R&D milestones during the first quarter. We continued to deliver significant value to shareholders in the form of $1.9 billion in the first quarter 2016 dividends and a $5 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement executed in March 2016. And finally, we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2016 and beyond. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Chuck."

There's obviously a significant cost burden attached with that. Could you talk to the idea of where you feel specialist care pricing is going in the U.S. and how quickly? Is biosimilars cost effectiveness arguments in the gridlock house sufficient to maintain status quo? Or how do you anticipate and how quickly do you anticipate change? Second, on PBMs. Again, to Ian, some of your peers have identified PBMs as bad actors in the whole healthcare value chain given their disproportionate rebate capture. Do you believe that PBMs or rather pricing transparency is a good or bad thing from an industry perspective? And then finally for Mikael, I saw some data recently on SELZENTRY, your CCR 5 antagonist in immuno oncology setting. Do you have any plans to develop that drug within that setting? Or is the IP an issue?"

And the value of the patients of our society. But there's also an element of total affordability. So I think the ability of companies to have the complete regime, like in Pfizer's case, the PD-L1, the OX40, the 4-1BB or a small molecule, will enable offerings to payer that I think society will find acceptable from a cost-benefit return as distinct from looking at the complications of acquiring all of those elements separately in the marketplace. On pricing itself, I do -- I agree with you, there is a large amount of rhetoric given the election year and there is concerns from individuals about accessing pharmaceuticals. This is extremely complex. It's in great part due to the pressure on plants that have been transformed away from having the ability to really be an insurance company and become somewhat more a benefit administrators and insurers. It has to do with the quality of insurance and also to do with the value of these specialty products. So I expect a robust discussion, but I expect that, in the end, the United States will continue to support innovation and find ways to make sure that innovation is supported and products get to patients. And that will obviously be a robust policy discussion. But I do think in the end, that's where the United States will end up in that discussion. On PBMs, in a market-based system, PBMs provide value by aggregating volumes and negotiating discounts. To the extent those discounts are passed on to the end user or the end payer or an appropriate amount is passed on and they're serving a valid market function, as the market changes, they may have a larger or smaller role. But I think what I would emphasize is, I like to see a marketplace work. I like to see incentives in the marketplace and ensure it works. And I like to see the appropriate amount of transparency. So that's really what I can really comment on that."

I mean, Eliquis is performing extremely well with an LOE in the United States,  Eliquis in 2019. So LYRICA, that is. LYRICA. Eliquis is doing very well.  XELJANZ is doing well. So I think the priorities are, continue to ensure that our science comes to market, grow our in-line products, which we think we are doing well; execute on capital discipline, which we continue to do. And in our Established Products business, it's to roll out successfully the biosimilar strategy, to continue to utilize and maximize the value of our sterile injectables around the world. So frankly, I think there's lots to do in that area. We'll continue to look at our tax situations. We have a very good tax group. Frank and his team are very good at looking how to improve that. It continues to be an area of focus. Vis a vis IBRANCE, I agree with you that the trials are in the timelines you talked about, but that's the nature of the trials in oncology. And the reality is, we have already started those trials and are well ahead of any live competition. So it's a matter of a lead established in the marketplace. So I'm very optimistic about the long-term growth rates of IBRANCE, both in the indications it has now and the indications to come as we go earlier in the breast cancer and also outside of breast cancer.

During my remarks this morning, I will briefly recap the highlights from the quarter and comment on our strategies, including expected pipeline development this year, our approach to business development in li",2091,"Thank you, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. During my remarks this morning, I will briefly recap the highlights from the quarter and comment on our strategies, including expected pipeline development this year, our approach to business development in light of our decision not to move forward with Allergan and the steps we expect to take to assess the potential split of the company. 
2016 is off to a good start, with solid performance across both the Innovative and Established businesses. Notably, Prevnar 13, IBRANCE, Eliquis and Chantix are performing better than we initially projected. 
As we referenced in our earnings release, a portion of the growth in the quarter was attributable to additional selling days compared to the year-ago quarter, which will be offset in the fourth quarter from a growth perspective. We nonetheless had a strong quarter financially even with that impact, exceeding our internal projections and incorporated the strong operational performance as well as the recent weakening of the dollar into our updated financial guidance for the year. 
And compared to the first quarter, we expect that our LOE impact from Lyrica, Rebif, Enbrel will be more pronounced in the remaining quarters of the year. Additionally, new product launch expenses and R&D investment are also phased higher for the remainder of the year. Frank will provide more details in a few minutes. 
Overall, looking at the quarter, on a revenue basis, Pfizer stand-alone business, excluding Hospira, grew 15% operationally, and 26% operationally with the inclusion of Hospira. Our Innovative business generated impressive operational revenue growth of 28%, driven by the performance of Eliquis globally, and IBRANCE, Prevnar 13, Lyrica, XELJANZ, Chantix and Nexium 24HR, principally in the U.S. 
Of particular note, IBRANCE has already earned broad patient and physician acceptance. Since launch in the U.S. last year, about 6,800 prescribers have treated approximately 28,000 women with HR+, HER2- metastatic breast cancer, and the feedback continues to be very encouraging, particularly around the efficacy and tolerability profile and impact on the overall quality of life.
Recently, we announced that the confirmatory Phase III PALOMA-2 trial for IBRANCE in first-line metastatic breast cancer met its primary endpoints of improving progression-free survival. Detailed results will be presented at ASCO in early June.
We're also seeing continued strong operational growth from Eliquis, which is yielding increased market penetration and market share gains in the U.S. and Japan. The contribution of Eliquis to our alliance revenue line more than doubled year-over-year. 
For the Prevnar 13 adult indication, while there was a year-over-year growth as expected, we saw a sequential quarterly decline in revenues given the rapid penetration we achieved in the U.S. market during 2015. The pediatric indication remains strong, and we anticipate that global revenues for the Prevnar 13 franchise in full year 2016 will be comparable to 2015. 
And we were pleased that the results from the EAGLES Study, the largest global clinical trial of smoking-cessation medicines, were published in The Lancet. The study was designed to compare the neuropsychiatric safety of Chantix and bupropion with placebo and nicotine patch in adult smokers with and without a history of psychiatric disorders. 
The authors concluded that the study did not show a significant increase in serious neuropsychiatric events with Chantix or bupropion relative to placebo or nicotine patch. The study also found that smokers treated with Chantix had significantly higher quit rates than those treated with bupropion, nicotine patch or placebo.
Turning now to our Established business. It grew 24% operationally, primarily due to the additional revenues from legacy Hospira products. Without Hospira and the impact of foreign exchange, the business grew 1%. In particular, we saw strong performance from the sterile injectables portfolio. The addition of Hospira's leading generic injectables portfolio with Pfizer's legacy branded injectables establishes Pfizer as the #1 sterile injectables company globally. 
We now have one of the broadest and most diverse offerings of difficult-to-manufacture sterile injectable medicines, which are critically important for patients around the world. This leading market position, combined with our expanded biosimilars offering and the continued growth of Pfizer's legacy branded portfolio in Emerging Markets, will help us to move the Established Pharmaceuticals business from a period of loss of exclusivity-driven decline to potential growth. 
The Hospira acquisition was a clear growth driver, and the integration continues to proceed well. We have addressed specific issues related to legacy Hospira's manufacturing and have developed a plan to implement Pfizer quality standards at the sites. And we have dedicated resources to support the sites as they complete their transition to the Pfizer network.
Based on Hospira's excellent strategic fit with our Established business and our intense focus on integration of Hospira, we expect to exceed our original synergy targets of $800 million in annual cost savings by 2018 and now expect to achieve approximately $1 billion in cost savings. 
As you are aware, in early April, we decided not to move forward with the Allergan transaction due to the actions of the U.S. Treasury Department. Given these actions and the current political climate, we do not see any potential for a transaction involving inversions in the near term. 
While the outcome was disappointing, we always view the potential Allergan transaction not as a new strategy, but rather as a way to accelerate our existing strategy, which remains unchanged. Our strategy is anchored by several elements, namely, improving the company's revenue growth profile so that a greater proportion of our earnings-per-share growth is driven by incremental revenue opportunities. 
Our latest product launches, including Eliquis, Xalkori, XELJANZ, IBRANCE and Prevnar 13 Adult, have now become meaningful revenue contributors. In addition, the FDA's decision to approve Celltrion's biosimilar infliximab across all eligible indications marks a critical and positive step forward in helping to create a pathway for biosimilars in the U.S. We hold the exclusive commercialization rights to this product in the U.S. 
While launch timing of Inflectra will ultimately depend upon a number of factors such as marketplace dynamics and intellectual property considerations, we are continuing with the preparation of our launch plans for 2016. 
Our current biosimilars portfolio includes 3 commercialized products available in select markets outside the U.S.: Inflectra, lovastatin and Retacrit. We believe that biosimilars represent an attractive revenue growth opportunity for expanding patient access to important treatments. 
We also see continued opportunities for our Established Pharm Business in Emerging Markets, with a robust portfolio positioned to compete in these markets. GEP revenues in Emerging Markets increased 10% operationally this quarter, and company-wide revenues in Emerging Markets increased 14% operationally. Emerging Markets revenues represented nearly 20% of our total company's revenue base.
We are also continuing to make significant progress in securing potential future growth drivers across the advancement of our pipeline. Specific examples include the planned submissions for ulcerative colitis for XELJANZ, which is on track to occur in first half of 2017; the acceptance for review of the XELJANZ EU filing for rheumatoid arthritis. We have completed enrollment of the bococizumab SPIRE-2 outcomes trial. While it can be hard to predict duration of trial -- of a time-to-events trial, we currently anticipate the potential completion of this outcome study in the second half of 2017. 
Presentation of ertugliflozin's Phase III data at the American Diabetes Association meeting in June and a potential regulatory filing in the U.S.; the tanezumab Phase III program, where we are now conducting trials for osteoarthritis, chronic low back pain and cancer pain indications; a potential regulatory decision in the EU for IBRANCE in combination with endocrine therapy for the treatment of HR+, HER2- advanced metastatic breast cancer; and for inotuzumab for adult patients with relapsed or refractory CD22-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We are in discussions with the FDA on our next steps to bringing this important medicine to patients. 
Behind these assets is a strong early and mid-stage pipeline, most notably, a broad portfolio of IO compounds which continue to advance. Our avelumab PD-L1 program with Merck KGaA has ramped up rapidly and now has last 30 programs ongoing, both as monotherapy and in combination with other portfolio assets, 8 of which are potentially registration enabling. 
We continue to expect that the key advances in IO will come from novel combinations, both double and triple combination regimes, and technologies that may have the potential to treat more patients with immunotherapy ultimately transform the cancer treatment paradigm. We have several combination studies that are already in the clinic with our key combination assets being 4-1BB and OX40. 
We also have a range of immuno-oncology assets moving into the clinic, including our allogeneic CAR-T program in collaboration with Cellectis and Servier; and a small molecule immunotherapy asset, IDO1, in collaboration with iTeos; and our bispecific antibody P-cadherin.
Recently, we presented Phase II data at the AACR annual meeting, showing that IBRANCE was effective in slowing the multiplication of cancer cells in patients diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer who received no prior therapy. And we also expect our proof-of-concept readout with our next-generation ALK inhibitor, lorlatinib, in ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer patients towards the end of the year. Lorlatinib is our investigational follow-on drug to Xalkori. 
In neuroscience, we began a Phase II proof-of-concept study this quarter for our novel dopamine modulation asset for Parkinson's disease. If successful, this may have the potential to replace the standard of care in Parkinson's. 
In addition, through a collaboration with MedGenesis Therapeutix, we have a second compound being investigated in Parkinson's and expect to have a proof-of-concept study read out in the second half of the year. The compound is a GDNF protein and may have the potential to provide the first disease-modifying treatment that slows the progressive decline in Parkinson's patients. 
In Vaccines, we expect to have C. difficile proof-of-concept readout towards the end of the year. C. difficile is a growing, hard-to-treat infection in the hospital and long-term care setting. Currently, there are no vaccines available to prevent the disease, and the infection control practices are challenging to implement. 
Overall, we are anticipating a steady stream of pipeline updates throughout 2016. Our strategy will also capitalize on the opportunities and specific expertise resulting from our distinct, competitive and growing businesses, namely our Innovative and Established business. Each is led by strong leaders with the experience and know-how to effectively direct and grow these organizations. 
In addition to capitalizing on the strength of our pipeline, our strategy includes allocating our capital to shareholder-friendly initiatives with an eye towards sustainable value creation. This includes continuing to look for ways other than inversions to improve our tax rate. It also includes pursuing business development opportunities that use our capital efficiently in ways that create meaningful shareholder value, that have the potential for near-term solid value creation, that strengthen our individual businesses with capabilities in key assets and enhance our leadership position in the most attractive core areas. 
As you know, we're also considering a potential separation of our Innovative and Established business. No decision has been made at this point, and we recently announced we plan to make an assessment of the merits of the separation by the end of 2016. By this time, we'll be completing our third and final year of building the required set of [ph] financials to support any split, and we'll also be in a position to complete the necessary financial analysis needed to determine if the time is right to move forward with the split. 
If we determine the time is right, then we expect to be in a position to execute a split by the end of 2017. And if we determine through our process that a split isn't appropriate, we will continue to have the flexibility to assess the option and proceed if and when we deem the time is right. 
Our decision framework has not changed. It continues to be based on these 4 questions. Are the businesses performing well within Pfizer? Could the businesses perform well as stand-alone entities? Is there a trapped value in the combined entity? And can the trapped value be unlocked efficiently? Throughout the year, we'll be assessing our performance in each of these factors. 
In summary, the business is performing well, driven by a sound strategy. The outlook for the year is strong based on a demonstrated ability of the Innovative and Established business to execute against this goal. We have a healthy pipeline with strong candidates at every stage of the pipeline, and we have the financial flexibility and several options to creating short-term and long-term value for shareholders. 
I'll now turn it over to Frank, and thank you."

As always, the charts I am reviewing today are included in our webcast. As a reminder, because we completed the acquisition of Hospira in September 3, 2015, Pfizer's first quarter 2016 financial results include 3 months of",1061,"Thanks, Ian. Good day, everyone. As always, the charts I am reviewing today are included in our webcast. As a reminder, because we completed the acquisition of Hospira in September 3, 2015, Pfizer's first quarter 2016 financial results include 3 months of legacy Hospira global operations compared to the first quarter 2015 results, which do not include any legacy Hospira operations.
Now moving on to the financials. We had a good quarter. First quarter 2016 reported revenues were approximately $13 billion and reflect year-over-year operational growth of $2.9 billion or 26%, of which $1.2 billion or 11% is attributable to the inclusion of legacy Hospira operations and approximately $900 million or 8% is attributable to 5 additional selling days in the U.S. and 4 additional selling days in the international markets in the first quarter of '16 versus the year-ago quarter. 
Excluding legacy Hospira operations and these additional selling days, reported revenues grew $800 million or 7% operationally, which reflects continued strong performance of IBRANCE, Prevnar 13, Eliquis, XELJANZ, Lyrica and Chantix, and a 14% operational growth in Emerging Markets, which were partially offset by the absorption of an approximately $300 million negative operational impact due to product losses of exclusivity. 
With respect to selling days, I want to point out that because of our accounting calendar, there was a greater variability of selling days during the quarters in '15 than there will be in 2016, but this will not impact total number of selling days or our revenue for 2016. To illustrate, there were 5 more U.S. and 4 more international selling days in the first quarter of '16 compared with the year-ago quarter, and there are 4 fewer U.S. and 3 fewer international selling days in the fourth quarter of '16 versus the fourth quarter 2015. 
So the imbalance in selling days we saw in the first quarter will be offset in the fourth quarter 2016, and there will be essentially the same number of selling days in full-year '16 as in full year 2015. Consequently, the only impact will be to the quarterly year-over-year comparisons, notably for the first and fourth quarters. 
Reported revenues continue to be unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of $729 million or 7%, including losses related to the Venezuelan bolivar. 
First quarter adjusted diluted EPS was $0.67 versus $0.51 in the year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to increased revenues, the inclusion of Hospira operations, a lower effective tax rate and fewer diluted weighted average shares outstanding, which declined by 78 million shares versus the year-ago quarter due to our share repurchase program, which includes the impact of our $5 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement executed in February of 2015 and completed in July of '15, and by another 136 million shares associated with a partial-quarter benefit from an accelerated share repurchase agreement executed in March of 2016, which were partially offset by an aggregate operational increase and adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses and adjusted R&D expenses of $1.1 billion or 16%, $0.07 negative impact due to foreign exchange and continuing product losses of exclusivity. 
Reported diluted EPS was $0.49 compared with $0.38 in the year-ago quarter due to the previously mentioned factors and the favorable impact of lower charges for business and legal entity alignment activities incurred during the first quarter, which were partially offset by higher acquisition-related costs, legal charges, purchase accounting adjustments and higher asset impairment charges. 
Foreign exchange negatively impacted first quarter reported revenues by approximately $729 million or 7% and positively impacted adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses and adjusted R&D expenses, in the aggregate, by $197 million or 3%. As a result, foreign exchange negatively impacted first quarter adjusted diluted EPS by approximately $0.07 compared with the year-ago quarter. 
The results for the GIP, VOC and GEP businesses are available and can be found at the end of the presentation that is posted on our website. 
Moving on to our 2016 financial guidance. We are updating our 2016 reported revenues and adjusted diluted EPS ranges due to our strong performance to date and improved business outlook for 2016 as well as the favorable impact from foreign exchange rates since mid-January 2016. 
Consequently, we raised the midpoint of our 2016 revenue guidance by $2 billion and the midpoint of our 2016 adjusted diluted EPS guidance range by $0.18. We now expect 2016 reported revenues to be in the range of $51 billion to $53 billion versus our previous expectation of $49 billion to $51 billion, and we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.38 to $2.48 versus our previous expectation of $2.20 to $2.30. 
I want to punctuate what Ian said previously. Operational factors, such as our strong performance to date in 2016, in addition to our improved business outlook for 2016, favorably impacted the midpoint of reported revenue guidance range by approximately $1 billion and the adjusted diluted EPS guidance range by $0.12. Favorable changes in foreign exchange rates since mid-January 2016 also favorably impacted the midpoint of the reported revenue guidance range by approximately $1 billion and the adjusted diluted EPS guidance range by $0.06. 
Finally, given our first quarter results and the benefit of continued support of recently launched products as well as foreign exchange, we are raising the midpoint of our adjusted SI&A guidance range by $500 million. Consequently, we now expect adjusted SI&A expenses to be in the range of $13.7 billion to $14.7 billion.
Moving on to key takeaways. This quarter marks our sixth consecutive quarter of Pfizer stand-alone operational revenue growth, which was primarily driven by new products that are early in their life cycles such as IBRANCE, Prevnar 13, Eliquis, XELJANZ and Lyrica, and additional selling days during the first quarter. 
As I just mentioned, we raised the midpoints of our 2016 reported revenues and adjusted diluted EPS guidance ranges to reflect strong operational performance to date, favorable changes in foreign exchange rates and improved business outlook for 2016. We accomplished several key R&D milestones during the first quarter. We continued to deliver significant value to shareholders in the form of $1.9 billion in the first quarter 2016 dividends and a $5 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement executed in March 2016. And finally, we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2016 and beyond. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Chuck."

It's not as easy for the Established because really the Established business is a unique business, including strong sterile injectables, strong biosimilar capabilities in big Emerging Markets.

On the -- on whether we can unleash where there's trapped value, we'll obviously use outside advisers. But one of the classic methods would simply be to look at the sum of the parts as much as we can establish by disaggregating our business the same way as we give you information to do, so we can take those businesses and compare them to stand-alone businesses and see what a potential evaluation would be with the parts and compare it to the sum. That is one way of looking at that trapped value. Another is to look historically at what has happened to companies that -- whether they're spun -- or where they've been spun in an unforced manner, i.e., because of management's decision and not because of activist pressure, and see what has happened to the shares of those companies subsequently.

Can you confirm or not confirm that, that decision would be a yes or no, that you would split by the end of '17? Or should we be extending our timeline for the actual timing of a split? And then number two, I know you've sort given this before, Frank, but can you just comment, roughly speaking, on what you see the go-forward growth rates for both the growth business and the Established products business being? I think you've kind of given us a ballpark figure for that, I know there's no official guidance out there, but just a ballpark figure, it would be nice to get those ballparks refreshed. And then finally, you had made some commentary, Frank, around -- I think you've made some commentary around the leverage ratio that the Allergan Pfizer newco -- you'd be willing to take the Allergan Pfizer newco to. I was just wondering now that obviously Allergan is not going to be part of the future, what kind of leverage ratio you guys would go to, sort of maximum, and whether or not you would be willing to take out debt in order to do a large share repurchase?"

So by the way, if I was willing to do it for that, I'd be willing to do it for the right transaction on a going-forward basis. In terms of leveraging the balance sheet for buybacks, the way I think about this is if you go back to 2010 and if you include the $5 billion accelerated share repurchase that we added this past March, $50.7 billion of share buybacks, $50.7 billion, 1.9 billion of shares, excluding the 405 million shares as a result of the Zoetis exchange, so we've done actually a massive buyback without having to borrow and leverage the balance sheet, which allows us to keep our powder dry if we wanted to do different a kind of a transaction.

We have 85 projects spread across Phase I to Phase III registration. And let me just mention a couple that we think will be really unique and differentiating. We already touched base on 4-1BB and OX40 and a triple IO combo. Lorlatinib in the ALK and ROS space is generating very interesting data that we will start to share. We have a novel ADC called PTK-7 that we also see some really interesting response rate. In the immuno-inflammation field, in addition to XELJANZ, we now have 4 different immunokinases going into Phase II, with several highly specific JAKs going to inflammatory bowel disease, dermatological inflammation and lupus. So we will share more data around those, but I think they would really move the entire JAK field over time into new areas and with new profiles. Vaccines, it's our C. diff and Staph aureus that we are really excited about. And Ian mentioned in his introduction that we have built some interesting assets in Parkinson with a completely novel dopamine modulator and also have an interesting GDNF study together with MedGenesis. And finally, in rare disease, I'll exemplify that we have a growing sickle-cell franchise with rivipansel and a plan to start PDE9 as a way to prevent occurrence of a difficult-to-treat rare disease episode. So you can see our opportunity spans multiple therapeutic areas. XELJANZ in Europe, I think, is based on a very comprehensive file. We have 6 complete clinical trials, with 2 open-label extension. And all our program contains more than 19,000 patients here, more than 6,000 patients in long-term extension up to 8 year. And please, I want to just remind everyone that XELJANZ has been used by more than 6,500 physician and more than 50,000 patients in U.S. with a very favorable profile.

In just over a year in the market, IBRANCE has been prescribed by almost 7,000 physicians and reaching more than 28,000 patients. This rapid uptake is a testament to its efficacy and outstanding safety profile, with a very low rate of Global 3/4 GI effects such as fatigue and diarrhea.

But there's also an element of total affordability. So I think the ability of companies to have the complete regime, like in Pfizer's case, the PD-L1, the OX40, the 4-1BB or a small molecule, will enable offerings to payers that I think society will find acceptable from a cost-benefit return as distinct from looking at the complications of acquiring all of those elements separately in the marketplace. On pricing itself, I do -- I agree with you, there is a large amount of rhetoric given the election year, and there is concerns from individuals about accessing pharmaceuticals. This is extremely complex. It's in great part due to the pressure on plans that have been transformed away from having the ability to really be an insurance company and become somewhat more a benefit administrators and insurers. It has to do with the quality of insurance and also to do with the value of these specialty products. So I expect a robust discussion, but I expect that, in the end, the United States will continue to support innovation and find ways to make sure that innovation is supported and products get to patients. And that will obviously be a robust policy discussion. But I do think in the end, that's where the United States will end up in that discussion. On PBMs, in a market-based system, PBMs provide value by aggregating volumes and negotiating discounts. To the extent those discounts are passed on to the end user or the end payer or an appropriate amount is passed on, then they're serving a valid market function. As the market changes, they may have a larger or smaller role. But I think what I would emphasize is, I like to see a marketplace work. I like to see incentives in the marketplace and ensure it works. And I like to see the appropriate amount of transparency. So that's really all I can really comment on that."

We will present details at ASCO with an oral presentation, we'll be a late breaker. Now this trial provides additional confirmatory evidence on the benefits of IBRANCE for breast cancer patient. So this will add to the momentum, obviously. Also will be used for regulatory filings. It is a requirement from FDA so that we can convert the accelerated approval to a permanent approval. And we plan to file. We are in discussions now with the FDA. In EU, we have already filed and we have an accepted filing based on PALOMA-1 and 3. But also we have submitted already PALOMA-2 over there as additional supporting data. And as we said before, we expect to receive IBRANCE approval in U.S. as early as this year if eventually -- in Europe, as early as this year, if we had a positive opinion from European authorities."

In some cases, within the same country, it's happening district-by-district. So we are working very intensively on that because we see the opportunity as a major one. But moving to how we are doing with our expansion into other breast cancer segments and, particularly, into the adjuvant setting. Actually, we have 2 studies in the adjuvant setting. That's PENELOPE-B, which is for high-risk early breast cancer, and we have PALLAS for intermediate-risk early breast cancer. They're recruiting very nicely right now. I need to also emphasize that we have another one, which is in pilot, is a collaborative study, but it is in the neoadjuvant setting, with collaboration with the Washington University."

During my remarks, I will briefly talk about the performance of the business and provide some thoughts regarding each of our businesses and our pipeline. 
Our financial performance here today is strong, even stripping out the impact of our Legacy Hospira business, who reported another quarter operational revenue growth that is driving our solid EPS performance. We achieved this through continued strong performance of new products, in addition do patent-protected products that are later in their life cycle, as well as operational growth in emerging markets. This was accomplished despite some continued headwinds from products loss exclusivity. 
As you know, to ensure the appropriate level of focus and autonomy, we have evolved our operating model into 2 distinct businesses, Innovative Business, we now call Pfizer Innovative Health and, an Established Business, we now call Pfizer Essential Health. Through the first 6 months of the year, the businesses are executing well against their strategies, as demonstrated by each unit's results. 
A few words about each. The Pfizer Innovative Health has continuously strengthened our core brands, including Ibrance, Eliquis, Xeljanz, Lyrica and Chantix. Most specifically, Xeljanz has been prescribed to more than 50,000 patients worldwide. Revenues for the quarter were $217 million, which represents 70% operational growth versus quarter 2 2015. 
Eliquis utilization adoption continues to rapidly increase. More than 3.5 million patients already have been prescribed Eliquis. It is now the  #1 prescribed [indiscernible] anticoagulant amongst cardiologists in the U.S., Japan and several European countries. 
As our partner Bristol-Myers reported, revenues in the second quarter was strong representing 75% of operational year-over-year growth and 90% year-to-date operational growth. 
Regarding IBRANCE, approximately 35,000 patients are now being treated with 7,600 prescribers since its launch in February last year. And it has now been approved in 14 countries in addition to the U.S. We anticipate receiving a decision from EU regulators around the end of the year. 
In Q2, we achieved revenues of $514 [ph] million and for the first 6 months of the year, a total of $942 million. Operating franchise continues to be a significant contributor. With the success of our adult launch in the U.S., approximately 40% of the adult 65 and plus population have been vaccinated as of the end of June, achieving year-over-year growth is now reduction in the number of U.S. adults age 65 that have not received that certain chart. We do, however, expect overall global Prevnar franchise sales for the full year to be comparable to slightly below 2015 levels. 
During the quarter, we closed the Anacor acquisition. This is a nice complementary [indiscernible] portfolio within the Innovative business. The Anacor acquisition is a great example optimistic bolt-on acquisitions sun Mark Foley with the pipeline product that is potentially close to [indiscernible]. 
In terms of the pipeline, we believe there are significant late-stage opportunities in the Innovative business in key areas such as human oncology, CV metabolic, vaccines, INI, rare diseases, neuroscience and pain 
In immunooncology, we started Phase III studies with avelumab in bladder and ovarian cancer, adding to numerous existing studies fully underway to compound [indiscernible] Merck KGaA, we plan to file avelumab for the treatment of metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma at the end of quarter 3 2016 in the U.S. and by the end of 2016 in EU .
[indiscernible] we're working with Servi on a joint clinical development program [indiscernible] top 19, a product developed by Cellectis exclusive rights to develop [indiscernible]  in the United States. And in June, Cellectis announced the first patient was treated in a Phase 1 pediatric B-cell acute lypoblastic trial, marking the first clinical trial of [indiscernible]. 
And last week, we expanded our immuno-oncology portfolio by entering to a development collaboration license and option agreement with Western Oncolytics. We are collaborating with them on the preclinical and clinical development oncolytic vaccinia virus, WO-12 through Phase I trials. Following the completion of the Phase I trial, we have an exclusive option to acquire WO-12. 
In the oncology portfolio, we completed our Phase III study for intotuzumab in adult patients with refractory CD22 acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Based on the study's results, we are planning to submissions and if approved intotuzumab could be a valuable new addition available treatment options for these patients. Currently, adult patients with relapsed refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia have a 5-year survival rate of less than 10% making these patients particularly difficult to treat. 
We also continue to see success with Xalkori, which is now the first and only FDA approved biomarker-driven therapy for the treatment of ROS1 positive metastatic non-small cell cancer. In a clinical trial with 50 [ph] patients, 2/3 responded to treatment and the median duration response [indiscernible] years. While patient population is limited, advanced patients limited treatment options. In July, CHMP adopted  a positive opinion, recommending expansion of the current indication for Xalkori to also include treatment of adults [indiscernible] advanced non-small cell lung cancer. This recommendation is now being reviewed by European Commission. 
In vaccines, we have 2 preventive vaccines [indiscernible] and [indiscernible] in Phase II clinical development. We expect to have C. difficile Phase II data towards the end of this year. 
In information and immunology, the Anacor acquisition has brought us [indiscernible]. It is important [indiscernible] first line treatment option for the 18 to 25 million children and adults in the U.S. mild to moderate atopic dermatitis. If approved, this would be a meaningful advancement for these patients who have not seen new treatment options for their condition in the last 15 years. 
Last month, the detailed results from the pivotal Phase III study were published in the period journal and a new drug application is currently under review by U.S. FDA with an expected action date in January 2017. 
In Xeljanz,  we have recently announced positive top line results from the 4 [ph] Phase II trial of Xeljanz that patient could moderately to severe active ulcerative colitis. The combined findings from the Phase III pivotal trial are encouraging and provide evidence that Xeljanz has the potential to be an effective new treatment option for [indiscernible] submission in UC. 
We also announced results from 2 pivotal trials in Xeljanz to use in patients. The [indiscernible] study along with a long-term extension study are expected to potential submission [indiscernible] positive [indiscernible] applications. 
In pain, we began enrollment in the Phase III studies. This program consists of  6 studies [indiscernible] 7,000 patients chronic pain, 3 in [indiscernible] 2 in pain [indiscernible] and 1 in cancer pain. The study results are projected to begin [indiscernible] 2018. 
We also are strengthening our therapy capabilities. we've announced [indiscernible] Bamboo [indiscernible] based in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, focused on developing gene therapies for the treatment of patients with rare diseases. The acquisition [indiscernible] are growing portfolio with preclinical assets including potential therapies [indiscernible]. 
In addition, we are making good progress in [indiscernible] including a Phase III [indiscernible] study in sickle cell disease. The lab partner [indiscernible] presented data [indiscernible] have received vaccination for SPK-9001, which is currently being investigated in an ongoing Phase I-II trial as potentially onetime treatment for hemophlia B. 
Turning now to Pfizer's essential health. The business continues to [indiscernible] stabilize. Excluding the impact of Hospira, the legacy Essential Health business is nearly flat on an operational revenue basis for the first half of the year as compared to a year ago. We continue to expect that this business has the potential to meet the operational growth through a combination of [indiscernible] portfolio. Much of this is aided by the Hospira acquisition, along with continued growth in emerging markets, which grew by [indiscernible] percent operationally in the second quarter without Hospira and other core areas for the business [indiscernible]. 
Of note, we are now the worldwide leader in biosimilars, according to revenue. And we expect to compete in the first wave of biosimilars [indiscernible] in the U.S. and recently announced an investment to develop a state-of-the-art global technology center economic development area in China. This innovative facility [indiscernible] manufacturer quality at the potential to benefit patients both in China and across the world. 
And to potentially further enhance the revenue growth in this business, we will continue actively manage and reshape our portfolio. Our overreaching objective Essential Health has not changed, to generate a modest but sustainable rate of revenue growth. I believe the businesses are in a good trajectory and we're taking actions to enable us to achieve prosperity. 
Turning now to a few comments regarding a potential split of the company. As we previously said, what we're assessing [indiscernible] separation and expect to arrive no later than end of this year. Let me add, this is not a make or break decision for the company. As I've shared with you, each of our businesses is performing well and we'll continue to pursue the strategies, including opportunistic business development, where appropriate [indiscernible] strategy. I will establish this decision around [indiscernible] 
As a reminder, our decision criteria for the split of the business has not changed. It's continuously based on 4 questions. Are the business [indiscernible] Pfizer? Could the business perform well standalone [indiscernible]? Does it attract from a value combined entity? And can we attract value be efficient? We will be thoughtful in evaluating [indiscernible] over the coming months. Our key and primary motivation [indiscernible] is shareholder value and return to shareholders. I don't view it being a long answer here. The decision will be taken in a straightforward context on the best [indiscernible] for shareholder value. 
In summary, we ended the second half of the year with positive momentum that has positioned us to deliver solid performance for the remainder of the year. Now, turn over to Frank who will go over detailed results of the quarter. Thank you."

Pfizer's second quarter and first half 2016 financial results include Hospira glo",731,"Thanks, Ian. Good day, everyone. As always, the I'm reviewing today are included in our webcast. As a reminder, we completed the acquisition of Hospira on September 3, 2015. Pfizer's second quarter and first half 2016 financial results include Hospira global operations while comparable prior year periods do not include any legacy Hospira operations. 
Now moving on to the financials. Second quarter revenues were approximately $13.1 billion, [indiscernible] year-over-year operational growth of $1.6 billion or 13%, which was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of $302 million or 3%. 
Legacy Hospira operations contributed $1.1 billion to revenues. If you exclude foreign exchange and the contribution from Legacy Hospira operations, Pfizer standalone revenues grew operationally by $458 million or 4%. 
In developed markets, operational revenue growth of $1.5 billion or 17% was driven by Legacy Hospira operations and the continued strong performance of Ibrance, Eliquis, Lyrica, which were partially offset by expected lower revenues from adult in the U.S. due to the high initial capture rate after its launch in the fourth quarter of 2014, resulting in a slower catchup opportunity versus the year-ago quarter product launch exclusivity and [indiscernible] the expiration of collaboration agreement to promote [indiscernible] in the U.S. 
In emerging markets, operational revenue growth of $116 million or 4% was driven by Legacy Hospira operations and certain essential health products primarily in China, which were partially offset by lower revenues for Prevnar 13 given the timing of purchase Gavi and the Vaccine Alliance and in certain other emerging markets. 
Second quarter recorded diluted EPS was $0.33 compared to $0.32 a year ago quarter due to higher impairment charges, product launch exclusivity, foreign exchange, higher charges for legal matters and the Allergan termination fee, which were partially offset by increased revenues in certain new, in-line and acquired products as well as lower effective tax rate. 
Second quarter adjusted diluted EPS was $0.64 versus $0.56 in the year-ago quarter. The increase is primarily due to increased revenues, lower effective tax rate and [indiscernible] weighted average shares outstanding that's declined by 106 million shares versus the year-ago quarter given our share repurchase program, which were partially offset by an aggregate operational increase adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses and adjusted R&D expenses of $913 million [ph] or 13% [ph] which includes the addition of Hospira operations in 2016, a $0.06 negative impact due to foreign exchange and continuing product losses of exclusivity. I want to point out that second quarter adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue increased year over year from 17.9% to 23.3%, primarily due to foreign exchange and the addition of Legacy Hospira operations. 
Also foreign exchange increased cost of sales while decreased in revenue as a percent of time, which is a typical exaggerated increase of our adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenues in the second quarter. Excluding foreign exchange impact, adjusted second quarter cost of sales as a percentage of revenue would have been 21.3%. We believe that this is an anomaly, rather than a trend, and we have maintained our 2016 adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue guidance. 
Foreign exchange negatively impacted second quarter revenue by approximately $302 million or 3% and negatively impacted the net of adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses and adjusted R&D expenses by $106 million or 1%. As a result, foreign exchange negatively impacted second quarter adjusted dilutive EPS by approximately $0.06 compared with the year-ago quarter. 
As you can see on the chart, we are reaffirming revenues and adjusted components of our 2016 financial guidance based on our strong performance to date and continued confidence in the business going forward. 
Moving on to key takeaways. We achieved another quarter of operational revenue growth driven by the inclusion of Legacy Hospira operations, new products that are early in their life cycles, such as IBRANCE, Eliquis and Xeljanz, as well as the solid performance from Lyrica. We reaffirm 2016 revenue and adjusted diluted EPS financial guidance. We announced and completed the acquisition of Anacor pharmaceuticals and accomplished several key product with pipeline milestones and we returned $8.7 billion to shareholders in the first half of 2016 through dividends and share repurchases, including a $5 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement. 
Finally, we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2016 and beyond. Now I'll turn it back to Chuck."

We continue to have very robust dialogue in the company preparing for this decision, certainly stress testing with our 2 management teams on issues of what initiatives inside these strategies could only be done if they were separate.

So biosimilars clearly is a very attractive market opportunity. Pfizer leader with biosimilars commercialized across all speak classes. So we are aiming with our development pipeline to really add to our leadership position in the market. Sterile injectables is another attractive segment and clear that was the primary driver of our acquisition with Hospira. We're the leader in that segment as well. We continue to be very positive about the opportunities with continued growth in Sterile Injectable business. And then the performance of our core brands in emerging markets continues to be strong. Our business performed well again in the second quarter, primarily driven by some of the I think incorporation of Hospira operations, but actually even, excluding the impact of Hospira we saw strong performance in the second quarter as well. And in addition to those core franchises, we also see [indiscernible] portfolio women's health continuing to be strong therapeutic areas for us where we have a leadership position. So when we put all of those drivers together, even in the face of the impact of LOEs that we are managing on behalf of the corporation, our aspiration in the medium term is to take the Essential Health business to a growth rate in the low to mid-single-digit range. And as a consequence, we believe we can add significant shareholder value through delivering that performance on a sustainable basis."

This does not immediately depends on the state of the different registrations and, frankly, we expect that to occur over a 2-year period post the integration. So some of the growth in the international will come once registrations are complete. And we continue to look at the total portfolio of the Essential Health business and look for ways to restructuring that. So that's part of the strategy of the team. In regard to the split, it's a good question, when you look at some of the splits in the pharma area and what is perceived as increase in value. Part of that is I think due to the fact that if you look at actually you said, the our Animal Health split or Baxter or the others, you have to question, number one, really, parts all invested in equally? I don't think they were. Were they getting the same amount of management attention, I don't think they were. In our particular case, we are investing in both segments, and there's a big difference between a division that you're spending [indiscernible] percent of your revenue and its management attention compared to a division that has 35% [ph] of your total revenues. So I think those are things were looking at. But I do acknowledge that there is this general assumption out there that split companies will improve their performance because no management [indiscernible] focus, which we are trying to deal with by having very distinct leaderships. And also we'd look some of that [indiscernible] so we look at the S&P 500 index. We look at Guggenheim, split company. But it's interesting if you look for 1 year, the S&P outperforms the split company index. 5 years it's about a push, roughly a push. 10 years the split company index outperforms the S&P 500. But on a compounded growth rate basis, 1% and change. so there's no real material difference to look at the returns on a 1, 5 and 10-year period the S&P versus [indiscernible] .
Yes so the key the question I think [indiscernible] tie question is what can be done differently if the companies are if the divisions split versus what can be done when they're inside Pfizer so of course the balance sheet whole capital structure and also at the [indiscernible]."

Ian, when you and I spoke about the split up in early June, one of the metrics you said you were considering was how cash flows would be impacted as a split company versus a combined company. And you brought it up a couple of times, almost seeming to signal that there was a cash flow problem with some sort if you were to split. I'm wondering if you could just elaborate on what potential problems might be from a cash flow perspective and balance sheet perspective. And second question, also in early June, when we talked about M&A, you mentioned all options were on the table when talking about deal sizes, and I'm wondering how much give language like that, does it really mean it's reasonably possible that we can see Pfizer spend say $100 billion on an acquisition target?

We have built a quite nice portfolio in the Alzheimer's space with gamma secretase modulator and a very selective base 1 inhibitor.

I am, for a couple of more questions. If the decision is not to split later this year, should shareholders confirm that you believe the Pfizer shares are fully valued because you've spent a lot of time talking about what part of the decision is to decide whether or not there's trapped value, so we decide not, I would assume that, that would mean that you feel that there is no trapped value. My second question is, I think, investors are also just frustrated that it's so long to decide. Is this all about tax consideration? Because it seems when you initially the idea and created 3 separate companies, which is now 2 separate companies, you pursued both AstraZeneca and then Allergan, so I'm just wondering how important having competitive tax basis is to make a decision in a tax inversion? And third, you brought this up in your comments, which is curious, your level of optimism that a new administration will pass broad tax reform.

So the answer would be I'm not sure, there's trapped value, but I'm pretty sure that we have a very robust pipeline and we'll produce greater value for shareholders as we go forward. And so I think that's what I'd answer that. Now on the tax reform, I am cautiously optimistic as there's more discussions on both sides of the aisle on the need to reform the tax system, we need to invest in the United States. And so hopefully that with the new administration, whatever administration is in, we look at the need and there will be energy around the tax reform.

If you look at the underlying growth of IBRANCE and Xeljanz and Chantix and Lyrica, the clearly the business is functioning both well internationally and in the U.S. So I think there are strong short-term drivers. I do understand that as we've signaled to you, with Prevnar, it's largely to be a growth contributor in the '17 period, in the '17 and '18. But on the other hand, we will see -- well you will see a reduction in adult sales in the U.S., we'll begin to see a pickup in adult sales internationally and we'll look to explore adult sales in new audience from 18 to 55 in the U.S. as well. So I think you'll see very strong growth drivers in most of our major products area, slower growth flattish in Prevnar. And then I think you look to the while we do have some appeal to begin to see the result of our investment innovation. You begin to see the launch of [indiscernible]. You'll see the launch of PSK-9. You'll see the launch of [indiscernible], which we believe is a best-in-class molecule and coming into a revitalized positioning in the marketplace. We see our vaccine products coming forward with C. difficile or perhaps [indiscernible]. So we see our whole portfolio coming very, very strongly. And there I do believe that total PD-1 is really going to different the company is we're building the play in spaces from what call tumors, which don't react to the PD-L1. And you then need to give specifics of vaccines very, very strong or where you need to go beyond the PD-L1 and you need to add triplets and doublets , we have 9 products in immuno-oncology so I think we're going to position as a company that can give you a backbone of the PD-L1 and the same package can give you doublets and triplets and traditional therapy. And I believe this is the key to really unlocking the value to oncology these offerings of capturing patients, rather than capturing individual treatment ops. So I'm excited about both our near-term and long-term opportunities."

Before we start, I'd like to remind you that our discussion during this call will include forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. Additional information regarding these factors is discussed under the disclosure notice section in the earnings press release we issued this morning as well as in Pfizer's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, included in Part I Item 1A Risk Factors, and this is filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, available at sec.gov and at the Pfizer website, pfizer.com. Forward-looking statements during this conference call speak only as of the original date of this call, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of these statements. 
In addition, discussions during the call will also include certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in Pfizer's current report on Form 8-K dated today, August 2, 2016. 
Any non-GAAP measures presented are not and should not be viewed as substitutes for financial measures required by U.S. GAAP. They have no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to the calculations of similar measures at other companies. 
We will now make prepared remarks, then we'll move to a Q&A session. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Ian Read. Ian?"

During my remarks, I will briefly talk about the performance of the business and provide some thoughts regarding each of our businesses and our pipeline. Our financial performance year t",1778,"Thank you, Chuck, and thank you for joining our call this morning. During my remarks, I will briefly talk about the performance of the business and provide some thoughts regarding each of our businesses and our pipeline. 
Our financial performance year to date is strong, even stripping out the impact of the Legacy Hospira business, who reported another quarter of operational revenue growth that is driving our solid EPS performance. We achieved this through continued strong performance of new products. In addition do patent-protected products that are later in their life cycle as well as operational growth in emerging markets. This was accomplished despite some continued headwinds from products loss of exclusivity. 
As you know, to ensure the appropriate level of focus and autonomy, we have evolved our operating model into 2 distinct businesses, Innovative Business, we now call Pfizer Innovative Health and, an Established Products Business, we now call Pfizer Essential Health. Through the first 6 months of the year, the businesses are executing well against their strategies, as demonstrated by each unit's results. 
A few words about each. The Pfizer Innovative Health has continuously strengthened our core brands, including IBRANCE, Eliquis, XELJANZ, Lyrica and Chantix. Most specifically, XELJANZ has been prescribed to more than 50,000 patients worldwide. Revenues for the quarter were $217 million, which represents 70% operational growth versus quarter 2 2015. 
Eliquis utilization adoption continues to rapidly increase. More than 3.5 million patients, already have been prescribed Eliquis. It is now the  #1 prescribed oral anticoagulant amongst cardiologists in the U.S., Japan and several European countries. 
As our partner Bristol-Myers reported, revenues in the second quarter were strong, representing 75% of operational year-over-year growth and 90% year-to-date operational growth. 
Regarding IBRANCE, approximately 35,000 patients are now being treated with about 7,600 prescribers since its launch in February last year. And it has now been approved in 14 countries in addition to the U.S. We anticipate receiving a decision from EU regulators around the end of the year. 
In Q2, we achieved revenues of $514 million and for the first 6 months of the year, a total of $942 million. Our Prevnar 13 franchise continues to be a significant contributor. With the success of our adult launch in the U.S., approximately 40% of the adult 65 and plus population have been vaccinated as of the end of June, achieving year-over-year growth is now more difficult with possible reduction in the number of U.S. adults age 65 that have not received that Prevnar 13 chart. We do, however, expect overall global Prevnar franchise sales for the year to be comparable to slightly below 2015 levels. 
During the quarter, we closed the Anacor acquisition. This is a nice complementary Inflammation Immunology portfolio within the Innovative business. The Anacor acquisition is a great example of optimistic profile acquisition that I mentioned, portfolio with a pipeline product that is potentially close to market there. 
In terms of the pipeline, we believe there are significant late-stage opportunities in the Innovative business in key areas such as immuno-oncology, CV metabolic, vaccines, INI, rare diseases, neuroscience and pain. 
In immuno-oncology, we have started Phase III studies for avelumab in bladder and ovarian cancer, adding to numerous existing studies fully underway for the compound. Together with our partner, Merck KGaA, we plan to file avelumab for the treatment of metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma at the end of quarter 3 2016 in the U.S. and by the end of 2016 in EU .
And currently, we're working with Servier on a joint clinical development program, the UCART19, a product developed by Cellectis. We have exclusive rights from Servier to develop new commercialized UCART19 in the United States. And in June, Cellectis announced the first patient was treated in a Phase I pediatric B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia trial, marking the first clinical trial of UCART19. 
And last week, we expanded our immuno-oncology portfolio by entering to a development collaboration license and option agreement with Western Oncolytics. We are collaborating with them on the preclinical and clinical development in novel and oncolytic vaccinia virus, WO-12 through Phase I trials. Following the completion of the Phase I trial, we have an exclusive option to acquire WO-12. 
In the oncology portfolio, we completed our Phase III study for inotuzumab in adult patients with relapsed or refractory CD22 acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Based on the study's results, we are planning to pursue regular submissions and if approved, inotuzumab could be a valuable new addition to current available treatment options for these patients. Currently, adult patients with relapsed refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia have a 5-year survival rate of less than 10% making these patients particularly difficult to treat. 
We also continue to see success with Xalkori. It is now the first and only FDA-approved biomarker-driven therapy for the treatment of the ROS1 positive metastatic non-small cell cancer. In a clinical trial with 50 patients, 2/3 responded to treatment and the median duration response exceeded 1.5 years. While the patient population is limited, it is an important advance of patients we previously had limited treatment options. In July, CHMP adopted a positive opinion, recommending extension of the current indication for Xalkori to also include treatment of adults. We have lost positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer. This recommendation is now being reviewed by European Commission. 
In vaccines, we have 2 preventive vaccines, Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium difficile in Phase II clinical development. We expect to have the C. diff Phase II data towards the end of this year. 
In information and immunology, the Anacor acquisition has brought us the [indiscernible]. It is important to potentially, first line beaten up option for the 18 to 25 million children and adults in the U.S. They have mild to moderate atopic dermatitis. If approved, this would be a meaningful advancement for these patients, who have not seen treatment options for their condition in the last 15 years. 
Last month, the detailed results from the pivotal Phase III study, we published in the period of news journal and the new drug application is currently under review by U.S. FDA with an expected action date in January 2017. 
In XELJANZ,  we have recently announced positive top line results from the 3 Phase II trial of XELJANZ that patient could moderately to severe active ulcerative colitis. The combined findings from the Phase III pivotal trial are encouraging and provide evidence that XELJANZ has the potential to be an effective new treatment option for both that both induces and maintains remission in UC. 
We also announced results from 2 pivotal trials in XELJANZ to use in patients with psoriatic arthritis. The 2 psoriatic arthritis studies along with a long-term extension study are expected to form the potential submission impacts the positive future regulatory applications. 
In pain, we begun enrollment in the full Phase III tanezumab studies. This program consists of 6 studies and approximately 7,000 patients in chronic pain conditions, 3 in our staph aureus, 2 in chronic lower back pain and 1 in cancer pain. The study results are projected to begin recording early into 2018. 
We're also strengthening our gene therapy capabilities. Yesterday, we've announced the acquisition of Bamboo, a privately-held biotech company based in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, focused on developing gene therapies for the treatment of patients with rare diseases. The acquisition complements our growing rare disease portfolio, with preclinical assets including potential therapies with [indiscernible] and Fridericia tax stuff. 
In addition, we are making good progress in hematological, including a Phase III study in sickle cell disease. The lab partner, Spark, recently presented data at the World Federation of Hemophilia Congress have received breakthrough designation for SPK-9001, which is currently being investigated in an ongoing Phase I-II trial as potentially onetime treatment for hemophlia B. 
Turning now to Pfizer's essential health. The business continues to -- close to stabilize. Excluding the impact of Hospira, the legacy Essential Health business is nearly flat on an operational revenue basis for the first half of this year as compared to a year ago. We continue to expect that this business has the potential to meet the operational growth through a combination of expanded biosimilars of sterile injectable portfolios. Much of this is aided by the excellent Hospira acquisition, along with continued growth in emerging markets, which grew by 30% operationally in the second quarter without Hospira and other core areas, where the business is growing within their cycle time objectives. 
Of note, we are now the worldwide leader in biosimilars, according to RMS revenue. And we expect to compete in the first wave of biosimilars within the U.S. and recently announced our investment to develop a state-of-the-art global biotechnology center in Hangzhou Economic Development area in China. This innovative facility will ensure the development and manufacturing of high quality exportable products and benefits that have the potential to benefit patients, both in China and throughout the world. 
And to potentially further enhance the revenue growth of this business, we will continue actively manage and reshape our portfolio. Our overreaching objective of Pfizer's Essential Health has not changed, to generate a modest but sustainable rate of revenue growth. I believe the businesses are in good trajectory, and we're taking the actions overall to enable us to achieve this goal. 
Turning now to a few comments regarding a potential split of the company. As we previously said, we're assessing the merits of separation and expect to arrive to a decision, no later than end of this year. Let me add, this is not a make-or-break decision for the company. As I've just shared with you, each of our businesses is performing well, and we'll continue to pursue the strategies, including opportunistic business development, where appropriate certainly, our strategy. And a strategy that will best position the long-term success. 
As a reminder, our decision criteria for the split of the business has not changed. It's continuously based on 4 questions. Are the business moving well within Pfizer? Could the business perform well as stand-alone entities? Easy to attract value and a value combined entity? And can the attract value be efficient? We will be thoughtful in evaluating the virtues of split over the coming months. Our key and primary rate motivation is shareholder value and return to shareholders. I don't view it being a long answer here. The decision will be taken in a straightforward context on the best top portfolio for shareholder value. 
In summary, we ended the second half of the year with positive momentum that has positioned us to deliver solid performance for the remainder of the year. Now, I'll turn over to Frank, who will go in the granular detailed results of the quarter. Thank you."

As always, the charts I'm reviewing today are included in our webcast.

As always, the charts I'm reviewing today are included in our webcast. As a reminder, because we completed the acquisition of Hospira on September 3, 2015, Pfizer's second quarter and first half 2016 financial results include Hospira global operations, while the comparable prior year periods do not include any legacy Hospira operations. 
Now moving on to the financials. Second quarter revenues were approximately $13.1 billion, and reflect year-over-year operational growth of $1.6 billion or 13%, which was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of $302 million or 3%. 
Legacy Hospira operations contributed $1.1 billion to revenues. If you exclude foreign exchange and the contribution from Legacy Hospira operations, Pfizer stand-alone revenues grew operationally by $458 million or 4%. 
In developed markets, operational revenue growth of $1.5 billion, a 17% is driven by Legacy Hospira operations and the continued strong performance of IBRANCE, Eliquis, XELJANZ and Lyrica, which were partially offset by expected lower revenues from the 13 adults in the U.S. due to the high initial capture rate after its launch in the third quarter of 2014, resulting in a smaller catch-up opportunity versus the year-ago quarter, product losses of exclusivity and the expiration of collaboration agreement to co-promote Rebif in the U.S. 
In emerging markets, operational revenue growth of $116 million or 4% was driven by Legacy Hospira operations and certain essential health products, primarily in China, which were partially offset by low revenues for Prevnar 13 due to the timing of purchase from Gavi and the Vaccine Alliance and in certain other emerging markets. 
Second quarter recorded diluted EPS was $0.33 compared with $0.32 in the year-ago quarter due to higher asset impairment charges, product loss of exclusivity, foreign exchange, higher charges for legal matters and the Allergan termination fee, which were partially offset by increased revenues in certain new, in-line and acquired products as well as a lower effective tax rate. 
Second quarter adjusted diluted EPS was $0.64 versus $0.56 in the year-ago quarter. The increase is primarily due to increased revenues, a low effective tax rate and fewer diluted weighted average shares outstanding that's declined by 106 million shares versus the year-ago quarter due to our share repurchase program, which were partially offset by an aggregate operational increase in adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses and adjusted R&D expenses of $930 million or 13% which includes the addition of Hospira operations in 2016, a $0.06 negative impact due to foreign exchange and continuing product losses of exclusivity. I want to point out that second quarter adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue increased year over year from 17.9% to 23.3%, primarily due to foreign exchange and the addition of Legacy Hospira operations. 
Also because foreign exchange increased cost of sales, while decreasing revenues at the same time, which is atypical. There was an exaggerated increase of our adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenues in the second quarter. Excluding the foreign exchange impact, adjusted second quarter cost of sales as a percentage of revenue would have been 21.3%. We believe that this is an anomaly, rather than a trend, and we have maintained our 2016 adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue guidance. 
Foreign exchange negatively impacted second quarter revenue by approximately $302 million or 3% and negatively impacted the net of adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses and adjusted R&D expenses by $106 million or 1%. As a result, foreign exchange negatively impacted second quarter adjusted dilutive EPS by approximately $0.06 compared with the year-ago quarter. 
As you can see on the chart, we are reaffirming revenues and adjusted components of our 2016 financial guidance based on our strong performance to date and continued confidence in the business going forward. 
Moving on to key takeaways. We achieved another quarter of operational revenue growth, driven by the inclusion of Legacy Hospira operations, new products that are early in their life cycles, such as IBRANCE, Eliquis and XELJANZ as well as the solid performance from Lyrica. We reaffirm 2016 revenue and adjusted diluted EPS financial guidance. We announced and completed the acquisition of Anacor Pharmaceuticals and accomplished several key product pipeline milestones, and we returned $8.7 billion to shareholders in the first half of 2016 through dividends and share repurchases, including a $5 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement. 
Finally, we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2016 and beyond. Now I'll turn it back to Chuck."

Certainly, stress testing will give our 2 management teams on issues of what initiatives inside the strategies could only be down if they were separate. And this is, I think, a key point to look at. Is this some material obstacle inside the company, or implementation of strategies of either of these decisions as they remain within. So Pfizer, what can all material strategies be efficiently implemented if we were part of Pfizer. So notice within has been taken, and we will make that call by the end of the year, and I look forward to giving a decision on that.

Like any business, we have in Pfizer, whether it's any part of our business, we continue to look at our capital allocation, we continue to look at what's the best interest of Pfizer, which businesses comprise the best in Pfizer.

Thanks for the question, Chris. So first of all, let me just say that we're actually very pleased with the performance in the second quarter and so far this year, across all the segments of our business, with legacy portfolio, the Peri-LOE brands, which are performing above market benchmarks, Emerging Markets business and then the group drivers biosimilars, and our sterile injectable portfolio. So biosimilars clearly is a very attractive market opportunity. Pfizer's the leader in total sales, with biosimilars commercialized across all 3 classes. So we are aiming with our development pipeline to really add to our leadership position in the market. Sterile injectables is another attractive segment and clearly, that was a primary driver of our acquisition with Hospira. We're the leader in that segment as well. We continue to be very positive about the opportunities with continued growth in the Sterile Injectable business. And then the performance of our core brands in emerging markets continues to be strong. Our business performed well again, in the second quarter, primarily driven by some of the incorporation of Hospira operations, but actually even, excluding the impact of Hospira, we saw strong performance in the second quarter as well. And in addition to those core franchises, we also see the anti-infectives portfolio in women's health continuing to be strong therapeutic areas for us, where we have a leadership position. So when we put all those drivers together, even in the face of the impact of LOEs that we are managing on behalf of the corporation, our aspiration in the medium term is to take the Essential Health business to a growth rate in the low- to mid-single-digit range. And as a consequence, we believe, we can add significant shareholder value through delivering that performance on a sustainable basis."

I would add that part of the investor case with Hospira was the launch of some of that portfolio in the international markets. This does not incur immediately. It depends on the state of the different registrations, and frankly, we expect that to occur over a 2-year period post the integration. So some of that growth internationally, will come once registrations are complete. And we continue to look at the total portfolio of the Essential Health business and look for ways to restructuring that. So that's part of the strategy of the team. With regard to the split, it's a good question, when you look at some of the splits in the pharma area and what was perceived as increasing value. Part of that is I think due to the fact that if you look at actually, all the -- you said, the our own Animal Health split or Abbott, Baxter, or the others, you have to question, number one, really, parts all being invested in equally? I don't think they were. Were they getting the same amount of management attention, I don't think they were. In our particular case, we are investing in both segments, overall and there's a big difference between a division in the spending, being 8% of your revenue and its management attention compared to a division that has 35% of your total revenues. So I think those are things we're looking at. But I do acknowledge that there is this general assumption out there that, that split companies will improve their performance because of no management focus, which we are trying to deal with by having very distinct leaderships. And also we'd look to some of that resource. Frank, could also comment on that."

I'm wondering if you could just elaborate on what potential problems might be from a cash flow perspective and balance sheet perspective. And second question, also in early June, when we talked about M&A, you mentioned all options were on the table when talking about deal sizes, and I'm wondering how much weight to give language like that. Does it really mean it's reasonably possible that we can see Pfizer spend let's say, $100 billion on an acquisition target?

Once you split you permanently divide those cash flows, and of course, you lose flexibility. I think that was basically my comment there, which is understandable. Your question on M&A is we constantly survey the M&A space. We have the ability to do acquisitions. I don't think we're necessarily limited in size.

Thank you for the interest, and great that you picked up some of the things we have communicated. We have built a quite nice portfolio in the Alzheimer's space with the gamma secretase modulator and a very selective BACE1 inhibitor. Our gamma secretase modulator was based on extensive work to develop a unique profile in the sense that it modulates rather than inhibit the cleavage of the gamma secretase function of the A beta. So you get the unique profile where you do lower some of the forms of amyloids -- the longer forms, typically, the 1-40 amyloid beta that has been assumed to be the most toxic, while it actually preserves and possibly enhance some of the shorter forms that potentially even can be beneficial. So we do think we have a unique profile, and it does not have the type of, so far, side effects that have been reported with gamma secretase inhibitor, including GI issues. This has been a very tolerable clean drug. So we will certainly continue to look at ways to advance this molecule, as a standalone molecule, and we have the unique opportunity to consider combining it with BACE1.

I would assume that would mean that you feel that there is no trapped value. My second question is, I think investors are also just frustrated that it's so long to decide. Is this all about tax consideration? Because it seems that when you initially floated the idea and created 3 separate companies, which is now 2 separate companies, you pursued both AstraZeneca and then Allergan. So I'm just wondering how important having competitive tax basis is to making your decision a tax inversion. And third, you brought this up in your comments but just curious.

And so I think that's what I'd answer to that. Now on the tax reform, I am cautiously optimistic as there's more discussion on both sides of the aisle on the need to reform the tax system, the need to invest in the United States. And so hopefully, that -- with the new administration, whoever is in -- whatever administration is in, that when we look at the need and there'll be energy around the tax reform.

And also, we continue to see very strong insurance, [ph] feedback from prescribers and patients continue to be very positive, particularly around patient quality of life.

As you know, we have 5 in EU and could have an approved product by the end of the year. And we will continue to expand into earlier lines of therapy. As you know, we have pivotal studies ongoing in this population. Now let me move to Sutent. You're right, we did report the S-TRAC results. Let me say just a few words about it. Today, there are no treatments approved or widely used in the adjuvant setting for RCC. Nephrectomy is the standard of care. The S-TRAC study that we did aim to determine if adjuvant therapy with Sutent post nephrectomy would be beneficial for RCC patients with no metastatic disease, and we did that in high-risk patients, recurrents. The results were not only statistically significant but also clinically meaningful. So if approved, Sutent will be the first product approved in the adjuvant setting for RCC. Too early to comment on filing and approval time lines. We will update you on appropriate times, but how to think about the opportunities basically, it's also part of your question. The eligible population for S-TRAC of when we did the target [ph] Stage III patients [ph] and the small part of the non-metastatic Stage IV. The Stage III population in the U.S. is 5,000 to 6,000 per year approximately, assuming that 80% of patients that are stage III are receiving nephrectomy. This will result in approximately 4,000 to 5,000 patients eligible for Sutent in the U.S. per year with similar numbers expected in year.

And then the second question, just biosimilars in general. We heard from Sandoz in June that pricing is coming in quite a bit below where they had modeled the market, but penetration is also coming in higher.

Our financial performance year t",1801,"Thank you, Chuck, and thank you for joining our call this morning. During my remarks, I will briefly talk about the performance of the business and provide some thoughts regarding each of our businesses and our pipeline. 
Our financial performance year to date is strong, even stripping out the impact of the legacy Hospira business, we reported another quarter of operational revenue growth that is driving our solid EPS performance. We achieved this through continued strong performance of new products, in addition to patent-protected products that are later in their life cycle, as well as operational growth in emerging markets. This was accomplished despite some continued headwinds from products' loss of exclusivity. 
As you know, to ensure the appropriate level of focus and autonomy, we have evolved our operating model into 2 distinct businesses, the Innovative Business, we now call Pfizer Innovative Health and an Established Products Business, we now call Pfizer Essential Health. Through the first 6 months of the year, the businesses are executing well against their strategies, as demonstrated by each unit's results. 
A few words about each. For Pfizer Innovative Health, we continuously strengthen our core brands, including IBRANCE, Eliquis, XELJANZ, Lyrica and Chantix. Most specifically, XELJANZ has been prescribed to more than 50,000 patients worldwide. Revenues for the quarter were $217 million, which represents 70% operational growth versus quarter 2 2015. 
Eliquis utilization adoption continues to rapidly increase. More than 3.5 million patients already have been prescribed Eliquis. It is now the #1 prescribed oral anticoagulant amongst cardiologists in the U.S., Japan and several European countries. 
As our partner Bristol-Myers reported, revenues in the second quarter were strong, representing 75% of operational year-over-year growth and 90% year-to-date operational growth. 
Regarding IBRANCE, approximately 35,000 patients are now being treated with it by 7,600 prescribers since its launch in February last year, and it has now been approved in 14 countries in addition to the U.S. We anticipate receiving a decision from EU regulators around the end of the year. 
In Q2, we achieved revenues of $514 million and for the first 6 months of the year, a total of $942 million. Our Prevnar 13 franchise continues to be a significant contributor. With the success of our adult launch in the U.S., approximately 40% of the adult 65 and plus population have been vaccinated as of the end of June, achieving year-over-year growth is now more difficult because of a reduction in the number of U.S. adults over 65 who have not received their Prevnar 13 shot. We do, however, expect overall global Prevnar franchise sales for full year to be comparable to slightly below 2015 levels. 
During the quarter, we closed the Anacor acquisition. This is a nice complementary inflammation and immunology portfolio within the Innovative business. The Anacor acquisition is a great example of the type of opportunistic profile on acquisitions that [indiscernible] portfolio with a pipeline product that is potentially close to market launch. 
In terms of the pipeline, we believe there are significant late-stage opportunities in the Innovative business in key areas such as immuno-oncology, CV metabolic, vaccines, INI, rare diseases, neuroscience and pain. 
In immuno-oncology, we have started Phase III studies for avelumab in bladder and ovarian cancer, adding to the numerous existing studies fully underway for the compound. Together with our partner, Merck KGaA, we plan to file avelumab for the treatment of metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma at the end of quarter 3 2016 in the U.S. and by the end of 2016 in the EU.
With CAR-T, we’re working with Servier on a joint clinical development program for UCART19, a product developed by Cellectis. We have exclusive rights from Servier to develop and commercialize UCART19 in the United States. And in June, Cellectis announced the first patient was treated in a Phase I pediatric B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia trial, marking the first clinical trial of UCART19. 
And last week, we expanded our immuno-oncology portfolio by entering into a development collaboration license and option agreement with Western Oncolytics. We will collaborate with them on the preclinical and clinical development of novel and oncolytic vaccinia virus, WO-12, through Phase I trials. Following the completion of the Phase I trial, we have an exclusive option to acquire WO-12. 
In the oncology portfolio, we completed our Phase III study for inotuzumab in adult patients with relapsed or refractory CD22 acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Based on the study's results, we are planning to pursue regular submissions and if approved, inotuzumab could be a valuable new addition to current available treatment options for these patients. Currently, adult patients with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia have a 5-year survival rate of less than 10% making these patients particularly difficult to treat. 
We also continue to see success with Xalkori. It is now the first and only FDA-approved biomarker-driven therapy for the treatment of the ROS1 positive metastatic non-small cell cancer. In a clinical trial of 50 patients, 2/3 responded to the treatment and the median duration of the response exceeded 1.5 years. While the patient population is limited, it is an important advance for patients who previously had limited treatment options. In July, CHMP adopted a positive opinion, recommending extension of the current indication for Xalkori to also include the treatment of adults with ROS1-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer. This recommendation is now being reviewed by the European Commission. 
In vaccines, we have 2 preventive vaccines, Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium difficile in Phase II clinical development. We expect to have the CBT II or Phase II data towards the end of this year. 
In inflammation and immunology, the Anacor acquisition has brought us [indiscernible]. It is an important potential first line treatment option for the 18 to 25 million children and adults in the U.S. that have mild to moderate atopic dermatitis. If approved, this would be a meaningful advancement for these patients, who have not seen new treatment options for their condition in the last 15 years. 
Last month, the detailed results from the pivotal Phase III study were published in a peer-reviewed journal and a new drug application is currently under review by U.S. FDA with an expected action date in January 2017. 
In XELJANZ, we have recently announced positive top line results from the third Phase III trial of XELJANZ for patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis. The combined findings from the Phase III pivotal trial are encouraging and provide evidence that XELJANZ has the potential to be an effective new treatment option that both induces and maintains remission in UC. 
We also announced the results from 2 pivotal trials of XELJANZ for use in patients with psoriatic arthritis. The 2 psoriatic arthritis studies along with a long-term extension study are expected to form the potential submission impact [ph] for positive future regulatory applications. 
In pain, we've begun enrollment in the [indiscernible] Phase III tanezumab studies. This program consists of 6 studies and approximately 7,000 patients with 3 chronic pain conditions, 3 in our staph aureus, 2 in chronic lower back pain and 1 in cancer pain. The study results are projected to begin reporting out in 2018. 
We're also strengthening our gene therapy capabilities. Yesterday, we announced the acquisition of Bamboo, a privately-held biotech company based in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, focused on developing gene therapies for the treatment of patients with rare diseases. The acquisition complements our growing rare disease portfolio, with preclinical assets including potential therapies with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and Friedreich's Ataxia.
In addition, we are making good progress in hematological, including a Phase III study in sickle cell disease. The lab partner, Spark, who recently presented data at the World Federation of Hemophilia Congress and have received breakthrough designation for SPK-9001, which is currently being investigated in an ongoing Phase I-II trial as a potentially onetime treatment for hemophilia B. 
Turning now to Pfizer's Essential Health. The business continues to move close to stabilizing [indiscernible]. Excluding the impact of Hospira, our legacy Essential Health business is nearly flat on an operational revenue basis for the first half of this year as compared to a year ago. We continue to expect that this business has the potential to move to operational [indiscernible] growth through a combination of expanded biosimilars and sterile injectable portfolios. Much of this is aided by the Hospira acquisition, along with continued growth in emerging markets, which grew by 30% [ph] operationally in the second quarter without Hospira and other core areas, where the businesses are growing within their sectors and [indiscernible]. 
Of note, we are now the worldwide leader in biosimilars, according to RMS revenue. And we expect to compete in the first wave of biosimilars [indiscernible] in the U.S. and recently announced our investment to develop a state-of-the-art global biotechnology center in Hangzhou Economic Development area in China. This innovative facility will ensure the development and manufacturing of high quality, affordable biosimilar elements [ph] that have the potential to benefit patients both in China and throughout the world. 
And to, potentially, further enhance the revenue growth of this business, we will continue to actively manage and reshape our portfolio. Our overreaching objective for Pfizer Essential Health has not changed, to generate a modest but sustainable rate of revenue growth. I believe the businesses are on a good trajectory, and we are taking the actions [indiscernible] to enable us to achieve this goal. 
Turning now to a few comments regarding a potential split of the company. As we've previously said, we're assessing the merits of separation and expect to arrive at a decision no later than end of this year. Let me add, this is not a make-or-break decision for the company. As I've just shared with you, each of our businesses is performing well and we'll continue to pursue the strategies, including opportunistic business development, where appropriate, to accelerate our strategy. And a strategy that will best position them for long-term success. 
As a reminder, our decision criteria for the split of the business has not changed. It's continuously based on 4 questions. Are the businesses performing well within Pfizer? Could the businesses perform well as stand-alone entities? Is there trapped value in the combined entity? And can the trapped value be unlocked efficiently? We will be thoughtful in evaluating the virtues of split over the coming months. Our key and primary motivation here is shareholder value and return to shareholders. I don't view there being a wrong answer here. The decision will be taken in a straightforward context on the best portfolio for shareholder value. 
In summary, we ended the second half of the year with positive momentum that has positioned us to deliver solid performance for the remainder of the year. Now, I'll turn it over to Frank, who will go into greater detail on results of the quarter. Thank you."

As a reminder, because we completed the acquisition of Hospira on September 3, 2015, Pfizer's second quarter and first half 2016 financial results incl",750,"Thanks, Ian. Good day, everyone. As always, the charts I'm reviewing today are included in our webcast. As a reminder, because we completed the acquisition of Hospira on September 3, 2015, Pfizer's second quarter and first half 2016 financial results include Hospira global operations, while the comparable prior year periods do not include any legacy Hospira operations. 
Now moving on to the financials. Second quarter revenues were approximately $13.1 billion and reflect year-over-year operational growth of $1.6 billion or 13%, which was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of $302 million or 3%. 
Legacy Hospira operations contributed $1.1 billion to revenues. If you exclude foreign exchange and the contribution from Legacy Hospira operations, Pfizer stand-alone revenues grew operationally by $458 million or 4%. 
In developed markets, operational revenue growth of $1.5 billion or 17% was driven by legacy Hospira operations and the continued strong performance of IBRANCE, Eliquis, XELJANZ and Lyrica, which were partially offset by expected lower revenues from Prevnar 13 adult in the U.S. due to the high initial capture rate after its launch in the third quarter of 2014, resulting in a smaller catch-up opportunity versus the year-ago quarter, product losses of exclusivity and the expiration of a collaboration agreement to co-promote Rebif in the U.S. 
In emerging markets, operational revenue growth of $116 million or 4% was driven by Legacy Hospira operations and certain essential health products, primarily in China, which were partially offset by lower revenues for Prevnar 13 due to the timing of purchases from Gavi and the Vaccine Alliance and in certain other emerging markets. 
Second quarter reported diluted EPS was $0.33 compared with $0.32 in the year-ago quarter due to higher asset impairment charges, product losses of exclusivity, foreign exchange, higher charges for legal matters and the Allergan termination fee, which were partially offset by increased revenues from certain new, in-line and acquired products as well as a lower effective tax rate. 
Second quarter adjusted diluted EPS was $0.64 versus $0.56 in the year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to increased revenues, a low effective tax rate and fewer diluted weighted average shares outstanding that's declined by 106 million shares versus the year-ago quarter due to our share repurchase program, which were partially offset by an aggregate operational increase in adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses and adjusted R&D expenses of $913 [ph] million or 13% which includes the addition of Hospira operations in 2016, a $0.06 negative impact due to foreign exchange and continuing product losses of exclusivity. I wanted to point out that second quarter adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue increased year over year from 17.9% to 23.3%, primarily due to foreign exchange and the addition of legacy Hospira operations. 
Also because foreign exchange increased the cost of sales while decreasing revenues at the same time, which is atypical. There was an exaggerated increase of our adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenues in the second quarter. Excluding the foreign exchange impact, adjusted second quarter cost of sales as a percentage of revenue would have been 21.3%. We believe that this is an anomaly, rather than a trend, and we have maintained our 2016 adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue guidance. 
Foreign exchange negatively impacted second quarter revenues by approximately $302 million or 3% and negatively impacted the net of adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses and adjusted R&D expenses by $106 million or 1%. As a result, foreign exchange negatively impacted second quarter adjusted diluted EPS by approximately $0.06 compared with the year-ago quarter. 
As you can see on the chart, we are reaffirming revenues and adjusted components of our 2016 financial guidance based on our strong performance to date and continued confidence in the business going forward. 
Moving on to key takeaways. We achieved another quarter of operational revenue growth, driven by the inclusion of legacy Hospira operations, new products that are early in their life cycle, such as IBRANCE, Eliquis and XELJANZ as well as the solid performance from Lyrica. We reaffirm 2016 revenue and adjusted diluted EPS financial guidance. We announced and completed the acquisition of Anacor Pharmaceuticals and accomplished several key product pipeline milestones, and we returned $8.7 billion to shareholders in the first half of 2016 through dividends and share repurchases, including a $5 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement. 
Finally, we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2016 and beyond. Now I'll turn it back to Chuck."

Certainly, stress testing with our 2 management teams on issues of what initiatives inside their strategies could only be done if they were separate. And this is, I think, a key point to look at. Is there some material obstacle inside the company for implementation of strategies of either of these divisions if they remain inside Pfizer or can all material strategies be efficiently implemented if we were part of Pfizer?

Thanks for the question, Chris. So first of all, let me just say that we're actually very pleased with the performance in the second quarter and so far this year, across all of the segments of our business, both legacy portfolio; the Peri-LOE brands, which are performing above market benchmarks; the emerging market business; and then the group drivers, biosimilars, and our sterile injectable portfolio. So biosimilars clearly is a very attractive market opportunity. Pfizer's the leader in total sales, with biosimilars commercialized across all 3 classes. So we are aiming with our development pipeline to really add to our leadership position in the market. Sterile injectables is another attractive segment and clearly, that was the primary driver of our acquisition with Hospira. We're the leader in that segment as well. And we continue to be very positive about the opportunities for continued growth in the sterile injectable business. And then the performance of our core brands in emerging markets continues to be strong. Our business performed well again in the second quarter, primarily driven by some of the incorporation of Hospira operations, but actually, even excluding the impact of Hospira, we saw strong performance in the second quarter as well. And in addition to those core franchises, we also see the anti-infectives portfolio in women's health continuing to be strong therapeutic areas for us, where we have a leadership position. So when we put all those drivers together, even in the face of the impact of LOEs that we are managing on behalf of the corporation, our aspiration in the medium term is to take the Essential Health business to a growth rate in the low- to mid-single-digit range. And as a consequence, we believe, we can add significant shareholder value through delivering that performance on a sustainable basis."

I would add that part of the investment case with Hospira was the launch of some of their portfolio in the international markets. This does not occur immediately. It depends on the state of their different registrations, and frankly, we expect that to occur over a 2-year period post the integration. So some of that growth, internationally, will come once registrations are complete. And we continue to look at the total portfolio of the Essential Health business and look for ways for restructuring that. So that's part of the strategy of the team. With regard to the split, yes, it's a good question, when you look at some of the splits in the pharma area and what was perceived as increase in value. Part of that is I think due to the fact that if you look at, perhaps, the -- you said, the [indiscernible] Animal Health split or Abbott, or Baxter, or the others, you have to question, number one, were the [indiscernible] parts all being invested in equally? I don't think they were. Were they getting the same amount of management attention? I don't think they were. In our particular case, we are investing in both segments heavily and there's a big difference between a division that your spending being 8% of your revenue and its management attention compared to a division that has 35% of your total revenues. So I think those are things we're looking at. But I do acknowledge that there is this general assumption out there that split companies will improve their performance because of more management focus, which we are trying to deal with by having very distinct leaderships. And also we've looked at some of that resource. Perhaps Frank would like to comment on that."

Your question on M&A is -- we constantly survey the M&A space. We have the ability to do acquisitions. I don't think we're necessarily limited in size. If the transaction is attractive and creates shareholder value, we have the wherewithal to do the transactions we need to do. And I really wouldn't speculative, and never have speculated, on specific targets or specific opportunities."

Thank you for the interest and great that you picked up some of the things we have communicated. We have built a quite nice portfolio in the Alzheimer's space with the gamma secretase modulator and a very selective BACE1 inhibitor. Our gamma secretase modulator was based on extensive work to develop a unique profile in the sense that it modulates rather than inhibits the cleavage of the gamma secretase function of the A beta. So you get the unique profile where you do lower some of the forms of amyloids -- the longer forms, typically, the 1-40 amyloid beta that has been assumed to be the most toxic, while it actually preserves and possibly enhances some of the shorter forms that potentially even can be beneficial. So we do think we have a unique profile, and it does not have the type of, so far, side effects that have been reported with gamma secretase inhibitors, including GI issues. This has been a very tolerable clean drug. So we will certainly continue to look at ways to advance this molecule as a standalone molecule, and we have the unique opportunity to consider combining it with a BACE1. So it's a field we feel very enthusiastic about the recent advances, and thank you again for having noticed it."

If the decision is not to split later this year, should shareholders infer that you believe that Pfizer shares are fully valued? Because you've spent a lot of time talking about what part of the decision is to decide whether or not there's trapped value, so if we decide not. I would assume that would mean that you feel that there is no trapped value. My second question is, I think investors are also just frustrated that it's taking so long to decide. Is this all about tax considerations? Because it seems that when you initially floated the idea and created 3 separate companies, which is now 2 separate companies, you pursued both AstraZeneca and then Allergan. So I'm just wondering how important having a competitive tax basis is to making your decision, a tax inversion. And third, you brought this up in your comments but just curious. Your level of optimism that a new administration will pass broad tax reform. Should that happen, does it make sense for you to wait on deciding on a major transaction or deciding on a split?"

So I think they are different questions. So the answer would be, I'm not sure there's trapped value, but I'm pretty sure that we have a very robust pipeline and we'll produce greater value for shareholders as we go forward. And so I think that's the way I'd answer to that. Now on the tax reform, I am cautiously optimistic as there's more discussion on both sides of the aisle on the need to reform the tax system, the need to invest in the United States. And so hopefully, that -- with a new administration, whoever is in -- whatever administration is in, that they will really look at the need and there'll be energy around a tax reform. And of course, the potential of that tax reform has implications for what type of transactions you want to do and what type of premiums you want to pay. So it is an influence in our thinking."

As you know, we have 5 in EU and could have an approved product by the end of the year. And we will continue to expand into earlier lines of therapy. As you know, we have pivotal studies ongoing in this population. Now let me move to Sutent. You're right, we did report the S-TRAC results. Let me say just a few words about it. Today, there are no treatments approved or widely used in the adjuvant setting for RCC. Nephrectomy is the standard of care. The S-TRAC study that we did aimed to determine if adjuvant therapy with Sutent, post nephrectomy, would be beneficial for RCC patients with no metastatic disease, and we did that in high-risk of patients with recurrence. The results were not only statistically significant but also clinically meaningful. So if approved, Sutent will be the first product approved in the adjuvant setting for RCC. Too early to comment on filing and approval time lines. We will update you on appropriate times, but how to think about the opportunity which, basically, is also part of your question. The eligible population for S-TRAC when we did the trial was Stage III patients and a small part of the non-metastatic Stage IV. The Stage III population in the U.S. is 5,000 to 6,000 per year approximately, assuming that 80% of patients that are stage III are receiving nephrectomy. This will result in approximately 4,000 to 5,000 patients eligible for Sutent in the U.S. per year with similar numbers expected in year. Of course, these are preliminary numbers and, in case of potential approval, also will depend on the label."

The trial concluded that the trial did not show a significant increase in the incidence of serious neuropsychiatric events, with Chantix or bupropion compared to placebo and nicotine. In terms of efficacy, the results showed that patients who are taking Chantix have significantly higher continuous abstinence rates than patients taking bupropion. In Europe, the Chantix label has already been updated to remove the black triangle. And in the U.S., as you may be aware, the FDA has scheduled a joint advisory committee meeting that will review those data. Overall, we always believe that the available clinical data does not support an increased risk of serious neuropsychiatric safety events in patients attempting to quit smoking with Chantix.

If we look at your current tax rate of 24%, our thoughts are that if you look at some of your losses of exclusivity and if you've done really good tax planning on a lot of your assets that lose exclusivity between now and 2020, we estimate that there's approximately about $12 billion that lose exclusivity during that time period. And when you couple that with Prevnar that is above your tax rate, at least that's our resumption, isn't there an issue where there could be some creep upward on your overall effective tax rate? And just help us understand. I know you don't give long-term projection, but again, with that thinking, it would seem that with those sales accounting for about 1/3 of your total sales, that, that might influence the tax rate or bias it upwards. Second question, since you haven't taken off the table a large acquisition, can you remind us the qualities of the AZN acquisition that you attempted? And is that something that you might consider revisiting going forward? And then the last question just has to do with Anacor. On the crisaborole asset, you've given a long-term revenue target for that asset. Are you still comfortable with that target? And by what year could you hit that target?"

It was around operational expense savings. And it was around financial or ability to deploy our capital globally in a tax-efficient manner. I really can't comment on any appetite or on any specific company.

Or do you think that enthusiasm here is starting to build in too high expectations? And as a follow-up to that, can you guys comment a little bit on the strategy with crisaborole? Obviously, it fits well with your pediatric sales force, but this is also an entry into the dermatology market to some degree, where you certainly are present with Enbrel internationally but don't really have a presence in the dermatology market in the U.S. Just wondering if there's a broader interest in the derm space, particularly medical derm, where, when we hear from dermatologists, there is a significant vacuum in innovation. And then the second question, just biosimilars in general. We heard from Sandoz in June that pricing is coming in quite a bit below where they had modeled the market, but penetration is also coming in higher. Can you guys talk a little bit about -- John, maybe you can talk a little bit about how the biosimilar market is evolving and how the uptake of Inflectra might be different from competition that you might see to Enbrel or how you might compete for pharmacy-delivered injectable products.

Shane, it's on valuations, I think that if you back 6 or 7 months, they were -- I think, we said that we thought they were frothy. On biotech, they came down and are beginning to build back up again.

We achieved this through continued strong performance of new products, in addition to patent-protected products that are later in their life cycle, as well as operational growth in emerging markets. This was accomplished despite some continued headwinds from products' loss of exclusivity. 
As you know, to ensure the appropriate level of focus and autonomy, we have evolved our operating model into 2 distinct businesses, the Innovative Business, we now call Pfizer Innovative Health and an Established Products Business, we now call Pfizer Essential Health. Through the first 6 months of the year, the businesses are executing well against their strategies, as demonstrated by each unit's results. 
A few words about each. For Pfizer Innovative Health, we continuously strengthen our core brands, including IBRANCE, Eliquis, XELJANZ, Lyrica and Chantix. Most specifically, XELJANZ has been prescribed to more than 50,000 patients worldwide. Revenues for the quarter were $217 million, which represents 70% operational growth versus quarter 2 2015. 
Eliquis utilization adoption continues to rapidly increase. More than 3.5 million patients already have been prescribed Eliquis. It is now the #1 prescribed oral anticoagulant amongst cardiologists in the U.S., Japan and several European countries. 
As our partner Bristol-Myers reported, revenues in the second quarter were strong, representing 75% of operational year-over-year growth and 90% year-to-date operational growth. 
Regarding IBRANCE, approximately 35,000 patients are now being treated with it by 7,600 prescribers since its launch in February last year, and it has now been approved in 14 countries in addition to the U.S. We anticipate receiving a decision from EU regulators around the end of the year. 
In Q2, we achieved revenues of $514 million and for the first 6 months of the year, a total of $942 million. Our Prevnar 13 franchise continues to be a significant contributor. With the success of our adult launch in the U.S., approximately 40% of the adult 65 and plus population have been vaccinated as of the end of June, achieving year-over-year growth is now more difficult because of a reduction in the number of U.S. adults over 65 who have not received their Prevnar 13 shot. We do, however, expect overall global Prevnar franchise sales for full year to be comparable to slightly below 2015 levels. 
During the quarter, we closed the Anacor acquisition. This is a nice complementary inflammation and immunology portfolio within the Innovative business. The Anacor acquisition is a great example of the type of opportunistic profile on acquisitions that [indiscernible] portfolio with a pipeline product that is potentially close to market launch. 
In terms of the pipeline, we believe there are significant late-stage opportunities in the Innovative business in key areas such as immuno-oncology, CV metabolic, vaccines, INI, rare diseases, neuroscience and pain. 
In immuno-oncology, we have started Phase III studies for avelumab in bladder and ovarian cancer, adding to the numerous existing studies fully underway for the compound. Together with our partner, Merck KGaA, we plan to file avelumab for the treatment of metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma at the end of quarter 3 2016 in the U.S. and by the end of 2016 in the EU.
With CAR-T, we’re working with Servier on a joint clinical development program for UCART19, a product developed by Cellectis. We have exclusive rights from Servier to develop and commercialize UCART19 in the United States. And in June, Cellectis announced the first patient was treated in a Phase I pediatric B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia trial, marking the first clinical trial of UCART19. 
And last week, we expanded our immuno-oncology portfolio by entering into a development collaboration license and option agreement with Western Oncolytics. We will collaborate with them on the preclinical and clinical development of novel and oncolytic vaccinia virus, WO-12, through Phase I trials. Following the completion of the Phase I trial, we have an exclusive option to acquire WO-12. 
In the oncology portfolio, we completed our Phase III study for inotuzumab in adult patients with relapsed or refractory CD22 acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Based on the study's results, we are planning to pursue regular submissions and if approved, inotuzumab could be a valuable new addition to current available treatment options for these patients. Currently, adult patients with relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia have a 5-year survival rate of less than 10% making these patients particularly difficult to treat. 
We also continue to see success with Xalkori. It is now the first and only FDA-approved biomarker-driven therapy for the treatment of the ROS1 positive metastatic non-small cell cancer. In a clinical trial of 50 patients, 2/3 responded to the treatment and the median duration of the response exceeded 1.5 years. While the patient population is limited, it is an important advance for patients who previously had limited treatment options. In July, CHMP adopted a positive opinion, recommending extension of the current indication for Xalkori to also include the treatment of adults with ROS1-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer. This recommendation is now being reviewed by the European Commission. 
In vaccines, we have 2 preventive vaccines, Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium difficile in Phase II clinical development. We expect to have the CBT II or Phase II data towards the end of this year. 
In inflammation and immunology, the Anacor acquisition has brought us [indiscernible]. It is an important potential first line treatment option for the 18 to 25 million children and adults in the U.S. that have mild to moderate atopic dermatitis. If approved, this would be a meaningful advancement for these patients, who have not seen new treatment options for their condition in the last 15 years. 
Last month, the detailed results from the pivotal Phase III study were published in a peer-reviewed journal and a new drug application is currently under review by U.S. FDA with an expected action date in January 2017. 
In XELJANZ, we have recently announced positive top line results from the third Phase III trial of XELJANZ for patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis. The combined findings from the Phase III pivotal trial are encouraging and provide evidence that XELJANZ has the potential to be an effective new treatment option that both induces and maintains remission in UC. 
We also announced the results from 2 pivotal trials of XELJANZ for use in patients with psoriatic arthritis. The 2 psoriatic arthritis studies along with a long-term extension study are expected to form the potential submission impact [ph] for positive future regulatory applications. 
In pain, we've begun enrollment in the [indiscernible] Phase III tanezumab studies. This program consists of 6 studies and approximately 7,000 patients with 3 chronic pain conditions, 3 in our staph aureus, 2 in chronic lower back pain and 1 in cancer pain. The study results are projected to begin reporting out in 2018. 
We're also strengthening our gene therapy capabilities. Yesterday, we announced the acquisition of Bamboo, a privately-held biotech company based in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, focused on developing gene therapies for the treatment of patients with rare diseases. The acquisition complements our growing rare disease portfolio, with preclinical assets including potential therapies with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and Friedreich's Ataxia.
In addition, we are making good progress in hematological, including a Phase III study in sickle cell disease. The lab partner, Spark, who recently presented data at the World Federation of Hemophilia Congress and have received breakthrough designation for SPK-9001, which is currently being investigated in an ongoing Phase I-II trial as a potentially onetime treatment for hemophilia B. 
Turning now to Pfizer's Essential Health. The business continues to move close to stabilizing [indiscernible]. Excluding the impact of Hospira, our legacy Essential Health business is nearly flat on an operational revenue basis for the first half of this year as compared to a year ago. We continue to expect that this business has the potential to move to operational [indiscernible] growth through a combination of expanded biosimilars and sterile injectable portfolios. Much of this is aided by the Hospira acquisition, along with continued growth in emerging markets, which grew by 30% [ph] operationally in the second quarter without Hospira and other core areas, where the businesses are growing within their sectors and [indiscernible]. 
Of note, we are now the worldwide leader in biosimilars, according to RMS revenue. And we expect to compete in the first wave of biosimilars [indiscernible] in the U.S. and recently announced our investment to develop a state-of-the-art global biotechnology center in Hangzhou Economic Development area in China. This innovative facility will ensure the development and manufacturing of high quality, affordable biosimilar elements [ph] that have the potential to benefit patients both in China and throughout the world. 
And to, potentially, further enhance the revenue growth of this business, we will continue to actively manage and reshape our portfolio. Our overreaching objective for Pfizer Essential Health has not changed, to generate a modest but sustainable rate of revenue growth. I believe the businesses are on a good trajectory, and we are taking the actions [indiscernible] to enable us to achieve this goal. 
Turning now to a few comments regarding a potential split of the company. As we've previously said, we're assessing the merits of separation and expect to arrive at a decision no later than end of this year. Let me add, this is not a make-or-break decision for the company. As I've just shared with you, each of our businesses is performing well and we'll continue to pursue the strategies, including opportunistic business development, where appropriate, to accelerate our strategy. And a strategy that will best position them for long-term success. 
As a reminder, our decision criteria for the split of the business has not changed. It's continuously based on 4 questions. Are the businesses performing well within Pfizer? Could the businesses perform well as stand-alone entities? Is there trapped value in the combined entity? And can the trapped value be unlocked efficiently? We will be thoughtful in evaluating the virtues of split over the coming months. Our key and primary motivation here is shareholder value and return to shareholders. I don't view there being a wrong answer here. The decision will be taken in a straightforward context on the best portfolio for shareholder value. 
In summary, we ended the second half of the year with positive momentum that has positioned us to deliver solid performance for the remainder of the year. Now, I'll turn it over to Frank, who will go into greater detail on results of the quarter. Thank you."

As a reminder, because we completed the acquisition of Hospira on September 3, 2015, Pfizer's second quarter and first half 2016 financial results incl",750,"Thanks, Ian. Good day, everyone. As always, the charts I'm reviewing today are included in our webcast. As a reminder, because we completed the acquisition of Hospira on September 3, 2015, Pfizer's second quarter and first half 2016 financial results include Hospira global operations, while the comparable prior year periods do not include any legacy Hospira operations. 
Now moving on to the financials. Second quarter revenues were approximately $13.1 billion and reflect year-over-year operational growth of $1.6 billion or 13%, which was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of $302 million or 3%. 
Legacy Hospira operations contributed $1.1 billion to revenues. If you exclude foreign exchange and the contribution from Legacy Hospira operations, Pfizer stand-alone revenues grew operationally by $458 million or 4%. 
In developed markets, operational revenue growth of $1.5 billion or 17% was driven by legacy Hospira operations and the continued strong performance of IBRANCE, Eliquis, XELJANZ and Lyrica, which were partially offset by expected lower revenues from Prevnar 13 adult in the U.S. due to the high initial capture rate after its launch in the third quarter of 2014, resulting in a smaller catch-up opportunity versus the year-ago quarter, product losses of exclusivity and the expiration of a collaboration agreement to co-promote Rebif in the U.S. 
In emerging markets, operational revenue growth of $116 million or 4% was driven by Legacy Hospira operations and certain essential health products, primarily in China, which were partially offset by lower revenues for Prevnar 13 due to the timing of purchases from Gavi and the Vaccine Alliance and in certain other emerging markets. 
Second quarter reported diluted EPS was $0.33 compared with $0.32 in the year-ago quarter due to higher asset impairment charges, product losses of exclusivity, foreign exchange, higher charges for legal matters and the Allergan termination fee, which were partially offset by increased revenues from certain new, in-line and acquired products as well as a lower effective tax rate. 
Second quarter adjusted diluted EPS was $0.64 versus $0.56 in the year-ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to increased revenues, a low effective tax rate and fewer diluted weighted average shares outstanding that's declined by 106 million shares versus the year-ago quarter due to our share repurchase program, which were partially offset by an aggregate operational increase in adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses and adjusted R&D expenses of $913 [ph] million or 13% which includes the addition of Hospira operations in 2016, a $0.06 negative impact due to foreign exchange and continuing product losses of exclusivity. I wanted to point out that second quarter adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue increased year over year from 17.9% to 23.3%, primarily due to foreign exchange and the addition of legacy Hospira operations. 
Also because foreign exchange increased the cost of sales while decreasing revenues at the same time, which is atypical. There was an exaggerated increase of our adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenues in the second quarter. Excluding the foreign exchange impact, adjusted second quarter cost of sales as a percentage of revenue would have been 21.3%. We believe that this is an anomaly, rather than a trend, and we have maintained our 2016 adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue guidance. 
Foreign exchange negatively impacted second quarter revenues by approximately $302 million or 3% and negatively impacted the net of adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses and adjusted R&D expenses by $106 million or 1%. As a result, foreign exchange negatively impacted second quarter adjusted diluted EPS by approximately $0.06 compared with the year-ago quarter. 
As you can see on the chart, we are reaffirming revenues and adjusted components of our 2016 financial guidance based on our strong performance to date and continued confidence in the business going forward. 
Moving on to key takeaways. We achieved another quarter of operational revenue growth, driven by the inclusion of legacy Hospira operations, new products that are early in their life cycle, such as IBRANCE, Eliquis and XELJANZ as well as the solid performance from Lyrica. We reaffirm 2016 revenue and adjusted diluted EPS financial guidance. We announced and completed the acquisition of Anacor Pharmaceuticals and accomplished several key product pipeline milestones, and we returned $8.7 billion to shareholders in the first half of 2016 through dividends and share repurchases, including a $5 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement. 
Finally, we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2016 and beyond. Now I'll turn it back to Chuck."

So first of all, let me just say that we're actually very pleased with the performance in the second quarter and so far this year, across all of the segments of our business, both legacy portfolio; the Peri-LOE brands",301,"Okay. Thanks for the question, Chris. So first of all, let me just say that we're actually very pleased with the performance in the second quarter and so far this year, across all of the segments of our business, both legacy portfolio; the Peri-LOE brands, which are performing above market benchmarks; the emerging market business; and then the group drivers, biosimilars, and our sterile injectable portfolio. So biosimilars clearly is a very attractive market opportunity. Pfizer's the leader in total sales, with biosimilars commercialized across all 3 classes. So we are aiming with our development pipeline to really add to our leadership position in the market. Sterile injectables is another attractive segment and clearly, that was the primary driver of our acquisition with Hospira. We're the leader in that segment as well. And we continue to be very positive about the opportunities for continued growth in the sterile injectable business. And then the performance of our core brands in emerging markets continues to be strong. Our business performed well again in the second quarter, primarily driven by some of the incorporation of Hospira operations, but actually, even excluding the impact of Hospira, we saw strong performance in the second quarter as well. And in addition to those core franchises, we also see the anti-infectives portfolio in women's health continuing to be strong therapeutic areas for us, where we have a leadership position. So when we put all those drivers together, even in the face of the impact of LOEs that we are managing on behalf of the corporation, our aspiration in the medium term is to take the Essential Health business to a growth rate in the low- to mid-single-digit range. And as a consequence, we believe, we can add significant shareholder value through delivering that performance on a sustainable basis."

I would add that part of the investment case with Hospira was the launch of some of their portfolio in the international markets. This does not occur immediately. It depends on the state of their different registrations, and frankly, we expect that to occur over a 2-year period post the integration. So some of that growth, internationally, will come once registrations are complete. And we continue to look at the total portfolio of the Essential Health business and look for ways for restructuring that. So that's part of the strategy of the team. With regard to the split, yes, it's a good question, when you look at some of the splits in the pharma area and what was perceived as increase in value. Part of that is I think due to the fact that if you look at, perhaps, the -- you said, the [indiscernible] Animal Health split or Abbott, or Baxter, or the others, you have to question, number one, were the [indiscernible] parts all being invested in equally? I don't think they were. Were they getting the same amount of management attention? I don't think they were. In our particular case, we are investing in both segments heavily and there's a big difference between a division that your spending being 8% of your revenue and its management attention compared to a division that has 35% of your total revenues. So I think those are things we're looking at. But I do acknowledge that there is this general assumption out there that split companies will improve their performance because of more management focus, which we are trying to deal with by having very distinct leaderships. And also we've looked at some of that resource. Perhaps Frank would like to comment on that."

I'm wondering if you could just elaborate on what potential problems might be from a cash flow perspective and balance sheet perspective. And second question, also in early June, when we talked about M&A, you mentioned all options were on the table when talking about deal sizes, and I'm wondering how much weight to give language like that. Does it really mean it's reasonably possible that we could see Pfizer spend, let's say, $100 billion on an acquisition target?

Once you split, you permanently divide those cash flows, and of course, you lose flexibility. I think that was basically my comment there, which is understandable. Your question on M&A is -- we constantly survey the M&A space. We have the ability to do acquisitions. I don't think we're necessarily limited in size.

Thank you for the interest and great that you picked up some of the things we have communicated. We have built a quite nice portfolio in the Alzheimer's space with the gamma secretase modulator and a very selective BACE1 inhibitor. Our gamma secretase modulator was based on extensive work to develop a unique profile in the sense that it modulates rather than inhibits the cleavage of the gamma secretase function of the A beta. So you get the unique profile where you do lower some of the forms of amyloids -- the longer forms, typically, the 1-40 amyloid beta that has been assumed to be the most toxic, while it actually preserves and possibly enhances some of the shorter forms that potentially even can be beneficial. So we do think we have a unique profile, and it does not have the type of, so far, side effects that have been reported with gamma secretase inhibitors, including GI issues. This has been a very tolerable clean drug. So we will certainly continue to look at ways to advance this molecule as a standalone molecule, and we have the unique opportunity to consider combining it with a BACE1.

Is this all about tax considerations? Because it seems that when you initially floated the idea and created 3 separate companies, which is now 2 separate companies, you pursued both AstraZeneca and then Allergan.

And so I think that's the way I'd answer to that. Now on the tax reform, I am cautiously optimistic as there's more discussion on both sides of the aisle on the need to reform the tax system, the need to invest in the United States. And so hopefully, that -- with a new administration, whoever is in -- whatever administration is in, that they will really look at the need and there'll be energy around a tax reform.

As you know, we have 5 in EU and could have an approved product by the end of the year. And we will continue to expand into earlier lines of therapy. As you know, we have pivotal studies ongoing in this population. Now let me move to Sutent. You're right, we did report the S-TRAC results. Let me say just a few words about it. Today, there are no treatments approved or widely used in the adjuvant setting for RCC. Nephrectomy is the standard of care. The S-TRAC study that we did aimed to determine if adjuvant therapy with Sutent, post nephrectomy, would be beneficial for RCC patients with no metastatic disease, and we did that in high-risk of patients with recurrence. The results were not only statistically significant but also clinically meaningful. So if approved, Sutent will be the first product approved in the adjuvant setting for RCC. Too early to comment on filing and approval time lines. We will update you on appropriate times, but how to think about the opportunity which, basically, is also part of your question. The eligible population for S-TRAC when we did the trial was Stage III patients and a small part of the non-metastatic Stage IV. The Stage III population in the U.S. is 5,000 to 6,000 per year approximately, assuming that 80% of patients that are stage III are receiving nephrectomy. This will result in approximately 4,000 to 5,000 patients eligible for Sutent in the U.S. per year with similar numbers expected in year. Of course, these are preliminary numbers and, in case of potential approval, also will depend on the label."

Both of them are sizable markets, exceeding, each one of them, only to the [indiscernible] $3 billion, each one of them has market opportunity. In your question about competition, first of all, it's difficult to make [indiscernible] comparisons without head-to-head trials. Results from the initial Phase III studies of competitors of baricitinib, for example, appear to be consistent with the JAK+. But we believe that this data continues to support the value of JAK inhibitors for the treatment of RA and as a result, will grow the plus. Our product, we are confident on the value of XELJANZ, because we are the first-in-class JAK inhibitor, and the ongoing data dissemination of extensive real-world experience continues and will provide significant growth."

If you look at the underlying growth of IBRANCE and XELJANZ and Chantix and Lyrica, the -- clearly, the business is functioning, both, well internationally and in the U.S. So I think there are strong short-term drivers. I do understand that as we've signaled to you, that Prevnar is likely not to be a growth contributor in the '17 period -- in the '17 and '18. But on the other hand, we will see -- while we'll see a reduction in adult sales in the U.S., we'll begin to see a pickup in adult sales internationally and we'll look to explore adult sales in a new audience from 18 to 55 in the U.S. as well. So I think you'll see very strong growth drivers in most of our major products and the innovative area, with slower growth, flattish, probably, in Prevnar. And then I think you'll look to the -- while we do have [indiscernible] later on in the decade, you then begin see the result of all of our investment in innovation. You begin to see the launch of tanezumab. Or you see the launch of our PCSK9. We see the launch of ertugliflozin, which we believe is a best-in-class molecule and coming into a revitalized positioning in the marketplace. We see our vaccine products coming forward with C. difficile or perhaps [indiscernible]. So I think you could see our whole RO [ph] portfolio coming through very strongly. And there, I do believe that while table stakes is the PD-1, what was really going to differentiate the company is we're building to play in spaces from what we would call cold tumors, which don't react to the PD-L1s, and you then need to get in there with very specific sort of vaccines who are very strong or where you need to go beyond the PD-L1 and you need to add triplets and doublets. We have 9 products in immuno-oncology, so I think we're going to be positioned as a company that can give you the backbone of the PD-L1 and in the same package, can give you doublets and triplets and traditional therapy. And I believe this is the key to really unlocking the value of immuno-oncology with these offerings of capturing patients, rather than capturing individual treatment arms [ph].

Apparently, the EAGLES data is very important, right? So let me give you some insight on that. The trial was the largest clinical trial of approved smoking cessation medicine. It was conducted at the request of the FDA and the EMA. The trial concluded that the trial did not show a significant increase in the incidence of serious neuropsychiatric events, with Chantix or bupropion compared to placebo and nicotine. In terms of efficacy, the results showed that patients who are taking Chantix have significantly higher continuous abstinence rates than patients taking bupropion. In Europe, the Chantix label has already been updated to remove the black triangle. And in the U.S., as you may be aware, the FDA has scheduled a joint advisory committee meeting that will review those data. Overall, we always believe that the available clinical data does not support an increased risk of serious neuropsychiatric safety events in patients attempting to quit smoking with Chantix. And obviously, a black box warning is discouraging for physicians to prescribe the product and for patients to take this medicine. So we are really looking forward to discussing in September with the advisory committee."

As we think about the Anacor acquisitions, you guys made an unusual move and seemingly a timely one, given the increase in valuations in the biotech market. Ian, can you just kind of comment on the valuations in the biotech space as you see them today? Do you see opportunities despite the increased valuation? Or do you think that enthusiasm here is starting to build in too high expectations? And as a follow-up to that, can you guys comment a little bit on the strategy with crisaborole? Obviously, it fits well with your pediatric sales force, but this is also an entry into the dermatology market to some degree, where you certainly are present with Enbrel internationally but don't really have a presence in the dermatology market in the U.S. Just wondering if there's a broader interest in the derm space, particularly medical derm, where, when we hear from dermatologists, there is a significant vacuum in innovation. And then the second question, just biosimilars in general. We heard from Sandoz in June that pricing is coming in quite a bit below where they had modeled the market, but penetration is also coming in higher. Can you guys talk a little bit about -- John, maybe you can talk a little bit about how the biosimilar market is evolving and how the uptake of Inflectra might be different from competition that you might see to Enbrel or how you might compete for pharmacy-delivered injectable products.

Shane, it's on valuations, I think that if you back 6 or 7 months, they were -- I think, we said that we thought they were frothy. On biotech, they came down and are beginning to build back up again. It all depends on each individual company. What's the product? What's the opportunity> What you are willing to pay? What can you add to it? I don't think you can generalize on valuations across different products, but thank you for the question. On the crisaborole?"

During my remarks this morning, I will briefly recap the highlights in the quarter and provide some comments on the strength and depth of our pipeline.Starting with the quarter, we recor",1944,"Thank you, Chuck, and thank you for joining our call this morning. During my remarks this morning, I will briefly recap the highlights in the quarter and provide some comments on the strength and depth of our pipeline.
Starting with the quarter, we recorded another quarter of solid operational revenue growth, marking our eighth consecutive quarter of operational growth. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange and legacy Hospira operations, Pfizer's standalone revenues grew by 3% operational.
Looking at each of our businesses, Pfizer's Innovative Health achieved another quarter of strong revenue growth through the performance of key brands, including Eliquis globally, Xeljanz, Lyrica, Chantix and Ibrance primarily in the U.S.
We continue to be very pleased with the performance of Ibrance. Since our U.S. launch in February 2015, it remains the market leader for the treatment of first-line HR+ HER2- metastatic breast cancer. As expected, we are starting to see a tempering in new market share growth. However, our total scripts continue to grow and we are focused on reaching additional metastatic patients currently receiving chemotherapy or hormone replacement therapy -- sorry, hormone therapy alone.
We also anticipate the publication of our Phase III PALOMA-2 study will occur by year-end and expect that the ability of our dedicated breast cancer field [ph] course to then detail on the strength of this data. It should allow us to achieve greater penetration into the later [ph] doctor and physicians, many of whom are potentially high prescribers for Ibrance.
A key milestone to grow the Ibrance franchise is to secure approval in the EU where we have filed and received a positive opinion from the CHMP in September. We expect the decision from the commission later this year.
Also of note, both Eliquis and Xeljanz continue to generate attractive growth on a quarter-over-quarter basis, and Chantix in the U.S. is benefiting from the publication early this year of the EAGLES Study.
Prevnar 13, sequentially, we saw an increase this quarter in adult indication as flu season approaches. And overall, the Prevnar family continues to perform in line with our expectations.
Turning to Pfizer Essential Health business. It achieved operational revenue growth primarily due to the inclusion of the legacy Hospira operations and, to a less extent, from the Essential Health Standalone Sterile Injectables portfolio. Excluding legacy Hospira, we experienced a slight operational revenue decline on a year-to-date basis. However, we remain confident that the Essential Health portfolio has the potential to pivot to achieve more sustainable growth.
We expect this shift to be driven by a combination of anticipated growth across the portfolio, including sterile injectables, anti-infectives, biosimilars and emerging markets. Correct to say [ph] [indiscernible] offset to our Peri-LOE and legacy products portfolio which, by their nature, are robust contributors to cash flow generation, given they are multi-sourced and generally primed in developing markets.
As part of the Essential Health growth strategy, we anticipate to continue to refine the portfolio with good business development activities such as the pending acquisition of AstraZeneca's late-stage small molecule anti-infectives business and our recent agreement to sell the Infusion Systems unit to ICU Medical.
All in all, the PIH and EH business are performing well and have been further strengthened by approximately $40 billion of acquisitions we've done over the past year. It has enhanced our near-term growth potential by expanding our footprint in the highest growth therapeutic areas, including biosimilars, sterile injectables in Hospira, medical dermatology with Anacor, oncology with Medivation as well as several smaller deals. These additions to our portfolio have bolstered near-term revenue generation opportunities as our pipeline continue to mature and advance.
Turning to our pipeline. We remain confident that we have built a solid pipeline in targeted areas that have potentially meaningful clinical value for patients and will provide the largest return on investment for shareholders.
Of particular note is our oncology platform. For Ibrance, we have more than 60 research programs in breast and non-breast cancers, including squamous cell and neck cancer, metastatic pancreatic cancer and mantle cell lymphoma.
For Xtandi, the FDA approved the label update on October 20 to include new clinical data from the first comparative trial that demonstrated the safety of Xtandi compared to bicalutamide. We believe these data will help position to better understand the difference between Xtandi and bicalutamide for their patients living with metastatic CRPC, that's castration-resistant prostate cancer. Similar to Ibrance, we hope to generate new data to drive increased utilization earlier in the treatment paradigm for prostate cancer.
For immuno-oncology, we continue to execute our primary strategy of 10 compounds in the clinic and 30 programs ongoing. Given [indiscernible] Merck KGaA, we are on track to sell avelumab for treatment of metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma by the end of this year in the U.S. and we just announced the European Medicines Agency validated the review of our marketing operation -- Market Authorization Application in the EU.
Over 3,000 patients have now been enrolled in ongoing avelumab studies. We have studies evaluating avelumab as monotherapy and are completing recruitments in second-line non-small cell lung cancer and other small tumor types. However, we believe that doublets and triplets, that is the combination of avelumab with other bio [ph] drugs or chemotherapy, are the areas of greatest potential for patients. And we are making chartered investments in support of developing clinical data to potentially advance these combinations. We've initiated avelumab combination studies with chemotherapy and targeted therapies and expect to see updated data next year on Inlyta plus avelumab in first-line renal cell carcinoma and rituximab plus 4-1BB in follicular lymphoma. We also anticipate data on avelumab plus 4-1BB next year.
In addition to avelumab, for the remainder of the year, we have studies underway with other agents in our portfolio, including OX40 as a single agent and in combination with 4-1BB and avelumab in various tumor types. PTK7 and ADC is showing encouraging activity in ovarian cancer in Phase Ib and combination studies with avelumab will commence in in 2017. [indiscernible] is also in Phase I and we expect combination studies to start in 2017. Our clinical allogeneic CAR-T Cell program [indiscernible] is on track with recruitment in the U.K. ongoing.
Inflammation and immunology. Through our Anacor acquisition, we have added crisaborole to our pipeline for the treatment of mild to moderate dermatitis. It is currently under review by the FDA with a January 2017 PDUFA date. If approved, crisaborole has the potential to be an important first-line treatment for the 18 million patients in the U.S. who suffer from this significant unmet medical need. We are also exploring filing crisaborole outside of the U.S.
We continue to see strong potential to expand the label for our [indiscernible] of Xeljanz in diseases beyond RA such as UC and [indiscernible]. We're excited about our next-generation of selected JAK inhibitors currently in development.
In [indiscernible], in September, we recorded positive Phase III data for ertugliflozin. In partnership with Merck, we're on track to submit new drug applications to the FDA for ertugliflozin in fixed-dose combinations, ertugliflozin plus Januvia and ertugliflozin plus metformin by the end of 2016.
As you saw today, we announced the discontinuation of the clinical development program for bococizumab. While these decisions are always difficult, we make these assessments in the best interest of patients and our shareholders and within the context of both the data defining the potential profile of the drug as well as our view of the treatment and market landscape for the drug. The discontinuation decision was made based on its totality and information available to us across 2 key areas. 
The first is the emerging clinical profile from our sixth completed Phase III lipid studies. Specifically, the longer term data now in hand, including recently completed 52-week studies with top line results for enhanced today, we have seen an anticipated tenuation of LDL cholesterol over time. Additionally, we have observed an anticipated higher level of immunogenicity and injection site reaction of Bococizumab as compared to other agents in the class. 
The second is the evolving treatment and market landscape lipid agents in the CPSK 9 class. In this market, the treatment impact CD outcomes is a significant value driver, which requires long-term efficacy and durability of cholesterol level. And we also and we have also recently seen players establish access restrictions to the class, which has meaningfully dampened our initial expectations for the market potential. 
Taken together, the totality of the emerging clinical profile and the treatment and market landscape that is to conclusion about the Bococizumab is no longer readily provide value patients physicians for shareholders. And as a result, we determined the appropriate decision was to discontinue the development program. 
In rate diseases, the acquisition of Bamboo Therapeutics complements our rate disease portfolio and enhances our leader imaging therapy. And with partners bar, we have seen data from the first 7 [ph] patients being treated in our ongoing Phase I/II trial, which is promising so far and has the potential to be a onetime therapy for treatment of hemophilia B.
 [Audio Gap] 
both currently in Phase II. We anticipate [indiscernible] Phase II readout before year end. And assuming it achieves its primary end point, we anticipate a potential Phase III start in the first half of 2007 [ph]. 
And in biosimilars, we remain confident that we'll be well positioned in emerging biosimilars market with our broad pipeline. We recently announced that we wll begin shipment of Inflectra to [indiscernible] in the U.S. late November. 
As you can see, we expect to have several key pipeline between now and the end of 2007 [ph] across several areas. 
To summarize, the remainder of this year, we anticipate potential EU decisions for IBRANCE, avelumab filing in the U.S. in cell carcinoma, [indiscernible] filing the U.S. and proof-of-concept readout. 
In 2017, we anticipate potential U.S. cell carcinoma, potential [indiscernible] submission in non-small cell lung cancer, potential EU decisions for Xeljanz in RA, potential U.S. filing in the first half of 2017 for label change for Xeljanz and you see operators, and potential [indiscernible] decision in the U.S. 
In addition between now and the end of 2017, we expect up to 12 pivotal studies with top line readouts, with 7 from oncology, including the first IR combination data readouts [indiscernible], one from rare disease and 4 from biosimilars. 
Over the past 5 years, we have worked to shape the quality of the assets in our pipeline. I believe we have a mix of competitive assets that are positioned new therapy breakthroughs for patients over the next few years. 
Similarly, over the past 3 years, each of our businesses have gained a sharper focus, increased the category and a greater value capture the opportunities in the unique markets. Today, we have independent in resources standalone within to effectively compete in end markets while having the benefit of the corporation's strength in financial flexibility associated with being part of Pfizer. 
For example, we are now managing our Innovative Health business as biotherapeutic focused integrated business plus consumer health. We think [indiscernible] 5 [ph] small biotech companies each concentrated on targeted areas of science and relevant patient [indiscernible] and I think a clear focus on delivering value to patients, and in turn, to shareholders. 
In conclusion, our business is performing well. We have taken steps to position Innovative Health and Essential Health for long-term success through competitive portfolios, pipeline investment in key growth areas that address unmet needs of patients and, thirdly, the financial strength to continue to invest in the growth drivers that will enable both business [indiscernible] markets. 
Now turn it over to Frank, who will go in very detailed results for the quarter."
162270,401980108,1068370,"Pfizer Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2016",2016-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Pfizer Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ian. Good day, everyone. As always the charts I am reviewing today are included in our webcast. As a reminder, because we completed acquisition of Hospira on September 3, 2015, Pfizer's financial results for the third quarter and the first 9 month",1230,"Thanks, Ian. Good day, everyone. As always the charts I am reviewing today are included in our webcast. As a reminder, because we completed acquisition of Hospira on September 3, 2015, Pfizer's financial results for the third quarter and the first 9 months of 2016 include Hospira global operations, while the comparable prior year periods include only 1 month of legacy Hospira U.S. and do not include financial results from legacy Hospira international operations. 
In addition, Pfizer completed the acquisition of Anacor Pharmaceuticals on June 24, 2016. Consequently, our financial results for the third quarter and the first 9 months of 2016 include 3 months of legacy Anacor operations, which were immaterial. 
Finally, Pfizer completed its acquisition of Medivation on September 28, 2016, so financial results for the third quarter and first 9 months of 2016 reflect 3 business days of legacy Medivation operations, which were also immaterial. 
Now, moving on to the financials. Third quarter revenues were approximately $13 billion and reflect year-over-year operational growth of $1.2 billion or 10%, which was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of $224 million or 2%. Legacy Hospira operations contributed $1.1 billion to Pfizer's third quarter revenues in our Essential Health business. If you exclude foreign exchange and the contribution from legacy Hospira operations, Pfizer standalone revenues grew operationally by $381 million or 3%. 
Innovative Health operational revenue growth was 10%, driven by the strong performance of IBRANCE in the U.S., Eliquis globally and Xeljanz and [indiscernible] primarily less which were partially offset by the loss of Rebif's alliance revenue versus the year-ago quarter due to the expiration at year end 2015 of the agreement to copromote Rebif in the U.S., lower Enbrel revenues in most developed markets due to bisimilar competition and expected lower revenues from Prevnar 13 adult in the U.S. due to the high initial capture rate after its launch in the fourth quarter of 2014, resulting in a smaller catch-up opportunity versus the year-ago quarter. 
Essential Health operational revenue growth was also 10% driven by the inclusion of legacy Hospira operations and to a lesser extent Pfizer standalone sterile injectables, both of which were partially offset by the loss of exclusivity in the associated generic competition, primarily from Lyrica and Zyvox in most developed Europe markets. 
Pfizer standalone revenue in the Essential Health business, which excludes the contribution of legacy Hospira operations declined 5% operationally as a result of the 7% operational increase from the standalone sterile injectables portfolio, which was more than offset by a 15% operational decrease in the Peri-LOE products portfolio and the 4% operational decline in Essential Health standalone legacy established products portfolio. 
It's important to note that in emerging markets, Pfizer's overall Essential Health revenues grew 9% operationally due primarily to the inclusion of legacy Hospira operations and Pfizer standalone sterile injectables portfolio and standalone legacy established products portfolio. 
Third quarter reported diluted EPS was $0.21 compared to $0.34 in the year-ago quarter due to the charge related to the pending sale of Hospira infusion systems, increased operating expenses, product losses of exclusivity and foreign exchange impacts, including the Venezuelan Bolivar, all of which were partially offset by revenue both in certain new in-line and acquired products and lower asset impairment charges and lower acquisition-related costs. 
Adjusted diluted EPS for the third quarter was $0.61 versus $0.60 in the year-ago quarter. The increase is primarily due to increased revenues, a lower effective tax rate and fewer diluted weighted average shares outstanding which declined by 105 million shares versus the year-ago quarter due to our share repurchase program, all of which were partially offset by an aggregate operational increase in adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses and adjusted R&D expenses of approximately $1.1 billion or 16%, which includes the addition of Hospira operations in 2016; a $0.04 negative impact due to foreign exchange and continuing product losses of exclusivity. 
I want to point out the third quarter adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenues increased year-over-year from 17.4% to 22.7% primarily due to foreign exchange and the addition of legacy Hospira operations. 
Also, because foreign exchange increased cost of sales while decreasing revenues at the same time, which is atypical, there was an exaggerated increase of our adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenues in the third quarter. If you exclude foreign exchange impact, third quarter adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue would have been 20.9%. 
Although we have experienced this for 2 consecutive quarters, we continue to view this as an anomaly rather than a trend, and we have narrowed our 2016 adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue guidance within its original rate. 
Foreign exchange negatively impacted third quarter revenues by approximately $224 million or 2%, of which approximately $175 million was attributable to Venezuela. While FX favorably impacted adjusted SI&A and R&D expenses, the previously mentioned significant negative impact on adjusted cost of sales drove the overall FX impact of $116 million or 2% in our total adjusted cost. As a result, foreign exchange negatively impacted third quarter adjusted diluted EPS by approximately $0.04 compared with the year-ago quarter where approximately $0.015 related to Venezuela. 
As you can see on the chart, we've narrowed the ranges to certain components of 2016 financial guidance. We increased the low end of our revenue guidance range, and we now expect 2016 revenues to be in the range of $52 billion to $53 billion. I want to point out that this range continues to absorb an anticipated $1.8 billion negative impact from product losses of exclusivity and an anticipated $1.4 billion negative impact from foreign exchange versus 2015, of which almost $850 million is attributable to Venezuela. 
I also want to remind everyone that as we previously communicated, there are 7, 7 fewer selling days in the fourth quarter of 2016 versus the fourth quarter of 2015. This will impact only the quarterly year-over-year comparisons given that there are essentially the same number of selling days in 2016 as there were in 2015. 
Because of our decision to discontinue the global clinical development program for boco, we now expect adjusted R&D expenses to be in the range of $7.8 billion to $8.1 billion and adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.38 to $2.43, which is still within our original range of $2.38 to $2.48 . It's important to that the midpoint of our adjusted diluted EPS guidance range is negatively impacted solely to reflect disposition. Excluding the spoke disposition, the midpoint of the range would have increased by $0.02. 
Moving on to key takeaways. We achieved our eighth consecutive quarter of operational revenue growth. In the third quarter of 2016, growth was driven by the inclusion of Legacy Hospira operations, new products that are early in their life cycles, such as IBRANCE, Eliquis and Xeljanz as well as the solid performance from Lyrica and Chantix. We narrowed the ranges of certain components of our 2016 financial guidance. We announced and completed the acquisition of Medivation and accomplished several key products pipeline milestones. And we returned $10.5 billion to shareholders through the first 9 months of 2016 through dividends and share repurchases, including a $5 billion accelerated share repurchase program. Finally, we remain committed to building attractive shareholder return in 2016 and beyond. 
Now I'll turn it back to Chuck."

Let's just deal in general with the pricing situation, and then we'll come back to the supply [indiscernible] 61. So look, we're obviously got pricing affordability issue concerning to us has further been amplified in this election cycle. There is considerable uncertainty and turmoil about both candidate's positions on these issues, and it's difficult to decipher between campaign rhetoric and legitimate policy views. It's been disappointing. It's been disappointing that, that pricing has completely neglected the other side of the ledger, that is the benefits and value added by pharmaceutical industry. So while we understand the healthcare costs have been increasing for many patients, we disagree with the prevailing notion of some politicians that pharmaceuticals are the reason for these raising costs. And we believe that post the election cycle, good public policy will prevail. So currently, in the U.S., [indiscernible] we spend 70% of our GDP on health care, yet we only spend 2% on drugs. While 12% GDP is spent on inpatient and outpatient services. We compare that to the OECD countries, who spend approximately 9% of GDP on health care, they spend 1.5% of GDP on drugs. And only 5.5% of GDP on medical services. Over half a point of GDP extra on drugs between OECD and the United States. You get a vibrant research-based industry that is producing roughly $1.3 trillion of value to GDP. I think policymakers are well aware of the importance of maintaining an innovative pharmaceutical business. However, if you look at cost increases in the U.S. from 2004, 2014, hospital service costs have increased 75%, while prescription drug costs have increased 35%. While passiveness CTI, they are lagging the overall medical cost of around 40% growth. I think what's exacerbated the cost problems for patients is the insurance plans on average cover a much lower share, 83% actually, of prescription drug cost compared to the cost of medical services where they cover 96%. So we are seeing insurance companies are making a choice of subsidizing health care that is more than drugs. You see this in the actions taken by increasing co-pays and shifting drugs into the overall deductible, which has pushed the issue with the patients with affordability, but it's certainly not due to price increases, because in 2016, the branded pharmaceutical industry talked about 2.8 on average net price increase. I think the market's reacting to the fact that in the pharmaceutical business, there are 2 markets. There's a market of branded patented protected products increased prices in '15 to [ph] 8% [ph] and then a market of generics or generics that are exclusive, where we've seen certain actives take [indiscernible] unreasonable price increases. So I think we can have better solutions and if we look to how do we fix the policy issues and the regulatory issues that allow single suppliers, single-source suppliers and ease the pathway of these generics. Regardless of the election results, I don't -- I'm not really concerned -- well, no matter the outcome of the presidential races, we will continue to look to public officials. That being said, let's talk to the rebate issue. Look, I think the rebates have served an important contribution to allowing negotiations on volume-related transactions. I think they are now becoming at least helpful in getting cost-effective solutions to patients. In reality, if we can find somewhere, and I think it would need legislative fix that we can find some way ensuring that the pharmaceutical industry has an ability to moderate price according to volume sold over the cost of the customers without rebates, I think it will be of the best interest to patients. Now coming to the issue on prox 61. If we voted today on the facts of the case, on the merits of the proposition, it would be rejected by the Californian voters. I don't -- we don't see any particular overall benefit in health care costs for California. However, we are highly politicized arena. It's difficult to say exactly what's going to happen on this proposition. But once we know the results, the industry will then formulate its public policy responses. I would like to save that what Prof 61 is asking for is basically untenable. It's asking for an industry that has given noncommercial prices to the veterans for very good reasons, they are a special part of our society and we feel them commercial prices to that part of the society, take that and send it to the rest of government is not a work of equal model. So prop 61 between its loading and this information of 6 months, implementation in 6 months expect to see a lot of public policies between climate implementation. Sorry for the length of that answer."

And at 52 weeks, we saw a substantial population reduction in LDL lowering. And we correlated that would neutralize the antibodies. And then we have the site rejection injection site reactions on some of our trials. So when you look at the total profile of our drug, we don't believe it's commercially -- could be commercially successful or in the benefit of patients for us to continue to bring that to market. I think -- and then on the pricing issue, we always price responsively. We price to the marketplaces the value of our product. And on the affordability issue, we've always made provisions for patients who have no insurance or co poor insurance to get our product for free or nearly free. So I don't believe that there is any reason for Pfizer to change its approach to the pricing of our products as we sit here today."

So far, of the limited pricing we have seen to date for the Nepali, the discount levels are in line with our expectations. And we expect Enbrel's pricing to be competitive. In Norway or in Denmark where the Nepali 1 national tenders. Let me say Norwegians published the outcomes of their tender and the Nepali won the tender with a 47% discount while Enbrel provide 41% discount. But it is important to note that the tender process in Norway is not indicative by any means of the pricing practices and trends typically seen in other markets across Europe. Now let me speak about IBRANCE. IBRANCE had a terrific launch and has quickly become the standard of care. Since launch, it's been prescribed by more than 8,500 physicians, reaching more than 40,000 patients. This rapid uptake is a testament to its efficacy and its outstanding safety and tolerability profile. Very low rate of for GI side effects such as fatigue or diarrhea. Now, as expected, given this performance, we are starting to see some tempering of growth. But let me clarify that recent reporting changes at IMS due to some specialty pharmacy consolidations might be muddening the orders and not showing an accurate picture. Based on our data, we continue to grow in scripts by 9% in the third quarter versus the second quarter of 2016, sequential, which aligns us with our own net sales growth of 7% quarter after quarter. Moving forward, our strategy with Ibrance is unfolding. So far, growth of IBRANCE has come on establishing the product to early adoptive physicians. We believe growth in the next 2 years in the U.S. will come from later but we have limited prescription so far. We are now moving to the second phase of our strategy and building a dedicated sales team and a field-based medical organization to maximize this opportunity. In addition, the publication of our Phase III PALOMA 2 study data, which we anticipate will occur by year end will be important additional data for these late adopting physicians.

So if you look at our cost of sales as a percentage of revenue this quarter, 22.7%. If you remove the impact of foreign exchange, that 22.7 becomes 20.9%. So FX have material negative impact over on cost of sales. This kind of atypical relationship between revenues and cost of sales, we don't expect it to continue in 2017, we do expect it to continue next quarter and it's really being driven primarily by Japan, and within Japan, obviously, the yen, based on just what's going on there relative to the currency fluctuations in the yen in the amount of end market inventory that we have there.

During my remarks this morning, I will briefly recap the highlights in the quarter and provide some comments on the strength and depth of our pipeline.
Starting with the quarter, we recorded another quarter of solid operational revenue growth, marking our eighth consecutive quarter of operational growth. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange and legacy Hospira operations, Pfizer's standalone revenues grew by 3% operational.
Looking at each of our businesses, Pfizer's Innovative Health achieved another quarter of strong revenue growth through the performance of key brands, including Eliquis globally, Xeljanz, Lyrica, Chantix and Ibrance primarily in the U.S.
We continue to be very pleased with the performance of Ibrance. Since our U.S. launch in February 2015, it remains the market leader for the treatment of first-line HR+ HER2- metastatic breast cancer. As expected, we are starting to see a tempering in new market share growth. However, our total scripts continue to grow and we are focused on reaching additional metastatic patients currently receiving chemotherapy or hormone replacement therapy -- sorry, hormone therapy alone.
We also anticipate the publication of our Phase III PALOMA-2 study will occur by year-end and expect that the ability of our dedicated breast cancer field [ph] course to then detail on the strength of this data. It should allow us to achieve greater penetration into the later [ph] doctor and physicians, many of whom are potentially high prescribers for Ibrance.
A key milestone to grow the Ibrance franchise is to secure approval in the EU where we have filed and received a positive opinion from the CHMP in September. We expect the decision from the commission later this year.
Also of note, both Eliquis and Xeljanz continue to generate attractive growth on a quarter-over-quarter basis, and Chantix in the U.S. is benefiting from the publication early this year of the EAGLES Study.
Prevnar 13, sequentially, we saw an increase this quarter in adult indication as flu season approaches. And overall, the Prevnar family continues to perform in line with our expectations.
Turning to Pfizer Essential Health business. It achieved operational revenue growth primarily due to the inclusion of the legacy Hospira operations and, to a less extent, from the Essential Health Standalone Sterile Injectables portfolio. Excluding legacy Hospira, we experienced a slight operational revenue decline on a year-to-date basis. However, we remain confident that the Essential Health portfolio has the potential to pivot to achieve more sustainable growth.
We expect this shift to be driven by a combination of anticipated growth across the portfolio, including sterile injectables, anti-infectives, biosimilars and emerging markets. Correct to say [ph] [indiscernible] offset to our Peri-LOE and legacy products portfolio which, by their nature, are robust contributors to cash flow generation, given they are multi-sourced and generally primed in developing markets.
As part of the Essential Health growth strategy, we anticipate to continue to refine the portfolio with good business development activities such as the pending acquisition of AstraZeneca's late-stage small molecule anti-infectives business and our recent agreement to sell the Infusion Systems unit to ICU Medical.
All in all, the PIH and EH business are performing well and have been further strengthened by approximately $40 billion of acquisitions we've done over the past year. It has enhanced our near-term growth potential by expanding our footprint in the highest growth therapeutic areas, including biosimilars, sterile injectables in Hospira, medical dermatology with Anacor, oncology with Medivation as well as several smaller deals. These additions to our portfolio have bolstered near-term revenue generation opportunities as our pipeline continue to mature and advance.
Turning to our pipeline. We remain confident that we have built a solid pipeline in targeted areas that have potentially meaningful clinical value for patients and will provide the largest return on investment for shareholders.
Of particular note is our oncology platform. For Ibrance, we have more than 60 research programs in breast and non-breast cancers, including squamous cell and neck cancer, metastatic pancreatic cancer and mantle cell lymphoma.
For Xtandi, the FDA approved the label update on October 20 to include new clinical data from the first comparative trial that demonstrated the safety of Xtandi compared to bicalutamide. We believe these data will help position to better understand the difference between Xtandi and bicalutamide for their patients living with metastatic CRPC, that's castration-resistant prostate cancer. Similar to Ibrance, we hope to generate new data to drive increased utilization earlier in the treatment paradigm for prostate cancer.
For immuno-oncology, we continue to execute our primary strategy of 10 compounds in the clinic and 30 programs ongoing. Given [indiscernible] Merck KGaA, we are on track to sell avelumab for treatment of metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma by the end of this year in the U.S. and we just announced the European Medicines Agency validated the review of our marketing operation -- Market Authorization Application in the EU.
Over 3,000 patients have now been enrolled in ongoing avelumab studies. We have studies evaluating avelumab as monotherapy and are completing recruitments in second-line non-small cell lung cancer and other small tumor types. However, we believe that doublets and triplets, that is the combination of avelumab with other bio [ph] drugs or chemotherapy, are the areas of greatest potential for patients. And we are making chartered investments in support of developing clinical data to potentially advance these combinations. We've initiated avelumab combination studies with chemotherapy and targeted therapies and expect to see updated data next year on Inlyta plus avelumab in first-line renal cell carcinoma and rituximab plus 4-1BB in follicular lymphoma. We also anticipate data on avelumab plus 4-1BB next year.
In addition to avelumab, for the remainder of the year, we have studies underway with other agents in our portfolio, including OX40 as a single agent and in combination with 4-1BB and avelumab in various tumor types. PTK7 and ADC is showing encouraging activity in ovarian cancer in Phase Ib and combination studies with avelumab will commence in 2017. [indiscernible] inhibitor is also in Phase I and we expect combination studies to start in 2017. Our clinical allogeneic CAR-T Cell program [indiscernible] is on track with recruitment in the U.K. ongoing.
Inflammation and immunology. Through our Anacor acquisition, we have added crisaborole to our pipeline for the treatment of mild to moderate dermatitis. It is currently under review by the FDA with a January 2017 PDUFA date. If approved, crisaborole has the potential to be an important first-line treatment for the 18 million patients in the U.S. who suffer from this significant unmet medical need. We are also exploring filing crisaborole outside of the U.S.
We continue to see strong potential to expand the label for our [indiscernible] of Xeljanz in diseases beyond RA such as UC and [indiscernible]. We're excited about our next-generation of selected JAK inhibitors currently in development.
In [indiscernible], in September, we recorded positive Phase III data for ertugliflozin. In partnership with Merck, we're on track to submit new drug applications to the FDA for ertugliflozin in fixed-dose combinations, ertugliflozin plus Januvia and ertugliflozin plus metformin by the end of 2016.
As you saw today, we announced the discontinuation of the clinical development program for bococizumab. While these decisions are always difficult, we make these assessments in the best interest of patients and our shareholders and within the context of both the data defining the potential profile of the drug as well as our view of the treatment and market landscape for the drug.
The discontinuation decision was made based on the totality of information available to us across 2 key areas. The first is the emerging clinical profile from our sixth completed Phase III lipid-lowering study, specifically the longer-term efficacy data now in hand, including from 2 recently completed 52-week studies from which top line results were announced today, we have seen an anticipated tenuation of LDL cholesterol lowering over time. Additionally, we have observed an anticipated higher level of immunogenicity and injection site reaction of bococizumab as compared to other agents in the class.
The second is the evolving treatment and market landscape for lipid-lowering agents in the PCSK9 class. In this market, a treatment's ability to impact CD outcomes is a significant value driver, which requires long-term efficacy and durability of the cholesterol lowering. And we have also recently seen payers establish access restrictions to the class, which has meaningfully dampened our initial expectations for the market potential.
Taken together, the totality of the emerging clinical profile and the treatment and market landscape led us to the conclusion that bococizumab is no longer likely to provide value to patients, physicians or shareholders. And as a result, we determined the appropriate decision was to discontinue the development program.
In rare diseases, the acquisition of Bamboo Therapeutics complements our rare disease portfolio and enhances our leadership position in gene therapy. And with our partner, Spark, we have seen data from the first 7 patients being treated in our ongoing Phase I/II trial, which is promising so far and has the potential to be a long-term therapy for the treatment of hemophilia B.
In vaccines, we continue to advance [indiscernible] programs, which are both currently in Phase II. We anticipate [indiscernible] Phase II readout before the year-end. And assuming it achieves its primary end point, we anticipate a potential Phase III start in the first half of 2007 (sic) [2017].
And in biosimilars, we remain confident that we will be well-positioned in the emerging biosimilars market with our broad pipeline. We recently announced that we will begin shipment of Inflectra to wholesalers in the U.S. in late November.
As you can see, we expect to have several key pipeline markdowns between now and the end of 2007 (sic) [2017] across several therapeutic areas.
To summarize, the remainder of this year, we anticipate potential EU decisions for Ibrance, avelumab filing in the U.S. in Merkel cell carcinoma, ertugliflozin filing in the U.S. and [indiscernible] proof-of-concept readout.
In 2017, we anticipate potential U.S. decision for avelumab Merkel cell carcinoma, potential [indiscernible] submission in non-small cell lung cancer, potential EU decision for Xeljanz in RA, potential U.S. filing in the first half of 2017 for label extension for Xeljanz in UC and [indiscernible] and potential [indiscernible] decision in the U.S.
In addition, between now and the end of 2017, we expect up to 12 pivotal studies with top line readouts, with 7 from oncology, including the first [indiscernible] combination data readouts of avelumab; one from rare disease and 4 from biosimilars.
Over the past 5 years, we have worked to shape the quality of the assets in our pipeline. I believe we have a mix of competitive assets that are positioned to get the new therapy breakthroughs for patients over the next few years. Similarly, over the past 3 years, each of our business have gained a sharper focus, increased accountability and a greater ability to capture the opportunities within their unique markets.
Today, they have the independence and resources as standalone entities within Pfizer to effectively compete in end markets while having the benefit of the operational strength and financial flexibility associated with being part of Pfizer.
For example, we are now managing our Innovative Health business as biotherapeutics-focused integrated businesses plus consumer health. We think of them as 5 small biotech companies each concentrated on targeted areas of science and relevant patient groups and I think a clear focus of delivering value to patients and, in turn, to shareholders.
In conclusion, our business is performing well. We have taken steps to position Innovative Health and Essential Health for long-term success through competitive portfolios, pipeline investment in key growth areas that address the unmet needs of patients and, thirdly, the financial strength to continue to invest in the growth drivers that will enable both business to be leaders in their markets.

162270,401980108,1068809,"Pfizer Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2016",2016-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Pfizer Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ian. Good day, everyone. As always, the charts I'm reviewing today are included in our webcast.As a reminder, because we completed the acquisition of Hospira on September 3, 2015, Pfizer's financial results for the third quarter and the first 9",1241,"Thanks, Ian. Good day, everyone. As always, the charts I'm reviewing today are included in our webcast.
As a reminder, because we completed the acquisition of Hospira on September 3, 2015, Pfizer's financial results for the third quarter and the first 9 months of 2016 include Hospira global operations, while the comparable prior year periods include only one month of legacy Hospira U.S. and do not include financial results from legacy Hospira international operations.
In addition, Pfizer completed the acquisition of Anacor Pharmaceuticals on June 24, 2016. Consequently, our financial results for the third quarter and the first 9 months of 2016 include 3 months of legacy Anacor operations, which were immaterial.
Finally, Pfizer completed its acquisition of Medivation on September 28, 2016, so financial results for the third quarter and first 9 months of 2016 reflect 3 business days of legacy Medivation operations, which were also immaterial.
Now, moving on to the financials. Third quarter revenues were approximately $13 billion and reflect year-over-year operational growth of $1.2 billion or 10%, which was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of $224 million or 2%. Legacy Hospira operations contributed $1.1 billion to Pfizer's third quarter revenues in our Essential Health business. If you exclude foreign exchange and the contribution from legacy Hospira operations, Pfizer's standalone revenues grew operationally by $381 million or 3%.
Innovative Health operational revenue growth was 10%, driven by the strong performance of Ibrance in the U.S., Eliquis globally, and Xeljanz, Lyrica and Chantix all primarily in the U.S., which were partially offset by the loss of Rebif alliance revenue versus the year-ago quarter due to the expiration at year-end 2015 of the agreement to co-promote Rebif in the U.S., lower Enbrel revenues in most developed Europe markets due to biosimilar competition and expected lower revenues from Prevnar 13 adult in the U.S. due to the high initial capture rate after its launch in the fourth quarter of 2014 resulting in a smaller catch-up opportunity versus the year-ago quarter.
Essential Health operational revenue growth was also 10%, driven by the inclusion of legacy Hospira operations and, to a lesser extent, from Pfizer Standalone Sterile Injectables, both of which were partially offset by the loss of exclusivity in the associated generic competition, primarily from Lyrica and Zyvox in most developed Europe markets.
Pfizer standalone revenue in the Essential Health business, which excludes the contribution of legacy Hospira operations, declined 5% operationally as a result of the 7% operational increase from the Standalone Sterile Injectables portfolio, which was more than offset by a 15% operational decrease in the Peri-LOE Products portfolio and the 4% operational decline in the Essential Health Standalone Legacy Established Products portfolio. 
It's important to note that in emerging markets, Pfizer's overall Essential Health revenues grew 9% operationally due primarily to the inclusion of legacy Hospira operations and Pfizer Standalone Sterile Injectables portfolio and Standalone Legacy Established Products portfolio.
Third quarter reported diluted EPS was $0.21 compared with $0.34 in the year-ago quarter due to the charge related to the pending sale of Hospira Infusion Systems, increased operating expenses, product losses of exclusivity and foreign exchange impacts, including the Venezuelan bolivar, all of which were partially offset by revenue growth in certain new in-line and acquired products and lower asset impairment charges and lower acquisition-related cost.
Adjusted diluted EPS for the third quarter was $0.61 versus $0.60 in the year-ago quarter. The increase is primarily due to increased revenues, a lower effective tax rate and fewer diluted weighted average shares outstanding, which declined by 105 million shares versus the year-ago quarter due to our share repurchase program, all of which were partially offset by an aggregate operational increase in adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses and adjusted R&D expenses of approximately $1.1 billion or 16%, which includes the addition of Hospira operations in 2016, a $0.04 negative impact due to foreign exchange and continuing product losses of exclusivity.
I want to point out that third quarter adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenues increased year-over-year from 17.4% to 22.7% primarily due to foreign exchange and the addition of legacy Hospira operations. Also, because foreign exchange increased cost of sales while decreasing revenues at the same time, which is atypical, there was an exaggerated increase of our adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenues in the third quarter. If you exclude the foreign exchange impact, third quarter adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue would have been 20.9%. Although we have experienced this for 2 consecutive quarters, we continue to view this as an anomaly rather than a trend, and we have narrowed our 2016 adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue guidance within its original rate.
Foreign exchange negatively impacted third quarter revenues by approximately $224 million or 2%, of which approximately $175 million was attributable to Venezuela. While FX favorably impacted adjusted SI&A and R&D expenses, the previously mentioned significant negative impact on adjusted cost of sales drove the overall FX impact of $116 million or 2% in our total adjusted cost. As a result, foreign exchange negatively impacted third quarter adjusted diluted EPS by approximately $0.04 compared with the year-ago quarter, with approximately $0.015 related to Venezuela.
As you could see on the chart, we have narrowed the ranges to certain components of 2016 financial guidance. We increased the low end of our revenue guidance range and we now expect 2016 revenues to be in the range of $52 billion to $53 billion. I want to point out that this range continues to absorb an anticipated $1.8 billion negative impact from product losses of exclusivity and an anticipated $1.4 billion negative impact from foreign exchange versus 2015, of which almost $850 million is attributable to Venezuela.
I also want to remind everyone that -- or as we previously communicated, there are 7 fewer selling days in the fourth quarter of 2016 versus the fourth quarter of 2015. This will impact only the quarterly year-over-year comparisons, given that there are essentially the same number of selling days in 2016 as there were in 2015.
Because of our decision to discontinue the global clinical development program for boco, we now expect adjusted R&D expenses to be in the range of $7.8 billion to $8.1 billion and adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.38 to $2.43, which is still within our original range of $2.38 to $2.48.
It's important to note that the midpoint of our adjusted diluted EPS guidance range was negatively  impacted solely to reflect this decision. Excluding this boco decision, the midpoint of the range would have increased by $0.02.
Moving on to key takeaways. We achieved our eighth consecutive quarter of operational revenue growth. In the third quarter of 2016, growth was driven by the inclusion of legacy Hospira operations, new products that are early in their life cycles such as Ibrance, Eliquis and Xeljanz as well as the solid performance from Lyrica and Chantix. We narrowed the ranges of certain components of our 2016 financial guidance. We announced and completed the acquisition of Medivation and accomplished several key product and pipeline milestones. And we returned $10.5 billion to shareholders through the first 9 months of 2016 through dividends and share repurchases, including a $5 billion accelerated share repurchase program. Finally, we remain committed to building attractive shareholder returns in 2016 and beyond.
Now I'll turn it back to Chuck."

So let me take the launch of Inflectra, first of all. We obviously are very excited, very positive about the opportunities that we have, and that's based on the positive uptick that we've seen in the markets where we've already launched Inflectra. In fact, where biosimilars have launched, we've already seen around about a 26% volume share of branded Remicade switch to biosimilars of infliximab. And so we believe that actually the marketplace, on a global basis, is really beginning to become more comfortable with the introduction of biosimilars. And so in the United States, we obviously are very positive about the opportunities that, that represents. And we look forward, as we've already announced, to introducing Inflectra towards the end of this year.
In relation to sterile injectables, obviously, as you know, we're very focused on the combination of the legacy Hospira sterile injectable portfolio along with the branded legacy Pfizer portfolio. The strong performance that we've seen in the sterile injectable business this quarter really is a reflection of the combination of the strengths of both of those portfolios together, both the legacy branded Pfizer portfolio as well as the legacy generic Hospira sterile injectable portfolio. And I think we're seeing, at a customer level, that the combination of that much broader offerings to the customers really provide us with the breadth of portfolio that our customers value and provide us with a strong operational offering to customers right across the world.

This is going to take a little bit long, given the extent of your questions on this. Let's just deal, in general, with the pricing situation, and then we'll come back to the supply -- the Prop 61.
So look, we're -- obviously, drug pricing affordability is an issue that is concerning to us and has currently been amplified in this election cycle. There is considerable uncertainty and turmoil about both candidate's positions on these issues and it's difficult to decipher between campaign rhetoric and legitimate policy views. It's been disappointing. It's been disappointing that this debate on pricing has completely neglected the other side of the ledger, that is the benefits and value added by the pharmaceutical industry. So while we understand the health care costs have been increasing for many patients, we disagree with the prevailing notion among some politicians that pharmaceuticals are the reason for these rising costs. And we believe that post the election cycle, good public policy will prevail.
So currently, in the U.S., if used as a comparator, we spend 70% of our GDP on health care, yet we only spend 2% on drugs, while 12% of GDP is spent on inpatient and outpatient services. When we compare that to the OECD countries, who spend approximately 9% of GDP on health care, they spend 1.5% of GDP on drugs and only 5.5% of GDP on medical services, over half a point of GDP extra on drugs between OECD and the United States. You get a vibrant, research-based industry that is producing roughly $1.3 trillion of value to GDP. I think policymakers are well aware of the importance of maintaining an innovative pharmaceutical business. However, if you look at cost increases in the U.S. from 2004 to 2014, hospital service costs have increased 75%, while prescription drug costs have increased 35%. While faster than the CTI, they are lagging the overall medical cost of around 40% growth.
I think what's exacerbated the cost problem for patients in -- is their insurance plans, on average, cover a much lower share, 83% actually, of prescription drug costs for the -- compared to the cost of medical services where they cover 96%. So we're seeing insurance companies are making a choice of subsidizing health services more than drugs. You see this in the actions taken by increasing co-pays and shifting drugs into the overall deductible, which has pushed the issue with patients and affordability, but it's certainly not due to price increases because, in 2016, the branded pharmaceutical industry talked about a 2.8, on average, net price increase.
I think the market is reacting to the fact that in the pharmaceutical business, there are 2 markets. There's a market of branded patent-protected products, who increased prices in '15 to 8%, then a market of people who make generics or generics that are exclusive, where we've seen certain actives take on what is hard to believe is unreasonable price increases. So I think we can have better solutions if we look to how do we fix the policy issues and the regulatory issues that allow single suppliers, single-source suppliers and ease the pathway of these generics.
Regardless of the election results, I don't -- I'm not really concerned. Well, no matter the outcome of the presidential races, we will continue to look to public officials.
That being said, let's talk to the rebate issue. Look, I think the rebates have served an important contribution to allowing negotiations on volume-related transactions. I think they are now becoming less helpful in getting cost-effective solutions to patients. In reality, if we could find some way, and I think it would need a legislative fix, that we could find some way in ensuring that the pharmaceutical industry has an ability to moderate price according to volumes sold for the cost of the customers without rebates, I think that it would be of the best interest to patients.
Now, coming to the issue on Prop 61. If we voted today on the facts of the case, on the merits of the proposition, it would be rejected by the Californian voters. I don't -- we don't see any particular overall benefit in health care costs for California. However, we are in a highly politicized arena. It's difficult to say exactly what will happen on this proposition. But once we know the result, the industry will then formulate its public policy responses.
I would like to say that what Prop 61 is asking for is basically untenable. It's asking for an industry that has given noncommercial prices to the veterans for very good reason, they are a special part of our society and we give them noncommercial prices to that part of society, take that and send it to the rest of government is not a work of an economic model. So Prop 61, between its loading and this information of 6 months, implementation in 6 months, I will expect to see a lot of public policy discussions between that time and its implementation. Sorry for the length of that answer."

There are some facts in Q3. 26% of Xtandi units were prescribed by urologists, up from 20% historical. Right now, we have approximately 2,000 urologists prescribing the product. And the recent market research suggests that 80% of urologists are highly compelled to prescribe Xtandi after seeing the TERRAIN data.

In fact, we continue to see robust LDL lowering. It was only recently that we got the data on the majority of our LDL trials at 52 weeks. And at 52 weeks, we saw a substantial population reduction in LDL lowering, and we correlated that with neutralizing antibodies. And then we have the site rejection on one of our -- the injection site reaction on some of our trials. So when you look at the total profile of our drug, we don't believe it's commercially -- could be commercially successful or in the benefit of patients for us to continue to bring that to market. I think -- and then on the pricing issue, we've always priced responsively. We've priced to the marketplace the value of our product. And on the affordability issue, we've always made provisions for patients who have no insurance or poor insurance to get our product for free or nearly free. So I don't believe that there is any reason for Pfizer to change its approach to the pricing of our products as we sit here today. Thank you."

And this decline reflects the negative impact from biosimilars in Europe that were on slate in Q1. We have been preparing for biosimilar competition for quite some time, and we plan to continue to differentiate Enbrel by generating new data, by enhancing the patient experience and, of course, by leveraging our expertise in inflammation. For the remainder of the year, we expect continued modest uptake of Etanercept biosimilars. But due to their limited long-term safety and efficacy data, we anticipate their use will be primarily in new patients as physicians look to gain experience with these products. On your question on pricing. So far, of the limited pricing we have seen to date for Benepali, the discount levels are in line with our expectations, and we expect Enbrel's pricing to be competitive. In Norway or in Denmark, where Benepali won national tenders, let me say Norwegians published the outcome of their tender and Benepali  won the tender with a 47% discount while Enbrel provided a 41% discount. But it is important to note that the tender process in Norway is not indicative by any means of the pricing practices and trends typically seen in other markets across Europe. Now let me speak about Ibrance. Ibrance had a terrific launch and has quickly become the standard of care. Since launch, it's been prescribed by more than 8,500 physicians, reaching more than 40,000 patients. This rapid uptake is a testament to its efficacy and its outstanding safety and tolerability profile. Very low rate of great fear for GI side effects such as fatigue or diarrhea. Now as expected, given this performance, we are starting to see some tempering of growth. But let me clarify that. Recent reporting changes at IMS due to some specialty pharmacy consolidations might be mudding the orders and not showing an accurate picture. Based on our data, we continued to grow in scripts by 9% in the third quarter versus the second quarter of 2016, sequential, which aligns with our own net sales growth of 7% quarter-after-quarter. Now moving forward, our strategy with Ibrance is unfolding. So far, growth of Ibrance has come from establishing the product to early-adopting physicians. We believe growth in the next 2 years in the U.S. will come from late adopters but have a limited prescription so far. We are now moving to the second phase of our strategy and building a dedicated sales team and field-based medical organization to maximize this opportunity. In addition, the publication of our Phase III PALOMA-2 study data, which we anticipate to occur by year-end, will be important additional data for these late-adopting physicians. Now outside U.S., additional growth will come from our geographical expansion. As you know, Ibrance is ready within U.S. and now we plan to more countries, we have received positive opinion from CHMP in Europe and expect registration later this year. And last but not least, in the midterm, the growth will come from the many studies currently running to move to earlier lines of breast cancer."

Now when it comes to opportunity to advance the class further, I really appreciated your question because I think in 2017 and '18, you will see Pfizer propel as among the leaders when it comes to combination therapies. We aspire to have up to 6 triple therapies in the clinic by 2018 and up to 4 of them in the clinic by the end of this year. And that will include triple I/O agents such as 4-1BB, avelumab and OX40. It will include doublets and triplets with chemo and I/O agents. It will include also combinations with other emerging drugs in our pipeline, whether targeted drugs as well as combination drugs such as antibody-drug conjugate, smaller molecules like IDO. And I think what you will see is across many solid tumors, some of the larger tumor cases, lung, ovarian and gastric, as well as in blood cancer, a large set of trials that will be doublets and triplets and will address the need to further augment the promising results of immuno-oncology as well as deal with their colder tumors that are low in PD-L1."

So if you look at our cost of sales as a percentage of revenue this quarter, 22.7%. If you remove the impact of foreign exchange, that 22.7% becomes 20.9%. So FX have material negative impact over on cost of sales. By the way, this kind of atypical relationship between revenues and cost of sales, while we don't expect it to continue in 2017, we do expect it to continue next quarter, and it's really being driven primarily by Japan and within Japan, obviously, the yen based on just what's going on there relative to the currency fluctuations of the yen and the amount of end market inventory that we have there.

In terms of the EU markets, look, I cannot obviously give you a forward-looking statement on our forecast, but we aim for leadership with Ibrance there. And we think that we have very robust plans. We have built our sales forces. We are expecting the approval now, which is one of the most comprehensive compassionate use products that Pfizer has ever launched.

And then the last question is, as we look at and consider the market opportunity and your considerations in I/O, I would argue that it implies either a unique ability to displace existing players for a larger market opportunity.

I think it's a really growing drug class, which was fueled by very promising ovarian data that was presented at ESMO. And within that class, we are very excited about talazoparib because of its very strong potency and also that it has a potentially unique differentiation with what is called PARP trapping. When it comes to the near-term opportunities, we have a Phase III trial called M-BRCA [ph], which is in BRCA-mutated breast cancer that has a readout due next year, possibly mid of the year. And we look forward very much to see that data set as we think that the talazoparib and the PARP class in this type of sensitized tumors with DNA repair deficiency can perform very well and supplement other therapies. I want to -- just to punctuate that the existence of this BRCA and other DNA repairs deficiency now goes into a number of cancers, and the opportunity is likely much larger than early anticipated. It's not just breast, ovarian but also increasingly seen in -- plus data in lung. And these tumors often carry a high mutational burden, which allow us uniquely to combine talazoparib with immuno-oncology product. And of course, that can include doublets like avelumab and potentially even triplets. So I think you should really keep an eye on what we may be able to do with our really comprehensive portfolio to move this to standalone and in combination."

As you know, it was a randomized, double-blind, parallel group study with almost 500 patients and importantly was funded by the Norwegian government. And the study found no significant difference in disease worsening between patients who underwent a single switch to Inflectra CT-P13 versus, obviously, who remained on Remicade. It also finds that the incidence of antidrug antibodies and the frequency of reported adverse events between Remicade and Inflectra CT-P13 were similar.

During my remarks this morning, I will briefly recap the highlights from the quarter and provide some comments on the strength and depth of our pipeline.Starting with the quarter, we rec",2007,"Thank you, Chuck, and thank you for joining our call this morning. During my remarks this morning, I will briefly recap the highlights from the quarter and provide some comments on the strength and depth of our pipeline.
Starting with the quarter, we recorded another quarter of solid operational revenue growth, marking our eighth consecutive quarter of operational growth. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange and the legacy Hospira operations, Pfizer's standalone revenues grew by 3% operationally.
Looking at each of our businesses, Pfizer's Innovative Health achieved another quarter of strong revenue growth due to the performance of key brands, including Eliquis globally, Xeljanz, Lyrica, Chantix and Ibrance primarily in the U.S.
We continue to be very pleased with the performance of Ibrance. Since our U.S. launch in February 2015, it remains the market leader for the treatment of first-line HR+ HER2- metastatic breast cancer. As expected, we are starting to see a tempering in new market share growth. However, our total scripts continue to grow and we are focused on reaching additional metastatic patients currently receiving chemotherapy or hormone replacement therapy -- sorry, hormone therapy alone.
We also anticipate the publication of our Phase III PALOMA-2 study will occur by year-end and expect that the ability of our dedicated breast cancer field force to then detail on the strength of this data. It should allow us to achieve greater penetration into the late adopting physicians, many of whom are potentially high prescribers for Ibrance.
A key milestone to grow the Ibrance franchise would be to secure approval in the EU where we have filed and received a positive opinion from the CHMP in September. We expect the decision from the commission later this year.
Also of note, both Eliquis and Xeljanz continue to generate attractive growth on a quarter-over-quarter basis, and Chantix in the U.S. is benefiting from the publication earlier this year of the EAGLES Study.
Prevnar 13, sequentially, we saw an increase this quarter in adult indication as flu season approaches. And overall, the Prevnar family continues to perform in line with our expectations.
Turning to the Pfizer Essential Health business. It achieved operational revenue growth primarily due to the inclusion of the legacy Hospira operations and, to a lesser extent, from the Essential Health Standalone Sterile Injectables portfolio. Excluding legacy Hospira, we experienced a slight operational revenue decline on a year-to-date basis. However, we remain confident that the Essential Health portfolio has the potential to pivot to achieve modest sustainable growth.
We expect this shift to be driven by a combination of anticipated growth across the portfolio, including sterile injectables, anti-infectives, biosimilars and emerging markets. Collectively, they make [indiscernible] offset for our Peri-LOE and legacy products portfolio which, by their nature, are robust contributors to cash flow generation, given they are multi-sourced, generally, prime [ph] in developing markets.
As part of the Essential Health growth strategy, we anticipate continuing to refine the portfolio with good business development activities such as the pending acquisition of AstraZeneca's late-stage small molecule anti-infectives business and our recent agreement to sell the Infusion Systems unit to ICU Medical.
All in all, the PIH and PH business are performing well and have been further strengthened by the approximately $40 billion of acquisitions we've done over the past year, which has enhanced our near-term growth potential by expanding our footprint in the highest growth therapeutic areas, including biosimilars, sterile injectables with Hospira, medical dermatology with Anacor, oncology with Medivation as well as several smaller deals. These additions to our portfolio have bolstered near-term revenue generation opportunities as our pipeline continues to mature and advance.
Turning to our pipeline. We remain confident that we have built a solid pipeline in targeted areas that have potentially meaningful clinical value for patients and will provide the largest return on investment for shareholders.
Of particular note is our oncology platform. For Ibrance, we have more than 60 research programs in breast and non-breast cancers, including squamous cell and neck cancer, metastatic pancreatic cancer and mantle cell lymphoma.
For Xtandi, the FDA approved the label update on October 20 to include important data from the first comparative trial that demonstrated the safety and efficacy of Xtandi compared to bicalutamide. We believe these data will help position us to better understand the difference between Xtandi and bicalutamide for their patients living with metastatic CRPC, that's castration-resistant prostate cancer. Similar to Ibrance, we hope to generate new data to drive increased utilization earlier in the treatment paradigm for prostate cancer.
For immuno-oncology, we continue to execute our primary strategy of 10 compounds in the clinic and 30 programs ongoing. Together with our partner, Merck KGaA, we are on track to file avelumab for treatment of metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma by the end of this year in the U.S. and we just announced the European Medicines Agency validated the review of our marketing operation -- of our Market Authorization Application in the EU.
Over 3,000 patients have now been enrolled in ongoing avelumab studies. We have studies evaluating avelumab as monotherapy and are completing recruitments in second-line non-small cell lung cancer and other small tumor types. However, we believe that doublets and triplets, that is the combination of avelumab with other bio [ph] drugs or chemotherapy, are the areas of greatest potential for patients. And we are making targeted investments in support of developing clinical data to potentially advance these combinations. We've initiated avelumab combination studies with chemotherapy and targeted therapies and expect to see updated data next year on Inlyta plus avelumab in first-line renal cell carcinoma and rituximab plus 4-1BB in follicular lymphoma. We also anticipate data on avelumab plus 4-1BB next year.
In addition to avelumab, for the remainder of the year, we have studies underway with other agents in our portfolio, including OX40 as a single agent and in combination with 4-1BB and with avelumab in various tumor types. PTK7 and ADC is showing encouraging activity in ovarian cancer in Phase Ib and combination studies with avelumab will commence in 2017. [indiscernible] inhibitor is also in Phase I and we expect combination studies to start in 2017. Our clinical allogeneic CAR-T Cell program with selective [indiscernible] is on track with recruitment in the U.K. ongoing.
In inflammation and immunology, through our Anacor acquisition, we have added crisaborole to our pipeline for the treatment of mild to moderate dermatitis. It is currently under review by the FDA with a January 2017 PDUFA date. If approved, crisaborole has the potential to be an important first-line treatment for the 18 million patients in the U.S. who suffer from this significant unmet medical need. We are also exploring filing crisaborole outside of the U.S.
We continue to see strong potential to expand the label for our [indiscernible] Xeljanz in diseases beyond RA such as UC and psoriatic arthritis. We're excited about our next-generation of selected JAK inhibitors currently in development.
In [indiscernible], in September, we recorded positive Phase III data for ertugliflozin. In partnership with Merck, we're on track to submit new drug applications to the FDA for ertugliflozin in 2 fixed-dose combinations, ertugliflozin plus Januvia and ertugliflozin plus metformin, by the end of 2016.
As you saw today, we announced the discontinuation of the clinical development program for bococizumab. While these decisions are always difficult, we make these assessments in the best interests of patients and our shareholders and within the context of both the data defining the potential profile of the drug as well as our view of the treatment and market landscape for the drug.
The discontinuation decision was made based on the totality of information available to us across 2 key areas. The first is the emerging clinical profile from our sixth completed Phase III lipid-lowering study, specifically the longer-term efficacy data now in hand, including from 2 recently completed 52-week studies for which top line results were announced today, we have seen an anticipated tenuation of LDL cholesterol lowering over time. Additionally, we have observed an unanticipated higher level of immunogenicity and injection site reaction of bococizumab as compared to other agents in the class.
The second is the evolving treatment and market landscape for lipid-lowering agents in the PCSK9 class. In this market, a treatment's ability to impact CD outcomes is a significant value driver, which requires long-term efficacy and durability of the cholesterol lowering. And we have also recently seen payers establish access restrictions to the class, which has meaningfully dampened our initial expectations for the market potential.
Taken together, the totality of the emerging clinical profile and the treatment and market landscape led us to the conclusion that bococizumab is no longer likely to provide value to patients, physicians or shareholders. And as a result, we determined the appropriate decision was to discontinue the development program.
In rare diseases, the acquisition of Bamboo Therapeutics complements our rare disease portfolio and enhances our leadership position in gene therapy. And with our partner, Spark, we have seen data from the first 7 patients being treated in our ongoing Phase I/II trial, which is promising so far and has the potential to be a onetime therapy for the treatment of hemophilia B.
In vaccines, we continue to advance [indiscernible] programs, which are both currently in Phase II. We anticipate a [indiscernible] Phase II readout before the year-end. And assuming it achieves its primary end point, we anticipate a potential Phase III start in the first half of 2007 (sic) [ 2017 ].
And in biosimilars, we remain confident that we will be well-positioned in the emerging biosimilars market with our broad pipeline. We recently announced that we will begin shipment of Inflectra to wholesalers in the U.S. in late November.
As you can see, we expect to have several key pipeline [indiscernible] between now and the end of 2007 (sic) [ 2017 ] across several therapeutic areas.
To summarize, the remainder of this year, we anticipate potential EU decisions for Ibrance, avelumab filing in the U.S. in Merkel cell carcinoma, ertugliflozin filing in the U.S. and [indiscernible] proof-of-concept readout.
In 2017, we anticipate potential U.S. decision for avelumab Merkel cell carcinoma, potential [indiscernible] submission in non-small cell lung cancer, potential EU decision for Xeljanz in RA, potential U.S. filing in the first half of 2017 for label extension for Xeljanz in UC and psoriatic arthritis and potential [indiscernible] decision in the U.S.
In addition, between now and the end of 2017, we expect up to 12 pivotal studies with top line readouts, with 7 from oncology, including the first [indiscernible] combination data readouts of avelumab; one from rare disease and 4 from biosimilars.
Over the past 5 years, we have worked to shape the quality of the assets in our pipeline. I believe we have a mix of competitive assets that are positioned to deliver new therapeutic breakthroughs for patients over the next few years. Similarly, over the past 3 years, each of our businesses have gained a sharper focus, increased accountability and a greater ability to capture the opportunities within their unique markets.
Today, they have the independence and resources as standalone entities within Pfizer to effectively compete in their markets while having the benefit of the operational strength and financial flexibility associated with being part of Pfizer.
For example, we are now managing our Innovative Health business as 5 therapeutic-focused integrated businesses plus consumer health. We think of them as 5 small biotech companies each concentrated on targeted areas of science and relevant patient groups and, I think, a clear focus on delivering value to patients and, in turn, to shareholders.
In conclusion, our business is performing well. We have taken steps to position Innovative Health and Essential Health for long-term success through competitive portfolios, pipeline investments in key growth areas that address the unmet needs of patients and, thirdly, the financial strength to continue to invest in the growth drivers that will enable both businesses to be leaders in their markets.
Now I'll turn it over to Frank, who will go into greater detail on the results for the quarter."
162270,401980108,1069191,"Pfizer Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2016",2016-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Pfizer Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Ian. Good day, everyone. As always, the charts I'm going to be reviewing today are included in our webcast.As a reminder, because we completed the acquisition of Hospira on September 3, 2015, Pfizer's financial results for the third quarter and",1241,"Thanks, Ian. Good day, everyone. As always, the charts I'm going to be reviewing today are included in our webcast.
As a reminder, because we completed the acquisition of Hospira on September 3, 2015, Pfizer's financial results for the third quarter and the first 9 months of 2016 include Hospira global operations, while the comparable prior year periods include only one month of legacy Hospira U.S. and do not include financial results from legacy Hospira international operations.
In addition, Pfizer completed the acquisition of Anacor Pharmaceuticals on June 24, 2016. Consequently, our financial results for the third quarter and the first 9 months of 2016 include 3 months of legacy Anacor operations, which were immaterial.
Finally, Pfizer completed its acquisition of Medivation on September 28, 2016, so financial results for the third quarter and first 9 months of 2016 reflect 3 business days of legacy Medivation operations, which were also immaterial.
Now, moving on to the financials. Third quarter revenues were approximately $13 billion and reflect year-over-year operational growth of $1.2 billion or 10%, which was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of $224 million or 2%. Legacy Hospira operations contributed $1.1 billion to Pfizer's third quarter revenues in our Essential Health business. If you exclude foreign exchange and the contribution from legacy Hospira operations, Pfizer's standalone revenues grew operationally by $381 million or 3%.
Innovative Health operational revenue growth was 10%, driven by the strong performance of Ibrance in the U.S., Eliquis globally, and Xeljanz, Lyrica and Chantix all primarily in the U.S., which were partially offset by the loss of Rebif alliance revenue versus the year-ago quarter due to the expiration at year-end 2015 of the agreement to co-promote Rebif in the U.S., lower Enbrel revenues in most developed Europe markets due to biosimilar competition and expected lower revenues from Prevnar 13 adult in the U.S. due to the high initial capture rate after its launch in the fourth quarter of 2014 resulting in a smaller catch-up opportunity versus the year-ago quarter.
Essential Health operational revenue growth was also 10%, driven by the inclusion of legacy Hospira operations and, to a lesser extent, from Pfizer's standalone Sterile Injectables, both of which were partially offset by the loss of exclusivity and the associated generic competition, primarily for Lyrica and Zyvox, in most developed Europe markets.
Pfizer's standalone revenue in the Essential Health business, which excludes the contribution of legacy Hospira operations, declined 5% operationally as a result of a 7% operational increase from the standalone Sterile Injectables portfolio, which was more than offset by a 15% operational decrease in the Peri-LOE Products portfolio and the 4% operational decline in the Essential Health standalone Legacy Established Products portfolio. 
It's important to note that in emerging markets, Pfizer's overall Essential Health revenues grew 9% operationally due primarily to the inclusion of legacy Hospira operations and Pfizer's standalone Sterile Injectables portfolio and standalone Legacy Established Products portfolio.
Third quarter reported diluted EPS was $0.21 compared with $0.34 in the year-ago quarter due to a charge related to the pending sale of Hospira Infusion Systems, increased operating expenses, product losses of exclusivity and foreign exchange impacts, including the Venezuelan bolivar, all of which were partially offset by revenue growth from certain new in-line and acquired products and lower asset impairment charges and lower acquisition-related costs.
Adjusted diluted EPS for the third quarter was $0.61 versus $0.60 in the year-ago quarter. The increase is primarily due to increased revenues, a lower effective tax rate and fewer diluted weighted average shares outstanding, which declined by 105 million shares versus the year-ago quarter due to our share repurchase program, all of which were partially offset by an aggregate operational increase in adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses and adjusted R&D expenses of approximately $1.1 billion or 16%, which includes the addition of Hospira operations in 2016, a $0.04 negative impact due to foreign exchange and continuing product losses of exclusivity.
I want to point out that third quarter adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenues increased year-over-year from 17.4% to 22.7% primarily due to foreign exchange and the addition of legacy Hospira operations. Also, because foreign exchange increased cost of sales while decreasing revenues at the same time, which is atypical, there was an exaggerated increase of our adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenues in the third quarter. If you exclude the foreign exchange impact, third quarter adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue would have been 20.9%. Although we have experienced this for 2 consecutive quarters, we continue to view this as an anomaly rather than a trend, and we have narrowed our 2016 adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue guidance within its original range.
Foreign exchange negatively impacted third quarter revenues by approximately $224 million or 2%, of which approximately $175 million was attributable to Venezuela. While FX favorably impacted adjusted SI&A and R&D expenses, the previously mentioned significant negative impact on adjusted cost of sales drove the overall FX impact of $115 million or 2% in our total adjusted costs. As a result, foreign exchange negatively impacted third quarter adjusted diluted EPS by approximately $0.04 compared with the year-ago quarter, with approximately $0.015 related to Venezuela.
As you can see on the chart, we've narrowed the ranges for certain components of 2016 financial guidance. We increased the low end of our revenue guidance range and we now expect 2016 revenues to be in the range of $52 billion to $53 billion. I want to point out that this range continues to absorb an anticipated $1.8 billion negative impact from product losses of exclusivity and an anticipated $1.4 billion negative impact from foreign exchange versus 2015, of which almost $850 million is attributable to Venezuela.
I also want to remind everyone that as we previously communicated, there are 7 fewer selling days in the fourth quarter of 2016 versus the fourth quarter of 2015. This will impact only the quarterly year-over-year comparisons, given that there are essentially the same number of selling days in 2016 as there were in 2015.
Because of our decision to discontinue the global clinical development program for boco, we now expect adjusted R&D expenses to be in the range of $7.8 billion to $8.1 billion and adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.38 to $2.43, which is still within our original range of $2.38 to $2.48.
It's important to note that the midpoint of our adjusted diluted EPS guidance range was negatively impacted solely to reflect this decision. Excluding this boco decision, the midpoint of the range would have increased by $0.02.
Moving on to key takeaways. We achieved our eighth consecutive quarter of operational revenue growth. In the third quarter of 2016, growth was driven by the inclusion of legacy Hospira operations, new products that are early in their life cycles such as Ibrance, Eliquis and Xeljanz as well as the solid performance from Lyrica and Chantix. We narrowed the ranges for certain components of our 2016 financial guidance. We announced and completed the acquisition of Medivation and accomplished several key product and pipeline milestones. And we returned $10.5 billion to shareholders through the first 9 months of 2016 through dividends and share repurchases, including a $5 billion accelerated share repurchase program. Finally, we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2016 and beyond.
Now I'll turn it back to Chuck."

So let me take the launch of Inflectra, first of all. We obviously are very excited, very positive about the opportunities that we have, and that's based on the positive uptake that we've seen in the markets where we've already launched Inflectra. In fact, where biosimilars have launched, we've already seen around about a 26% volume share of branded Remicade switch to biosimilars of infliximab. And so we believe that, actually, the marketplace, on a global basis, is really beginning to become more comfortable with the introduction of biosimilars.

In relation to sterile injectables, obviously, as you know, we're very focused on the combination of the legacy Hospira sterile injectable portfolio along with the branded legacy Pfizer portfolio.

So look, we're -- obviously, drug pricing affordability is an issue that is concerning to us and has clearly been amplified in this election cycle. There is considerable uncertainty and turmoil about both candidate's positions on these issues and it's difficult to decipher between campaign rhetoric and legitimate policy views. It's been disappointing. It's been disappointing that this debate on pricing has completely neglected the other side of the ledger, that is the benefits and value added by the pharmaceutical industry. So while we understand that health care costs have been increasing for many patients, we disagree with the prevailing notion among some politicians that pharmaceuticals are the reason for these rising costs. And we believe that post the election cycle, good public policy will prevail.
So currently, in the U.S., you'll see it's a comparator, we spend 70% of our GDP on health care, yet we only spend 2% on drugs, while 12% of GDP is spent on inpatient and outpatient services. When we compare that to the OECD countries, who spend approximately 9% of GDP on health care, they spend 1.5% of GDP on drugs and only 5.5% of GDP on medical services, over 0.5 point of GDP extra on drugs between OECD and the United States. You get a vibrant, research-based industry that is producing roughly $1.3 trillion of value to GDP. I think policymakers are well aware of the importance of maintaining an innovative pharmaceutical business. However, if you look at cost increases in the U.S. from 2004 to 2014, hospital service costs have increased 75%, while prescription drug costs have increased 35%. While faster than the CTI, they are lagging the overall medical costs of around 40% growth.
I think what's exacerbated the cost problem for patients in -- is their insurance plans, on average, cover a much lower share, 83% actually, of prescription drug costs for the -- compared to the cost of medical services where they cover 96%. So we're seeing the insurance companies are making a choice of subsidizing health services more than drugs. You see this in their actions taken by increasing co-pays and shifting drugs into the overall deductible, which has pushed the issue with patients on affordability, but it's certainly not due to price increases because, in 2016, the branded pharmaceutical industry talked about a 2.8%, on average, net price increase.
I think the market is reacting to the fact that in the pharmaceutical business, there are 2 markets. There's a market of branded, patent-protected products that increased prices in '15 2.8%, then a market of difficult-to-make generics or generics that are exclusive, where we've seen certain actives take, what society believes, are unreasonable price increases. So I think we can have better solutions if we look to how do we fix the policy issues and the regulatory issues that allow single suppliers, single-source suppliers and ease the pathway of those generics.
Regardless of the election results, I don't -- I'm not really concerned. Well, no matter the outcome of the presidential and congressional races, we will continue to work with public officials.
That being said, let's talk to the rebate issue. Look, I think the rebates have served an important contribution to allowing negotiations on volume-related transactions. I think they are now becoming less helpful in getting cost-effective solutions for patients. In reality, if we could find some way, and I think it would need a legislative fix, if we could find some way of ensuring that the pharmaceutical industry has an ability to moderate price according to volumes sold for [indiscernible] customers without rebates, I think that would be in the best interest of patients.
Now, coming to the issue on Prop 61. If we voted today on the facts of the case, on the merits of the proposition, it would be rejected by the Californian voters. I don't -- we don't see any particular overall benefit in health care costs for California. However, we are in a highly politicized arena. It's difficult to say exactly what will happen on this proposition. But once we know the result, the industry will then formulate its public policy responses.
I would like to say that what Prop 61 is asking for is basically untenable. It's asking for an industry that has given noncommercial prices to the veterans for a very good reason, they are a special part of our society and we've given noncommercial prices to that part of society, to take that and extend it to the rest of government is not a workable economic model. So Prop 61, between its voting and its information in 6 months -- implementation in 6 months, I would expect to see a lot of public policy discussions between that time and its implementation. Sorry for the length of that answer."

But importantly, as you asked, we believe there is a large intact [ph] opportunity within the urology segment, which will be able to be catalyzed by the TERRAIN label update.
Just are some facts. In Q3, 26% of Xtandi units were prescribed by urologists, up from 20% historically. Right now, we have approximately 2,000 urologists prescribing the product. And the recent market research suggests that 80% of urologists are highly compelled to prescribe Xtandi after seeing the TERRAIN data. So I think TERRAIN data publication and the inclusion in the label will be an important catalyst for Xtandi."

I'm just wondering if you saw something with your outcomes trials that you can share with us and any additional details on LDL lowering and events.
And then, my second question is back to the pricing question. Clearly, Pfizer, along with many of your peers, have taken multiple price increases during the year. Pfizer is no exception. How do you see your ability to take price going forward? How should we think about price competition -- or contribution from price going forward?

And on our profile, what we saw was that earlier on, we did see -- we had ADAs. But had data earlier on at 12 weeks and 24 weeks, and we saw no -- can you -- no substantial impact on LDL lowering. In fact, we continue to see a robust LDL lowering. It was only recently that we got the data on the majority of our LDL trials out at 52 weeks. And out at 52 weeks, we saw a substantial population reduction in LDL lowering, and we correlated that with neutralizing antibodies. And then we hade the site rejection on one of our -- the injection site reaction on some of our trials. So when you look at the total profile of our drug, we don't believe that it's commercially -- could be commercially successful or in the benefit of patients for us to continue to bring that to market. I think -- and then on the pricing issue, we have always priced responsively. We've priced to the marketplace the value of our product. And on the affordability issue, we've always made provisions for patients who have no insurance or poor insurance to get our product for free or nearly free. So I don't believe that there is any reason for Pfizer to change its approach to the pricing of our products as we sit here today. Thank you."

And this decline reflects the negative impact from biosimilars in Europe that were on slate in Q1. We have been preparing for biosimilar competition for quite some time, and we plan to continue to differentiate Enbrel by generating new data, by enhancing the patient experience and, of course, by leveraging our expertise in inflammation. For the remainder of the year, we expect continued modest uptake of Etanercept biosimilars. But due to their limited long-term safety and efficacy data, we anticipate their use will be primarily in new patients as physicians look to gain experience with these products. On your question on pricing. So far, of the limited pricing we have seen to date for Benepali, the discount levels are in line with our expectations, and we expect Enbrel's pricing to be competitive. In Norway or in Denmark, where Benepali won national tenders, let me say Norwegians published the outcome of their tender and Benepali won the tender with a 47% discount while Enbrel provided a 41% discount. But it is important to note that the tender process in Norway is not indicative, by any means, of the pricing practices and trends typically seen in other markets across Europe. Now let me speak about Ibrance. Ibrance had a terrific launch and has quickly become the standard of care. Since launch, it's been prescribed by more than 8,500 physicians, reaching more than 40,000 patients. This rapid uptake is a testament to its efficacy and its outstanding safety and tolerability profile. Very low rate of great fear for GI side effects such as fatigue or diarrhea. Now as expected, given this performance, we are starting to see some tempering of growth. But let me clarify that. Recent reporting changes at IMS, due to some specialty pharmacy consolidations, might be muddying the waters and not showing an accurate picture. Based on our data, we continued to grow in scripts by 9% in the third quarter versus the second quarter of 2016, sequentially, which aligns with our own net sales growth of 7% quarter-after-quarter. Now moving forward, our strategy with Ibrance is unfolding. So far, growth of Ibrance has come from establishing the product to early-adopting physicians. We believe growth in the next 2 years in the U.S. will come from late adopters but have limited prescriptions so far. We are now moving to the second phase of our strategy and building a dedicated sales team and field-based medical organization to maximize this opportunity. In addition, the publication of our Phase III PALOMA-2 study data, which we anticipate to occur by year-end, will be important additional data for these late-adopting physicians. Now outside the U.S., additional growth will come from our geographical expansion. As you know, Ibrance is already in U.S. and now in 20 more countries. And we have received positive opinion from CHMP in Europe and expect registration later this year. And last but not least, in the midterm, the growth will come from the many studies currently running to move to earlier lines of breast cancer."

We aspire to have up to 6 triple therapies in the clinic by 2018 and up to 4 of them in the clinic by the end of this year. And that will include triple I/O agents such as 4-1BB, avelumab and OX40. It will include doublets and triplets with chemo and I/O agents. It will include also combinations with other emerging drugs in our pipeline, whether targeted drugs as well as combination drugs such as antibody-drug conjugate, smaller molecules like IDO.

If there was one, what would the dynamics of that repatriation bill need to look like for you to consider repatriating some of the $80 billion that you have trapped offshore that you might potentially like to bring back to the States to put to use? Second question on pricing. I don't think you answered Jami's question on price/volume and the contribution there. But just delving on pricing a little bit further, certainly McKesson and Cardinal have indicated that they expect significantly less price increases next year. Is your innovation product group and your established health group anticipating a similar level of increases to what they took in '16? Or less of increases as have been evidenced by what McKesson and Cardinal have said? And then lastly on Xeljanz.

Now to your question. We are expanding Xeljanz both geographically and therapeutically. And geographically, we are moving into Europe. As you are aware, in March, the EMA accepted our application for the treatment of moderate to severe active RA. The application provides additional information to the original submission, includes data from the oral development program, which consisted of 6 completed Phase III clinical trials plus 2 open-label long-term expansion studies, one of which is still ongoing. While we cannot speculate what would be the European authorities' decision, we are very confident on the strength of the data. Our discussions are going very, very well.

Now on repatriation, I can't -- I would hope that the Congress with the administration will reform the international tax code as soon as possible next year. I think it is entirely uncompetitive and negative to business and jobs in the United States. So I would hope they would reform it in terms of not only repatriation but going to a territorial system or another type of system that permanently puts us on a level playing field with foreign companies.

Everything rises, everything falls in the same direction. But we had an atypical move this quarter. We actually had it last quarter, too, very unusual, where revenues were down, COGS were up. So if you look at our cost of sales as a percentage of revenue this quarter, 22.7%. If you remove the impact of foreign exchange, that 22.7% becomes 20.9%. So FX had material negative impact over on cost of sales. By the way, this kind of atypical relationship between revenues and cost of sales, while we don't expect it to continue in 2017, we do expect it to continue next quarter, and it's really being driven primarily by Japan and within Japan, obviously, the yen, based on just what's gone on there relative to the currency fluctuations of the yen and the amount of end market inventory that we have there.

And within that class, we are very excited about talazoparib because of its very strong potency and also that it has a potentially unique differentiation with what is called PARP trapping. When it comes to the near-term opportunities, we have a Phase III trial called M-BRCA [ph], which is in BRCA-mutated breast cancer that has a readout due next year, possibly middle of the year. And we look forward very much to see that data set as we think that the talazoparib and the PARP class in this type of sensitized tumors with DNA repair deficiency can perform very well and supplement other therapies. I want to -- just to punctuate that the existence of this BRCA and other DNA repairs deficiency now goes into a number of cancers, and the opportunity is likely much larger than early anticipated. It's not just breast, ovarian, but also increasingly seen in prostate and lung. And these tumors often carry a high mutational burden, which allow us, uniquely, to combine talazoparib with an immuno-oncology product. And of course, that can include doublets like avelumab and potentially even triplets.

NOR-SWITCH is a significant additional add to the data that we have for Inflectra. As you know, it was a randomized, double-blind, parallel group study with almost 500 patients and importantly was funded by the Norwegian government. And the study found no significant difference in disease worsening between patients who underwent a single switch to Inflectra CT-P13 versus those who remained on Remicade. It also finds that the incidence of antidrug antibodies and the frequency of reported adverse events between Remicade and Inflectra CT-P13 were similar. And so we think that the impact of that data is that it certainly will be helpful and informative in helping to make sure that physicians, patients and indeed payers can make an informed choice about the role that biosimilars and Inflectra, specifically, can play in that patient population."

162270,401980108,1070525,"Pfizer Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 01, 2016",2016-11-01,"Earnings Calls","Pfizer Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Chuck, and thank you for joining our call this morning. During my remarks this morning, I will briefly recap the highlights from the quarter and provide some comments on the strength and depth of our pipeline.Starting with the quarter, we rec",2007,"Thank you, Chuck, and thank you for joining our call this morning. During my remarks this morning, I will briefly recap the highlights from the quarter and provide some comments on the strength and depth of our pipeline.
Starting with the quarter, we recorded another quarter of solid operational revenue growth, marking our eighth consecutive quarter of operational growth. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange and the legacy Hospira operations, Pfizer's standalone revenues grew by 3% operationally.
Looking at each of our businesses, Pfizer's Innovative Health achieved another quarter of strong revenue growth due to the performance of key brands, including Eliquis globally, Xeljanz, Lyrica, Chantix and Ibrance primarily in the U.S.
We continue to be very pleased with the performance of Ibrance. Since our U.S. launch in February 2015, it remains the market leader for the treatment of first-line HR+ HER2- metastatic breast cancer. As expected, we are starting to see a tempering in new market share growth. However, our total scripts continue to grow and we are focused on reaching additional metastatic patients currently receiving chemotherapy or hormone replacement therapy -- sorry, hormone therapy alone.
We also anticipate the publication of our Phase III PALOMA-2 study will occur by year-end and expect that the ability of our dedicated breast cancer field force to then detail on the strength of this data. It should allow us to achieve greater penetration into the late adopting physicians, many of whom are potentially high prescribers for Ibrance.
A key milestone to grow the Ibrance franchise would be to secure approval in the EU where we have filed and received a positive opinion from the CHMP in September. We expect the decision from the commission later this year.
Also of note, both Eliquis and Xeljanz continue to generate attractive growth on a quarter-over-quarter basis, and Chantix in the U.S. is benefiting from the publication earlier this year of the EAGLES Study.
Prevnar 13, sequentially, we saw an increase this quarter in adult indication as flu season approaches. And overall, the Prevnar family continues to perform in line with our expectations.
Turning to the Pfizer Essential Health business. It achieved operational revenue growth primarily due to the inclusion of the legacy Hospira operations and, to a lesser extent, from the Essential Health Standalone Sterile Injectables portfolio. Excluding legacy Hospira, we experienced a slight operational revenue decline on a year-to-date basis. However, we remain confident that the Essential Health portfolio has the potential to pivot to achieve modest sustainable growth.
We expect this shift to be driven by a combination of anticipated growth across the portfolio, including sterile injectables, anti-infectives, biosimilars and emerging markets. Collectively, they make [indiscernible] offset for our Peri-LOE and legacy products portfolio which, by their nature, are robust contributors to cash flow generation, given they are multi-sourced, generally, prime [ph] in developing markets.
As part of the Essential Health growth strategy, we anticipate continuing to refine the portfolio with good business development activities such as the pending acquisition of AstraZeneca's late-stage small molecule anti-infectives business and our recent agreement to sell the Infusion Systems unit to ICU Medical.
All in all, the PIH and PH business are performing well and have been further strengthened by the approximately $40 billion of acquisitions we've done over the past year, which has enhanced our near-term growth potential by expanding our footprint in the highest growth therapeutic areas, including biosimilars, sterile injectables with Hospira, medical dermatology with Anacor, oncology with Medivation as well as several smaller deals. These additions to our portfolio have bolstered near-term revenue generation opportunities as our pipeline continues to mature and advance.
Turning to our pipeline. We remain confident that we have built a solid pipeline in targeted areas that have potentially meaningful clinical value for patients and will provide the largest return on investment for shareholders.
Of particular note is our oncology platform. For Ibrance, we have more than 60 research programs in breast and non-breast cancers, including squamous cell and neck cancer, metastatic pancreatic cancer and mantle cell lymphoma.
For Xtandi, the FDA approved the label update on October 20 to include important data from the first comparative trial that demonstrated the safety and efficacy of Xtandi compared to bicalutamide. We believe these data will help position us to better understand the difference between Xtandi and bicalutamide for their patients living with metastatic CRPC, that's castration-resistant prostate cancer. Similar to Ibrance, we hope to generate new data to drive increased utilization earlier in the treatment paradigm for prostate cancer.
For immuno-oncology, we continue to execute our primary strategy of 10 compounds in the clinic and 30 programs ongoing. Together with our partner, Merck KGaA, we are on track to file avelumab for treatment of metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma by the end of this year in the U.S. and we just announced the European Medicines Agency validated the review of our marketing operation -- of our Market Authorization Application in the EU.
Over 3,000 patients have now been enrolled in ongoing avelumab studies. We have studies evaluating avelumab as monotherapy and are completing recruitments in second-line non-small cell lung cancer and other small tumor types. However, we believe that doublets and triplets, that is the combination of avelumab with other bio [ph] drugs or chemotherapy, are the areas of greatest potential for patients. And we are making targeted investments in support of developing clinical data to potentially advance these combinations. We've initiated avelumab combination studies with chemotherapy and targeted therapies and expect to see updated data next year on Inlyta plus avelumab in first-line renal cell carcinoma and rituximab plus 4-1BB in follicular lymphoma. We also anticipate data on avelumab plus 4-1BB next year.
In addition to avelumab, for the remainder of the year, we have studies underway with other agents in our portfolio, including OX40 as a single agent and in combination with 4-1BB and with avelumab in various tumor types. PTK7 and ADC is showing encouraging activity in ovarian cancer in Phase Ib and combination studies with avelumab will commence in 2017. [indiscernible] inhibitor is also in Phase I and we expect combination studies to start in 2017. Our clinical allogeneic CAR-T Cell program with selective [indiscernible] is on track with recruitment in the U.K. ongoing.
In inflammation and immunology, through our Anacor acquisition, we have added crisaborole to our pipeline for the treatment of mild to moderate dermatitis. It is currently under review by the FDA with a January 2017 PDUFA date. If approved, crisaborole has the potential to be an important first-line treatment for the 18 million patients in the U.S. who suffer from this significant unmet medical need. We are also exploring filing crisaborole outside of the U.S.
We continue to see strong potential to expand the label for our [indiscernible] Xeljanz in diseases beyond RA such as UC and psoriatic arthritis. We're excited about our next-generation of selected JAK inhibitors currently in development.
In [indiscernible], in September, we recorded positive Phase III data for ertugliflozin. In partnership with Merck, we're on track to submit new drug applications to the FDA for ertugliflozin in 2 fixed-dose combinations, ertugliflozin plus Januvia and ertugliflozin plus metformin, by the end of 2016.
As you saw today, we announced the discontinuation of the clinical development program for bococizumab. While these decisions are always difficult, we make these assessments in the best interests of patients and our shareholders and within the context of both the data defining the potential profile of the drug as well as our view of the treatment and market landscape for the drug.
The discontinuation decision was made based on the totality of information available to us across 2 key areas. The first is the emerging clinical profile from our sixth completed Phase III lipid-lowering study, specifically the longer-term efficacy data now in hand, including from 2 recently completed 52-week studies for which top line results were announced today, we have seen an anticipated tenuation of LDL cholesterol lowering over time. Additionally, we have observed an unanticipated higher level of immunogenicity and injection site reaction of bococizumab as compared to other agents in the class.
The second is the evolving treatment and market landscape for lipid-lowering agents in the PCSK9 class. In this market, a treatment's ability to impact CD outcomes is a significant value driver, which requires long-term efficacy and durability of the cholesterol lowering. And we have also recently seen payers establish access restrictions to the class, which has meaningfully dampened our initial expectations for the market potential.
Taken together, the totality of the emerging clinical profile and the treatment and market landscape led us to the conclusion that bococizumab is no longer likely to provide value to patients, physicians or shareholders. And as a result, we determined the appropriate decision was to discontinue the development program.
In rare diseases, the acquisition of Bamboo Therapeutics complements our rare disease portfolio and enhances our leadership position in gene therapy. And with our partner, Spark, we have seen data from the first 7 patients being treated in our ongoing Phase I/II trial, which is promising so far and has the potential to be a onetime therapy for the treatment of hemophilia B.
In vaccines, we continue to advance [indiscernible] programs, which are both currently in Phase II. We anticipate a [indiscernible] Phase II readout before the year-end. And assuming it achieves its primary end point, we anticipate a potential Phase III start in the first half of 2007 (sic) [ 2017 ].
And in biosimilars, we remain confident that we will be well-positioned in the emerging biosimilars market with our broad pipeline. We recently announced that we will begin shipment of Inflectra to wholesalers in the U.S. in late November.
As you can see, we expect to have several key pipeline [indiscernible] between now and the end of 2007 (sic) [ 2017 ] across several therapeutic areas.
To summarize, the remainder of this year, we anticipate potential EU decisions for Ibrance, avelumab filing in the U.S. in Merkel cell carcinoma, ertugliflozin filing in the U.S. and [indiscernible] proof-of-concept readout.
In 2017, we anticipate potential U.S. decision for avelumab Merkel cell carcinoma, potential [indiscernible] submission in non-small cell lung cancer, potential EU decision for Xeljanz in RA, potential U.S. filing in the first half of 2017 for label extension for Xeljanz in UC and psoriatic arthritis and potential [indiscernible] decision in the U.S.
In addition, between now and the end of 2017, we expect up to 12 pivotal studies with top line readouts, with 7 from oncology, including the first [indiscernible] combination data readouts of avelumab; one from rare disease and 4 from biosimilars.
Over the past 5 years, we have worked to shape the quality of the assets in our pipeline. I believe we have a mix of competitive assets that are positioned to deliver new therapeutic breakthroughs for patients over the next few years. Similarly, over the past 3 years, each of our businesses have gained a sharper focus, increased accountability and a greater ability to capture the opportunities within their unique markets.
Today, they have the independence and resources as standalone entities within Pfizer to effectively compete in their markets while having the benefit of the operational strength and financial flexibility associated with being part of Pfizer.
For example, we are now managing our Innovative Health business as 5 therapeutic-focused integrated businesses plus consumer health. We think of them as 5 small biotech companies each concentrated on targeted areas of science and relevant patient groups and, I think, a clear focus on delivering value to patients and, in turn, to shareholders.
In conclusion, our business is performing well. We have taken steps to position Innovative Health and Essential Health for long-term success through competitive portfolios, pipeline investments in key growth areas that address the unmet needs of patients and, thirdly, the financial strength to continue to invest in the growth drivers that will enable both businesses to be leaders in their markets.
Now I'll turn it over to Frank, who will go into greater detail on the results for the quarter."

As always, the charts I'm going to be reviewing today are included in our webcast.As a reminder, because we completed the acquisition of Hospira on September 3, 2015, Pfizer's financial results for the third quarter and",1241,"Thanks, Ian. Good day, everyone. As always, the charts I'm going to be reviewing today are included in our webcast.
As a reminder, because we completed the acquisition of Hospira on September 3, 2015, Pfizer's financial results for the third quarter and the first 9 months of 2016 include Hospira global operations, while the comparable prior year periods include only one month of legacy Hospira U.S. and do not include financial results from legacy Hospira international operations.
In addition, Pfizer completed the acquisition of Anacor Pharmaceuticals on June 24, 2016. Consequently, our financial results for the third quarter and the first 9 months of 2016 include 3 months of legacy Anacor operations, which were immaterial.
Finally, Pfizer completed its acquisition of Medivation on September 28, 2016, so financial results for the third quarter and first 9 months of 2016 reflect 3 business days of legacy Medivation operations, which were also immaterial.
Now, moving on to the financials. Third quarter revenues were approximately $13 billion and reflect year-over-year operational growth of $1.2 billion or 10%, which was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of $224 million or 2%. Legacy Hospira operations contributed $1.1 billion to Pfizer's third quarter revenues in our Essential Health business. If you exclude foreign exchange and the contribution from legacy Hospira operations, Pfizer's standalone revenues grew operationally by $381 million or 3%.
Innovative Health operational revenue growth was 10%, driven by the strong performance of Ibrance in the U.S., Eliquis globally, and Xeljanz, Lyrica and Chantix all primarily in the U.S., which were partially offset by the loss of Rebif alliance revenue versus the year-ago quarter due to the expiration at year-end 2015 of the agreement to co-promote Rebif in the U.S., lower Enbrel revenues in most developed Europe markets due to biosimilar competition and expected lower revenues from Prevnar 13 adult in the U.S. due to the high initial capture rate after its launch in the fourth quarter of 2014 resulting in a smaller catch-up opportunity versus the year-ago quarter.
Essential Health operational revenue growth was also 10%, driven by the inclusion of legacy Hospira operations and, to a lesser extent, from Pfizer's standalone Sterile Injectables, both of which were partially offset by the loss of exclusivity and the associated generic competition, primarily for Lyrica and Zyvox, in most developed Europe markets.
Pfizer's standalone revenue in the Essential Health business, which excludes the contribution of legacy Hospira operations, declined 5% operationally as a result of a 7% operational increase from the standalone Sterile Injectables portfolio, which was more than offset by a 15% operational decrease in the Peri-LOE Products portfolio and the 4% operational decline in the Essential Health standalone Legacy Established Products portfolio. 
It's important to note that in emerging markets, Pfizer's overall Essential Health revenues grew 9% operationally due primarily to the inclusion of legacy Hospira operations and Pfizer's standalone Sterile Injectables portfolio and standalone Legacy Established Products portfolio.
Third quarter reported diluted EPS was $0.21 compared with $0.34 in the year-ago quarter due to a charge related to the pending sale of Hospira Infusion Systems, increased operating expenses, product losses of exclusivity and foreign exchange impacts, including the Venezuelan bolivar, all of which were partially offset by revenue growth from certain new in-line and acquired products and lower asset impairment charges and lower acquisition-related costs.
Adjusted diluted EPS for the third quarter was $0.61 versus $0.60 in the year-ago quarter. The increase is primarily due to increased revenues, a lower effective tax rate and fewer diluted weighted average shares outstanding, which declined by 105 million shares versus the year-ago quarter due to our share repurchase program, all of which were partially offset by an aggregate operational increase in adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses and adjusted R&D expenses of approximately $1.1 billion or 16%, which includes the addition of Hospira operations in 2016, a $0.04 negative impact due to foreign exchange and continuing product losses of exclusivity.
I want to point out that third quarter adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenues increased year-over-year from 17.4% to 22.7% primarily due to foreign exchange and the addition of legacy Hospira operations. Also, because foreign exchange increased cost of sales while decreasing revenues at the same time, which is atypical, there was an exaggerated increase of our adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenues in the third quarter. If you exclude the foreign exchange impact, third quarter adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue would have been 20.9%. Although we have experienced this for 2 consecutive quarters, we continue to view this as an anomaly rather than a trend, and we have narrowed our 2016 adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of revenue guidance within its original range.
Foreign exchange negatively impacted third quarter revenues by approximately $224 million or 2%, of which approximately $175 million was attributable to Venezuela. While FX favorably impacted adjusted SI&A and R&D expenses, the previously mentioned significant negative impact on adjusted cost of sales drove the overall FX impact of $115 million or 2% in our total adjusted costs. As a result, foreign exchange negatively impacted third quarter adjusted diluted EPS by approximately $0.04 compared with the year-ago quarter, with approximately $0.015 related to Venezuela.
As you can see on the chart, we've narrowed the ranges for certain components of 2016 financial guidance. We increased the low end of our revenue guidance range and we now expect 2016 revenues to be in the range of $52 billion to $53 billion. I want to point out that this range continues to absorb an anticipated $1.8 billion negative impact from product losses of exclusivity and an anticipated $1.4 billion negative impact from foreign exchange versus 2015, of which almost $850 million is attributable to Venezuela.
I also want to remind everyone that as we previously communicated, there are 7 fewer selling days in the fourth quarter of 2016 versus the fourth quarter of 2015. This will impact only the quarterly year-over-year comparisons, given that there are essentially the same number of selling days in 2016 as there were in 2015.
Because of our decision to discontinue the global clinical development program for boco, we now expect adjusted R&D expenses to be in the range of $7.8 billion to $8.1 billion and adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.38 to $2.43, which is still within our original range of $2.38 to $2.48.
It's important to note that the midpoint of our adjusted diluted EPS guidance range was negatively impacted solely to reflect this decision. Excluding this boco decision, the midpoint of the range would have increased by $0.02.
Moving on to key takeaways. We achieved our eighth consecutive quarter of operational revenue growth. In the third quarter of 2016, growth was driven by the inclusion of legacy Hospira operations, new products that are early in their life cycles such as Ibrance, Eliquis and Xeljanz as well as the solid performance from Lyrica and Chantix. We narrowed the ranges for certain components of our 2016 financial guidance. We announced and completed the acquisition of Medivation and accomplished several key product and pipeline milestones. And we returned $10.5 billion to shareholders through the first 9 months of 2016 through dividends and share repurchases, including a $5 billion accelerated share repurchase program. Finally, we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2016 and beyond.
Now I'll turn it back to Chuck."

So let me take the launch of Inflectra, first of all. We obviously are very excited, very positive about the opportunities that we have, and that's based on the positive uptake that we've seen in the markets where we've already launched Inflectra. In fact, where biosimilars have launched, we've already seen around about a 26% volume share of branded Remicade switch to biosimilars of infliximab. And so we believe that, actually, the marketplace, on a global basis, is really beginning to become more comfortable with the introduction of biosimilars.

In relation to sterile injectables, obviously, as you know, we're very focused on the combination of the legacy Hospira sterile injectable portfolio along with the branded legacy Pfizer portfolio. The strong performance that we've seen in the sterile injectable business this quarter really is a reflection of the combination of the strengths of both of those portfolios together, both the legacy branded Pfizer portfolio as well as the legacy generic Hospira sterile injectable portfolio. And I think we're seeing, at a customer level, that the combination of that much broader offerings to the customers really provides us with the breadth of portfolio that our customers value and provide us with a strong operational offering to customers right across the world.

This is going to take a little bit longer, given the extent of your questions on this. Let's just deal, in general, with the pricing situation, and then we'll come back to the supply -- the Prop 61.
So look, we're -- obviously, drug pricing affordability is an issue that is concerning to us and has clearly been amplified in this election cycle. There is considerable uncertainty and turmoil about both candidate's positions on these issues and it's difficult to decipher between campaign rhetoric and legitimate policy views. It's been disappointing. It's been disappointing that this debate on pricing has completely neglected the other side of the ledger, that is the benefits and value added by the pharmaceutical industry. So while we understand that health care costs have been increasing for many patients, we disagree with the prevailing notion among some politicians that pharmaceuticals are the reason for these rising costs. And we believe that post the election cycle, good public policy will prevail.
So currently, in the U.S., you'll see it's a comparator, we spend 70% of our GDP on health care, yet we only spend 2% on drugs, while 12% of GDP is spent on inpatient and outpatient services. When we compare that to the OECD countries, who spend approximately 9% of GDP on health care, they spend 1.5% of GDP on drugs and only 5.5% of GDP on medical services, over 0.5 point of GDP extra on drugs between OECD and the United States. You get a vibrant, research-based industry that is producing roughly $1.3 trillion of value to GDP. I think policymakers are well aware of the importance of maintaining an innovative pharmaceutical business. However, if you look at cost increases in the U.S. from 2004 to 2014, hospital service costs have increased 75%, while prescription drug costs have increased 35%. While faster than the CTI, they are lagging the overall medical costs of around 40% growth.
I think what's exacerbated the cost problem for patients in -- is their insurance plans, on average, cover a much lower share, 83% actually, of prescription drug costs for the -- compared to the cost of medical services where they cover 96%. So we're seeing the insurance companies are making a choice of subsidizing health services more than drugs. You see this in their actions taken by increasing co-pays and shifting drugs into the overall deductible, which has pushed the issue with patients on affordability, but it's certainly not due to price increases because, in 2016, the branded pharmaceutical industry talked about a 2.8%, on average, net price increase.
I think the market is reacting to the fact that in the pharmaceutical business, there are 2 markets. There's a market of branded, patent-protected products that increased prices in '15 2.8%, then a market of difficult-to-make generics or generics that are exclusive, where we've seen certain actives take, what society believes, are unreasonable price increases. So I think we can have better solutions if we look to how do we fix the policy issues and the regulatory issues that allow single suppliers, single-source suppliers and ease the pathway of those generics.
Regardless of the election results, I don't -- I'm not really concerned. Well, no matter the outcome of the presidential and congressional races, we will continue to work with public officials.
That being said, let's talk to the rebate issue. Look, I think the rebates have served an important contribution to allowing negotiations on volume-related transactions. I think they are now becoming less helpful in getting cost-effective solutions for patients. In reality, if we could find some way, and I think it would need a legislative fix, if we could find some way of ensuring that the pharmaceutical industry has an ability to moderate price according to volumes sold for [indiscernible] customers without rebates, I think that would be in the best interest of patients.
Now, coming to the issue on Prop 61. If we voted today on the facts of the case, on the merits of the proposition, it would be rejected by the Californian voters. I don't -- we don't see any particular overall benefit in health care costs for California. However, we are in a highly politicized arena. It's difficult to say exactly what will happen on this proposition. But once we know the result, the industry will then formulate its public policy responses.
I would like to say that what Prop 61 is asking for is basically untenable. It's asking for an industry that has given noncommercial prices to the veterans for a very good reason, they are a special part of our society and we've given noncommercial prices to that part of society, to take that and extend it to the rest of government is not a workable economic model. So Prop 61, between its voting and its information in 6 months -- implementation in 6 months, I would expect to see a lot of public policy discussions between that time and its implementation. Sorry for the length of that answer."

But importantly, as you asked, we believe there is a large intact [ph] opportunity within the urology segment, which will be able to be catalyzed by the TERRAIN label update.
Just are some facts. In Q3, 26% of Xtandi units were prescribed by urologists, up from 20% historically. Right now, we have approximately 2,000 urologists prescribing the product. And the recent market research suggests that 80% of urologists are highly compelled to prescribe Xtandi after seeing the TERRAIN data. So I think TERRAIN data publication and the inclusion in the label will be an important catalyst for Xtandi."

In fact, we continue to see a robust LDL lowering. It was only recently that we got the data on the majority of our LDL trials out at 52 weeks. And out at 52 weeks, we saw a substantial population reduction in LDL lowering, and we correlated that with neutralizing antibodies. And then we hade the site rejection on one of our -- the injection site reaction on some of our trials. So when you look at the total profile of our drug, we don't believe that it's commercially -- could be commercially successful or in the benefit of patients for us to continue to bring that to market. I think -- and then on the pricing issue, we have always priced responsively. We've priced to the marketplace the value of our product. And on the affordability issue, we've always made provisions for patients who have no insurance or poor insurance to get our product for free or nearly free. So I don't believe that there is any reason for Pfizer to change its approach to the pricing of our products as we sit here today. Thank you."

And this decline reflects the negative impact from biosimilars in Europe that were on slate in Q1. We have been preparing for biosimilar competition for quite some time, and we plan to continue to differentiate Enbrel by generating new data, by enhancing the patient experience and, of course, by leveraging our expertise in inflammation. For the remainder of the year, we expect continued modest uptake of Etanercept biosimilars. But due to their limited long-term safety and efficacy data, we anticipate their use will be primarily in new patients as physicians look to gain experience with these products. On your question on pricing. So far, of the limited pricing we have seen to date for Benepali, the discount levels are in line with our expectations, and we expect Enbrel's pricing to be competitive. In Norway or in Denmark, where Benepali won national tenders, let me say Norwegians published the outcome of their tender and Benepali won the tender with a 47% discount while Enbrel provided a 41% discount. But it is important to note that the tender process in Norway is not indicative, by any means, of the pricing practices and trends typically seen in other markets across Europe. Now let me speak about Ibrance. Ibrance had a terrific launch and has quickly become the standard of care. Since launch, it's been prescribed by more than 8,500 physicians, reaching more than 40,000 patients. This rapid uptake is a testament to its efficacy and its outstanding safety and tolerability profile. Very low rate of great fear for GI side effects such as fatigue or diarrhea. Now as expected, given this performance, we are starting to see some tempering of growth. But let me clarify that. Recent reporting changes at IMS, due to some specialty pharmacy consolidations, might be muddying the waters and not showing an accurate picture. Based on our data, we continued to grow in scripts by 9% in the third quarter versus the second quarter of 2016, sequentially, which aligns with our own net sales growth of 7% quarter-after-quarter. Now moving forward, our strategy with Ibrance is unfolding. So far, growth of Ibrance has come from establishing the product to early-adopting physicians. We believe growth in the next 2 years in the U.S. will come from late adopters but have limited prescriptions so far. We are now moving to the second phase of our strategy and building a dedicated sales team and field-based medical organization to maximize this opportunity. In addition, the publication of our Phase III PALOMA-2 study data, which we anticipate to occur by year-end, will be important additional data for these late-adopting physicians. Now outside the U.S., additional growth will come from our geographical expansion. As you know, Ibrance is already in U.S. and now in 20 more countries. And we have received positive opinion from CHMP in Europe and expect registration later this year. And last but not least, in the midterm, the growth will come from the many studies currently running to move to earlier lines of breast cancer."

Now when it comes to opportunities to advance the class further, I really appreciated your question because I think in 2017 and '18, you will see Pfizer propel as among the leaders when it comes to combination therapies. We aspire to have up to 6 triple therapies in the clinic by 2018 and up to 4 of them in the clinic by the end of this year. And that will include triple I/O agents such as 4-1BB, avelumab and OX40. It will include doublets and triplets with chemo and I/O agents. It will include also combinations with other emerging drugs in our pipeline, whether targeted drugs as well as combination drugs such as antibody-drug conjugate, smaller molecules like IDO. And I think what you will see is across many solid tumors, some of the larger tumor cases, lung, ovarian and gastric, as well as in blood cancer, a large set of trials that will be doublets and triplets and will address the need to further augment the promising results of immuno-oncology as well as deal with the colder [ph] tumors that are low in PD-L1."

So if you look at our cost of sales as a percentage of revenue this quarter, 22.7%. If you remove the impact of foreign exchange, that 22.7% becomes 20.9%. So FX had material negative impact over on cost of sales. By the way, this kind of atypical relationship between revenues and cost of sales, while we don't expect it to continue in 2017, we do expect it to continue next quarter, and it's really being driven primarily by Japan and within Japan, obviously, the yen, based on just what's gone on there relative to the currency fluctuations of the yen and the amount of end market inventory that we have there.

And the second was, just staying on Ibrance as well, when we think about the EU opportunity for the drug, how should we think about both the launch and size of that opportunity relative to what we've seen in the U.S.? I guess how would you compare and contrast the uptake we've seen here versus what you hope to see as we roll out in Europe?"

I think it's a really growing drug class, which was fueled by very promising ovarian data that was presented at ESMO. And within that class, we are very excited about talazoparib because of its very strong potency and also that it has a potentially unique differentiation with what is called PARP trapping. When it comes to the near-term opportunities, we have a Phase III trial called M-BRCA [ph], which is in BRCA-mutated breast cancer that has a readout due next year, possibly middle of the year. And we look forward very much to see that data set as we think that the talazoparib and the PARP class in this type of sensitized tumors with DNA repair deficiency can perform very well and supplement other therapies. I want to -- just to punctuate that the existence of this BRCA and other DNA repairs deficiency now goes into a number of cancers, and the opportunity is likely much larger than early anticipated. It's not just breast, ovarian, but also increasingly seen in prostate and lung. And these tumors often carry a high mutational burden, which allow us, uniquely, to combine talazoparib with an immuno-oncology product. And of course, that can include doublets like avelumab and potentially even triplets. So I think you should really keep an eye on what we may be able to do with our really comprehensive portfolio to move this to asset standalone and in combination."

As you know, it was a randomized, double-blind, parallel group study with almost 500 patients and importantly was funded by the Norwegian government. And the study found no significant difference in disease worsening between patients who underwent a single switch to Inflectra CT-P13 versus those who remained on Remicade. It also finds that the incidence of antidrug antibodies and the frequency of reported adverse events between Remicade and Inflectra CT-P13 were similar.

During my remarks this morning, I will briefly recap the highlights from the quarter and comment on our strategies, including expected pipeline development this year, our approach to business development in light of our decision not to move forward with Allergan and the steps we expect to take to assess the potential split of the company. 
2016 is off to a good start, with solid performance across both the Innovative and Established businesses. Notably, Prevnar 13, IBRANCE, Eliquis and Chantix are performing better than we initially projected. 
As we referenced in our earnings release, a portion of the growth in the quarter was attributable to additional selling days compared to the year ago quarter, which will be offset in the fourth quarter from a growth perspective. We nonetheless had a strong quarter financially even without that impact, exceeding our internal projections and incorporated the strong operational performance as well as the recent weakening of the dollar into our updated financial guidance for the year. 
And compared to the first quarter, we expect that our LOE impact from Lyrica, Rebif, Enbrel will be more pronounced in the remaining quarters of the year. Additionally, new product launch expenses and R&D investment are also phased higher for the remainder of the year. Frank will provide more details in a few minutes. 
Overall, looking at the quarter, on a revenue basis, Pfizer stand-alone business, excluding Hospira, grew 15% operationally, and 26% operationally with the inclusion of Hospira. Our Innovative business generated impressive operational revenue growth of 28%, driven by the performance of Eliquis globally and IBRANCE, Prevnar 13, Lyrica, XELJANZ, Chantix and Nexium 24HR, principally in the U.S. 
Of particular note, IBRANCE has already earned broad patient and physician acceptance. Since launching in the U.S. last year, about 6,800 prescribers have treated approximately 28,000 women with HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer, and the feedback continues to be very encouraging, particularly around the efficacy and tolerability profile and impact on the overall quality of life.
Recently, we announced that the confirmatory Phase III PALOMA-2 trial for IBRANCE in first-line metastatic breast cancer met its primary endpoints of improving progression-free survival. Detailed results will be presented at ASCO in early June.
We're also seeing continued strong operational growth from Eliquis, which is yielding increased market penetration and market share gains in the U.S. and Japan. The contribution of Eliquis to our alliance revenue line more than doubled year-over-year. 
For the Prevnar 13 adult indication, while there was a year-over-year growth as expected, we saw a sequential quarterly decline in revenues given the rapid penetration we achieved in the U.S. market during 2015. The pediatric indication remained strong, and we anticipate that global revenues for the Prevnar 13 franchise in full year 2016 will be comparable to 2015. 
And we were pleased that the results from the EAGLES study, the largest global clinical trial of smoking-cessation medicines, were published in The Lancet. The study was designed to compare the neuropsychiatric safety of Chantix and bupropion with placebo and nicotine patch in adult smokers with and without a history of psychiatric disorders. 
The authors concluded that the study did not show a significant increase in serious neuropsychiatric events with Chantix or bupropion relative to placebo or nicotine patch. The study also found that smokers treated with Chantix had significantly higher quit rates than those treated with bupropion, nicotine patch or placebo.
Turning now to our Established business. It grew 24% operationally, primarily due to the additional revenues from legacy Hospira products. Without Hospira and the impact of foreign exchange, the business grew 1%. In particular, we saw strong performance from the sterile injectables portfolio. The addition of Hospira's leading generic injectables portfolio with Pfizer's legacy branded injectables establishes Pfizer as the #1 sterile injectables company globally. 
We now have one of the broadest and most diverse offerings of difficult-to-manufacture sterile injectable medicines, which are critically important for patients around the world. This leading market position, combined with our expanded biosimilars offering and the continued growth of Pfizer's legacy branded portfolio in Emerging Markets, will help us to move the Established Pharmaceuticals business from a period of loss of exclusivity-driven decline to potential growth. 
The Hospira acquisition was a clear growth driver, and the integration continues to proceed well. We have addressed specific issues related to legacy Hospira's manufacturing and have developed a plan to implement Pfizer quality standards at the sites. And we have dedicated resources to support the sites as they complete their transition to the Pfizer network.
Based on Hospira's excellent strategic fit with our Established business and our intense focus on integration of Hospira, we expect to exceed our original synergy targets of $800 million in annual cost savings by 2018 and now expect to achieve approximately $1 billion in cost savings. 
As you are aware, in early April, we decided not to move forward with the Allergan transaction due to the actions of the U.S. Treasury Department. Given these actions and the current political climate, we do not see any potential for a transaction involving inversions in the near term. 
While the outcome was disappointing, we always view the potential Allergan transaction not as a new strategy, but rather as a way to accelerate our existing strategy, which remains unchanged. Our strategy is anchored by several elements, namely, improving the company's revenue growth profile so that a greater proportion of our earnings per share growth is driven by incremental revenue opportunities. 
Our latest product launches, including Eliquis, Xalkori, XELJANZ, IBRANCE and Prevnar 13 Adult, have now become meaningful revenue contributors. In addition, the FDA's decision to approve Celltrion's biosimilar infliximab across all eligible indications marks a critical and positive step forward in helping to create a pathway for biosimilars in the U.S. We hold the exclusive commercialization rights to this product in the U.S. 
While launch timing of Inflectra will ultimately depend upon a number of factors such as marketplace dynamics and intellectual property considerations, we are continuing with the preparation of our launch plans for 2016. 
Our current biosimilars portfolio includes 3 commercialized products available in select markets outside the U.S.: Inflectra, Nivestim and Retacrit. We believe that biosimilars represent an attractive revenue growth opportunity for expanding patient access to important treatments. 
We also see continued opportunities for our Established Pharm Business in Emerging Markets, with a robust portfolio positioned to compete in these markets. GEP revenues in Emerging Markets increased 10% operationally this quarter, and company-wide revenues in Emerging Markets increased 14% operationally. Emerging Markets revenues represented nearly 20% of our total company's revenue base.
We are also continuing to make significant progress in securing potential future growth drivers across the advancement of our pipeline. Specific examples include: a planned submissions for ulcerative colitis for XELJANZ, which is on track to occur in the first half of 2017; the acceptance for review of the XELJANZ EU filing for rheumatoid arthritis. We have completed enrollment of the bococizumab SPIRE-2 outcomes trial. While it can be hard to predict duration of trial -- of a time-to-events trial, we currently anticipate a potential completion of this outcome study in the second half of 2017. 
Presentation of ertugliflozin's Phase III data at the American Diabetes Association meeting in June and a potential regulatory filing in the U.S.; the tanezumab Phase III program, where we are now conducting trials for osteoarthritis, chronic low back pain and cancer pain indications; a potential regulatory decision in the EU for IBRANCE in combination with endocrine therapy for the treatment of HR+/HER2- advanced metastatic breast cancer; and for inotuzumab for adult patients with relapsed or refractory CD22-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We are in discussions with the FDA on our next steps to bringing this important medicine to patients. 
Behind these assets is a strong and early mid-stage pipeline, most notably, a broad portfolio of IO compounds which continue to advance. Our avelumab PD-L1 program with Merck KGaA has ramped up rapidly and now has 30 programs ongoing, both as monotherapy and in combination with other portfolio assets, 8 of which are potentially registration enabling. 
We continue to expect that the key advances in IO will come from novel combinations, both double and triple combination regimes, and technologies that may have the potential to treat more patients with immunotherapy ultimately transform the cancer treatment paradigm. We have several combination studies that are already in the clinic with our key combination assets being 4-1BB and OX40. 
We also have a range of immuno-oncology assets moving into the clinic, including our allogeneic CAR-T program in collaboration with Cellectis and Servier; and a small molecule immunotherapy asset, IDO1, in collaboration with iTeos; and our bispecific antibody P-cadherin.
Recently, we presented Phase II data at the AACR annual meeting, showing that IBRANCE was effective in slowing the multiplication of cancer cells in patients diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer who received no prior therapy. And we also expect our proof-of-concept readout with our next-generation ALK inhibitor, lorlatinib, in ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer patients towards the end of the year. Lorlatinib is our investigational follow-on drug to Xalkori. 
In neuroscience, we began a Phase II proof-of-concept study this quarter for our novel dopamine modulation asset for Parkinson's disease. If successful, this may have the potential to replace the standard of care in Parkinson's. 
In addition, through a collaboration with MedGenesis Therapeutix, we have a second compound being investigated in Parkinson's and expect to have a proof-of-concept study readout in the second half of the year. The compound is a GDNF protein and may have the potential to provide the first disease-modifying treatment that slows the progressive decline in Parkinson's patients. 
In vaccines, we expect to have a C. difficile proof-of-concept readout towards the end of the year. C. difficile is a growing, hard-to-treat infection in the hospital and long-term care setting. Currently, there are no vaccines available to prevent the disease, and the infection control practices are challenging to implement. 
Overall, we are anticipating a steady stream of pipeline updates throughout 2016. Our strategy will also capitalize on the opportunities and specific expertise resulting from our distinct, competitive and growing businesses, namely our Innovative and Established business. Each is led by strong leaders with the experience and know-how to effectively direct and grow these organizations. 
In addition to capitalizing on the strength of our pipeline, our strategy includes allocating our capital to shareholder-friendly initiatives with an eye towards sustainable value creation. This includes continuing to look for ways other than inversions to improve our tax rate. It also includes pursuing business development opportunities that use our capital efficiently in ways that create meaningful shareholder value, that have the potential for near-term solid value creation, that strengthen our individual businesses with capabilities in key assets and enhance our leadership position in the most attractive core areas. 
As you know, we're also considering a potential separation of our Innovative and Established business. No decision has been made at this point, and we recently announced we plan to make an assessment of the merits of the separation by the end of 2016. By this time, we'll be completing our third and final year of building the required segment financials to support any split, and we'll also be in a position to complete the necessary financial analysis needed to determine if the time is right to move forward with the split. 
If we determine the time is right, then we expect to be in a position to execute a split by the end of 2017. And if we determine through our process that a split isn't appropriate, we will continue to have the flexibility to assess the option and proceed if and when we deem the time is right. 
Our decision framework has not changed. It continues to be based on these 4 questions. Are the businesses performing well within Pfizer? Could the businesses perform well as stand-alone entities? Is there trapped value in the combined entity? And can the trapped value be unlocked efficiently? Throughout the year, we'll be assessing our performance against each of these factors. 
In summary, the business is performing well, driven by a sound strategy. The outlook for the year is strong based on a demonstrated ability of the Innovative and Established businesses to execute against this goal. We have a healthy pipeline with strong candidates at every stage of the pipeline, and we have the financial flexibility and several options to creating short-term and long-term value for shareholders. 
I'll now turn it over to Frank, and thank you."

As always, the charts I am reviewing today are included in our webcast. As a reminder, because we completed the acquisition of Hospira in September 3, 2015, Pfizer's first quarter 2016 financial results include 3 months of",1068,"Thanks, Ian. Good day, everyone. As always, the charts I am reviewing today are included in our webcast. As a reminder, because we completed the acquisition of Hospira in September 3, 2015, Pfizer's first quarter 2016 financial results include 3 months of legacy Hospira global operations compared to the first quarter 2015 results, which do not include any legacy Hospira operations.
Now moving on to the financials. We had a good quarter. First quarter 2016 reported revenues were approximately $13 billion and reflect year-over-year operational growth of $2.9 billion or 26%, of which $1.2 billion or 11% is attributable to the inclusion of legacy Hospira operations and approximately $900 million or 8% is attributable to 5 additional selling days in the U.S. and 4 additional selling days in the international markets in the first quarter of '16 versus the year ago quarter. 
Excluding legacy Hospira operations and these additional selling days, reported revenues grew $800 million or 7% operationally, which reflects continued strong performance of IBRANCE, Prevnar 13, Eliquis, XELJANZ, Lyrica and Chantix, and a 14% operational growth in Emerging Markets, which were partially offset by the absorption of an approximately $300 million negative operational impact due to product losses of exclusivity. 
With respect to selling days, I want to point out that because of our accounting calendar, there was a greater variability of selling days during the quarters in '15 than there will be in 2016, but this will not impact total number of selling days or our revenue for 2016. To illustrate, there were 5 more U.S. and 4 more international selling days in the first quarter of '16 compared with the year ago quarter, and there are 4 fewer U.S. and 3 fewer international selling days in the fourth quarter of '16 versus the fourth quarter 2015. 
So the imbalance in selling days we saw in the first quarter will be offset in fourth quarter 2016, and there will be essentially the same number of selling days in full year '16 as in full year 2015. Consequently, the only impact will be to the quarterly year-over-year comparisons, notably for the first and fourth quarters. 
Reported revenues continue to be unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange of $729 million or 7%, including losses related to the Venezuelan bolivar. 
First quarter adjusted diluted EPS was $0.67 versus $0.51 in the year ago quarter. The increase was primarily due to increased revenues, the inclusion of Hospira operations, a lower effective tax rate and fewer diluted weighted average shares outstanding, which declined by 78 million shares versus the year ago quarter due to our share repurchase program, which includes the impact of our $5 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement executed in February of 2015 and completed in July of '15, and by another 136 million shares associated with a partial-quarter benefit from an accelerated share repurchase agreement executed in March of 2016, which were partially offset by an aggregate operational increase in adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses and adjusted R&D expenses of $1.1 billion or 16%, $0.07 negative impact due to foreign exchange and continuing product losses of exclusivity. 
Reported diluted EPS was $0.49 compared with $0.38 in the year ago quarter due to the previously mentioned factors and the favorable impact of lower charges for business and legal entity alignment activities incurred during the first quarter, which were partially offset by higher acquisition-related costs, legal charges, purchase accounting adjustments and higher asset impairment charges. 
Foreign exchange negatively impacted first quarter reported revenues by approximately $729 million or 7% and positively impacted adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses and adjusted R&D expenses, in the aggregate, by $197 million or 3%. As a result, foreign exchange negatively impacted first quarter adjusted diluted EPS by approximately $0.07 compared with the year ago quarter. 
The results for the GIP, VOC and GEP businesses are available and can be found at the end of the presentation that is posted on our website. 
Moving on to our 2016 financial guidance. We are updating our 2016 reported revenues and adjusted diluted EPS ranges due to our strong performance to date and improved business outlook for 2016 as well as the favorable impact from foreign exchange rates since mid-January 2016. 
Consequently, we raised the midpoint of our 2016 revenue guidance by $2 billion and the midpoint of our 2016 adjusted diluted EPS guidance range by $0.18. We now expect 2016 reported revenues to be in the range of $51 billion to $53 billion versus our previous expectation of $49 billion to $51 billion, and we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.38 to $2.48 versus our previous expectation of $2.20 to $2.30. 
I want to punctuate what Ian said previously. Operational factors, such as our strong performance to date in 2016, in addition to our improved business outlook for 2016, favorably impacted the midpoint of the reported revenue guidance range by approximately $1 billion and the adjusted diluted EPS guidance range by $0.12. Favorable changes in foreign exchange rates since mid-January 2016 also favorably impacted the midpoint of the reported revenue guidance range by approximately $1 billion and the adjusted diluted EPS guidance range by $0.06. 
Finally, given our first quarter results and the benefit of continued support of recently launched products as well as foreign exchange, we are raising the midpoint of our adjusted SI&A guidance range by $500 million. Consequently, we now expect adjusted SI&A expenses to be in the range of $13.7 billion to $14.7 billion.
Moving on to key takeaways. This quarter marks our sixth consecutive quarter of Pfizer stand-alone operational revenue growth, which was primarily driven by new products that are early in their life cycles such as IBRANCE, Prevnar 13, Eliquis, XELJANZ and Lyrica, and additional selling days during the first quarter. 
As I just mentioned, we raised the midpoints of our 2016 reported revenues and adjusted diluted EPS guidance ranges to reflect strong operational performance to date, favorable changes in foreign exchange rates and improved business outlook for 2016. We accomplished several key R&D milestones during the first quarter. We continued to deliver significant value to shareholders in the form of $1.9 billion in the first quarter 2016 dividends and a $5 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement executed in March 2016. And finally, we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2016 and beyond. 
With that, I'll turn it back to Chuck."

Outside of Pfizer, we'll try and establish similar-like companies. It would be easier for the Innovative business. It's not as easy for the Established because really the Established business is a unique business, including strong sterile injectables, strong biosimilar capabilities in big Emerging Markets.

On the -- on whether we can unleash where there's trapped value, we'll obviously use outside advisers. But one of the classic methods would simply be to look at the sum of the parts as much as we can establish by disaggregating our business the same way as we give you information to do, so we can take those businesses and compare them to stand-alone businesses and see what a potential evaluation would be with the parts and compare it to the sum. That is one way of looking at that trapped value. Another is to look historically at what has happened to companies that -- companies where they're spun or where they've been spun in an unforced manner, i.e., because of management's decision and not because of activist pressure, and see what has happened to the shares of those companies subsequently.

I think you've kind of given us a ballpark figure for that, I know there's no official guidance out there, but just a ballpark figure, it would be nice to get those ballparks refreshed. And then finally, you had made some commentary, Frank, around -- I think you've made some commentary around the leverage ratio that the Allergan Pfizer newco -- you'd be willing to take the Allergan Pfizer newco to.

So by the way, if I was willing to do it for that, I'd be willing to do it for the right transaction on a going-forward basis. In terms of leveraging the balance sheet for buybacks, the way I think about this is if you go back to 2010 and if you include the $5 billion accelerated share repurchase that we added this past March, $50.7 billion of share buybacks, $50.7 billion, 1.9 billion of shares, excluding the 405 million shares as a result of the Zoetis exchange. So we've done actually a massive buyback without having to borrow and leverage the balance sheet, which allows us to keep our powder dry if we wanted to do different a kind of a transaction.

We already touched base on 4-1BB, on OX40 and a triple IO combo. Lorlatinib in the ALK and ROS space is generating very interesting data that we will start to share. We have a novel ADC called PTK-7 that we also see some really interesting response rate. In the immuno-inflammation field, in addition to XELJANZ, we now have 4 different immunokinases going into Phase II, with several highly specific JAKs going to inflammatory bowel disease, dermatological inflammation and lupus. So we will share more data around those, but I think that would really move the entire JAK field over time into new areas and with new profiles. Vaccines, it's our C. diff and Staph aureus that we are really excited about. And Ian mentioned in his introduction that we have built some interesting assets in Parkinson with a completely novel dopamine modulator and also have an interesting GDNF study together with MedGenesis. And finally, in rare disease, I'll exemplify that we have a growing sickle cell franchise with rivipansel and a plan to start PDE9 as a way to prevent occurrence of a difficult-to-treat rare disease episode. So you can see our opportunity spans multiple therapeutic areas. XELJANZ in Europe, I think, is based on a very comprehensive file. We have 6 complete clinical trials with 2 open-label extension. And all our program contains more than 19,000 patients here, more than 6,000 patients in long-term extension up to 8 year. And please, I want to just remind everyone that XELJANZ has been used by more than 6,500 physician and more than 50,000 patients in U.S. with a very favorable profile.

First, we are the only company with a registered product in U.S. and 8 other countries and an accepted filing in Europe where we may obtain registration this year. In just over a year in the market, IBRANCE has been prescribed by almost 7,000 physicians and reaching up more than 28,000 patients. This rapid uptake is a testament to its efficacy and outstanding safety profile with a very low rate of Global 3/4 GI effects such as fatigue and diarrhea. IBRANCE has delivered positive results across 3 randomized pivotal trials, is being studied in additional 5 pivotal studies in early, advanced and recurrent breast cancer as well as 62 ongoing investigator-initiated research, 38 of which are in breast cancer and 28 are in nonbreast cancer.

But there's also an element of total affordability. So I think the ability of companies to have the complete regime, like with Pfizer's case, the PD-L1, the OX40, the 4-1BB or a small molecule, will enable offerings to payers that I think society will find acceptable from a cost-benefit return as distinct from looking at the complications of acquiring all of those elements separately in the marketplace. On pricing itself, I do -- I agree with you, there is a large amount of rhetoric given the election year, and there is concerns from individuals about accessing pharmaceuticals. This is extremely complex. It's in great part due to the pressure on plans that have been transformed away from having the ability to really be an insurance company and become somewhat more a benefit administrators and insurers. It has to do with the quality of insurance and also to do with the value of these specialty products. So I expect a robust discussion, but I expect that, in the end, the United States will continue to support innovation and find ways to make sure that innovation is supported and products get to patients. And that will obviously be a robust policy discussion. But I do think in the end, that's where the United States will end up in that discussion. On PBMs, in a market-based system, PBMs provide value by aggregating volumes and negotiating discounts. To the extent those discounts are passed on to the end user or the end payer or an appropriate amount is passed on and they're serving a valid market function, as the market changes, they may have a larger or smaller role. But I think what I would emphasize is I like to see a marketplace work. I like to see incentives in the marketplace and ensure it works. And I like to see the appropriate amount of transparency. So that's really all I can really comment on that."

So I think the priorities are continue to ensure that our science comes to market; grow our in-line products, which we think we are doing well; execute on capital discipline, which we continue to do. And in our Established Products business, it's to roll out successfully the biosimilar strategy, to continue to utilize and maximize the value of our sterile injectables around the world. So frankly, I think there's lots to do in that area. We'll continue to look at our tax situations. We have a very good tax group. Frank and his team are very good at looking how to improve that.

The demographics are very favorable there. We have a larger eligible population. But the price per dose is less than in the U.S. And also another factor is that we need to obtain a recommendation. And this is a process that the Europe can take -- recommendation and reimbursement, can be phased over 2 years, because it's happening country by country. In some cases, within the same country, it's happening district by district. So we are working very intensively on that because we see the opportunity as a major one. But moving to how we are doing with our expansion into other breast cancer segments and, particularly, into the adjuvant setting. Actually, we have 2 studies in the adjuvant setting. That's PENELOPE-B, which is for high-risk early breast cancer, and we have PALLAS for intermediate-risk early breast cancer. And they are recruiting very nicely right now. I need to also emphasize that we have another one, which is in pilot, is a collaborative study, but it is in the neoadjuvant setting with collaboration with the Washington University."
