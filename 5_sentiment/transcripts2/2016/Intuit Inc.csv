We are out of the gate strong in the first half of fiscal 2016. We grew revenue 23% in the second quarter, exceeded our guidance across the board and we're on pace to deliver against our",1088,"All right. Thank you, Matt, and thanks to all of you for joining us. We are out of the gate strong in the first half of fiscal 2016. We grew revenue 23% in the second quarter, exceeded our guidance across the board and we're on pace to deliver against our full year outlook. Now we know tax is on everybody's mind at this point of the year, so let me start there first. 
Overall, our tax strategy is on track. We are focused on expanding the do-it-yourself software category while driving customer growth and share gains, particularly in the simple return segment. TurboTax Online units grew 12% through February 20 with total units up 9%. We're growing our excessive efile season to date faster than the category, which implies that we're once again taking share. Our growth is being driven by product innovation as we continue our journey through reimagine tax-preparation. This year, TurboTax expanded its data import capability and pursuit our taxes are done.
Approximately 75% of taxpayers will be able to digitally import W-2s directly into the product this year, up from 68% last year. TurboTax securely imports tax information directly for more than 1.4 million employers and financial institutions, saving considerable time and improving accuracy for the taxpayer. 
This season, all mobile and online customers are [indiscernible] W-2 and TurboTax will import the information into their tax return, whether their on a Phone, tablet or a computer, which also saves time and reduces errors. Our TurboTax smart look feature is resonating with customers. This new feature quickly connects users with TurboTax experts who will answer the question in realtime completely free. And for the second consecutive year, Americans with straightforward tax situations are able to use TurboTax to sold both the Federal 1040A or the 1040EZ returns, as well as their state returns for free. This is a highly compelling offer for the 60 million American, many of whom live to paycheck-to-paycheck and count on their tax refund as of the biggest check that they will receive all year.
I am really excited about our pace of innovation. While there's plenty of time left on the clock, if you look at the scoreboard so far, you'll see that IRS data through February 19 shows the self-prepared efiles were up about 3%, contrasted with assisted efiles being down 5%. And as I mentioned earlier, [indiscernible] all growth and other third party data indicate that we're gaining share so far this season.
Looking beyond TurboTax Online, our TurboTax desktop units are roughly flat and the data suggests we're gaining share and winning back customers who may have gone elsewhere last year. On the ProTax side of the business, we've seen positive early trends in customer acquisition and returns growth as well. As I always said this time of the year, it's early this season for our tax businesses, but I'd like the strong start that we delivered so far. We're staying agile, and I'm very pleased with our products and our customer experience.
Now let's talk Small Business. We continue to generate strong new user growth in our online ecosystem. Over 80% of QuickBooks Online customers were new to the Intuit franchise once again this quarter. Total QuickBooks paying customer growth was also healthy in the quarter as our desktop business posted strong results as well. QuickBooks Online continues to build momentum. Total QuickBooks Online subscribers grew 49% in the second quarter. This resulted in the addition of nearly 100,000 QBO subscribers in the quarter, bringing us to 1,257,000 paid subs worldwide at the end of January.
Roughly 50,000 of our QBO subscribers are using QuickBooks Self-Employed, which is up from 35,000 last quarter. Outside the U.S, QBO subs grew roughly 80% to 230,000 paying subscribers, which is in line with our expectations. We remain focused on growing customers globally. We built good momentum in the U.K, Australia and Brazil, and we recently went live in France. We continue to get smarter as we expand our global footprint. We are tuning the local game plan in each country to achieve our targets for lost time value versus customer acquisition costs. Near term, this is dampening subscriber growth to date it in India and in Canada, but we have clear plans in place to drive healthy, profitable growth in these 2 markets over the long term.
Finally, our expanding QBO ecosystem gives us confidence that growth will remain healthy. 85,000 accountants who use of the accounted version of QBO also have at least 3 clients using QuickBooks Online. That's more than double the number of accountants with at least 3 clients versus last year. And we now have over 2,000 apps that integrate with QBO in our marketplace, which is more than double the number we had 1 year ago. 13% of QBO subscribers are now using a third-party application, up from 8% 12 months ago.
We know that retention of the QBO customer who also uses a third-party app is better, which increases lifetime value. The QBO subscriber growth remains near 50% this quarter. So we remain confident in our full year outlook, as well as the outlook we gave for fiscal 2017. In fact, we saw QBO subs grew during the last quarter of this -- last month of this quarter become a peak for us, and that is a good new story because that is the peak season for adding QBO subscribers. 
As a result, we're raising the low end of our QBO subscriber outlook for the remainder of this fiscal year. The range is now 1,475,000 to 1,500,000 subscribers. Now as a reminder, at Investor Day, we shared our expectation that QBO subscribers would grow better than 40% on average between fiscal year '15 and fiscal year '17, and that would enable us to exit fiscal year '17 with between 2 million to 2.2 million subs. Given this quarter's performance, we remain absolutely on track to deliver against this longer-term outlook.
So when you hit the total key, it has been a strong first half of the year. I'm inspired by our team's commitment to reimagine the tax prep experience in both our consumer and our Professional Tax businesses. And there's much more innovation in-store from these teams over the next few years. 
And in Small Business, customer growth remains strong, as we continue to focus on global customer acquisition enabled by our cloud solutions. So with that overview, I'm going to turn it over to Neil to of the through the financial details."
21171,323693532,941243,"Intuit Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 25, 2016",2016-02-25,"Earnings Calls","Intuit Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Brad, and good afternoon, everyone. For the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we delivered revenue of $923 million, up 23%. Non-GAAP operating income of $114 million versus a loss of $22 million a year ago. GAAP operating income of $42 million versus",653,"Thanks, Brad, and good afternoon, everyone. For the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we delivered revenue of $923 million, up 23%. Non-GAAP operating income of $114 million versus a loss of $22 million a year ago. GAAP operating income of $42 million versus a loss of $89 million. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.25 versus a loss of $0.06, and GAAP earnings per share of $0.09 versus a loss of $0.23 last year.
These results reflect the changes we made to our desktop software offerings in fiscal 2015 resulting in ratable revenue recognition from that point forward. Turning to the business segments. 
Total small business segment revenue increased 7% for the quarter. Small Business Online Ecosystem revenue grew approximately 23% for the quarter, as customer acquisition in our Online ecosystem continues to drive growth. QuickBooks Online subscribers grew 49%, online payments customers grew 5%, and online payments charge volume grew 17%. Online Payroll customers grew 17%.
I know some of you have been tracking QBO subs in the product itself. You should be aware that due to a one-week lag in the data, it's not always a good indicator of where we will land for the quarter. You also have to consider variability for marketing and processing test, seasonality and other data and timing issues when looking at the subs number. 
Our second and third fiscal quarters are our strongest seasonally as accountants drive adoption during tax season. Switching to desktop. Total desktop ecosystem revenue increased 3% for the quarter. QuickBooks Desktop units increased 14% in the second quarter. Our strong desktop performance was driven by our pricing and promotion strategy. And for the full fiscal year, we expect desktop ecosystem revenue to be up slightly versus last year. 
Consumer Tax revenue was up 29% versus the second quarter last year. Consumer Tax revenue is significantly higher than last year, reflecting a shift from the third quarter to the second quarter, primarily driven by an extra weekend day in January this year. We still expect revenue growth of 5% to 7% for the full year. 
We are focused on execution for the remainder of the season, to grow the category and expand our share. Our ProTax group revenue grew to $84 million, driven by changes to our desktop offerings where revenue is now recognized ratably as services are delivered. For the third and fourth quarters, ProTax revenue should be roughly the same as it was in fiscal 2015. 
We continue to take a disciplined approach to capital management, investing the cash we generate in opportunities that yield an expected return on investment greater than 15% over 5 years. We repurchased $455 million worth of shares in Q2 and $900 million remained on our authorization as of the end of the quarter.
Our cash and investments balance was $334 million at the end of the second quarter. On February 1, we secured $1.5 billion in debt financing, including a $1 billion revolver and a new term loan of $500 million. One strategic use of this step was the purchase of our San Diego campus, which we previously discussed. 
Other potential uses include share repurchases and acquisitions that closely align with our strategic priorities. Our Board approved a $0.30 dividend per share for our third fiscal quarter payable on April 18. This represents a 20% increase versus last year. 
And one final note on capital allocation. We expect to process to sell Demandforce, QuickBase and Quicken will be completed this fiscal quarter with total proceeds of approximately $500 million. We expect to report capital only gains when these sales close. 
We provided our guidance for the third quarter in our press release. We also reiterated our full year revenue operating income and EPS guidance. As a reminder, we expect to provide the final TurboTax unit update in late April after the tax season ends. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Brad to close."

And based on these results, we're confident in our ability to deliver on the back half of the year as well. Now we recognize of the macro environment looks choppy. But if you look back over the 3 plus decades as a company, it is during uncertain times that our products are needed most by our customers. They still need to file their taxes, pay their bills and look for ways to stretch their hard-earned dollars as far as they can. And we've never been in a stronger position to serve our customers. 
Over the past several years, we transformed from a North American desktop software company to a cloud-driven global product and platform company. And that heavy lifting is now behind us. That's why we're continuing to play offense, investing in innovation to fuel customer growth. We have lots of opportunity in front of us, and we remain deeply committed to accelerating both customer and revenue growth.
But it all starts with great people. And as always, I want to thank our employees for their hard work and their ongoing focus. On the great people as part of this earnings release, we announced the decision to rotate the general managers in our Consumer Tax and our Small Business units following the tax season. Effective May 1, Sasan Goodarzi will take over as the Head of The Small Business Group and Dan Wernikoff will assume responsibility as the General Manager for our Consumer Tax business. 
This commitment to leadership mobility is consistent with Intuit's historical process. As we accelerate our transformation to a single ecosystem, strengthening and developing senior talent to possess a deep understanding of all aspects of the ecosystem is more important than ever. Intuit's future success centers on our ability to solve important 2 sided interactions in ways that deliver tremendous benefit for both side. This rotation will enable Dan and Sasan to develop deep empathy for each of Intuit's core customers, as well as to better understand and appreciation of our collective product and technologies across the company. 
We're able to implement leadership move like this from a position of strength. We build deep talent benches. We develop great momentum. And we have clear visibility in a strong outlook in both Small Business and Consumer Tax. I'm excited to watch that momentum continue as Susan and Dan bring a fresh perspective and a new set of capabilities to their respective teams. 
So with that, Latif, let's open it up and let's hear what's on everyone's mind."

So let me start with desktop units. The good news is we've been able to continue to drive strong QBO subscribers, 49% percent and over 80% of those are new to the franchise, while also growing our desktop units 14%.",447,"Great. Thank you, Raimo. This is Brad. So let me start with desktop units. The good news is we've been able to continue to drive strong QBO subscribers, 49% percent and over 80% of those are new to the franchise, while also growing our desktop units 14%. And what we basically there is last year, we had tried to raise the price on desktop from $199 to $249, and we thought that might accelerate the migration with QBO. That didn't happen. In fact, we didn't see migrate accelerate. What we did see, though, is upgraders and those that were using existing desktop delaying their purchase. So throughout the balance of last year, we tested $199 price promotions and we saw a really strong results. What we saw was it had no impact at all on QBO. There was no cannibalization. But what it did do is that incentive people to actually upgrade to the newer version. And so what you're seeing happen now is we have the ability to continue to accelerate QBO, continue to get existing desktop customers to move up to the newest version, and that's the best of both worlds. And so that's what's happening with desktop units. And as you heard, we plan to see -- we actually anticipate the desktop units in revenue will be up slightly for the year now. The second question was on QBO and average revenue per user. As you know, we shared at Investor Day, we're solving for total revenue growth and subscriber growth and our targets are 25% to 30% in revenue and then about 40% subscriber growth. And that will get us to the targets we provided for fiscal year '16 and 17. I will say, however, that we do see opportunities for ARPU to continue to accelerate over time. If you remember, we talked about a first-year customer comes in with a period of time where they have a trial and a promotional prize. Once they move into the 13th month on the product, that ARPU goes up for that customer about 50%. So as more of these new customer start to age, we see a natural tailwind in ARPU. And of course, we continue to get smarter in how we do attack service to what payroll and payment. So we do see upside opportunity down the road. But for us, ARPU is really an output metric. We want to stay focused on total revenue growth and customer growth. And then, over time, think by executing well, ARPU will improve. And we'll give you an update on ARPU on our next Investor Day. But we don't to focus on that on a quarterly basis."

So with the IRS data being published on February 19, they're showing that total returns received were down about 1.3%. They're suggesting that the self-prepared returns, the do-it-yourself category, is up about 3% season to date and the assisted is down 5. If you do all the translation and recitations of that, that would suggest that the do-it-yourself category has picked up a little more than 2 points of share from assisted so far. Now in the back half of the season, we'll see assisted get a little bit stronger as more complex retentive. But the good news is the DIY category continues to take share from assisted. And then the question is, what about TurboTax share and sign the category? And let me say, we have not seen this strong of market share advances at this time of the year in my recollection, and I've been here for a while. So right now, season to date, we're a little over 3.5 points of market share. And we're seeing market share increases in TurboTax Online. We're seeing market share increases in TurboTax desktop at retail. And we're also seeing an increase in the number of free fall line customers using TurboTax. So it's across the board. And then your question is where can we do better? We are, were always constructively dissatisfied.

If you look back at the same quarterly trends from 2015, you'll see that Q1 is a high point for us. Attach rates tail off a little bit in Q2.

But I can tell you right now, we have collectively linked in. We've added 23 data scheme as protocols. We straightened the password. We've added opportunities to share information at a federal at this level between the private industry and the government. And we are starting to talk the framework called. And I think all of that is having an impact of that is good news for all of us. But right now, I think the season is still playing out anything, which is the combination of procrastination.

We run is a much us in the U.S.. So we didn't fill those are good quality leads but we do think that was a good effective cost acquire customers. So we pulled that out of this year, and we have a little bit of a grow over on that. But underlying help is that Canada QuickBooks Online business is strong. We simply have pulled out a channel and now we're going to go over it. India is a little different. To be very candid with you, our product in India, we had more work to do to get it compliant. We've now added 2 scrum teams of engineer. We've also pulled back on marketing just through the accounting channel, and resetting to go more direct to small businesses. and so that one is on a bit of a pivot. I feel really good. We have 1,000 engineers that work at our India Development Center, and they are all passionate about helping get QBO localized. And we have a lot of good end market knowledge. We're simply in a reset mode there. Put small and out as part of our mix Becerra perfect time to learn our lessons and get that we are committed to both Canada and to India over the long term, which is a matter right now are making adjustments to the channel in Canada, and we're making sure the products is complaining care."

You had an aggressive campaign to go out against any customers we thought that we might have lost a competitor. And quite frankly, our data shows that we're getting them back. In fact, our conversions from our competitors are at 3x in the desktop business. Our share is up a couple of points in retail. And the net promoter in the desktop business is up 13 points year-over-year. So I think this is about us learning a tough lesson. We've made a mistake. We recovered well from it. And our customers can back and said, great, we're back with TurboTax again. In terms of all the relationship. Our goal is always to expand the category then to grow customers faster than revenue because as you know ultimately over time, there's customers tax situations will become more complex and over multiple years we can maximize the lifetime value.

But since we're talking about lifetime value and profitability that are pretty equivalent in both sides, we just want to make sure that it stay with us and they don't build anywhere S. But one of the things we learned last year is releasing the price to $249. We basically had customer seeing but not renewing under desktop and they weren't moving to QBO, and that was actually a lose for us. And so our promotional pricing now basically says we're going to keep those people who want to stay on desktop at least active, continuing to buy from us and use the newest version and get the best product. And we're going to continue to lean into QBO. And I think what you see happening overall is the best of both worlds. I think, ultimately, you're going to see a portion of customers still on desktop in 2017, 2018, and that will go out to 2020 and further. There's just a couple people that have gone to stay in desktop.

So April 15 big being the day, since it happen of the we can everyone has still Monday, April 18. And so the good news is, people are going to have their taxes by them. So what we look at is the ratio know when you're shooting to send the taxes into asset of the self prepared method versus assisted. And we really like the fact that right now, season to date, 2% of the total market on the more to self prepared than they are assisted. So I think it's probably a phase assumption to say any year-over-year comparisons are probably driven by the fact that just fewer people so far have filed their returns versus last year. But the good news is the of ratio people leading into do-it-yourself versus assisted continues to trends we're seeing from the last 10. which is more people are filing taxes on their own now than going to somebody to look for them. In terms of changes in free and paid, we have had a really strong campaign for 2 years in a row in Absolute Zero. And you saw last year, not only did we drive unit growth to share goes, we actually exceeded our revenue guidance last year. So there's a monetization model behind that, that we're super excited about. This year, terms of mix, free is up a couple of points more than it was last year.

We are out of the gate strong in the first half of fiscal 2016. We grew revenue 23% in the second quarter, exceeded our guidance across the board, and we're on pace to deliver against our full year outlook. Now we know tax is on everybody's mind at this point of the year, so let me start there first. 
Overall, our tax strategy is on track. We are focused on expanding the do-it-yourself software category, while driving customer growth and share gains, particularly in the simple return segment. TurboTax Online units grew 12% through February 20 with total units up 9%. We're growing our accepted efile season to date faster than the category, which implies that we're once again taking share. Our growth is being driven by product innovation as we continue our journey through reimagine tax preparation. This year, TurboTax expanded its data import capability and pursuit of taxes are done.
Approximately 75% of taxpayers will be able to digitally import W-2s directly into the product this year, up from 68% last year. TurboTax securely imports tax information directly for more than 1.4 million employers and financial institutions, saving considerable time and improving accuracy for the taxpayer. 
This season, all mobile and online customers are [indiscernible] folder of W-2, and TurboTax will import the information into their tax return, whether they're on a phone, a tablet or a computer, which also saves time and reduces errors. Our TurboTax smart look feature is resonating with customers. This new feature quickly connects users with TurboTax experts who will answer the question in realtime completely free. And for the second consecutive year, Americans with more straightforward tax situations are able to use TurboTax to file both their Federal 1040A or the 1040EZ returns as well as their state returns for free. This is a highly compelling offer for the 60 million Americans, many of whom live paycheck-to-paycheck and count on their tax refund as the biggest check that they will receive all year.
I am really excited about our pace of innovation. While there's plenty of time left on the clock, if you look at the scoreboard so far, you'll see that IRS data through February 19 shows the self-prepared efiles were up about 3%, contrasted with assisted efiles being down 5%. And as I mentioned earlier, our efile growth and other third-party data indicate that we're gaining share so far this season.
Looking beyond TurboTax Online, our TurboTax desktop units are roughly flat and the data suggests we're gaining share and winning back customers who may have gone elsewhere last year. On the ProTax side of the business, we've seen positive early trends in customer acquisition and returns growth as well. As I always say at this time of the year, it's early in the season for our tax businesses, but I like the strong start that we delivered so far. We're staying agile, and I'm very pleased with our products and our customer experience.
Now let's talk Small Business. We continue to generate strong new user growth in our online ecosystem. Over 80% of QuickBooks Online customers were new to the Intuit franchise once again this quarter. Total QuickBooks paying customer growth was also healthy in the quarter as our desktop business posted strong results as well. QuickBooks Online continues to build momentum. Total QuickBooks Online subscribers grew 49% in the second quarter. This resulted in the addition of nearly 100,000 QBO subscribers in the quarter, bringing us to 1,257,000 paid subs worldwide at the end of January.
Roughly 50,000 of our QBO subscribers are using QuickBooks Self-Employed, which is up from 35,000 last quarter. Outside the U.S., QBO subs grew roughly 80% to 230,000 paying subscribers, which is in line with our expectations. We remain focused on growing customers globally. We built good momentum in the U.K., Australia and Brazil, and we recently went live in France. We continue to get smarter as we expand our global footprint. We are tuning the local game plan in each country to achieve our targets for lost time value versus customer acquisition costs. Near term, this is dampening subscriber growth a bit in India and in Canada, but we have clear plans in place to drive healthy, profitable growth in these 2 markets over the long term.
Finally, our expanding QBO ecosystem gives us confidence that growth will remain healthy. 85,000 accountants who use the accountant version of QBO also have at least 3 clients using QuickBooks Online. That's more than double the number of accountants with at least 3 clients versus last year. And we now have over 2,000 apps that integrate with QBO in our marketplace, which is more than double the number we had a year ago. 13% of QBO subscribers are now using a third-party application, up from 8% 12 months ago.
We know that retention of a QBO customer who also uses a third-party app is better, which increases lifetime value. The QBO subscriber growth remains near 50% this quarter. So we remain confident in our full year outlook as well as the outlook we gave for fiscal 2017. In fact, we thought QBO subs grew during the last quarter of this -- last month of this quarter become a peak for us, and that is a good new story because that is the peak season for adding QBO subscribers. 
As a result, we're raising the low end of our QBO subscriber outlook for the remainder of this fiscal year. The range is now 1,475,000 to 1,500,000 subscribers. Now as a reminder, at Investor Day, we shared our expectation that QBO subscribers would grow better than 40% on average between fiscal year '15 and fiscal year '17, and that would enable us to exit fiscal year '17 with between 2 million to 2.2 million subs. Given this quarter's performance, we remain absolutely on track to deliver against this longer-term outlook.
So when you hit the total key, it has been a strong first half of the year. I'm inspired by our team's commitment to reimagine the tax prep experience in both our consumer and our Professional Tax businesses. And there's much more innovation in store from these teams over the next few years. 
And in Small Business, customer growth remains strong, as we continue to focus on global customer acquisition enabled by our cloud solutions. So with that overview, I'm going to turn it over to Neil to walk you through the financial details."
21171,323693532,941564,"Intuit Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Feb 25, 2016",2016-02-25,"Earnings Calls","Intuit Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Brad, and good afternoon, everyone. For the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we delivered revenue of $923 million, up 23%. Non-GAAP operating income of $114 million versus a loss of $22 million a year ago. GAAP operating income of $42 million versus",652,"Thanks, Brad, and good afternoon, everyone. For the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we delivered revenue of $923 million, up 23%. Non-GAAP operating income of $114 million versus a loss of $22 million a year ago. GAAP operating income of $42 million versus a loss of $89 million. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.25 versus a loss of $0.06, and GAAP earnings per share of $0.09 versus a loss of $0.23 last year.
These results reflect the changes we made to our desktop software offerings in fiscal 2015 resulting in ratable revenue recognition from that point forward. Turning to the business segments. 
Total Small Business segment revenue increased 7% for the quarter. Small Business Online Ecosystem revenue grew approximately 23% for the quarter, as customer acquisition in our Online ecosystem continues to drive growth. QuickBooks Online subscribers grew 49%, Online Payments customers grew 5%, and Online Payments charge volume grew 17%. Online Payroll customers grew 17%.
I know some of you have been tracking QBO subs in the product itself. You should be aware that due to a one-week lag in the data, it's not always a good indicator of where we will land for the quarter. You also have to consider variability from marketing and processing tests, seasonality and other data and timing issues when looking at the subs number. 
Our second and third fiscal quarters are our strongest seasonally as accountants drive adoption during tax season. Switching to desktop. Total desktop ecosystem revenue increased 3% for the quarter. QuickBooks Desktop units increased 14% in the second quarter. Our strong desktop performance was driven by our pricing and promotion strategy. And for the full fiscal year, we expect desktop ecosystem revenue to be up slightly versus last year. 
Consumer Tax revenue was up 29% versus the second quarter last year. Consumer Tax revenue is significantly higher than last year, reflecting a shift from the third quarter to the second quarter, primarily driven by an extra weekend day in January this year. We still expect revenue growth of 5% to 7% for the full year. 
We are focused on execution for the remainder of the season, to grow the category and expand our share. Our ProTax group revenue grew to $84 million, driven by changes to our desktop offerings where revenue is now recognized ratably as services are delivered. For the third and fourth quarters, ProTax revenue should be roughly the same as it was in fiscal 2015. 
We continue to take a disciplined approach to capital management, investing the cash we generate in opportunities that yield an expected return on investment greater than 15% over 5 years. We repurchased $455 million worth of shares in Q2 and $900 million remained on our authorization as of the end of the quarter.
Our cash and investments balance was $334 million at the end of the second quarter. On February 1, we secured $1.5 billion in debt financing, including a $1 billion revolver and a new term loan of $500 million. One strategic use of this step was the purchase of our San Diego campus, which we previously discussed. 
Other potential uses include share repurchases and acquisitions that closely align with our strategic priorities. Our Board approved a $0.30 dividend per share for our third fiscal quarter payable on April 18. This represents a 20% increase versus last year. 
And one final note on capital allocation. We expect the process to sell Demandforce, QuickBase and Quicken will be completed this fiscal quarter with total proceeds of approximately $500 million. We expect to report GAAP-only gains when these sales close. 
We provided our guidance for the third quarter in our press release. We also reiterated our full year revenue, operating income and EPS guidance. As a reminder, we expect to provide the final TurboTax unit update in late April after the tax season ends. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Brad to close."

And based on these results, we're confident in our ability to deliver on the back half of the year as well. Now we recognize the macro environment looks choppy. But if you look back over the 3-plus decades as a company, it is during uncertain times that our products are needed most by our customers. They still need to file their taxes, pay their bills and look for ways to stretch their hard-earned dollars as far as they can. And we've never been in a stronger position to serve our customers. 
Over the past several years, we transformed from a North American desktop software company to a cloud-driven global product and platform company. And that heavy lifting is now behind us. That's why we're continuing to play offense, investing in innovation to fuel customer growth. We have lots of opportunity in front of us, and we remain deeply committed to accelerating both customer and revenue growth.
But it all starts with great people. And as always, I want to thank our employees for their hard work and their ongoing focus. On the subject of great people, as a part of this earnings release, we announced the decision to rotate the general managers in our Consumer Tax and our Small Business units following the tax season. Effective May 1, Sasan Goodarzi will take over as the Head of The Small Business Group and Dan Wernikoff will assume responsibility as the General Manager for our Consumer Tax business. 
This commitment to leadership mobility is consistent with Intuit's historical process. As we accelerate our transformation to a single ecosystem, strengthening and developing senior talent to possess a deep understanding of all aspects of the ecosystem is more important than ever. Intuit's future success centers on our ability to solve important 2-sided interaction in ways that deliver tremendous benefit for both sides. This rotation will enable Dan and Sasan to develop deep empathy for each of Intuit's core customers as well as a better understanding and an appreciation of our collective products and technologies across the company. 
We're able to implement leadership moves like this from a position of strength. We build deep talent benches. We develop great momentum. And we have clear visibility in the strong outlook in both Small Business and Consumer Tax. I'm excited to watch that momentum continue as Susan and Dan bring a fresh perspective and a new set of capabilities to their respective teams. 
So with that, Latif, let's open it up and let's hear what's on everyone's mind."

So let me start with desktop units.

Thank you, Raimo. This is Brad. So let me start with desktop units. The good news is we've been able to continue to drive strong QBO subscribers, 49% percent and over 80% of those are new to the franchise, while also growing our desktop units 14%. And what we basically learned is last year, we had tried to raise the price on desktop from $199 to $249, and we thought that might accelerate the migration to QBO. That didn't happen. In fact, we didn't see migraters accelerate. What we did see, though, is upgraders and those that were using existing desktop delaying their purchase. So throughout the balance of last year, we tested $199 price promotions and we saw really strong results. What we saw was it had no impact at all on QBO. There was no cannibalization. But what it did do is that it incented people to actually upgrade to the newer version. And so what you're seeing happen now is we have the ability to continue to accelerate QBO, continue to get existing desktop customers to move up to the newest version, and that's the best of both worlds. And so that's what's happening with desktop units. And as you heard, we plan to see -- we actually anticipate the desktop units in revenue will be up slightly for the year now. The second question was on QBO and average revenue per user. As you know, we shared at Investor Day, we're solving for total revenue growth and subscriber growth, and our targets are 25% to 30% in revenue and then about 40% subscriber growth. And that will get us to the targets we provided for fiscal year '16 and 17. I will say, however, that we do see opportunities for ARPU to continue to accelerate over time. If you remember, we talked about a first-year customer comes in with a period of time where they have a trial and a promotional price. Once they move into the 13th month on the product, that ARPU goes up for that customer about 50%. So as more of these new customers start to age, we see a natural tailwind in ARPU. And of course, we continue to get smarter in how we do a tax service to what payroll and payment. So we do see upside opportunity down the road. But for us, ARPU is really an output metric. We want to stay focused on total revenue growth and customer growth. And then, over time, we think by executing well, ARPU will improve. And we'll give you an update on ARPU on our next Investor Day. But we don't to focus on that on a quarterly basis."

If you do all the translation and [indiscernible] of that, that would suggest that the do-it-yourself category has picked up a little more than 2 points of share from assisted so far. Now in the back half of the season, we'll see assisted get a little bit stronger as more complex retentive. But the good news is the DIY category continues to take share from assisted. And then the question is, what about TurboTax share inside that category? And let me tell you, we have not seen this strong of market share advances at this time of the year in my recollection, and I've been here for a while. So right now, season to date, we're a little over 3.5 points of market share. And we're seeing market share increases in TurboTax Online. We're seeing market share increases in TurboTax desktop at retail. And we're also seeing an increase in the number of free fall line customers using TurboTax. So it's across the board. And then your question is where can we do better? We are, were always constructively dissatisfied.

So what we see every year is the tax business is always hard to predict in terms of total returns filed. There's macro trends that you can go back and look at over a decade where there's just more procrastination. As tools become easier to use, people's 1099s and W-2s tend to come out a little bit later. They tend to wait a little further into the season to file their taxes. And so that's been one thing that discontinues and has been doing that for the last 10 years. The second is -- the good news is with the RSA that came out through February 19, this past week, the stock returns actually went up about 3%. So even though we got out to a slow start, it brings the total season to date down to about 1.3 below prior year. So I think you're starting to see momentum pick up. The question behind your question and I heard you ask it, was fraud. I think, collectively, we as an industry and the government are absolutely making an impact on fraud. Now whether or not that actually is correlated with the number of filings that have been filed so far, we won't know till the end of the year when the IRS and the state actually tell us how many of the returns were fraudulent. But I can tell you right now, we have collectively linked in. We've added 23 data schemers and protocols. We strengthened the password. We've added opportunities to share information at a federal and state level between the private industry and the government. And we are starting to adopt a framework called NIST. And I think all of that is having an impact, and that is good news for all of us. But right now, I think the season is still playing out and I think it's just a combination of combination of procrastination. And then we'll see how much of it ends up being us having an impact on fraud."

And of course, we opened up France. And overall, it's up 80%. We have over 250,000 paying subs. A lot more in the pipeline in trial periods and kind of using the products. So that looks very healthy. I did mention the 2 countries you want me to drill deeper on, Canada and India. And I'll start with Canada. Canada is about 30% of our global units today. And what really impacted its growth rate this quarter is last year, we had tried a test at putting QuickBooks Online in retail stores. You would go and purchase it just like you would a box. You would come home and then you would activate it hopefully. And while that drove subs, we did not like the retention rate. In fact, we saw attrition was higher in that particular channel. We ran a similar test in the U.S. So we didn't feel those were good quality leads. We didn't think that was a good effective cost to acquire customers. So we pulled that out this year, and we have a little bit of a grow over on that. But the underlying health is the Canada QuickBooks Online business is strong. We simply have pulled out a channel, and now we're going to have to grow over it. India is a little different. To be very candid with you, our product in India, we had more work to do to get it compliant. We've now added 2 scrum teams of engineers. We've also pulled back on marketing just through the accounting channel, and we're starting to go more direct to small businesses. and so that one's been a little bit of a pivot. I feel really good. We have 1,000 engineers that work at our India Development Center, and they are all passionate about helping get QBO localized. And we have a lot of good in-market knowledge. We're simply in a reset mode there. It's small enough part of our mix. It's the perfect time to learn the lessons and to get readjusted, and we are committed to both Canada and to India over the long term. We're just in the matter -- right now, we're making adjustments to the channel in Canada, and we're making sure the product is compliant in India."

We had made some product changes in the early part of last season that honestly angered our customers. And last year, we gave them the $25 difference in what they would have been able to get for a deluxe product versus what it required them to move up to premiere. And we made a promise we would return the desktop product lineup features to the way they had been, and we did that this year. We kept our promise. And we had an aggressive campaign to go out against any customer we thought that we might have lost to a competitor. And quite frankly, our data shows that we're getting them back. In fact, our conversions from our competitors are at 3x in the desktop business. Our share is up a couple of points in retail. And the net promoter in the desktop business is up 13 points year-over-year. So I think this is about us learning a tough lesson. We made a mistake. We recovered well from it. And our customers came back and said, ""Great, we're back with TurboTax again."" In terms of volume relationship, our goal is always to expand the category then to grow customers faster than revenue because as you know ultimately over time, these customers tax situations will become more complex and over multiple years, we can maximize the lifetime value. So right now, we're seeing good, solid growth in units, as you heard us report today, 9% overall and 12% in TTO, TurboTax Online. And while we're still maintaining our guidance of 5% to 7%, we really like the trend so far this tax season, and we think the that ratio will contain to play out, with more units coming in faster than revenue to the balance of the season."

And we like our momentum in the U.S. In fact, we just crossed 1 million active paying customers in the United States, which is a major milestone. In terms of opportunity ahead in total addressable market, there's about 29 million small businesses in the U.S. If you back out the self-employed, you're still looking at the neighborhood of between 8 million and 12 million, and we currently have 1 million that are using QuickBooks Online. So we aren't running out of any sort of opportunities to grow. It's just a matter of us continue to lean and execute, and we're seeing improvements in our Net Promoter Scores. We're seeing a lot of good traffic coming to QuickBooks Online, and we're seeing improved conversion rates. So I -- from a quarter-to-quarter perspective, as Neil said, you have some seasonality that kicks in.

Good news is we're getting more of our QuickBooks Online users that are new to the franchise, which means we're expanding the category. We were getting fewer customers from desktop to migrate over. But since we're talking about lifetime value and profitability that are pretty equivalent in both sides, we just want to make sure they stay with us. They don't build anywhere else. But one of the things we learned last year is by raising the price to $249, we basically had customers staying but not renewing on their desktop and they weren't moving to QBO, and that was actually a lose for us. And so our promotional pricing now basically says we're going to keep those people who want to stay on desktop at least active, continuing to buy from us and use the newest version and get the best product. And we're going to continue to lean into QBO. And I think what you see happening, overall, is the best of both worlds. I think, ultimately, you're going to see a portion of customers still on desktop in 2017, 2018, and that will go all the way out to 2020 and further. There's just a group of people that are going to want to stay on desktop. We want to make sure they're using the most recent version and continuing to buy from us while we continue to open up the category with QBO. And so I think that's the only difference to our outlook as we hope to have more active customers on desktop, while we continue to add new users in QBO."

And I got the other 2. Thank you for clarifying, Michael. I appreciate it. So right now, it's hard to describe because none of us really know, it's only conjecture why are the number of returns being filed with the IRS down 1.3 season today. And we all have hypotheses. But the good news is we know that come April 18 then yes, there actually is an emancipation day this year. So instead of April 15 being the day, since it happened over the weekend, everyone has till Monday, April 18. And so the good news is, people are going to have file their taxes by then. So what we look at is the ratio what -- how many are shooting to send the taxes in through a self-prepared method versus assisted. And we really like the fact that right now, season to date, 2% of the total market are leaning more to self-prepared than they are assisted. So I think it's probably a safe assumption to say any year-over-year comparisons are probably driven by the fact that just fewer people so far have filed their returns versus last year. But the good news is the ratio of people leaning in to do-it-yourself versus assisted continues the trend we're seeing for the last 10. which is more people are filing taxes on their own now than going to somebody to do it for them. In terms of changes in free and paid, we have had a really strong campaign for 2 years in a row in Absolute Zero. And as you saw last year, not only did it drive unit growth and share gains, we actually exceeded our revenue guidance last year. So there's a monetization model behind that, that we're super excited about. This year, in terms of mix, free is up a couple of points more than it was last year. And that's in an alignment with our guidance. and so we feel very good about the free-to-pay mix. And honestly, we feel even better about our monetization this year because we learned a lot from last year's program. So I'm feeling good overall about free to paid.

We are out of the gate strong in the first half of fiscal 2016. We grew revenue 23% in the second quarter, exceeded our guidance across the board, and we're on pace to deliver against our full year outlook. Now we know tax is on everybody's mind at this point of the year, so let me start there first. 
Overall, our tax strategy is on track. We are focused on expanding the do-it-yourself software category, while driving customer growth and share gains, particularly in the simple return segment. TurboTax Online units grew 12% through February 20 with total units up 9%. We're growing our accepted efile season to date faster than the category, which implies that we're once again taking share. Our growth is being driven by product innovation as we continue our journey to reimagine tax preparation. This year, TurboTax expanded its data import capability and pursuit of taxes are done.
Approximately 75% of taxpayers will be able to digitally import W-2s directly into the product this year, up from 68% last year. TurboTax securely imports tax information directly for more than 1.4 million employers and financial institutions, saving considerable time and improving accuracy for the taxpayer. 
This season, all mobile and online customers can snap a photo of their W-2, and TurboTax will import the information into their tax return, whether they're on a phone, a tablet or a computer, which also saves time and reduces errors. Our TurboTax smart look feature is resonating with customers. This new feature quickly connects users with TurboTax experts who will answer the question in realtime completely free. And for the second consecutive year, Americans with more straightforward tax situations are able to use TurboTax to file both their Federal 1040A or the 1040EZ returns as well as their state returns for free. This is a highly compelling offer for the 60 million Americans, many of whom live paycheck-to-paycheck and count on their tax refund as the biggest check that they will receive all year.
I am really excited about our pace of innovation. While there's plenty of time left on the clock, if you look at the scoreboard so far, you'll see that IRS data through February 19 shows the self-prepared efiles were up about 3%, contrasted with assisted efiles being down 5%. And as I mentioned earlier, the IRS efile growth and other third-party data indicate that we're gaining share so far this season.
Looking beyond TurboTax Online, our TurboTax desktop units are roughly flat and the data suggests we're gaining share and winning back customers who may have gone elsewhere last year. On the ProTax side of the business, we've seen positive early trends in customer acquisition and returns growth as well. As I always say at this time of the year, it's early in the season for our tax businesses, but I like the strong start that we delivered so far. We're staying agile, and I'm very pleased with our products and our customer experience.
Now let's talk Small Business. We continue to generate strong new user growth in our online ecosystems. Over 80% of QuickBooks Online customers were new to the Intuit franchise once again this quarter. Total QuickBooks paying customer growth was also healthy in the quarter as our desktop business posted strong results as well. QuickBooks Online continues to build momentum. Total QuickBooks Online subscribers grew 49% in the second quarter. This resulted in the addition of nearly 100,000 QBO subscribers in the quarter, bringing us to 1,257,000 paid subs worldwide at the end of January.
Roughly 50,000 of our QBO subscribers are using QuickBooks Self-Employed, which is up from 35,000 last quarter. Outside the U.S., QBO subs grew roughly 80% to 230,000 paying subscribers, which is in line with our expectations. We remain focused on growing customers globally. We've built good momentum in the U.K., Australia and Brazil, and we recently went live in France. We continue to get smarter as we expand our global footprint. We are tuning the local game plan in each country to achieve our targets for lost time value versus customer acquisition costs. Near-term, this is dampening subscriber growth a bit in India and in Canada, but we have clear plans in place to drive healthy, profitable growth in these 2 markets over the long term.
Finally, our expanding QBO ecosystem gives us confidence that growth will remain healthy. 85,000 accountants who use the accountant version of QBO also have at least 3 clients using QuickBooks Online. That's more than double the number of accountants with at least 3 clients versus last year. And we now have over 2,000 apps that integrate with QBO in our marketplace, which is more than double the number we had a year ago. 13% of QBO subscribers are now using a third-party application, up from 8% 12 months ago.
We know that retention of a QBO customer who also uses a third-party app is better, which increases lifetime value. The QBO subscriber growth remains near 50% this quarter. So we remain confident in our full year outlook as well as the outlook we gave for fiscal 2017. In fact, we saw QBO subs grew during the last quarter of this -- the last month of this quarter become a peak for us, and that is a good new story because that is the peak season for adding QBO subscribers. 
As a result, we're raising the low end of our QBO subscriber outlook for the remainder of this fiscal year. The range is now 1,475,000 to 1,500,000 subscribers. Now as a reminder, at Investor Day, we shared our expectation that QBO subscribers would grow better than 40% on average between fiscal year '15 and fiscal year '17, and that would enable us to exit fiscal year '17 with between 2 million to 2.2 million subs. Given this quarter's performance, we remain absolutely on track to deliver against this longer-term outlook.
So when you hit the total key, it has been a strong first half of the year. I'm inspired by our team's commitment to reimagine the tax prep experience in both our consumer and our Professional Tax businesses. And there's much more innovation in store from these teams over the next few years. 
And in Small Business, customer growth remains strong, as we continue to focus on global customer acquisition enabled by our cloud solutions. So with that overview, I'm going to turn it over to Neil to walk you through the financial details."

For the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we delivered revenue of $923 million, up 23%. Non-GAAP operating income of $114 million versus a loss of $22 million a year ago.

Non-GAAP operating income of $114 million versus a loss of $22 million a year ago. GAAP operating income of $42 million versus a loss of $89 million. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.25 versus a loss of $0.06, and GAAP earnings per share of $0.09 versus a loss of $0.23 last year.
These results reflect the changes we made to our desktop software offerings in fiscal 2015 resulting in ratable revenue recognition from that point forward. Turning to the business segments. 
Total Small Business segment revenue increased 7% for the quarter. Small Business Online Ecosystem revenue grew approximately 23% for the quarter, as customer acquisition in our Online ecosystem continues to drive growth. QuickBooks Online subscribers grew 49%, Online Payments customers grew 5%, and Online Payments charge volume grew 17%. Online Payroll customers grew 17%.
I know some of you have been tracking QBO subs in the product itself. You should be aware that due to a one-week lag in the data, it's not always a good indicator of where we will land for the quarter. You also have to consider variability from marketing and processing tests, seasonality and other data and timing issues when looking at the subs number. 
Our second and third fiscal quarters are our strongest seasonally as accountants drive adoption during tax season. Switching to desktop. Total desktop ecosystem revenue increased 3% for the quarter. QuickBooks Desktop units increased 14% in the second quarter. Our strong desktop performance was driven by our pricing and promotion strategy. And for the full fiscal year, we expect desktop ecosystem revenue to be up slightly versus last year. 
Consumer Tax revenue was up 29% versus the second quarter of last year. Consumer Tax revenue is significantly higher than last year, reflecting a shift from the third quarter to the second quarter, primarily driven by an extra weekend day in January this year. We still expect revenue growth of 5% to 7% for the full year. 
We are focused on execution for the remainder of the season, to grow the category and expand our share. Our ProTax group revenue grew to $84 million, driven by changes to our desktop offerings where revenue is now recognized ratably as services are delivered. For the third and fourth quarters, ProTax revenue should be roughly the same as it was in fiscal 2015. 
We continue to take a disciplined approach to capital management, investing the cash we generate in opportunities that yield an expected return on investment greater than 15% over 5 years. We repurchased $455 million worth of shares in Q2 and $900 million remained on our authorization as of the end of the quarter.
Our cash and investments balance was $334 million at the end of the second quarter. On February 1, we secured $1.5 billion in debt financing, including a $1 billion revolver and a new term loan of $500 million. One strategic use of this step was the purchase of our San Diego campus, which we previously discussed. 
Other potential uses include share repurchases and acquisitions that closely align with our strategic priorities. Our Board approved a $0.30 dividend per share for our third fiscal quarter payable on April 18. This represents a 20% increase versus last year. 
And one final note on capital allocation. We expect the process to sell Demandforce, QuickBase and Quicken will be completed this fiscal quarter with total proceeds of approximately $500 million. We expect to report GAAP-only gains when these sales close. 
We provided our guidance for the third quarter in our press release. We also reiterated our full year revenue, operating income and EPS guidance. As a reminder, we expect to provide a final TurboTax unit update in late April after the tax season ends. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Brad to close."

And based on these results, we're confident in our ability to deliver on the back half of the year as well. Now we recognize the macro environment looks choppy. But if you look back over the 3-plus decades as a company, it is during uncertain times that our products are needed most by our customers. They still need to file their taxes, pay their bills and look for ways to stretch their hard-earned dollars as far as they can. And we've never been in a stronger position to serve our customers. 
Over the past several years, we transformed from a North American desktop software company to a cloud-driven global product and platform company. And that heavy lifting is now behind us. That's why we're continuing to play offense, investing in innovation to fuel customer growth. We have lots of opportunity in front of us, and we remain deeply committed to accelerating both customer and revenue growth.
But it all starts with great people. And as always, I want to thank our employees for their hard work and their ongoing focus. On the subject of great people, as a part of this earnings release, we announced the decision to rotate the general managers in our Consumer Tax and our Small Business units following the tax season. Effective May 1, Sasan Goodarzi will take over as the Head of The Small Business Group and Dan Wernikoff will assume responsibility as the General Manager for our Consumer Tax business. 
This commitment to leadership mobility is consistent with Intuit's historical process. As we accelerate our transformation to a single ecosystem, strengthening and developing senior talent to possess a deep understanding of all aspects of the ecosystem is more important than ever. Intuit's future success centers on our ability to solve important 2-sided interactions in ways that deliver tremendous benefit for both sides. This rotation will enable Dan and Sasan to develop deep empathy for each of Intuit's core customers as well as a better understanding and an appreciation of our collective products and technologies across the company. 
We're able to implement leadership moves like this from a position of strength. We build deep talent benches. We develop great momentum. And we have clear visibility and a strong outlook in both Small Business and Consumer Tax. I'm excited to watch that momentum continue as Susan and Dan bring a fresh perspective and a new set of capabilities to their respective teams. 
So with that, Latif, let's open it up and let's hear what's on everyone's mind."

So let me start with desktop units. The good news is we've been able to continue to drive strong QBO subscribers, 49% percent and over 80% of those are new to the franchise, while also growing our desktop units 14%.",448,"Great. Thank you, Raimo. This is Brad. So let me start with desktop units. The good news is we've been able to continue to drive strong QBO subscribers, 49% percent and over 80% of those are new to the franchise, while also growing our desktop units 14%. And what we basically learned is last year, we had tried to raise the price on desktop from $199 to $249, and we thought that might accelerate the migration to QBO. That didn't happen. In fact, we didn't see migraters accelerate. What we did see, though, is upgraders and those that were using existing desktop delaying their purchase. So throughout the balance of last year, we tested $199 price promotions and we saw really strong results. What we saw was it had no impact at all on QBO. There was no cannibalization. But what it did do is that it incented people to actually upgrade to the newer version. And so what you're seeing happen now is we have the ability to continue to accelerate QBO, continue to get existing desktop customers to move up to the newest version, and that's the best of both worlds. And so that's what's happening with desktop units. And as you heard, we plan to see -- we actually anticipate the desktop units in revenue will be up slightly for the year now. The second question was on QBO and average revenue per user. As you know, we shared at Investor Day, we're solving for total revenue growth and subscriber growth, and our targets are 25% to 30% in revenue and then about 40% subscriber growth. And that will get us to the targets we provided for fiscal year '16 and 17. I will say, however, that we do see opportunities for ARPU to continue to accelerate over time. If you remember, we talked about a first-year customer comes in with a period of time where they have a trial and a promotional price. Once they move into the 13th month on the product, that ARPU goes up for that customer about 50%. So as more of these new customers start to age, we see a natural tailwind in ARPU. And of course, we continue to get smarter in how we do a tax service like payroll and payment. So we do see upside opportunity down the road. But for us, ARPU is really an output metric. We want to stay focused on total revenue growth and customer growth. And then, over time, we think by executing well, ARPU will improve. And we'll give you an update on ARPU on our next Investor Day. But we don't to focus on that on a quarterly basis."

So with the IRS data being published on February 19, they're showing that total returns received were down about 1.3%. They're suggesting that the self-prepared returns, the do-it-yourself category, is up about 3% season to date and the assisted is down 5%. If you do all the translation and machinations of that, that would suggest that the do-it-yourself category has picked up a little more than 2 points of share from assisted so far. Now in the back half of the season, we'll see assisted get a little bit stronger as more complex come in, but the good news is the DIY category continues to take share from assisted. And then the question is, what about TurboTax share inside that category? And let me say, we have not seen this strong a market share advance at this time of the year in my recollection, and I've been here for a while. So right now, season to date, we're a little over 3.5 points of market share. And we're seeing market share increases in TurboTax Online. We're seeing market share increases in TurboTax desktop at retail. And we're also seeing an increase in the number of free fall line customers using TurboTax. So it's across the board. And then your question is where can we do better? We are, were always constructively dissatisfied. But I have to tell you right now, I feel really good about the product innovation the team has put out into the market. I love the reaction to our advertising and our marketing campaign. I love the fact that we've taken a leadership role in fighting security or cyber fraud and leading the security efforts across the industry. And of course, we have opportunities to continue to make sure we're answering phones faster. There's places in the product we always want to make it easier for end-users and the team's all over that.

If you look back at the same quarterly trends from 2015, you'll see that Q1 is a high point for us. Attach rates tail off a little bit in Q2. Probably the bigger factor, though, is that we're including the self-employed units this year in the numbers, and they were very small last year in Q2. And those are typically earlier businesses, self-employed, sole proprietors who don't have the same attach opportunities as our other QBO base overall. But those are the 2 main things to watch and understand the attach rates and payments in Q2."

So what we see every year is the tax business is always hard to predict in terms of total returns filed. There's macro trends that you can go back and look at over a decade where there's just more procrastination. As tools become easier to use, people's 1099s and W-2s tend to come out a little bit later. They tend to wait a little further into the season to file their taxes. And so that's been one thing that just continues and it has been doing that for the last 10 years. The second is -- the good news is with the IRS data that came out through February 19, this past week, looks like returns actually went up about 3%. So even though we got out to a slow start, it brings the total season to date down to about 1.3 below prior year. So I think you're starting to see momentum pick up. The question behind your question and I heard you ask it, was fraud. I think, collectively, we as an industry and the government are absolutely making an impact on fraud. Now whether or not that actually is correlated with the number of filings that have been filed so far, we won't know till the end of the year when the IRS and the state actually tell us how many of the returns were fraudulent. But I can tell you right now, we have collectively linked in. We've added 23 data schemers and protocols. We strengthened the passwords. We've added opportunities to share information at a federal and state level between the private industry and the government. And we are starting to adopt a framework called NIST. And I think all of that is having an impact, and that is good news for all of us. But right now, I think the season is still playing out and I think it's just a combination of procrastination. And then we'll see how much of it ends up being us having an impact on fraud."

This is Brad. I would say, first of all, overall, we feel very good about our global progress and I mentioned the countries, the U.K., Australia, Brazil, where we made an acquisition last year of a company called ZeroPaper, and now we just ported that under the QBO platform in February. And of course, we opened up France. And overall, it's up 80%. We have over 250,000 paying subs. A lot more in the pipeline in trial periods and kind of using the products. So that looks very healthy. I did mention the 2 countries you want me to drill deeper on, Canada and India. And I'll start with Canada. Canada is about 30% of our global units today. And what really impacted its growth rate this quarter is last year, we had tried a test at putting QuickBooks Online in retail stores. You would go and purchase it just like you would a box. You would come home and then you would activate it hopefully. And while that drove subs, we did not like the retention rate. In fact, we saw attrition was higher in that particular channel. We ran a similar test in the U.S. So we didn't feel those were good quality leads. We didn't think that was a good effective cost to acquire customers. So we pulled that out this year, and we have a little bit of a grow over on that. But the underlying health is the Canada QuickBooks Online business is strong. We simply have pulled out a channel, and now we're going to have to grow over it. India is a little different. To be very candid with you, our product in India, we had more work to do to get it compliant. We've now added 2 scrum teams of engineers. We've also pulled back on marketing just through the accounting channel, and we're starting to go more direct to small businesses. and so that one's been a little bit of a pivot. I feel really good. We have 1,000 engineers that work at our India Development Center, and they are all passionate about helping get QBO localized. And we have a lot of good in-market knowledge. We're simply in a reset mode there. It's small enough part of our mix. It's the perfect time to learn the lessons and to get readjusted, and we are committed to both Canada and to India over the long term. We're just in the matter -- right now, we're making adjustments to the channel in Canada, and we're making sure the product is compliant in India."

And we made a promise we would return the desktop product lineup features to the way they had been, and we did that this year. We kept our promise. And we had an aggressive campaign to go out against any customer we thought that we might have lost to a competitor. And quite frankly, our data shows that we're getting them back. In fact, our conversions from our competitors are at 3x in the desktop business. Our share is up a couple of points in retail. And the net promoter in the desktop business is up 13 points year-over-year. So I think this is about us learning a tough lesson. We made a mistake. We recovered well from it. And our customers came back and said, ""Great, we're back with TurboTax again."" In terms of volume relationship, our goal is always to expand the category and then to grow customers faster than revenue -- because as you know ultimately over time, those customers' tax situations will become more complex and over multiple years, we can maximize the lifetime value.

Good news is we're getting more of our QuickBooks Online users that are new to the franchise, which means we're expanding the category. We were getting fewer customers from desktop to migrate over. But since we're talking about lifetime value and profitability that are pretty equivalent in both sides, we just want to make sure they stay with us. They don't go anywhere else. But one of the things we learned last year is by raising the price to $249, we basically had customers staying but not renewing on their desktop and they weren't moving to QBO, and that was actually a lose for us. And so our promotional pricing now basically says we're going to keep those people who want to stay on desktop at least active, continuing to buy from us and use the newest version and get the best product. And we're going to continue to lean into QBO. And I think what you see happening, overall, is the best of both worlds. I think, ultimately, you're going to see a portion of customers still on desktop in 2017, 2018, and that will go all the way out to 2020 and further. And there's just a group of people that are going to want to stay on desktop. We want to make sure they're using the most recent version and continuing to buy from us while we continue to open up the category with QBO. And so I think that's the only difference to our outlook as we hope to have more active customers on desktop, while we continue to add new users in QBO."

And I got the other 2. Thank you for clarifying, Michael. I appreciate it. So right now, it's hard to describe because none of us really know, it's only conjecture, why are the number of returns being filed with the IRS down 1.3 season to date. And we all have hypotheses. But the good news is we know that come April 18 -- and yes, there actually is an emancipation day this year. So instead of April 15 being the day, since it happens over the weekend, everyone has till Monday, April 18. And so the good news is, people are going to have file their taxes by then. So what we look at is the ratio what -- how many are shooting to send the taxes in through a self-prepared method versus assisted. And we really like the fact that right now, season to date, 2% of the total market are leaning more to self-prepared than they are assisted. So I think it's probably a safe assumption to say any year-over-year comparisons are probably driven by the fact that just fewer people so far have filed their returns versus last year. But the good news is the ratio of people leaning in to do-it-yourself versus assisted continues the trend we're seeing for the last 10. which is more people are filing taxes on their own now than going to somebody to do it for them. In terms of changes in free and paid, we have had a really strong campaign for 2 years in a row in Absolute Zero. And as you saw last year, not only did it drive unit growth and share gains, we actually exceeded our revenue guidance last year. So there's a monetization model behind that, that we're super excited about. This year, in terms of mix, free is up a couple of points more than it was last year. And that's in an alignment with our guidance. and so we feel very good about the free-to-pay mix. And honestly, we feel even better about our monetization this year because we learned a lot from last year's program. So I'm feeling good overall about free to paid. On  California racks, I actually -- good news is we have our general counsel sitting here. So Laura Fennell, is there any update we have on the California situation?"

As you already know, we had an outstanding tax season. We're also pleased with our performance in Small Business.

As you already know, we had an outstanding tax season. We're also pleased with our performance in Small Business. 
At the company level in our fiscal third quarter, we came in ahead of our guidance across the board. And as a result, we're raising our revenue, operating income and earnings per share guidance for the year. Since tax is on everyone's mind, let's start there. 
We feel great about the product innovation that we delivered in TurboTax this year, as well as the result enabled by that innovation. As you know, there are 4 key drivers to our Consumer Tax business. The first driver is the number of returns filed with the IRS. The latest IRS data indicates that total returns were up about 1.5%. That was a bit stronger than we expected, so it was a modest tailwind. 
The second driver is the percentage of those returns filed using do-it-yourself software. This season, the category grew nearly 6% versus the assisted category, which was up only slightly. This suggests that do-it-yourself software category gained more than 1 point of share again this year, driving more than 3 points of revenue growth for TuboTax. 
The third driver is TurboTax's share within the do-it-yourself software category. For the third consecutive year, we gained share within the category. In fact, this season, we gained more than 3 points of share, bringing our total software category share to roughly 65%. 
And the fourth driver is revenue per return. As you know, our goal is to grow customers faster than revenue, which yields a positive lifetime value payoff after tax situations grow more complex over time. Our strategy to gain share of the less complex returns continue to bear fruit, enabling unit growth of 12% overall, which was faster than our revenue growth of over 9%. With that said, our revenue growth for the segment far outpaced our original outlook of 5% to 7% at the beginning of the fiscal year. 
Bottom line, it was a very successful tax season for TurboTax. So what drove the performance? The answer is simple, an awesome, innovative product experience. But what's behind the awesome experience is not system. It is driven by deep data science and rigorous execution from a very talented TurboTax team. 
Now we began this multi-year journey 3 years ago to reimagine the tax breadth in support of a brand mission of taxes are done. And this season, we began to really see it pay off. We remain committed to continuing to invest and build on our competitive advantage, driving share gains for the category and for TurboTax. This season, our team more than tripled its pace of innovation, introducing over 20 new products improvement. We couple this product innovation with a great demand generation campaign that really resonated. It doesn't take a genius to do your taxes. 
We made the complex simple, which when you get down to it, it's what Intuit does everyday. Our seamless cloud-based experience drove increased mobile discovery and usage. Our mobile app downloads were up 85% versus last season and the number of completed returns through the mobile app and through mobile browsers doubled. This year, customers snapped 5 million photos of tax documents with mobile devices, that is up 4x greater than it was last year. This represented 25% of all the documents imported in the TurboTax, which save time and reduce errors well lighting customers. We also continue to reimagine the entire product experience using data to help customers finish their taxes faster with increased confidence. 
For example, we broke down the Affordable Care Act and the simple question and providing new confident building features like Explain Why and Smart Look. These innovations help reduce the tax press time by 40% on average for our customers. We also delivered an excellent customer care experience and continue to invest in security, working with the industry and the government to protect our customers and to reduce fraud. 
On top of all of that product improvement, we continue to focus on serving an important segment that we feel is underserved and overcharged, the Simple Return segment. Absolute Zero give these taxpayers the most affordable options, a great product that cost them nothing. But Absolute Zero is just one of the reasons that we won this year. In fact, TurboTax gain share versus software competitive's who match the Absolute Zero offer, and we even gained share at the end of season at full price. All in all, TurboTax grew unit double-digit and expanded share. We also grew revenue more than 9%, and we improved margin in an already very profitable business. This was simply a great season for TurboTax.
Now let me shift to the ProTax business, which we recently rebranded as the Pro Connect group, given the strategic role this business play in our ecosystem. The ProConnect group supports both of our strategic goals, to do the nation's taxes and to be the operating system behind Small Business success. In support of doing the nation's taxes, were doing just that. We grew individual returns about 1% in this business this year, which is faster than the overall assisted category group. New customers were a bit soft, but we did a nice job of retention, leading to modest customer and return growth. 
Looking ahead, we're focused on growing the ProTax business in ways that are less reliant on price. We're leaning into the cloud with Intuit Tax Online, and we're innovating with new attach solutions, like refund transfer and e-signature. We've got some work to do to drive faster adoption in these services, but we're optimistic about the future. 
The new name reflects ProConnect groups expanded effort to support Small Business success. The more we connect our accountant customers with our Small Business customers, the more successful they all our and the healthier our ecosystem becomes. For example, we know QuickBooks Online retention at 11 points better when a Small Business works with an accountant. So you're tapping into our card network to make these connections. Nearly 600,000 QuickBooks Online subscribers are now linked to an accountant. That is up 70% versus last year. This all nets out a strategic important, highly profitable business, albeit with a slower growth rate then TurboTax with a Small Business group. Neil will talk about our expectations in this business in a minute. That overview of the tax side of the house, let's transition to Small Business. We continue to generate strong new user growth in our Online ecosystem. 
Again this quarter, more than 80% of QuickBooks Online customers were new to the Intuit franchise and total QuickBooks paying customer growth remains healthy. Year-to-date, across desktop and online, new customers are up 16%, which is an acceleration from last year. 
QuickBooks Online continue to build momentum. We grew total QuickBooks Online subscribers 45% in the third quarter. This resulted in the addition of 140,000 QBO subscribers in the quarter, bringing us to 1,397,000 paid subs worldwide at the end of April, which was ahead of our guidance. Roughly 75,000 of these QBO subscribers are using QuickBooks Self-Employed, which is up from 50,000 last quarter. 
Outside the U.S, QuickBooks Online grew roughly 60% to 255,000 paying subscribers. In total, we're executing well and we're on track to meet our subscriber targets for fiscal year 2016 and 2017. Also, it's important to note that revenue per customer is coming in a bit stronger than we expected so far this year. As we said at Investor Day, we're expecting to land as $2 million to 2.2 million QBO subs at the end of fiscal 2017. 
Now we're also improving customer retention, and we fully expect retention to continue to improve next year's more of our QBO customers are required through or worked with an accountant. Attach of payroll payments and third-party apps also improved retention, and we're building solid traction in there as well. For example, we now have over 100,000 QuickBooks Online Accountant customers who have at least 3 of their own clients on QBO. That's more than double what it was a year ago. We now also have 2500 third-party apps in our ecosystem. That's up from 1,100 year ago and approximately 15% of QuickBooks Online customers are connecting to at least 1 third-party app. That's up from 9% a year ago. Payroll and payment, as you know, we drivers of retention and they also help drive revenue per customer and the attach rates for these products remain healthy at 19% per payroll and 8% for payments. 
So that's of the story of the high level. Our teams have driven significant innovation across all of our offering and has resulted in strong financial results for the quarter and for the year. So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Neil to walk you through the financial details."

For the third quarter of fiscal 2016, we delivered revenue of $2.3 billion, up 8%. This growth reflects the shift of approximately $30 million of Consumer Tax revenue from Q3 into Q2 relative to last season. 
We delivered non-GAAP operating income of $1.4 billion, up 11%. GAAP operating income of $1.3 billion, up 21%. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.43, up 20%. And GAAP earnings per share of $3.94, which reflects an after-tax gain of $0.67 per share on the divestiture of Quicken, QuickBase and Demandforce. Turning to the business segments. 
Total Small Business segment revenue increased 12% for the quarter. Small Business Online Ecosystem revenue grew approximately 24% for the quarter as customer acquisition and our Online ecosystem continues to drive growth. QuickBooks Online subscribers grew 45%. Online active payments customers grew 6% and online payments charge volume grew 18%. Online Payroll customers grew 17%. Switching to the desktop side. Total desktop ecosystem revenue increased 8%. QuickBooks Desktop units were up 3% in the third quarter. And for the full year, we expect desktop units and revenue will be up slightly. 
I know it's been difficult to correlate the growth rate and QBO subscriptions to our Online ecosystem revenue growth rate. Here are some detail on online revenue that should help with your modeling. 
In the third quarter, Online Payroll revenue grew 21% and online payment revenue grew 13%. About 40% of our Online Payroll customers are attached to QBO while 60% or not. We saw stand-alone Online Payroll through partners and accountants. And this is a good profitable business, but one that gross much lower than payroll attach QuickBooks online. The revenue it makes is closer to 50-50. 
We expect payroll customers attach to QuickBooks Online to grow around 25% this year and revenue from those customers to grow nearly 40%. Now let's look at payments through the same lens. 
The customer and revenue mix for attached to nonattached solutions is about 50, but the story is a little different. We are not currently focused on standalone payments, channels, like GoPayment and online processing that are not attached to QBO. The QBO attach business is growing very fast and then unattached business is shrinking. We expect payments customers and revenue attached to QuickBooks Online to grow more than 50% this year. 
Consumer Tax revenue was up 7% versus the third quarter last year. And for the year, we expect Consumer Tax revenue growth of approximately 9%. As a reminder, third quarter Consumer Tax revenue reflects the shift from the third quarter to the second quarter, primarily driven by an extra weekend day in January this year. 
One thing I'd like to call out as we start thinking about next season and next year's guidance. We're investing to improve the total TurboTax product experience, thus, delivering the results you saw this season. This remains a high margin business at over 60%. We remain focused on growing customers, gaining share and increasing profit dollars rather than margin expansion. 
Our ProConnect group, Professional Tax revenue was $126 million in the third quarter. For the fourth quarter, we expect ProConnect revenue to be approximately the same us in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. 
As Brad said, we're focused less on price on the ProTax side and investing in our accountant offerings to enhance growth in the QuickBooks Online ecosystem. We expect revenue to be roughly flat in fiscal 2017 with margins remaining above 60%. 
We continue to take a disciplined approach to capital management, investing the cash we generate in opportunities that yield an expected return on investment greater than 15% over 5 years. We've repurchased for $465 million of shares in the third quarter, and we had for $435 million remaining on our authorization. Our cash investment balance was $1.6 billion at the end of the third quarter and our Board approved a $0.30 dividend per share for our fiscal fourth quarter payable on July 18. This represents a 20% increase versus last year. Year-to-date, we returned nearly $2.5 billion in cash to our shareholders via share repurchases and dividends.
We provided guidance for the fourth quarter in our press release. We also raised our full year revenue, operating income and EPS guidance, and now expect revenue growth of 11% to 12% for the year. We've reiterated our full year fiscal 2016 guidance for QuickBooks Online subscribers. 
As we look forward to fiscal 2017, we're pleased that our trajectory is in line with the long-term customer and financial plans that we shared last year. Small Business and Consumer Tax remain quite healthy. We'll continue to invest in awesome products, security and customer care. The investments were making outside the U.S. will pay off over the longer term horizon. Taking all this into consideration, I still believe that $4.30 is in the best estimate of their non-GAAP EPS will come in next year. We'll share more when we provide fiscal 2017 guidance in August. And with that, I'll turn it back to Brad to close."

In fact, what we're doing is we're expanding the total addressable market. Note that have had a couple of shareholders ask we questions about the fact sheet we used to report years ago that included the number of desktop customers that run the last 3 years version. We don't report that in a more. So there was a question of hey, so that number actually decreasing faster than online subs going and are you losing customers? So tell you what, we share some information at this moment that actually subs that leased to publish and so what has got the same data. If you take the total number of QuickBooks will desktop customers and look at the ones that are on the last 3 years version, these are the active customers, and then you add to that to the online subscribers and the desktop subscribers, the total base is up 4%. That is the first time that base has grown and over a decade ago. If you then take that number and say, how many actually paid us this year? The either bought a version of desktop in the last 12 months or they got us subscriber, subscription for us. That number is up 20%. And then if you look at total new users, whether Davol desktop our online, that's up 16%. So no matter how we look at it, they had that were expanding TAM, we're growing our base. Are entering new markets, and we feel very good that both the desktop and the online business are growing. 
And time to desktop, the thing that we discovered is what we talked about at the last call. Have a group of customers that even with feature parity and even with pricing concessions, do not want to move to the cloud right now either because of their accountants, isn't it in the cloud or the Small Business just likes of the product the way they have it in they don't want to make the move. We want to make sure they remain active customers of Intuit and that there be payroll and payment services so we want to give them delighted. So it's making sure the desktop customers are happy. The cloud customers are happy and those who want to move over, we want to make it easy for them to do that. So net-net, we have a very vibrant ecosystem right now. It's growing in total and the online subs for us actually was right and our expectations. I felt great about 45% growth. I feel good about the momentum we have at the countries outside the U.S and most importantly, I love the facts we're expanding TAM, both new countries, as well as self-employed, which give us a lot of one is for the future. So that's how we felt what the QuickBooks business overall."

First of all, thanks for the feedback on the quarter. Let me talk to tax first. The results you saw this year are the results of a multiyear investment we've been making in product and innovation, which is not easily matched by competition. I mentioned a couple of things in my opening talk track that even though we had success with Absolute Zero, we also had success when competitors measure that's Absolute Zero and we were head-to-head and we took share, and also had success after Absolute Zero was done, and we were at full price. What's happening right now is we are really making big advances towards taxes completely going away and having no friction for customers to get to the refund. And you heard me talk about this year, on average, customer spent 40% last time having to do their taxes. That is not sub. The competition can match. Now at the same time, tell you, we have our out of respect for our competition. We don't under estimate that we know every year is going to be competitive. But I do believe that the team continued to advance our product innovation and as a result, continue to win newer customers and take sure? I do. That's the expectation we have of ourselves and that's the expectation we want to deliver for our customers is a product recently that's them closer until taxes are done. So I said I don't buy a large number in our case. We're going to continue to work hard to get at that number. 
The second is QBO an acceleration. You're right. For us to deliver the 2 million to the 2.2 million subs growth, you're going to continue to see an acceleration in terms of the net adds we bring it in a poorly quarterly basis with fully know that and we continue to reinforce our confidence in that and you may ask why? But remember, one of the things we talked about when we gave that forecast is we needed to have total subs growth on a 40% compounded annual growth rate. Well, this quarter was 45%. The second thing is, what we've made some adjustments outside the U.S. and Canada and India, we've got a clear path of how to get those countries repositioned in a good way. U.K. and Australia are on fire, and we just brought on to new countries, Brazil and France. So we believe with expanding TAM and the fact that were early innings in both self-employed and global as well as the fact that the U.S. grew in the mid-30s, we see our way to the to 2 to the 2.2. We're not batting an eye. And your math is correct, we think that is the mobile."

But I would have thought that those businesses should be growing even faster and it is surprising but you're QBO based business, although it's larger than payroll and payment, it's actually growing faster and adding more new dollars than the other 2 businesses. Can you help me us understand when could we see that inflection point with attach rate starts to inflect pretty materially that you could realize your growth objectives, which I'm sure are pretty aggressive with respect to payments in payroll? It seems to me that there's something limiting these attach rates from going potentially very high. I'm sure that you've talked this slide, which is anybody else, but I just wanted to get your perspective."

I'd say, first of all, of Tazewell, the one thing we have to keep in mind is we have a growing base of self-employed customers under the QBO numbers. And so those self-employed customers by definition don't have employees so they don't need payroll and many times they're driving for over or the for somebody else and they don't need payment. So if he actually looked at it on an apples-to-apples basis, our tax rate remains very healthy compared to read it was a year ago. What same time, we do see opportunities to continue to improve the attach rates. We're focused on first use, making sure we reduce the friction of the customer experience and continuing to get the services available outside the U.S. and then NUS countries, which will allow us to bring that penetration and that attach rate up from the total base. So you're correct. I would do think there still opportunity there. We're working on it hard. But one of the things you have to look at right now and the absolute numbers, keep in mind that last quarter, we had 50,000 QBO self-employed. This quarter, we had 75,000. And that number doesn't come with payroll and payment opportunities today. So that basically makes it attach rate the way they do. The other thing I would say about the ability to improve the revenue, the ecosystem in addition to attach this obviously, we've shared with you on the past, we have customers that come in at first year on a promotional pricing period. When they hit the 13th month, that average revenue per customer for that unit goes up about 15%, and we're going to have customers rolling off the promotional pricing period and that's going to help us bring revenue up. So last we sell adds. So in addition to attach rate and moving off of promotional pricing is retention. Year ago, we will talk to about attention in the low- to mid-70s. We now talk to you in QBO about retention in the high 70s and starting to tickle the low 80s. And every point of attention adds the net 15,000 subs. So that number is also a lever that we continue to improve, and we've improved to significantly over the last 12 months. So those are the pieces, I know there's a lot of math in there. Those are the pieces the kind of just to the confidence have in there as well Online ecosystem revenue. It is attach rates. It is retention and it is rolling off the promotional pricing."

And so to do that, we have to deliver 40% plus CAGR. And we've been above that number. And so we actually are achieving the outcomes that we set for ourselves internally. No along the way, we've had some learning. Walmart Canada, As you know, we found out that we were selling through retail and they were entertaining at the levels we expected them to. And so we shut down that channel. I would tell you that Canada that is now behind us and the momentum is rebuilding in Canada, and we feel very good about the Canada outlook right now. 
The other area was India. Any guess where we didn't take the time to localize the product and get all the compliance features of the levels that and accounted would have confidence to recommended. As a result, they were recommending our product in conjunction with another product and it was becoming companion app it would that not what that's a greater man and so we have not stopped that. With actually been finalizing the product, localization and we're now starting to go direct to small businesses while we'd get back to the county let them know the new version. That one is not as far along as Canada, but we're already seeing the partners in India as well. 
The last 2 or the new countries, Brazil, which is no reported it is acquisition we did a ago called ZeroPaper, reported over on the QBO, and we're starting to accelerate there. And then France, we just general release. So when you put that together U.S. remain strong, self-employed is opening a new market. Canada is back on track. India has made its turn. Brazil and France are ramping up. The U.K. and Israeli of the main gain investors. So we feel good about our 2 million to 2.2 million.

I know you're a busy man out there traveling and appreciate you dialing in. Let me start with QBO for a minute core U.S. I think one of the things that we're working hard to help everybody understand inside the company and outside is last year, when we introduced QuickBooks Self-Employed, we actually eliminated the low end SKU in QuickBooks Online, which was called QuickBooks Online Simple Start. And so we always use account QuickBooks Online Simple Start as the core QuickBooks Online product lineup because there is a little and customer who quite frankly was overserved by that product. And we shut it down and replaced it with QuickBooks Self-Employed. I think it's a little bit of a misnomer to say, pullout self-employed and to go as QuickBooks is growing. But I would be supplied to saying in a pullout on that Deluxe and just look at the rest of the product lineup. I think it is something we all have to get our head around is it is a part of our core product lineup and honestly, it's expanding TAM. There's 30 million to 50 million people that space that the original QuickBooks Self-Employed Simple Start is served. So I think that will be the first thing, and I just want to make sure that you know that's how we look at it. Now when you back that out and say how is the QuickBooks Online for U.S. business growing. What I like about it is that it's doing exactly what it wanted it to. It's expanding TAM. So the desktop customers are still growing. QBO, 80% of the customers are new to the franchise. They've never used QuickBooks or Accounting before. Self-employed is going after a category that they could have never been served before with the old QuickBooks Online Simple Start, and you put it all together and in the U.S, that number is, without self employed, growing in the mid-30s, which is a very healthy number out to you if you add back in QuickBooks the number is even better. So that would be the way we look at it in terms of corporate when I do think there's continued opportunity to keep that healthy about 30% and even potentially accelerate it as we get wiser about how to market the self-employed product. So that's on the self-employed side. On the accountant side, you're actually right. This business is strategic. We've known for years, 2 realities about to the accountants being involved and a Small Business trace. The first is the success rate of the Small Business goes up 89% if they work with an accountant. The second is over half of all accounting, payroll and payment decisions are made because the accountants influenced them and told them to buy it. So they are tremendous decision-making advocate for our products. The third piece is the piece that we talked about today in the opening points. yes, the accountant is working with a Small Business, the retention of QuickBooks Online goes up 1,100 basis points, 11 points a point of attention is incredible for us in our subs business. So the important to the accountants has never been were critical then we moved that fast, and we also think they're going to be catalyst to get a lot of these customers adopt the cloud just why we're leaning in so heavily with QuickBooks Online for accountants. So that's where this summer and they counted signed and I also hope to clear up a little bit of how a little cut core QBO specially that it relates to Simple Start or self-employed, I'm sorry, I got the old term in there, Matt."

We took equal parts share throughout the season. So we didn't have any variation that said,, these were all the result of this. And then you step back and say, well, what drove that. So when you look at it this your, the team put out 3x, 3x more than the product innovation that we did last year. Over 20 new product, feature functionality and innovations with were put into the attic. And that was a really good campaigns that I think resonated where people really felt it was self empower. And so it actually what drove our competitor advantage this year. So that's really the TurboTax piece. In terms of a seeing price, we've been pretty consistent on ACA puts Justin X piece of legislation this of introduce by government. The cost of people to see, this is complicated and our job is to say no, you're capable of doing it, we'll make it simple, and we worked really hard for 3 years to do that and the Affordable Care Act has not gone a headwind at all. In fact, it's been one of the highest converting aspects of our website. In terms of fraud, we'll have a summit again in the summertime with the rest of the industry the IRS commissioner. But I think we all collectively feel good that we made big events us this year as an industry. And we think that those advances will continue as we look ahead 2 next year, and we remain committed to getting back after the U.S. tax system."

We are looking to invest and make product better every day both in Small Business and in Consumer Tax. As you can imagine, this time of year, we have a lot of ideas, a lot of suggestions. There are ways to take advantage of that expanded addressable market as Brad mentioned and to grow the product faster. We're running test, we're running experiments now to determine, which of those you think will have the biggest impact next year both in Small Business and and Consumer Tax that we consider the markets that we're in. We've talked about some of the adjustments we've made in some of our markets outside the U.S. already. So those are the things that help us balance, Scott, between delivering what we consider is a very strong midteens improvement in EPS at the same time, while continuing to invest in the future, be sure that we have a good 18 to 19 after 2017.

All of those documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Intuit's website at intuit.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statement.
Some of the numbers in this report are presented on a non-GAAP basis. We've reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP numbers in today's press release. Unless otherwise noted, all growth rates refer to the current period versus the comparable prior year period, and the business metrics and associated growth rates refer to worldwide business metrics.  Also, all reported results and guidance, except GAAP, net income and EPS exclude Demandforce, QuickBase and Quicken, which have been sold and reclassified to discontinued operations. A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our website after this call ends.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Brad Smith."

As you already know, we had an outstanding tax season. We're also pleased with our performance in Small Business. At the company level in our fiscal third quarter, we came in ahead of our guidance across the board. And as a result, we're raising our revenue, operating income and earnings per share guidance for the year. Since tax is on everyone's mind, let's start there. 
We feel great about the product innovation that we delivered in TurboTax this year, as well as the results enabled by that innovation. As you know, there are 4 key drivers to our Consumer Tax business. The first driver is the number of returns filed with the IRS. The latest IRS data indicates that total returns were up about 1.5%. That was a bit stronger than we expected, so it was a modest tailwind. 
The second driver is the percentage of those returns filed using do-it-yourself software. This season, the category grew nearly 6% versus the assisted category which was up only slightly. This suggests that do-it-yourself software category gained more than 1 point of share again this year, driving more than 3 points of revenue growth for TuboTax. 
The third driver is TurboTax's share within the do-it-yourself software category. For the third consecutive year, we gained share within the category. In fact, this season, we gained more than 3 points of share, bringing our total software category share to roughly 65%. 
And the fourth driver is revenue per return. As you know, our goal is to grow customers faster than revenue, which yields a positive lifetime value payoff after tax situations grow more complex over time. Our strategy to gain share of the less complex returns continue to bear fruit, enabling unit growth of 12% overall, which was faster than our revenue growth of over 9%. With that said, our revenue growth for the segment far outpaced our original outlook of 5% to 7% at the beginning of the fiscal year. 
Bottom line, it was a very successful tax season for TurboTax. So what drove the performance? The answer is simple, an awesome, innovative product experience. But what's behind the awesome experience is not system. It is driven by deep data science and rigorous execution from a very talented TurboTax team. 
Now we began this multi-year journey 3 years ago to reimagine the tax breadth experience in support of a grand vision of taxes are done. And this season, we began to really see it pay off. We remain committed to continuing to invest and build on our competitive advantage, driving share gains for the category and for TurboTax. This season, our team more than tripled its pace of innovation, introducing over 20 new products improvement. We coupled this product innovation with a great demand generation campaign that really resonated. It doesn't take a genius to do your taxes. We made the complex simple, which when you get down to it, is what Intuit does everyday. 
Our seamless cloud-based experience drove increased mobile discovery and usage. Our mobile app downloads were up 85% versus last season and the number of completed returns through the mobile app and through mobile browsers doubled. This year, customers snapped 5 million photos of tax documents with mobile devices, that is up 4x greater than it was last year. This represented 25% of all the documents imported in the TurboTax, which saved time and reduce errors while delighting customers. 
We also continue to reimagine the entire product experience using data to help customers finish their taxes faster with increased confidence. For example, we broke down the Affordable Care Act into simple question and provide a new confidence building features like Explain Why and SmartLook. These innovations help reduce the tax prep time by 40% on average for our customers. We also delivered an excellent customer care experience and continue to invest in security, working with the industry and the government to protect our customers and to reduce fraud. 
On top of all of that product improvement, we continue to focus on serving an important segment that we feel is underserved and overcharged, the simple return segment. Absolute Zero give these taxpayers the most affordable option, a great product that cost them nothing. But Absolute Zero is just one of the reasons that we won this year. In fact, TurboTax gain share versus software competitors who match the Absolute Zero offer, and we even gained share at the end of season at full price. All in all, TurboTax grew unit double-digit and expanded share. We also grew revenue more than 9% and we improved margin in an already very profitable business. This was simply a great season for TurboTax.
Now let me shift to the ProTax business, which we recently rebranded as the ProConnect Group, given the strategic role this business play in our ecosystem. The ProConnect Group supports both of our strategic goals, to do the nation's taxes and to be the operating system behind small business success. In support of doing the nation's taxes, were doing just that. We grew individual returns about 1% in this business this year, which is faster than the overall assisted category group. New customers were a bit soft so we did a nice job of retention, leading to modest customer and return growth. 
Looking ahead, we're focused on growing the ProTax business in ways that are less reliant on price. We're leaning into the cloud with Intuit Tax Online, and we're innovating with new attached solutions like refund transfer and eSignature. We've got some work to do to drive faster adoption of these services, but we're optimistic about the future. 
The new name reflects ProConnect Group's expanded effort to support small business success. The more we connect our accountant customers with our small business customers, the more successful they all our and the healthier our ecosystem becomes. For example, we know QuickBooks Online retention is 11 points better when a small business works with an accountant. So you're tapping into our accountant network to make these connections. Nearly 600,000 QuickBooks Online subscribers are now linked to an accountant. That is up 70% versus last year. This all nets out to a strategic important, highly profitable business, albeit with a slower growth rate then TurboTax with a small business group. Neil will talk about our expectations in this business in a minute. 
With that overview of the tax side of the house, let's transition to Small Business. We continue to generate strong new user growth in our online ecosystem. Again, this quarter, more than 80% of QuickBooks Online customers were new to the Intuit franchise and total QuickBooks paying customer growth remain healthy. Year-to-date, across desktop and online, new customers are up 16%, which is an acceleration from last year. 
QuickBooks Online continue to build momentum. We grew total QuickBooks Online subscribers 45% in the third quarter. This resulted in the addition of 140,000 QBO subscribers in the quarter, bringing us to 1,397,000 paid subs worldwide at the end of April, which was ahead of our guidance. Roughly 75,000 of these QBO subscribers are using QuickBooks Self-Employed, which is up from 50,000 last quarter. 
Outside the U.S, QuickBooks Online grew roughly 60% to 255,000 paying subscribers. In total, we're executing well and we're on track to meet our subscriber targets for fiscal year 2016 and 2017. Also, it's important to note that revenue per customer is coming in a bit stronger than we expected so far this year. As we said at Investor Day, we're expecting to land at 2 million to 2.2 million QBO subs at the end of fiscal 2017. 
Now we're also improving customer retention, and we fully expect retention to continue to improve next year as more of our QBO customers are acquired through or worked with an accountant. Attached with payroll payments and third-party apps also improved retention, and we're building solid traction there as well. For example, we now have over 100,000 QuickBooks Online Accountant customers who have at least 3 of their own clients on QBO. That's more than double what it was a year ago. We now also have 2,500 third-party apps in our ecosystem. That's up from 1,100 a year ago and approximately 15% of QuickBooks Online customers are connecting to at least one third-party app, that's up from 9% a year ago. Payroll and payment, as you know, were drivers of retention and they also help drive revenue per customer. And the attach rates for these products remain healthy at 19% per payroll and 8% for payments. 
So that's the story at the high level. Our teams have driven significant innovation across all of our offering and has resulted in strong financial results for the quarter and for the year. So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Neil to walk you through the financial details."

For the third quarter of fiscal 2016, we delivered revenue of $2.3 billion, up 8%. This growth reflects the shift of approximately $30 million of Consumer Tax revenue from Q3 into Q2 relative to last season. We delivered non-GAAP operating income of $1.4 billion, up 11%. GAAP operating income of $1.3 billion, up 21%. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.43, up 20%. And GAAP earnings per share of $3.94, which reflects an after-tax gain of $0.67 per share on the divestiture of Quicken, QuickBase and Demandforce. 
Turning to the business segments. Total Small Business segment revenue increased 12% for the quarter. Small Business Online Ecosystem revenue grew approximately 24% for the quarter as customer acquisition and our online ecosystem continues to drive growth. QuickBooks Online subscribers grew 45%. Online active payments customers grew 6% and online payments charge volume grew 18%. Online Payroll customers grew 17%. Switching to the desktop side. Total desktop ecosystem revenue increased 8%. QuickBooks Desktop units were up 3% in the third quarter. And for the full year, we expect desktop units and revenue will be up slightly. 
I know it's been difficult to correlate the growth rate in QBO subscriptions to our online ecosystem revenue growth rate. Here are some detail on online revenue that should help with your modeling. In the third quarter, Online Payroll revenue grew 21% and online payment revenue grew 13%. About 40% of our Online Payroll customers are attached to QBO while 60% are not. We saw stand-alone Online Payroll through partners and accountants. This is a good profitable business, but one that grows much lower than payroll attached to QuickBooks online. The revenue mix is closer to 50-50. We expect payroll customers attached to QuickBooks Online to grow around 25% this year and revenue from those customers to grow nearly 40%. 
Now let's look at payments through the same lens.  The customer and revenue mix for attached to nonattached solutions is about 50, but the story is a little different. We are not currently focused on stand-alone payments, channels, like GoPayment and online processing that are not attached to QBO. The QBO attached business is growing very fast and the nonattached business is shrinking. We expect payments customers and revenue attached to QuickBooks Online to grow more than 50% this year. 
Consumer Tax revenue was up 7% versus the third quarter last year. And for the year, we expect Consumer Tax revenue growth of approximately 9%. As a reminder, third quarter Consumer Tax revenue reflects the shift from the third quarter to the second quarter, primarily driven by an extra weekend day in January of this year. 
One thing I'd like to call out as we start thinking about next season and next year's guidance. We're investing to improve the total TurboTax product experience, thus delivering the results you saw this season. This remains a high-margin business at over 60%. We remain focused on growing customers, gaining share and increasing profit dollars rather than margin expansion. 
Our ProConnect Group professional tax revenue was $126 million in the third quarter. For the fourth quarter, we expect ProConnect revenue to be approximately the same as in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. As Brad said, we're focused less on price on the ProTax side and investing in our accountant offerings to enhance growth in the QuickBooks Online ecosystem. We expect revenue to be roughly flat in fiscal 2017 with margins remaining above 60%. 
We continue to take a disciplined approach to capital management, investing the cash we generate in opportunities that yield an expected return on investment greater than 15% over 5 years. We repurchased $465 million of shares in the third quarter, and we have $435 million remaining on our authorization. Our cash investment balance was $1.6 billion at the end of the third quarter and our board approved a $0.30 dividend per share for our fiscal fourth quarter payable on July 18. This represents a 20% increase versus last year. Year-to-date, we returned nearly $2.5 billion in cash to our shareholders via share repurchases and dividends.
We provided guidance for the fourth quarter in our press release. We also raised our full year revenue, operating income and EPS guidance, and now expect revenue growth of 11% to 12% for the year. We've reiterated our full year fiscal 2016 guidance for QuickBooks Online subscribers. 
As we look forward to fiscal 2017, we're pleased that our trajectory is in line with the long-term customer and financial plans that we shared last year. Small Business and Consumer Tax remain quite healthy. We'll continue to invest in awesome products, security and customer care. The investments were making outside the U.S. will pay off over a longer-term horizon. Taking all this into consideration, I still believe that $4.30 is the best estimate of where non-GAAP EPS will come in next year. We'll share more when we provide fiscal 2017 guidance in August. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Brad to close."

In fact, what we're doing is we're expanding the total addressable market. I know that I've had a couple of shareholders ask we questions about the fact sheet we used to report years ago that included the number of desktop customers that run the last 3 years version. We don't report that in a more. And so there was a question of, hey, is that number actually decreasing faster than online subs are growing and are you losing customers? So I'll tell you what, we'll share some information at this moment that actually are subs that we used to publish just so everyone got the same data. If you take the total number of QuickBooks desktop customers and look at the ones that are on the last 3 years version, these are the active customers, and then you add to that to the online subscribers and the desktop subscribers, the total base is up 4%. That is the first time that base has grown in over a decade. If you then take that number and say how many actually paid us this year, they either bought a version of desktop in the last 12 months or they got us subscriber -- subscription from us, that number is up 20%. And then if you look at total new users, whether they bought desktop or online, that's up 16%. So no matter how you cut it, the headline is we're expanding TAM, we're growing our base, we're entering new markets and we feel very good that both the desktop and the online business are growing. 
And terms of desktop, the thing that we discovered as what we talked about on the last call. We have a group of customers that even with feature parity and even with pricing concession, do not want to move to the cloud right now. Either because their accountant isn't yet in the cloud or the small business just likes of the product the way they have it in they don't want to make the move. We want to make sure they remain active customers of Intuit and that they're buying payroll and payment services, so we want to give them delighted. So we're making sure that the desktop customers are happy. The cloud customers are happy and if those who want to move over, we want to make it easy for them to do that. So net-net, we have a very vibrant ecosystem right now. It's growing in total and the online subs for us actually was right on our expectations. I felt great about 45% growth. I feel good about the momentum we have in the countries outside the U.S. And most importantly, I love the fact that we're expanding TAM, both new countries as well as self-employed, which gives us a lot of runway for the future. So that's how we felt what the QuickBooks business overall."

So actually have, where should we be 1 year from now, 2 years from now, 3 yeas from now. In some cases, we pushed that number a little further out for strategic reason. In other cases, we say we think we can get the profitability a little bit sooner. But it truly is a country by country formula. And make no mistake, we see a lot of upside, and the #1 focus we have is expanding TAM and accelerating customer growth because we know lifetime value will come over time, we just want to make sure we're doing that prudently with the right cost to acquire."

First of all, thanks for the feedback on the quarter. Let me talk to tax first. The results you saw this year are the results of a multiyear investment we've been making in products and innovation, which is not easily matched by competition. I mentioned a couple of things in my opening talk track that even though we had success with Absolute Zero, we also had success when competitors match Absolute Zero and we were head-to-head and we took share, and also had success after Absolute Zero was done and we were at full price. What's happening right now is we are really making big advances towards taxes completely going away and having no friction for customers to get to the refund. And you heard me talk about this year, on average, customer spent 40% less time having to do their taxes. That is not sub that competition can match. Now at the same time, I'll tell you we have a lot of respect for our competition. We don't under estimate them and we know every year is going to be competitive. But I do believe that the team can continue to advance our product innovation and as a result continue to win more customers and take share? I do. That's the expectation we have of ourselves and that's the expectation we want to deliver for our customers as the product basically get them closer to taxes are done. So said another way, I don't buy the law of large numbers in our case. We're going to continue to work hard to get at that number. The second is QBO and acceleration. You're right, for us to deliver the 2 million to the 2.2 million subs growth, you're going to continue to see an acceleration in terms of the net adds we bring in on a quarterly basis. We fully know that and we continue to reinforce our confidence in that. And you may ask, why? Well, remember, one of the things we talked about when we gave that forecast is we needed to have total subs growth on a 40% compounded annual growth rate. Well, this quarter was 45%. The second thing is, while we've made some adjustments outside the U.S. and Canada and India, we've got a clear path of how to get those countries repositioned in a good way. U.K. and Australia are on fire, and we just brought on 2 new countries, Brazil and France. And so we believe with the expanding TAM and the fact that we're early innings in both self-employed and global as well as the fact that the U.S. grew in the mid-30s, we see our way to the to 2 million to the 2.2 million. We're not batting an eye and your math is correct, we think that is the doable."

And so if you actually look at it on an apples-to-apples basis, our attach rate remains very healthy compared to where it was a year ago. At the same time, we do see opportunities to continue to improve the attach rate. We are focused on first use, making sure we reduce the friction in the customer experience and continuing to get those services available outside the U.S. and the non-U.S. countries, which will allow us to bring that penetration and that attach rate up for the total base. So you're correct. We do think that there's still opportunity there. We're working on it hard. But one of the things you have to look at right now in the absolute numbers is keep in mind that last quarter we had 50,000 QBO self-employed. This quarter, we had 75,000. And that number doesn't come with payroll and payment opportunities today. And so that basically makes the attach rates look the way they do. The other thing I would say about the ability to improve the revenue, the ecosystem in addition to attach is obviously, we've shared with you in the past, we have customers that come in at first year on a promotional pricing period. When they hit the 13th month, that average revenue per customer for that unit goes up about 50%, and we're going to have customers rolling off that promotional pricing period, and that's going to help us bring revenue up. The last seesaw adds -- so in addition to attach rate and moving off of promotional pricing is retention. A year ago, we would talk to you about attention in the low- to mid-70s. We now talk to you in QBO about retention in the high 70s and starting to tickle the low 80s. And every point of retention adds a net 15,000 subs. And so that number is also a lever that we continue to improve, and we've improved it significantly over the last 12 months. So those are the pieces, Kash. I know there's a lot of math in there. Those are the pieces the kind of lead us to the confidence we have in the actual online ecosystem revenue. It is attach rates. It is retention, and it is rolling off the promotional pricing."

This is one of those mindset things. It's hard in management to say, what is the limitation. So we actually looked at the number of people that are paying employees and saying, we should have 100% of them as we're using QBO. And how many are accepting a credit card, and we should say, hey, we should have 100% of them. We know right now about half of small businesses accept payments, and so we think that number is a good aspirational goal. Somewhere between here and there is reality, but right now, I'd hate to limit our potential by putting a number out there that our employees think is, okay, the best we can be. Payroll for us is -- typically we say about 40% to 50% of desktop customers. Since right now, our QBO feature functionality is a little more service-oriented, I'd say somewhere in the 30% to 40% is the sort of the near-term, but I think over time, you're looking at half of the base using payroll as well."

I'll start with, it was just a short time ago in the fall at Investor Day when we removed the original target of 2 million subs, which was the original outlook for 2017. And we raised it to 2 to 2.2 million. And we said, hey, that's a new goal, and that was about 9 months ago, not even 9 months ago. And then from there, of course, we've been accelerating. And so to do that, we have to deliver 40% plus CAGR. And we've been above that number. And so we actually are achieving the outcomes that we set for ourselves internally. Now along the way, we've had some learning. La Motte, Canada, as you know, we found out that we were selling units through retail and then they weren't entertaining at the levels we expected them to. And so we shut down that channel. I would tell you that Canada PIVOT is now behind us, and the momentum is rebuilding in Canada, and we feel very good about the Canada outlook right now. The other area was India. And India's where we didn't take the time to localize the product and get all the compliance features at the levels that an accountant would have confidence to recommend it. As a result, they were recommending our product in conjunction with another product, and it was becoming companion app. We did not want that to be the brand, and so we have now stopped that. We've actually been finalizing the product, localization and we're now starting to go direct to small businesses while we'd get back out to accountants and let them know the new version. That one's not as far along as Canada, but we're already seeing the progress in India as well. The last 2 are the new countries, Brazil, which is now ported, it's acquisition we did a year ago called ZeroPaper, reporting over on the QBO, and we're starting to accelerate there. And then France, we just did general release. So when you put that together, U.S. remained strong, self-employed is opening a new market, Canada's back on track, India has made us turn, Brazil and France are ramping up and the U.K. and Australia remain gang busters. And so we feel good about our 2 million to 2.2 million. I understand there's a little bit, if you have to have faith and confidence, if you just take a look at what we've delivered so far. But I hope that we can demonstrate through the first quarter, the second quarter that we're going to be on track to deliver those numbers because we certainly feel good about them or we wouldn't reiterate the guidance."

I know you're a busy man out there traveling and appreciate your dialing in. Let me start with QBO for a minute, core U.S. I think one of the things that we're working hard to help everybody understand inside the company and outside is last year, when we introduced QuickBooks Self-Employed, we actually eliminated the low end SKU in QuickBooks Online, which was called QuickBooks Online Simple Start. And so we always use account QuickBooks Online Simple Start as the core QuickBooks Online product lineup because there is a low-end customer who, quite frankly, was over-served by that product. And we shut it down and replaced it with QuickBooks Self-Employed. So I think it's a little bit of a misnomer to say, pullout Self-Employed and just tell us how the rest of QuickBooks Online is growing. But the would be similar to saying, pullout out TurboTax Deluxe and just look at the rest of the product lineup. I think it is -- something we all have to get our head around is, it is a part of the core product lineup and honestly, it's expanding TAM. There's 30 million to 50 million people in that space that the original QuickBooks Self-Employed or Simple Start didn't serve. So I think that would be the first thing, and I just want to make sure that you know that's how we look at it. Now when you back that out and say how is the QuickBooks Online core U.S. business growing, what I like about it is that it's doing exactly what we wanted it to do. It's expanding TAM. So the desktop customers are still growing. QBO, 80% of the customers are new to the franchise. They've never used QuickBooks or Accounting before. Self-Employed is going after a category that they could have never been served before with the old QuickBooks Online Simple Start, and you put it all together and in the U.S., that number is, without Self-Employed, growing in the mid-30s, which is a very healthy number. But if you add back in Self-Employed since we used to have Simple Start in there, the number's even better. So that would be the way we look at it in terms of core, and I do think there's continued opportunity to keep that healthy above 30% and even potentially accelerate it as we get wiser about how to market the Self-Employed product. So that's on the Self-Employed side. On the Accountant side, you're actually right. This business is strategic. We've known for years 2 realities about the accountants being involved in a Small Business choice. The first is the success rate of the Small Business goes up 89% if they work with an accountant. The second is over half of all accounting, payroll and payment decisions are made because the accountants influence them and told them to buy it. So they are a tremendous decision-making advocate for our products. The third piece is the piece that we talked about today in the opening points. If the accountant is working with a Small Business, the retention of QuickBooks Online goes up 1,100 basis points, 11 points. And the point of retention is incredible for us in our subs business. So the importance of the accountant has never been more critical as we move the SaaS, and we also think they're going to be the catalyst to get a lot of these customers to adopt the cloud, which is why we're leaning in so heavily with QuickBooks Online for accountants. So that's sort of the summary on the Accountant side and I hope will also help the -- clear up a little bit about how we look at core QBO, especially as it relates to Simple Start -- or Self-Employed, I'm sorry. I got the old term in there, Matt."

So we didn't have any variation that said, hey, this was all the result of this. And then you step back and say, well, what drove that. But when you look at it this year, the team put out 3x, 3x more the product innovation than we did last year. Over 20 new product, feature functionality and innovations were put into the product. And that was a really good campaigns that I think resonated. Where people really felt more self empowered was what actually drove our competitor advantage this year. And so that's really the TurboTax piece. In terms of ACA and fraud, we've been pretty consistent on ACA. It's just the next piece of legislation that's been introduced by government that causes people to say, uh-oh, this is complicated, and our job is to say, no, you're capable of doing it, we'll make it simple. And we worked really hard for 3 years to do that and the Affordable Care Act has not been a headwind at all. In fact, it's been one of the highest converting aspects of our website. In terms of fraud, we'll have a summit again in the summertime with the rest of the industry and the IRS commissioner. But I think we all collectively feel good that we made big advances this year as an industry. And we think that those advances will continue as we look ahead to next year, and we remain committed to getting bad actors out of the U.S. tax system."

What we're seeing right now is there's a very delighted group of QuickBooks Desktop customers. And when we try creative things like raising the price on them, lowering the price on the cloud, getting feature parity, that didn't move them. All it did was cost them to delay purchasing the newest version of QuickBooks Desktop. So then, we went back and we tested some pricing promotions. It's not an every day low price. We just advertised at the price that it used to be before we raised it. And sure enough, those customers went out and bought the newer version of QuickBooks Desktop. So the good news is, they're staying with us. They're not going anywhere, and they're not hurting QuickBooks Online subscribers. So really, what we're doing now is we're making sure that we keep those customers happy. We continue to expose them to attach services, like payroll and payments, and we continue to let them know that there's a cloud-based version that's great for them should they ever decide to move. But our hope right now is that we keep them in the franchise, regardless of which product they choose."

I want to be wary of sharing any of our pricing decisions too far in advance because obviously, we have competition that would love to know the answers to those questions. But that being said, we have a tailwind and our tailwind is, as you know, we offer a promotional discount in the first 30 days or sometimes the first 90 days for someone to come into QuickBooks Online. They'll begin to use it for free then they'll get a discount of like 30% then they work their way up to full price. And imagine the large base of net adds we've been putting in that will anniversary off of that as a 13th month and then we'll basically become full price at a roughly $24, $25 a month. And we have a nice tailwind to that base that's going to be rolling off that promotional pricing. So what you should expect in '17 and going into '18 is continuing improvement in average revenue per customer. Now this is where Neil's answer a few minutes ago comes into play. We've got 3 cohorts of customers. We have QuickBooks Online U.S., QuickBooks Online non-U.S. and of course, they have -- the mix effect of QuickBooks Self-Employed. All of those are actually getting stronger every 90 days in terms of average revenue per customer. But depending upon which one of those grows the fastest, it can actually bring the blended mix down a little bit, but we would tell you, we look at it on a marginal contribution basis for each of those cohorts, and all of them are getting better and will continue to get better in '17 and '18."

We just made some decisions last week to continue to invest and building out feature parity to get it up to premiere and eventually the QuickBooks Enterprise level. That will be a multi-year journey. But I will put into context for you, no, we don't have those advanced inventory capabilities today. We have foundational inventory, which is different than it was 6 months ago, and it's getting stronger every day, but it's not advanced yet. We don't have the job costing in there yet. But I think it's important for us to kind of think about of the 3.5 million desktop customers we have today, 2.5 million do have feature parity. 2.5 million could move over tomorrow if that was the only decision they were waiting on. And as we know, we've moved about 100,000 over to the first 3 quarters of this year. That's up 22% last year, but that's not 2.5 million. So we're going to continue to build up feature parity. We think that's important for the long term. We're going to continue to try to get the accountant to encourage the desktop customer to look at the cloud, and we'll continue to do things like promotional pricing.

As you already know, we had an outstanding tax season. We're also pleased with our performance in Small Business.

As you already know, we had an outstanding tax season. We're also pleased with our performance in Small Business. At the company level in our fiscal third quarter, we came in ahead of our guidance across the board. And as a result, we're raising our revenue, operating income and earnings per share guidance for the year. Since tax is on everyone's mind, let's start there. 
We feel great about the product innovation that we delivered in TurboTax this year as well as the results enabled by that innovation. As you know, there are 4 key drivers to our Consumer Tax business. The first driver is the number of returns filed with the IRS. The latest IRS data indicates that total returns were up about 1.5%. That was a bit stronger than we expected, so it was a modest tailwind. 
The second driver is the percentage of those returns filed using do-it-yourself software. This season, the category grew nearly 6% versus the assisted category which was up only slightly. This suggests the do-it-yourself software category gained more than 1 point of share again this year, driving more than 3 points of revenue growth for TurboTax. 
The third driver is TurboTax's share within the do-it-yourself software category. For the third consecutive year, we gained share within the category. In fact, this season, we gained more than 3 points of share, bringing our total software category share to roughly 65%. 
And the fourth driver is revenue per return. As you know, our goal is to grow customers faster than revenue, which yields a positive lifetime value payoff as their tax situations grow more complex over time. Our strategy to gain share of the less complex returns continued to bear fruit, enabling unit growth of 12% overall, which was faster than our revenue growth of over 9%. With that said, our revenue growth for the segment far outpaced our original outlook of 5% to 7% at the beginning of the fiscal year. 
Bottom line, it was a very successful tax season for TurboTax. So what drove the performance? The answer is simple, an awesome, innovative product experience. But what's behind the awesome experience is not so simple. It is driven by deep data science and rigorous execution from a very talented TurboTax team. 
Now we began this multi-year journey 3 years ago to reimagine the tax prep experience in support of a grand vision of taxes are done. And this season, we began to really see it pay off. We remain committed to continuing to invest and build on our competitive advantage, driving share gains for the category and for TurboTax. This season, our team more than tripled its pace of innovation, introducing over 20 new product improvements. We coupled this product innovation with a great demand generation campaign that really resonated: It doesn't take a genius to do your taxes. We made the complex simple, which when you get down to it, is what Intuit does every day. 
Our seamless cloud-based experience drove increased mobile discovery and usage. Our mobile app downloads were up 85% versus last season and the number of completed returns through the mobile app and through mobile browsers doubled. This year, customers snapped 5 million photos of tax documents with mobile devices, that is up 4x greater than it was last year. This represented 25% of all the documents imported into TurboTax, which saved time and reduced errors while delighting customers. 
We also continue to reimagine the entire product experience using data to help customers finish their taxes faster with increased confidence. For example, we broke down the Affordable Care Act into simple questions and provided new confidence-building features like Explain Why and SmartLook. These innovations helped reduce the tax prep time by 40% on average for our customers. We also delivered an excellent customer care experience and continued to invest in security, working with the industry and the government to protect our customers and to reduce fraud. 
On top of all of that product improvement, we continue to focus on serving an important segment that we feel is underserved and overcharged, the simple return segment. Absolute Zero gives these taxpayers the most affordable option, a great product that cost them nothing. But Absolute Zero is just one of the reasons that we won this year. In fact, TurboTax gained share versus software competitors who matched the Absolute Zero offer, and we even gained share at the end of season at full price. All in all, TurboTax grew units double-digits and expanded share. We also grew revenue more than 9% and we improved margin in an already very profitable business. This was simply a great season for TurboTax.
Now let me shift to the ProTax business, which we recently rebranded as the ProConnect Group, given the strategic role this business plays in our ecosystem. The ProConnect Group supports both of our strategic goals, to do the nation's taxes and to be the operating system behind small business success. In support of doing the nation's taxes, we're doing just that. We grew individual returns about 1% in this business this year, which is faster than the overall assisted category group. New customers were a bit soft, though we did a nice job with retention, leading to modest customer and return growth. 
Looking ahead, we're focused on growing the ProTax business in ways that are less reliant on price. We're leaning into the cloud with Intuit Tax Online, and we're innovating with new attached solutions like refund transfer and eSignature. We've got some work to do to drive faster adoption of these services, but we're optimistic about the future. 
The new name reflects ProConnect Group's expanded efforts to support small business success. The more we connect our accountant customers with our small business customers, the more successful they all are and the healthier our ecosystem becomes. For example, we know QuickBooks Online retention is 11 points better when a small business works with an accountant. So we're tapping into our accountant network to make these connections. Nearly 600,000 QuickBooks Online subscribers are now linked to an accountant. That is up 70% versus last year. This all nets out to a strategically important, highly profitable business, albeit with a slower growth rate than TurboTax for the small business group. Neil will talk about our expectations in this business in a minute. 
With that overview on the tax side of the house, let's transition to Small Business. We continue to generate strong new user growth in our online ecosystem. Again, this quarter, more than 80% of QuickBooks Online customers were new to the Intuit franchise and total QuickBooks paying customer growth remain healthy. Year-to-date, across desktop and online, new customers are up 16%, which is an acceleration from last year. 
QuickBooks Online continued to build momentum. We grew total QuickBooks Online subscribers 45% in the third quarter. This resulted in the addition of 140,000 QBO subscribers in the quarter, bringing us to 1,397,000 paid subs worldwide at the end of April, which was ahead of our guidance. Roughly 75,000 of those QBO subscribers are using QuickBooks Self-Employed, which is up from 50,000 last quarter. 
Outside the U.S, QuickBooks Online grew roughly 60% to 255,000 paying subscribers. In total, we're executing well and we're on track to meet our subscriber targets for fiscal year 2016 and 2017. Also, it's important to note that revenue per customer is coming in a bit stronger than we expected so far this year. As we said at Investor Day, we're expecting to land at 2 million to 2.2 million QBO subs at the end of fiscal 2017. 
Now we're also improving customer retention, and we fully expect retention to continue to improve next year as more of our QBO customers are acquired through or work with an accountant. Attach of payroll, payments and third-party apps also improves retention, and we're building solid traction there as well. For example, we now have over 100,000 QuickBooks Online Accountant customers who have at least 3 of their own clients on QBO. That's more than double what it was a year ago. We now also have 2,500 third-party apps in our ecosystem. That's up from 1,100 a year ago and approximately 15% of QuickBooks Online customers are connecting to at least one third-party app, that's up from 9% a year ago. Payroll and payment, as you know, are drivers of retention and they also help drive revenue per customer. And the attach rates for these products remain healthy at 19% for payroll and 8% for payments. 
So that's the story at the high level. Our teams have driven significant innovation across all of our offerings and it's resulted in strong financial results for the quarter and for the year. So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Neil to walk you through the financial details."

For the third quarter of fiscal 2016, we delivered revenue of $2.3 billion, up 8%.

GAAP operating income of $1.3 billion, up 21%. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.43, up 20%. And GAAP earnings per share of $3.94, which reflects an after-tax gain of $0.67 per share on the divestiture of Quicken, QuickBase and Demandforce. 
Turning to the business segments. Total Small Business segment revenue increased 12% for the quarter. Small Business Online Ecosystem revenue grew approximately 24% for the quarter as customer acquisition and our online ecosystem continues to drive growth. QuickBooks Online subscribers grew 45%. Online active payments customers grew 6% and online payments charge volume grew 18%. Online Payroll customers grew 17%. Switching to the desktop side. Total desktop ecosystem revenue increased 8%. QuickBooks Desktop units were up 3% in the third quarter, and for the full year we expect desktop units and revenue will be up slightly. 
I know it's been difficult to correlate the growth rate in QBO subscriptions to our online ecosystem revenue growth rate. Here's some detail on online revenue that should help with your modeling. In the third quarter, Online Payroll revenue grew 21% and online payments revenue grew 13%. About 40% of our Online Payroll customers are attached to QBO while 60% are not. We sell stand-alone Online Payroll through partners and accountants. This is a good profitable business, but one that grows much slower than payroll attached to QuickBooks online. The revenue mix is closer to 50-50. We expect payroll customers attached to QuickBooks Online to grow around 25% this year and revenue from those customers to grow nearly 40%. 
Now let's look at payments through the same lens.  The customer and revenue mix for attached and nonattached solutions is about 50-50, but the story is a little different. We are not currently focused on stand-alone payments channels, like GoPayment and online processing that are not attached to QBO. The QBO attached business is growing very fast and the nonattached business is shrinking. We expect payments customers and revenue attached to QuickBooks Online to grow more than 50% this year. 
Consumer Tax revenue was up 7% versus the third quarter last year. And for the year, we expect Consumer Tax revenue growth of approximately 9%. As a reminder, third quarter Consumer Tax revenue reflects the shift from the third quarter to the second quarter, primarily driven by an extra weekend day in January this year. 
One thing I'd like to call out as we start thinking about next season and next year's guidance. We're investing to improve the total TurboTax product experience, thus delivering the results you saw this season. This remains a high-margin business at over 60%. We remain focused on growing customers, gaining share and increasing profit dollars rather than margin expansion. 
Our ProConnect Group professional tax revenue was $126 million in the third quarter. For the fourth quarter, we expect ProConnect revenue to be approximately the same as in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. As Brad said, we're focused less on price on the ProTax side and investing in our accountant offerings to enhance growth in the QuickBooks Online ecosystem. We expect revenue to be roughly flat in fiscal 2017 with margins remaining above 60%. 
We continue to take a disciplined approach to capital management, investing the cash we generate in opportunities that yield an expected return on investment greater than 15% over 5 years. We repurchased $465 million of shares in the third quarter, and we have $435 million remaining on our authorization. Our cash and investment balance was $1.6 billion at the end of the third quarter and our board approved a $0.30 dividend per share for our fiscal fourth quarter payable on July 18. This represents a 20% increase versus last year. Year-to-date, we've returned nearly $2.5 billion in cash to our shareholders via share repurchases and dividends.
We provided guidance for the fourth quarter in our press release. We also raised our full year revenue, operating income and EPS guidance, and now expect revenue growth of 11% to 12% for the year. We've reiterated our full year fiscal 2016 guidance for QuickBooks Online subscribers. 
As we look forward to fiscal 2017, we're pleased that our trajectory is in line with the long-term customer and financial plans that we shared last year. Small Business and Consumer Tax remain quite healthy. We'll continue to invest in awesome products, security and customer care. The investments we're making outside the U.S. will pay off over a longer-term horizon. Taking all this into consideration, I still believe that $4.30 is the best estimate of where non-GAAP EPS will come in next year. We'll share more when we provide fiscal 2017 guidance in August. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Brad to close."

Now before I close, I'd like to share a few words about our dear friend, Bill Campbell. Personally and professionally, Bill's larger than life persona, his colorful language, his brilliance and his leadership stretched from coast-to-coast. Respected by all as the coach, his influence shaped men and women from football fields to corporate board rooms and to his table at the Old Pro sports bar in Palo Alto, California. He was indeed one-of-a-kind and while Bill can never be replaced, he will always be remembered. 
So with that, let's turn it over to you to hear what's on your mind. Latif?"

In fact, what we're doing is we're expanding the total addressable market. I know that I've had a couple of shareholders ask we questions about the fact sheet we used to report years ago that included the number of desktop customers that were on the last 3 years version. We don't report that any more. And so there was a question of, hey, is that number actually decreasing faster than online subs are growing and are you losing customers? So I'll tell you what, we'll share some information at this moment that actually is stuff that we used to publish just so everyone's got the same data. If you take the total number of QuickBooks desktop customers and look at the ones that are on the last 3 years version, these are the active customers, and then you add to that to the online subscribers and the desktop subscribers, the total base is up 4%. That is the first time that base has grown in over a decade. If you then take that number and say how many actually paid us this year, they either bought a version of desktop in the last 12 months or they got a subscriber -- a subscription from us, that number is up 20%. And then if you look at total new users, whether they bought desktop or online, that's up 16%. So no matter how you cut it, the headline is we're expanding TAM, we're growing our base, we're entering new markets and we feel very good that both the desktop and the online business are growing. 
In terms of desktop, the thing that we discovered is what we talked about on the last call. We have a group of customers that even with feature parity and even with pricing concessions, do not want to move to the cloud right now. Either because their accountant isn't yet in the cloud or the small business just likes the product the way they have it and they don't want to make the move. We want to make sure they remain active customers of Intuit and that they're buying payroll and payment services, so we want to give them delighted. So we're making sure that the desktop customers are happy. The cloud customers are happy and of those who want to move over, we want to make it easy for them to do that. So net-net, we have a very vibrant ecosystem right now. It's growing in total and the online subs for us, actually, was right on our expectations. I felt great about 45% growth. I feel good about the momentum we have in the countries outside the U.S. And most importantly, I love the fact that we're expanding TAM, both new countries as well as self-employed, which gives us a lot of runway for the future. So that's how we felt about the QuickBooks business overall."

In other cases, we say we think we can get the profitability a little bit sooner. But it truly is a country-by-country formula. And make no mistake, we see a lot of upside, and the #1 focus we have is expanding TAM and accelerating customer growth because we know lifetime value will come over time, we just want to make sure we're doing that prudently with the right cost to acquire."

First of all, thanks for the feedback on the quarter. Let me talk to tax first. The results you saw this year are the result of a multiyear investment we've been making in products and innovation, which is not easily matched by competition. I mentioned a couple of things in my opening talk track that even though we had success with Absolute Zero, we also had success when competitors matched Absolute Zero and we were head-to-head and we took share, and also had success after Absolute Zero was done and we were at full price. What's happening right now is we are really making big advances towards taxes completely going away and having no friction for customers to get to the refund. And you heard me talk about this year, on average, customers spent 40% less time having to do their taxes. That is not stuff that competition can match. Now at the same time, I'll tell you we have a lot of respect for our competition. We don't underestimate them and we know every year is going to be competitive. But do I believe that the team can continue to advance our product innovation and as a result continue to win more customers and take share? I do. That's the expectation we have of ourselves, and that's the expectation we want to deliver for our customers is a product that basically get them closer to taxes are done. So said another way, I don't buy the law of large numbers in our case. We're going to continue to work hard to get at that number. The second is QBO and acceleration. You're right, for us to deliver the 2 million to the 2.2 million subs growth, you're going to continue to see an acceleration in terms of the net adds we bring in on a quarterly basis. We fully know that, and we continue to reinforce our confidence in that. And you may ask, why? Well, remember, one of the things we talked about when we gave that forecast is we needed to have total subs growth on a 40% compounded annual growth rate. Well, this quarter was 45%. The second thing is, while we've made some adjustments outside the U.S. and Canada and India, we've got a clear path to how to get those countries repositioned in a good way. U.K. and Australia are on fire, and we just brought on 2 new countries, Brazil and France. And so we believe with the expanding TAM and the fact that we're early innings in both self-employed and global as well as the fact that the U.S. grew in the mid-30s, we see our way to the 2 million to the 2.2 million. We're not batting an eye and your math is correct, we think that is the doable."

And it's a little surprising that you're QBO-based business, although it's larger than payroll and payment, it's actually growing faster and adding more new dollars than the other 2 businesses. Can you help us understand when could we see the inflection point where the attach rate starts to inflect pretty materially that you could realize your growth objectives, which I'm sure are pretty aggressive with respect to payments and payroll? It seems to me there's something limiting these attach rates from going potentially very high. I'm sure that you've thought through this as much as anybody else, but I just wanted to get your perspective."

I'd say, first of all, at face value, the one thing we have to keep in mind is we have a growing base of self-employed customers in the QBO numbers. And so those self-employed customers, by definition, don't have employees so they don't need payroll, and many times they're driving for Uber or Lyft or somebody else and they don't need payments. And so if you actually look at it on an apples-to-apples basis, our attach rate remains very healthy compared to where it was a year ago. At the same time, we do see opportunities to continue to improve the attach rate. We are focused on first use, making sure we reduce the friction in the customer experience and continuing to get those services available outside the U.S. in the non-U.S. countries, which will allow us to bring that penetration and that attach rate up for the total base. So you're correct. We do think that there's still opportunity there. We're working on it hard. But one of the things you have to look at right now in the absolute numbers is keep in mind that last quarter we had 50,000 QBO self-employed. This quarter, we had 75,000. And that number doesn't come with payroll and payment opportunities today. And so that basically makes the attach rates look the way they do. The other thing I would say about the ability to improve the revenue, the ecosystem, in addition to attach, is obviously we've shared with you in the past we have customers that come in that first year on a promotional pricing period. When they hit the 13th month, that average revenue per customer for that unit goes up about 50%, and we're going to have customers rolling off that promotional pricing period, and that's going to help us bring revenue up. The last seesaw adds -- so in addition to attach rates and moving off of promotional pricing is retention. A year ago, we would talk to you about attention in the low- to mid-70s. We now talk to you in QBO about retention in the high 70s and starting to tickle the low 80s. And every point of retention adds a net 15,000 subs. And so that number is also a lever that we continue to improve, and we've improved it significantly over the last 12 months. So those are the pieces, Kash. I know there's a lot of math in there. Those are the pieces the kind of lead us to the confidence we have in the actual online ecosystem revenue. It is attach rates. It is retention, and it is rolling off the promotional pricing."

And how many are accepting a credit card, and we should say, hey, we should have 100% of them. We know right now about 1/2 of small businesses accept payments, and so we think that number is a good aspirational goal. Somewhere between here and there is reality, but right now, I'd hate to limit our potential by putting a number out there that our employees think is, okay, the best we can be. Payroll for us is, typically, we say about 40% to 50% of desktop customers. Since right now, our QBO feature functionality is a little more service-oriented, I'd say somewhere in the 30s to 40s is the sort of the near-term, but I think over time, you're looking at half of the base using payroll as well."

And we raised it to 2 to 2.2 million. And we said, hey, that's a new goal, and that was about 9 months ago, not even 9 months ago. And then from there, of course, we've been accelerating. And so to do that, we have to deliver 40% plus CAGR. And we've been above that number. And so we actually are achieving the outcomes that we set for ourselves internally. Now along the way, we've had some learning. One was [ph] Canada. As you know, we found out that we were selling units through retail and then they weren't retaining at the levels we expected them to. And so we shut down that channel. I will tell you that Canada pivot is now behind us, and the momentum is rebuilding in Canada, and we feel very good about the Canada outlook right now. The other area was India. And India's where we didn't take the time to localize the product and get all the compliance features at the level that an accountant would have confidence to recommend it. As a result, they were recommending our product in conjunction with another product, and it was becoming a companion app. We did not want that to be the brand, and so we have now stopped that. We've actually been finalizing the product localization, and we're now starting to go direct to small businesses while we get back out to accountants and let them know the new version. That one's not as far along as Canada, but we're already seeing the progress in India as well. The last 2 are the new countries, Brazil, which has now ported its acquisition we did a year ago called ZeroPaper, we're porting over onto QBO, and we're starting to accelerate there. And then France, we just did general release. So when you put that together, U.S. remained strong, self-employed is opening a new market, Canada's back on track, India has made its turn, Brazil and France are ramping up and the U.K. and Australia remain gangbusters. And so we feel good about our 2 million to 2.2 million. I understand there's a little bit of you have to have faith and confidence, if you just take a look at what we've delivered so far. But I hope that we can demonstrate through the first quarter, the second quarter that we're going to be on track to deliver those numbers because we certainly feel good about them or we wouldn't reiterate the guidance."

The first is, when we look at the core U.S. subs ex international and self-employed, the net adds have sort of flattened a little bit here in the last couple of quarters. And I'm just curious, as we think forward, especially towards the 2 million to 2.2 million goal, would you expect that the, call it, core domestic sub adds would sort of reaccelerate again? Or I'd love your sort of thoughts around that. And then the second question is, you had the BDO announcement and you talked about the QBOA, the kind of importance of the accounting channel. Maybe you could just restate the importance there. It sounds like it has implications for churn and other aspects here. So I'd love to get your quotes or color there."

I know you're a busy man out there traveling and appreciate you dialing in. Let me start with QBO for a minute, core U.S. I think one of the things that we're working hard to help everybody understand inside the company and outside is last year, when we introduced QuickBooks Self-Employed, we actually eliminated the low-end SKU in QuickBooks Online, which was called QuickBooks Online Simple Start. And so we always use to count QuickBooks Online Simple Start as the core QuickBooks Online product lineup because there is a low-end customer who, quite frankly, was over-served by that product. And we shut it down and replaced it with QuickBooks Self-Employed. So I think it's a little bit of a misnomer to say, pullout Self-Employed and just tell us how the rest of QuickBooks Online is growing. Because that would be similar to saying, pullout out TurboTax Deluxe and just look at the rest of the product lineup. I think it is -- something we all have to get our head around is, it is a part of the core product lineup and, honestly, it's expanding TAM. There's 30 million to 50 million people in that space that the original QuickBooks Self-Employed -- or Simple Start didn't serve. So I think that would be the first thing, and I just want to make sure that you know that's how we look at it. Now when you back that out and say how is the QuickBooks Online core U.S. business growing, what I like about it is that it's doing exactly what we wanted it to do. It's expanding TAM. So the desktop customers are still growing. QBO, 80% of the customers are new to the franchise. They've never used QuickBooks or Accounting before. Self-Employed is going after a category that they could have never been served before with the old QuickBooks Online Simple Start, and you put it all together and in the U.S., that number is, without Self-Employed, growing in the mid-30s, which is a very healthy number. But if you add back in Self-Employed since we used to have Simple Start in there, the number's even better. So that would be the way we look at it in terms of core, and I do think there's continued opportunity to keep that healthy above 30% and even, potentially, accelerate it as we get wiser about how to market the Self-Employed product. So that's on the Self-Employed side. On the Accountant side, you're absolutely right. This business is strategic. We've known for years 2 realities about the accountants being involved in a Small Business choice. The first is the success rate of the Small Business goes up 89% if they work with an accountant. The second is over half of all accounting, payroll and payment decisions are made because the accountants influence them and told them to buy it. So they are a tremendous decision-making advocate for our products. The third piece is the piece that we talked about today in the opening points. If the accountant is working with a Small Business, the retention of QuickBooks Online goes up 1,100 basis points, 11 points. And a point of retention is incredible for us in our subs business. So the importance of the accountant has never been more critical as we move to SaaS. And we also think they're going to be the catalyst to get a lot of these customers to adopt the cloud, which is why we're leaning in so heavily with QuickBooks Online for accountants. So that's sort of the summary on the Accountant side and I hope also helped clear up a little bit about how we look at core QBO, especially as it relates to Simple Start -- or Self-Employed, I'm sorry. I got the old term in there, Matt."

In terms of elaborating on TurboTax, as you know, the full season and we've picked up a little over 3 points a share. As you look at it in pieces and parts, sort of early season, what happened in the core season while Absolute Zero was an offering and then what happened at the end of season when Absolute Zero stops being offered by us. Although one of our competitors continued to offer a version of it out there, and we went back to full price. We took equal parts share throughout the season. So we didn't have any variation that said, hey, this was all the result of this. And then you step back and say, well, what drove that. But when you look at it this year, the team put out 3x, 3x more the product innovation than we did last year. Over 20 new product feature functionality and innovations were put into the product. And that plus a really good campaign that I think resonated, where people really felt more self-empowered, was what actually drove our competitive advantage this year. And so that's really the TurboTax piece. In terms of ACA and fraud, we've been pretty consistent on ACA. It's just the next piece of legislation that's been introduced by government that causes people to say, uh-oh, this is complicated. And our job is to say, no, you're capable of doing it, we'll make it simple. And we worked really hard for 3 years to do that and the Affordable Care Act has not been a headwind at all. In fact, it's been one of the highest converting aspects of our website. In terms of fraud, we'll have a summit again in the summertime with the rest of the industry and the IRS commissioner. But I think we all, collectively, feel good that we made big advances this year as an industry. And we think that those advances will continue as we look ahead to next year, and we remain committed to getting bad actors out of the U.S. tax system."

And we tend to see -- move on the top side. We are looking to invest and make the product better every day, both in Small Business and in Consumer Tax. As you can imagine, this time of year we have a lot of ideas, a lot of suggestions for ways to take advantage of that expanded addressable market that Brad mentioned and to grow the product faster. We're running tests and we're running experiments now to determine which of those we think would have the biggest impact next year, both in Small Business and in Consumer Tax. We consider the markets that we're in. We've talked about some adjustments we've made to some of our markets outside the U.S. already.

And just as we're learning in TurboTax, we can use machine learning and data science to look for more creative ways to expose them to these kinds of offers. And so I have to tell you, TurboTax has been leading the way in using data as a way to attach products and services. And we're now bringing that same level of rigor to the QuickBooks Online team, and we're trying to use that as a way to improve the attach rates for payroll and payments as well. We're early days, but we think there's a lot of opportunity there.

We just advertised at the price that it used to be before we raised it. And sure enough, those customers went out and bought the newer version of QuickBooks Desktop. So the good news is, they're staying with us. They're not going anywhere, and they're not hurting QuickBooks Online subscribers.

They'll begin to use it for free, then they'll get a discount of like 30%, then they work their way up to full price. And imagine the large base of net adds we've been putting in that will anniversary off of that at the 13th month and then we'll basically become full price at a roughly $24, $25 a month. And we have a nice tailwind to that base that's going to be rolling off that promotional pricing.

We've got 3 cohorts of customers. We have QuickBooks Online U.S., QuickBooks Online non-U.S. and of course, the mix effect of QuickBooks Self-Employed.

We have foundational inventory, which is different than it was 6 months ago, and it's getting stronger every day, but it's not advanced yet. We don't have the job costing in there yet. But I think it's important for us to kind of think about: of the 3.5 million desktop customers we have today, 2.5 million do have feature parity. 2.5 million could move over tomorrow if that was the only decision they were waiting on. And as we know, we've moved about 100,000 over to the first 3 quarters of this year. That's up 22% last year, but that's not 2.5 million. So we're going to continue to build up feature parity.

As you already know, we had an outstanding tax season. We're also pleased with our performance in Small Business. At the company level in our fiscal third quarter, we came in ahead of our guidance across the board. And as a result, we're raising our revenue, operating income and earnings per share guidance for the year. Since tax is on everyone's mind, let's start there. 
We feel great about the product innovation that we delivered in TurboTax this year as well as the results enabled by that innovation. As you know, there are 4 key drivers to our Consumer Tax business. The first driver is the number of returns filed with the IRS. The latest IRS data indicates that total returns were up about 1.5%. That was a bit stronger than we expected, so it was a modest tailwind. 
The second driver is the percentage of those returns filed using do-it-yourself software. This season, the category grew nearly 6% versus the assisted category which was up only slightly. This suggests the do-it-yourself software category gained more than 1 point of share again this year, driving more than 3 points of revenue growth for TurboTax. 
The third driver is TurboTax's share within the do-it-yourself software category. For the third consecutive year, we gained share within the category. In fact, this season, we gained more than 3 points of share, bringing our total software category share to roughly 65%. 
And the fourth driver is revenue per return. As you know, our goal is to grow customers faster than revenue, which yields a positive lifetime value payoff as their tax situations grow more complex over time. Our strategy to gain share of the less complex returns continued to bear fruit, enabling unit growth of 12% overall, which was faster than our revenue growth of over 9%. With that said, our revenue growth for the segment far outpaced our original outlook of 5% to 7% at the beginning of the fiscal year. 
Bottom line, it was a very successful tax season for TurboTax. So what drove the performance? The answer is simple, an awesome, innovative product experience. But what's behind the awesome experience is not so simple. It is driven by deep data science and rigorous execution from a very talented TurboTax team. 
Now we began this multi-year journey 3 years ago to reimagine the tax prep experience in support of a grand vision of taxes are done. And this season, we began to really see it pay off. We remain committed to continuing to invest and build on our competitive advantage, driving share gains for the category and for TurboTax. This season, our team more than tripled its pace of innovation, introducing over 20 new product improvements. We coupled this product innovation with a great demand generation campaign that really resonated: It doesn't take a genius to do your taxes. We made the complex simple, which when you get down to it, is what Intuit does every day. 
Our seamless cloud-based experience drove increased mobile discovery and usage. Our mobile app downloads were up 85% versus last season and the number of completed returns through the mobile app and through mobile browsers doubled. This year, customers snapped 5 million photos of tax documents with mobile devices, that is up 4x greater than it was last year. This represented 25% of all the documents imported into TurboTax, which saved time and reduced errors while delighting customers. 
We also continue to reimagine the entire product experience using data to help customers finish their taxes faster with increased confidence. For example, we broke down the Affordable Care Act into simple questions and provided new confidence-building features like Explain Why and SmartLook. These innovations helped reduce the tax prep time by 40% on average for our customers. We also delivered an excellent customer care experience and continued to invest in security, working with the industry and the government to protect our customers and to reduce fraud. 
On top of all of that product improvement, we continue to focus on serving an important segment that we feel is underserved and overcharged, the simple return segment. Absolute Zero gives these taxpayers the most affordable option, a great product that cost them nothing. But Absolute Zero is just one of the reasons that we won this year. In fact, TurboTax gained share versus software competitors who matched the Absolute Zero offer, and we even gained share at the end of season at full price. All in all, TurboTax grew units double-digits and expanded share. We also grew revenue more than 9% and we improved margin in an already very profitable business. This was simply a great season for TurboTax.
Now let me shift to the ProTax business, which we recently rebranded as the ProConnect Group, given the strategic role this business plays in our ecosystem. The ProConnect Group supports both of our strategic goals, to do the nation's taxes and to be the operating system behind small business success. In support of doing the nation's taxes, we're doing just that. We grew individual returns about 1% in this business this year, which is faster than the overall assisted category group. New customers were a bit soft, though we did a nice job with retention, leading to modest customer and return growth. 
Looking ahead, we're focused on growing the ProTax business in ways that are less reliant on price. We're leaning into the cloud with Intuit Tax Online, and we're innovating with new attached solutions like refund transfer and eSignature. We've got some work to do to drive faster adoption of these services, but we're optimistic about the future. 
The new name reflects ProConnect Group's expanded efforts to support small business success. The more we connect our accountant customers with our small business customers, the more successful they all are and the healthier our ecosystem becomes. For example, we know QuickBooks Online retention is 11 points better when a small business works with an accountant. So we're tapping into our accountant network to make these connections. Nearly 600,000 QuickBooks Online subscribers are now linked to an accountant. That is up 70% versus last year. This all nets out to a strategically important, highly profitable business, albeit with a slower growth rate than TurboTax for the small business group. Neil will talk about our expectations in this business in a minute. 
With that overview on the tax side of the house, let's transition to Small Business. We continue to generate strong new user growth in our online ecosystem. Again, this quarter, more than 80% of QuickBooks Online customers were new to the Intuit franchise and total QuickBooks paying customer growth remain healthy. Year-to-date, across desktop and online, new customers are up 16%, which is an acceleration from last year. 
QuickBooks Online continued to build momentum. We grew total QuickBooks Online subscribers 45% in the third quarter. This resulted in the addition of 140,000 QBO subscribers in the quarter, bringing us to 1,397,000 paid subs worldwide at the end of April, which was ahead of our guidance. Roughly 75,000 of those QBO subscribers are using QuickBooks Self-Employed, which is up from 50,000 last quarter. 
Outside the U.S, QuickBooks Online grew roughly 60% to 255,000 paying subscribers. In total, we're executing well and we're on track to meet our subscriber targets for fiscal year 2016 and 2017. Also, it's important to note that revenue per customer is coming in a bit stronger than we expected so far this year. As we said at Investor Day, we're expecting to land at 2 million to 2.2 million QBO subs at the end of fiscal 2017. 
Now we're also improving customer retention, and we fully expect retention to continue to improve next year as more of our QBO customers are acquired through or work with an accountant. Attach of payroll, payments and third-party apps also improves retention, and we're building solid traction there as well. For example, we now have over 100,000 QuickBooks Online Accountant customers who have at least 3 of their own clients on QBO. That's more than double what it was a year ago. We now also have 2,500 third-party apps in our ecosystem. That's up from 1,100 a year ago and approximately 15% of QuickBooks Online customers are connecting to at least one third-party app, that's up from 9% a year ago. Payroll and payment, as you know, are drivers of retention and they also help drive revenue per customer. And the attach rates for these products remain healthy at 19% for payroll and 8% for payments. 
So that's the story at the high level. Our teams have driven significant innovation across all of our offerings and it's resulted in strong financial results for the quarter and for the year. So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Neil to walk you through the financial details."

For the third quarter of fiscal 2016, we delivered revenue of $2.3 billion, up 8%. This growth reflects the shift of approximately $30 million of Consumer Tax revenue from Q3 into Q2 relative to last season. We delivered non-GAAP operating income of $1.4 billion, up 11%. GAAP operating income of $1.3 billion, up 21%. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.43, up 20%. And GAAP earnings per share of $3.94, which reflects an after-tax gain of $0.67 per share on the divestiture of Quicken, QuickBase and Demandforce. 
Turning to the business segments. Total Small Business segment revenue increased 12% for the quarter. Small Business Online Ecosystem revenue grew approximately 24% for the quarter as customer acquisition and our online ecosystem continues to drive growth. QuickBooks Online subscribers grew 45%. Online active payments customers grew 6% and online payments charge volume grew 18%. Online Payroll customers grew 17%. Switching to the desktop side. Total desktop ecosystem revenue increased 8%. QuickBooks Desktop units were up 3% in the third quarter, and for the full year we expect desktop units and revenue will be up slightly. 
I know it's been difficult to correlate the growth rate in QBO subscriptions to our online ecosystem revenue growth rate. Here's some detail on online revenue that should help with your modeling. In the third quarter, Online Payroll revenue grew 21% and online payments revenue grew 13%. About 40% of our Online Payroll customers are attached to QBO while 60% are not. We sell stand-alone Online Payroll through partners and accountants. This is a good profitable business, but one that grows much slower than payroll attached to QuickBooks online. The revenue mix is closer to 50-50. We expect payroll customers attached to QuickBooks Online to grow around 25% this year and revenue from those customers to grow nearly 40%. 
Now let's look at payments through the same lens. The customer and revenue mix for attached and nonattached solutions is about 50-50, but the story is a little different. We are not currently focused on stand-alone payments channels, like GoPayment and online processing that are not attached to QBO. The QBO attached business is growing very fast and the nonattached business is shrinking. We expect payments customers and revenue attached to QuickBooks Online to grow more than 50% this year. 
Consumer Tax revenue was up 7% versus the third quarter last year. And for the year, we expect Consumer Tax revenue growth of approximately 9%. As a reminder, third quarter Consumer Tax revenue reflects the shift from the third quarter to the second quarter, primarily driven by an extra weekend day in January this year. 
One thing I'd like to call out as we start thinking about next season and next year's guidance. We're investing to improve the total TurboTax product experience, thus delivering the results you saw this season. This remains a high-margin business at over 60%. We remain focused on growing customers, gaining share and increasing profit dollars rather than margin expansion. 
Our ProConnect Group professional tax revenue was $126 million in the third quarter. For the fourth quarter, we expect ProConnect revenue to be approximately the same as in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. As Brad said, we're focused less on price on the ProTax side and investing in our accountant offerings to enhance growth in the QuickBooks Online ecosystem. We expect revenue to be roughly flat in fiscal 2017 with margins remaining above 60%. 
We continue to take a disciplined approach to capital management, investing the cash we generate in opportunities that yield an expected return on investment greater than 15% over 5 years. We repurchased $465 million of shares in the third quarter, and we have $435 million remaining on our authorization. Our cash and investment balance was $1.6 billion at the end of the third quarter and our board approved a $0.30 dividend per share for our fiscal fourth quarter payable on July 18. This represents a 20% increase versus last year. Year-to-date, we've returned nearly $2.5 billion in cash to our shareholders via share repurchases and dividends.
We provided guidance for the fourth quarter in our press release. We also raised our full year revenue, operating income and EPS guidance, and now expect revenue growth of 11% to 12% for the year. We've reiterated our full year fiscal 2016 guidance for QuickBooks Online subscribers. 
As we look forward to fiscal 2017, we're pleased that our trajectory is in line with the long-term customer and financial plans that we shared last year. Small Business and Consumer Tax remain quite healthy. We'll continue to invest in awesome products, security and customer care. The investments we're making outside the U.S. will pay off over a longer-term horizon. Taking all this into consideration, I still believe that $4.30 is the best estimate of where non-GAAP EPS will come in next year. We'll share more when we provide fiscal 2017 guidance in August. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Brad to close."

I know that I've had a coup",511,"Yes. Walter, it's Brad. Thank you. First of all, I would tell you the important thing to think about is that desktop and online are not a zero-sum game. In fact, what we're doing is we're expanding the total addressable market. I know that I've had a couple of shareholders ask we questions about the fact sheet we used to report years ago that included the number of desktop customers that were on the last 3 years version. We don't report that any more. And so there was a question of, hey, is that number actually decreasing faster than online subs are growing and are you losing customers? So I'll tell you what, we'll share some information at this moment that actually is stuff that we used to publish just so everyone's got the same data. If you take the total number of QuickBooks desktop customers and look at the ones that are on the last 3 years version, these are the active customers, and then you add to that to the online subscribers and the desktop subscribers, the total base is up 4%. That is the first time that base has grown in over a decade. If you then take that number and say how many actually paid us this year, they either bought a version of desktop in the last 12 months or they got a subscriber -- a subscription from us, that number is up 20%. And then if you look at total new users, whether they bought desktop or online, that's up 16%. So no matter how you cut it, the headline is we're expanding TAM, we're growing our base, we're entering new markets and we feel very good that both the desktop and the online business are growing. 
In terms of desktop, the thing that we discovered is what we talked about on the last call. We have a group of customers that even with feature parity and even with pricing concessions, do not want to move to the cloud right now. Either because their accountant isn't yet in the cloud or the small business just likes the product the way they have it and they don't want to make the move. We want to make sure they remain active customers of Intuit and that they're buying payroll and payment services, so we want to give them delighted. So we're making sure that the desktop customers are happy. The cloud customers are happy and of those who want to move over, we want to make it easy for them to do that. So net-net, we have a very vibrant ecosystem right now. It's growing in total and the online subs for us, actually, was right on our expectations. I felt great about 45% growth. I feel good about the momentum we have in the countries outside the U.S. And most importantly, I love the fact that we're expanding TAM, both new countries as well as self-employed, which gives us a lot of runway for the future. So that's how we felt about the QuickBooks business overall."

In other cases, we say we think we can get the profitability a little bit sooner. But it truly is a country-by-country formula.

First of all, thanks for the feedback on the quarter. Let me talk to tax first. The results you saw this year are the result of a multiyear investment we've been making in products and innovation, which is not easily matched by competition. I mentioned a couple of things in my opening talk track that even though we had success with Absolute Zero, we also had success when competitors matched Absolute Zero and we were head-to-head and we took share, and also had success after Absolute Zero was done and we were at full price. What's happening right now is we are really making big advances towards taxes completely going away and having no friction for customers to get to the refund. And you heard me talk about this year, on average, customers spent 40% less time having to do their taxes. That is not stuff that competition can match. Now at the same time, I'll tell you we have a lot of respect for our competition. We don't underestimate them and we know every year is going to be competitive. But do I believe that the team can continue to advance our product innovation and as a result continue to win more customers and take share? I do. That's the expectation we have of ourselves, and that's the expectation we want to deliver for our customers is a product that basically get them closer to taxes are done. So said another way, I don't buy the law of large numbers in our case. We're going to continue to work hard to get at that number. The second is QBO and acceleration. You're right, for us to deliver the 2 million to the 2.2 million subs growth, you're going to continue to see an acceleration in terms of the net adds we bring in on a quarterly basis. We fully know that, and we continue to reinforce our confidence in that. And you may ask, why? Well, remember, one of the things we talked about when we gave that forecast is we needed to have total subs growth on a 40% compounded annual growth rate. Well, this quarter was 45%. The second thing is, while we've made some adjustments outside the U.S. and Canada and India, we've got a clear path to how to get those countries repositioned in a good way. U.K. and Australia are on fire, and we just brought on 2 new countries, Brazil and France. And so we believe with the expanding TAM and the fact that we're early innings in both self-employed and global as well as the fact that the U.S. grew in the mid-30s, we see our way to the 2 million to the 2.2 million. We're not batting an eye and your math is correct, we think that is the doable."

I would have -- granted that you guys have been putting up very good growth in QBO sub-base, I would have thought that the attach rate of payroll and payments, which are quite healthy at 19% and 8%, but I would have thought that those businesses should be growing even faster. And it's a little surprising that you're QBO-based business, although it's larger than payroll and payment, it's actually growing faster and adding more new dollars than the other 2 businesses. Can you help us understand when could we see the inflection point where the attach rate starts to inflect pretty materially that you could realize your growth objectives, which I'm sure are pretty aggressive with respect to payments and payroll? It seems to me there's something limiting these attach rates from going potentially very high. I'm sure that you've thought through this as much as anybody else, but I just wanted to get your perspective."

I'd say, first of all, at face value, the one thing we have to keep in mind is we have a growing base of self-employed customers in the QBO numbers. And so those self-employed customers, by definition, don't have employees so they don't need payroll, and many times they're driving for Uber or Lyft or somebody else and they don't need payments. And so if you actually look at it on an apples-to-apples basis, our attach rate remains very healthy compared to where it was a year ago. At the same time, we do see opportunities to continue to improve the attach rate. We are focused on first use, making sure we reduce the friction in the customer experience and continuing to get those services available outside the U.S. in the non-U.S. countries, which will allow us to bring that penetration and that attach rate up for the total base. So you're correct. We do think that there's still opportunity there. We're working on it hard. But one of the things you have to look at right now in the absolute numbers is keep in mind that last quarter we had 50,000 QBO self-employed. This quarter, we had 75,000. And that number doesn't come with payroll and payment opportunities today. And so that basically makes the attach rates look the way they do. The other thing I would say about the ability to improve the revenue, the ecosystem, in addition to attach, is obviously we've shared with you in the past we have customers that come in that first year on a promotional pricing period. When they hit the 13th month, that average revenue per customer for that unit goes up about 50%, and we're going to have customers rolling off that promotional pricing period, and that's going to help us bring revenue up. The last seesaw adds -- so in addition to attach rates and moving off of promotional pricing is retention. A year ago, we would talk to you about attention in the low- to mid-70s. We now talk to you in QBO about retention in the high 70s and starting to tickle the low 80s. And every point of retention adds a net 15,000 subs. And so that number is also a lever that we continue to improve, and we've improved it significantly over the last 12 months. So those are the pieces, Kash. I know there's a lot of math in there. Those are the pieces the kind of lead us to the confidence we have in the actual online ecosystem revenue. It is attach rates. It is retention, and it is rolling off the promotional pricing."

We know right now about half of small businesses accept payments, and so we think that number is a good aspirational goal. Somewhere between here and there is reality, but right now, I'd hate to limit our potential by putting a number out there that our employees think is, okay, the best we can be. Payroll for us is, typically, we say about 40% to 50% of desktop customers. Since right now, our QBO feature functionality is a little more service-oriented, I'd say somewhere in the 30s to 40s is the sort of the near-term, but I think over time, you're looking at half of the base using payroll as well."

I'll start with, it was just a short time ago in the fall at Investor Day when we removed the original target of 2 million subs, which was the original outlook for 2017. And we raised it to 2 to 2.2 million. And we said, hey, that's a new goal, and that was about 9 months ago, not even 9 months ago. And then from there, of course, we've been accelerating. And so to do that, we have to deliver 40% plus CAGR. And we've been above that number. And so we actually are achieving the outcomes that we set for ourselves internally. Now along the way, we've had some learning. One was [ph] Canada. As you know, we found out that we were selling units through retail and then they weren't retaining at the levels we expected them to. And so we shut down that channel. I will tell you that Canada pivot is now behind us, and the momentum is rebuilding in Canada, and we feel very good about the Canada outlook right now. The other area was India. And India's where we didn't take the time to localize the product and get all the compliance features at the level that an accountant would have confidence to recommend it. As a result, they were recommending our product in conjunction with another product, and it was becoming a companion app. We did not want that to be the brand, and so we have now stopped that. We've actually been finalizing the product localization, and we're now starting to go direct to small businesses while we get back out to accountants and let them know the new version. That one's not as far along as Canada, but we're already seeing the progress in India as well. The last 2 are the new countries, Brazil, which has now ported its acquisition we did a year ago called ZeroPaper, we're porting over onto QBO, and we're starting to accelerate there. And then France, we just did general release. So when you put that together, U.S. remained strong, self-employed is opening a new market, Canada's back on track, India has made its turn, Brazil and France are ramping up and the U.K. and Australia remain gangbusters. And so we feel good about our 2 million to 2.2 million. I understand there's a little bit of you have to have faith and confidence, if you just take a look at what we've delivered so far. But I hope that we can demonstrate through the first quarter, the second quarter that we're going to be on track to deliver those numbers because we certainly feel good about them or we wouldn't reiterate the guidance."

I know you're a busy man out there traveling and appreciate you dialing in. Let me start with QBO for a minute, core U.S. I think one of the things that we're working hard to help everybody understand inside the company and outside is last year, when we introduced QuickBooks Self-Employed, we actually eliminated the low-end SKU in QuickBooks Online, which was called QuickBooks Online Simple Start. And so we always use to count QuickBooks Online Simple Start as the core QuickBooks Online product lineup because there is a low-end customer who, quite frankly, was over-served by that product. And we shut it down and replaced it with QuickBooks Self-Employed. So I think it's a little bit of a misnomer to say, pullout Self-Employed and just tell us how the rest of QuickBooks Online is growing. Because that would be similar to saying, pullout out TurboTax Deluxe and just look at the rest of the product lineup. I think it is -- something we all have to get our head around is, it is a part of the core product lineup and, honestly, it's expanding TAM. There's 30 million to 50 million people in that space that the original QuickBooks Self-Employed -- or Simple Start didn't serve. So I think that would be the first thing, and I just want to make sure that you know that's how we look at it. Now when you back that out and say how is the QuickBooks Online core U.S. business growing, what I like about it is that it's doing exactly what we wanted it to do. It's expanding TAM. So the desktop customers are still growing. QBO, 80% of the customers are new to the franchise. They've never used QuickBooks or Accounting before. Self-Employed is going after a category that they could have never been served before with the old QuickBooks Online Simple Start, and you put it all together and in the U.S., that number is, without Self-Employed, growing in the mid-30s, which is a very healthy number. But if you add back in Self-Employed since we used to have Simple Start in there, the number's even better. So that would be the way we look at it in terms of core, and I do think there's continued opportunity to keep that healthy above 30% and even, potentially, accelerate it as we get wiser about how to market the Self-Employed product. So that's on the Self-Employed side. On the Accountant side, you're absolutely right. This business is strategic. We've known for years 2 realities about the accountants being involved in a Small Business choice. The first is the success rate of the Small Business goes up 89% if they work with an accountant. The second is over half of all accounting, payroll and payment decisions are made because the accountants influence them and told them to buy it. So they are a tremendous decision-making advocate for our products. The third piece is the piece that we talked about today in the opening points. If the accountant is working with a Small Business, the retention of QuickBooks Online goes up 1,100 basis points, 11 points. And a point of retention is incredible for us in our subs business. So the importance of the accountant has never been more critical as we move to SaaS. And we also think they're going to be the catalyst to get a lot of these customers to adopt the cloud, which is why we're leaning in so heavily with QuickBooks Online for accountants. So that's sort of the summary on the Accountant side and I hope also helped clear up a little bit about how we look at core QBO, especially as it relates to Simple Start -- or Self-Employed, I'm sorry. I got the old term in there, Matt."

Although one of our competitors continued to offer a version of it out there, and we went back to full price. We took equal parts share throughout the season. So we didn't have any variation that said, hey, this was all the result of this. And then you step back and say, well, what drove that. But when you look at it this year, the team put out 3x, 3x more the product innovation than we did last year. Over 20 new product feature functionality and innovations were put into the product. And that plus a really good campaign that I think resonated, where people really felt more self-empowered, was what actually drove our competitive advantage this year. And so that's really the TurboTax piece. In terms of ACA and fraud, we've been pretty consistent on ACA. It's just the next piece of legislation that's been introduced by government that causes people to say, uh-oh, this is complicated. And our job is to say, no, you're capable of doing it, we'll make it simple. And we worked really hard for 3 years to do that and the Affordable Care Act has not been a headwind at all. In fact, it's been one of the highest converting aspects of our website. In terms of fraud, we'll have a summit again in the summertime with the rest of the industry and the IRS commissioner.

So that's kind of the way we're looking to balance it off for the balance of this year, and we'll say more about that when we give guidance in August at Investor Day."

So QuickBooks Online Self-Employed versus its bigger brothers and sisters in U.S. and non-U.S. I can tell you what we did talk about, which is we began the year in the low- to mid-70s, and we're finishing up the fiscal year with retention in the high 70s. That's a pretty significant improvement in a 12-month period, and we see opportunity to continue to improve that as we go into next year.

But we don't see that gap actually closing, and we don't see a QBO subscriber outside the U.S. getting to the same average revenue per user we see in the U.S. in -- for a considerable time period. We don't really have the payroll and payments attach opportunities that you see in the U.S., outside the U.S. And that's where a lot of the revenue comes from, as you well know.

You're able to do that with moment of truth sort of pop-ups and things that will say, hey, you just added another employee, would you like to sign up for payroll services. And just as we're learning in TurboTax, we can use machine learning and data science to look for more creative ways to expose them to these kinds of offers. And so I have to tell you, TurboTax has been leading the way in using data as a way to attach products and services. And we're now bringing that same level of rigor to the QuickBooks Online team, and we're trying to use that as a way to improve the attach rates for payroll and payments as well. We're early days, but we think there's a lot of opportunity there.

And when we try creative things like raising the price on them, lowering the price on the cloud, getting feature parity, that didn't move them. All it did was cause them to delay purchasing the newest version of QuickBooks Desktop. So then, we went back and we tested some pricing promotions. It's not an everyday low price. We just advertised at the price that it used to be before we raised it. And sure enough, those customers went out and bought the newer version of QuickBooks Desktop. So the good news is, they're staying with us. They're not going anywhere, and they're not hurting QuickBooks Online subscribers.

I want to be wary of sharing any of our pricing decisions too far in advance because, obviously, we have competition that would love to know the answers to those questions. But that being said, we have a tailwind. And our tailwind is, as you know, we offer a promotional discount in the first 30 days or sometimes the first 90 days for someone to come into QuickBooks Online. They'll begin to use it for free, then they'll get a discount of like 30%, then they work their way up to full price. And imagine the large base of net adds we've been putting in that will anniversary off of that at the 13th month and then we'll basically become full price at a roughly $24, $25 a month. And we have a nice tailwind to that base that's going to be rolling off that promotional pricing. So what you should expect in '17 and going into '18 is continuing improvement in average revenue per customer. Now this is where Neil's answer a few minutes ago comes into play. We've got 3 cohorts of customers. We have QuickBooks Online U.S., QuickBooks Online non-U.S. and of course, the mix effect of QuickBooks Self-Employed. All of those are actually getting stronger every 90 days in terms of average revenue per customer. But depending upon which one of those grows the fastest, it can actually bring the blended mix down a little bit. But we would tell you, we look at it on a marginal contribution basis for each of those cohorts, and all of them are getting better and will continue to get better in '17 and '18."

But I will put into context for you, no, we don't have those advanced inventory capabilities today. We have foundational inventory, which is different than it was 6 months ago, and it's getting stronger every day, but it's not advanced yet. We don't have the job costing in there yet. But I think it's important for us to kind of think about: of the 3.5 million desktop customers we have today, 2.5 million do have feature parity. 2.5 million could move over tomorrow if that was the only decision they were waiting on. And as we know, we've moved about 100,000 over to the first 3 quarters of this year. That's up 22% last year, but that's not 2.5 million. So we're going to continue to build up feature parity.

I got to tell you, we are super excited to see the impact he's going to have in our ProConnect business going forward. 
Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'll tell you, we had an excellent finish to the fiscal year. For the fourth quarter, we delivered revenue of $754 million, which was up 8%. We've continued to build on our momentum throughout the year with fiscal 2016 revenue coming in at $4.7 billion, up 12%. Let me begin by sharing a few reflections on our business performance, and I'll start with Small Business.
With the shift to the cloud and mobile solutions, the opening of our platform to enable third-party to connect and our expansion into new geographies outside the U.S., we have more than doubled our total addressable market. Our primary goal is to penetrate this large addressable market, growing our customer base and expanding share in every geography. 
Our Small Business ecosystem remains vibrant with total QuickBooks Online subscribers growing 41% this year to more than 1.5 million subs. We added more than 400,000 QuickBooks Online subscribers over the past 12 months. We're leaning in to new offerings, like QuickBooks Self-Employed, while continuing to post strong growth in QuickBooks Online overall. 
We finished the year with about 85,000 self-employed subscribers, which is up from 25,000 just one year ago. Outside the U.S, QuickBooks Online grew 45% to 287,000 paying subs. In short, QuickBooks Online continued on a strong trajectory and we're executing well against the consistent set of priorities. 
We're realizing our goal to be the operating system behind Small Business success, helping small businesses save time and money so they can thrive when times are good and they can remain resilient were times are tough. We're also delivering outstanding results against our other strategic goal to do the nation's taxes. 
For the fiscal year, Consumer Tax revenue grew 10% with TurboTax Online units growing 15% and total TurboTax units growing 12%. We performed extremely well this past year, introducing 2 dozen innovations in TurboTax, which help expand the do-it-yourself software category while increasing our share in the category as well. 
We fully anticipate another competitive tax season next year, and our teams are already hard at work building on the next wave of innovation at a pace the promises to exceed this year. 
On the ProConnect side, revenue came in as expected at $428 million. Our ProConnect team is continuing to increase the focus on multiservice accountants. Those are accountants to do both books and taxes for their clients. This is in service to driving both accounting front success, as well as growing our own Small Business ecosystem.
To sum it up, fiscal 2016 was a strong year from start to finish. The QuickBooks Online ecosystem is driving Small Business growth and our tax businesses are celebrating a successful season. We're heading into fiscal 2017 with the wind in our backs, and we have some exciting plans underway as we look ahead.
So with that, let me turn it over to Neil to walk you through the financial details."

For the fourth quarter, we delivered revenue of $754 million, up 8%; non-GAAP operating income of $36 million; a GAAP operating loss of $56 million; non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.08 and a GAAP loss per share of $0.16. 
For the full year, we delivered revenue of $4.7 billion, up 12%. Non-GAAP operating income of $1.6 billion, up 36%. GAAP operating income of $1.2 billion, up 68%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.78, up 46% and GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.69, up from $1.28 a year ago. 
As a reminder, our GAAP results for fiscal 2015 and 2016 reflect the decision to divest certain businesses in fiscal 2015 and the sale of these businesses in fiscal 2016. You can refer to our press release for more details. 
Turning to the business segments. Total Small Business segment revenue grew 10% for the quarter and 9% for the year. QuickBooks Online subscriber growth finished the year strong at 41%, as we cross the high end of our guidance to finish with 1,513,000 paid subs. Small Business Online Ecosystem revenue grew 25% for the full year, and we expect some acceleration in fiscal 2017. 
Within the Online ecosystem, our payroll and payments businesses posted healthy growth for the year. Online Payroll customers grew 17%, online active payment customers grew 6% and online payments charge volume grew 15%.
And while QuickBooks Online is driving the majority of our new customer acquisition, QuickBooks Desktop remains a resilient and important part of the business. Desktop units grew 14% in the quarter and 8% for the year as we saw above in consumer upgrades. Roughly 2/3 of the desktop units we sold in fiscal 2016 were upgrades as opposed to new units. New desktop customers were essentially flat year-over-year. Total Small Business desktop ecosystem revenue grew 4% for the year. For fiscal 2017, we expect units to decline modestly and desktop ecosystem revenue to be flat to up slightly.
Moving over to tax. Consumer Tax revenue grew 10% for the year. As Brad said, we will continue to invest in the product experience and to prioritize growth in customers above margin expansion. ProConnect revenue grew 51% for the year, due to changes in our offerings that resulted in lower ratable revenue recognition in fiscal 2015. As I mentioned on the earnings call in May, we expect ProConnect revenue to be roughly flat in fiscal 2017.
We continue to take a disciplined approach to capital management, investing the cash we generate in opportunities that yield a return on investment greater than 15%. With approximately $1.1 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet, our first priority is investing for customer growth. 
When is the best use of cash, we'll return cash to our share holders via share repurchases. In fiscal 2016, we repurchased $2.3 billion worth of shares at an average price of $91. We reduced our weighted average share count by 7% net in fiscal 2016, and we expect to be in the market consistently in fiscal 2017. We have a total of $2.4 billion on our repurchase authorization, including $2 billion recently approved by our Board.
Our plans include a cash dividend of up to $1.36 per share for fiscal 2017 with the first quarter dividend of $0.34 per share payable on October 18. This represents a 13% increase versus last year and reflects our confidence in our business strategy, as well as more recurring and predictable revenue streams. You can find guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. Here are the highlights for fiscal 2017.
QuickBooks Online subscribers up [ph] 2 million to 2.2 million, growth of 32% to 45%. Revenue of $5 billion to $5.1 billion, growth of 7% to 9%. Non-GAAP operating income of $1.675 billion to $1.725 billion, growth of 8% to 11%. GAAP operating income of $1.33 billion to $1.38 billion, growth of 7% to 11%. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $4.30 to $4.40 for growth of 14% to 16%. GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.35 to $3.45 versus $3.69 in fiscal 2016. 
Fiscal 2016 earnings per share includes $0.65 net income per share from discontinued operations. We feel confident in our ability to deliver against our financial principles and our long-term strategic goals and we look forward to sharing our progress with you throughout this fiscal year. On a personal note, we will miss mats outstanding contribution Investor Relations. We are very fortunate to be adding his experience and business acumen to our ProConnect Group as we strengthen the connection between our accounting community and our Small Business ecosystem. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Brad."

Really nice go-to-market plans and programs there to capitalize on the temp opportunity we see before us. And I think we've given ourselves some good opportunities on the revenue side by not focusing on price increase to drive revenue growth. The revenue growth that you're going to see in 2017 is largely driven by customer growth and customer accounts. And as you saw this year in Consumer Tax in 2016, we think they're just big opportunities to grow our customer base and continue to expand. So I think the margin expansion you're going to see in 2017 is going to be very well-balanced between investments to drive growth and product improvements and also a very reasonable approach on the pricing side."

We have an increased focus on product market fit. We have really good lessons learned from this year in terms of go-to-market plans on a country-by-country basis. We've been adding incredible talents. You probably saw the announcement of Lucas Watson joining us after 17 years of global experience in Procter & Gamble and 5 years over at Google.

And so, as you add more self-employed customers who by definition don't have employees, you're going to have an attach rate that looks like it's going in the wrong direction. But that's actually healthy when you actually normalize it. And our payments attach was at 11%. So right now, we feel good about with those leading indicators.

So you'll find those who grew up in the digital world, but they don't really understand the platform marketing aspects. And we think we found a Rainer in Lucas. As I mentioned, 17 years at Procter & Gamble through a range of different product line, leading them across the globe. He ultimately took P&G online and lead their digital efforts.

If you look at those that are new to the franchising, QBO, it was north of 80%, it was 84% this quarter. And so there's just healthy growth across the board. And what's driving it is expanding the TAM. We're expanding the TAM in 3 ways the shift to cloud and mobile, more people now considering accounting software then they would have in the past so that they could come in and try it for free and then sign-up. It's actually improving their effectiveness. The second thing is helping us is we're getting the opportunity to be due to product with other product like PayPal, American Express, and so it gives us more consideration. And last but not least is global expansion, which ahs opened up tens of million of more prospects to our product we couldn't have served a couple of years ago. So that's one big bucket. It's just expanding the TAM. The second is we did see a strong repurchase cycle in desktop this year. So the desktop units rebounded, and it was primarily because of so people who are coming at the end of their 3-year cycle and they upgraded and they were able to buy the newest version of QuickBooks desktop and that gave us a little bit of bump here in the last pass of this fiscal year. But by and large, we do think this is sustainable. We've opened up with a total addressable market. We think the cloud and mobile is going to help us.

And then we introduced QuickBooks Online in Brazil. All the other countries, we've been out there for several years now.

Talk about it that way inside the company. But that said, I've got to tell, look some good momentum been built up in the U.K, early start in France and Brazil, and strong momentum in Australia. Canada has rebounded. So as we told you, our one issue we had in Canada is we have tried to sell QuickBooks Online in a box in a retail store. It was an experiment we had tried in the U.S. that didn't work and we shouted out but let it going Canada a little while longer. So the same sort of attrition issues. And so we pulled it out and we created a grow over a problem. That's now in our rearview mirror. So Canada's moving the right direction. India is the one that were trying to develop a model that shifts away from the accountants and focuses directly on Small Business and then looks for ways to monetize that over the long term. And we're running a series of experiments in India, but this is a very small part the base. But that's the one that I would tell you that we still have several alternatives we're exploring, but we don't have the go-to-market model figured out in India yet. So that's how I feel about overall global. I don't want to paint a black picture over this.

In fact, the number of migrations to move from desktop to QuickBooks Online this year within their own customer base was up 25%. So we've done work with our customer base and the desktop to figure out why they aren't interested in the cloud. And reasons 1 through 5 are all basically, I'm not ready to move to the cloud provider want to put my data into the quality the want to move to subscription basis. Maker product is working just fine. ProTax on it is working with me in the been a desktop version. Those are the kinds of reasons. In fact, only 14% side feature parity. So we want to make sure we keep this customers in the franchise we want to continue to make that got a comfortable with using the cloud version and we want to continue to let them know that we can help the migrates to the cloud when they're ready. As long as they stay with Intuit, we're happy. But right now, that's sort of bucket 1, which is there really aren't any major barriers other than their mindset and comfort level with the cloud. The second side is the repurchase cycle. We see this happen. Last year, we had raised the price on desktop. We did it for the first half of the year thinking that might actually drive people into the cloud what we now realize is there wasn't issue, it was a mindset. And so when we brought it back down total more normalized promotion we started to see the regular repurchase type will happen again and that's what carried into this year.

On the customers side, while we continue to see strong growth in QBO in the U.S, we believe we have outside opportunity with better execution, stronger product market fit and just a continued learning curve outside the U.S. And also, we're in the early days of QuickBooks Self-Employed. 85,000 paying subs now versus 25,000 12 months ago. And we really learned a lot this year as we put the bundled together with TurboTax we went after people like the Uber drivers and lift driver. And we think there's a lot of opportunity to grow the customer base and then when you get to the monetization of there is an opportunity there and we can see the tailwind at our back where we can fill the Telenet our back rather. One is, we see opportunities to continue to improve attached. The second is, as of those customers move off of promotional pricing and they hit their 13th month, the average revenue per customer goes up about 50%. And the third is we did just pass through a modest price increase in QuickBooks Online. It's gone out to the new customers and were in the process of rolling it out to existing base of those three things combined help us drive in the average revenue per customer, which helps to drive the QBO revenue. So it's those 2 things that we see continuing to drive improved performance in QBO."

I'll start first with the strategic role ProConnect plays in the business.

But probably they have a business that they monetize but they to tax returns for consumers and small businesses. And we are laser focus on the multiservice. Those are the people who do both books and taxes, not only for consumers, but also for small businesses. And that's a very large population. So one of the things that we've chosen to do is we step back and said, let's look at how we lined up our products and pricing to better serve these customers. And some other requires us building better collaboration between QuickBooks and their tax products. And so we're in the process of building that R&D out. And some of it is we needed to stop pricing for every single piece that we were giving the accountants. So for example, busy, we've chosen to give QuickBooks Online for accountants to the accountants for free. We don't charge them. Another thing we choose to do this year is not to take a price increase at the normal level as we would on the tax products. And instead, we're starting to build that into that kind product. So stop taking price everywhere we historically dead. And as a result of that, we're kind of backing off on the revenue growth short term on the ProTax back the house and we think long-term that's going to accelerate the overall revenue growth for the company."

For the fourth quarter, we delivered revenue of $754 million, which was up 8%. We've continued to build on our momentum throughout the year with fiscal 2016 revenue coming in at $4.7 billion, up 12%. 
Let me begin by sharing a few reflections on our business performance, and I'll start with Small Business.
With the shift to the cloud and mobile solutions, the opening of our platform to enable third parties to connect and our expansion into new geographies outside the U.S., we have more than doubled our total addressable market. Our primary goal is to penetrate this large addressable market, growing our customer base and expanding share in every geography. 
Our Small Business ecosystem remains vibrant, with total QuickBooks Online subscribers growing 41% this year to more than 1.5 million subs. We added more than 400,000 QuickBooks Online subscribers over the past 12 months. We're leaning in to new offerings like QuickBooks Self-Employed while continuing to post strong growth in QuickBooks Online overall. We finished the year with about 85,000 self-employed subscribers, which is up from 25,000 just 1 year ago. Outside the U.S., QuickBooks Online grew 45% to 287,000 paying subs. In short, QuickBooks Online continues on a strong trajectory, and we're executing well against the consistent set of priorities. We're realizing our goal to be the operating system behind small business success, helping small businesses save time and money so they can thrive when times are good, and they can remain resilient when times are tough. We're also delivering outstanding results against our other strategic goal: to do the nations' taxes. 
For the fiscal year, Consumer Tax revenue grew 10%, with TurboTax Online units growing 15% and total TurboTax units growing 12%. We performed extremely well this past year, introducing 2 dozen innovations in TurboTax, which helps expand the do-it-yourself software category while increasing our share in the category as well. We fully anticipate another competitive tax season next year, and our teams are already hard at work building on the next wave of innovations at a pace that promises to exceed this year's. 
On the ProConnect side, revenue came in as expected at $428 million. Our ProConnect team is continuing to increase the focus on multiservice accountants. Those are accountants who do both books and taxes for their clients. This is in service to driving those accounting firms' success as well as growing our own Small Business ecosystem.
To sum it up, fiscal 2016 was a strong year from start to finish. The QuickBooks Online ecosystem is driving Small Business growth, and our tax businesses are celebrating a successful season. We're heading into fiscal 2017 with the wind at our backs, and we have some exciting plans under way as we look ahead.
So with that, let me turn it over to Neil to walk you through the financial details."

For the fourth quarter, we delivered revenue of $754 million, up 8%; non-GAAP operating income of $36 million; a GAAP operating loss of $56 million; non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.08; and a GAAP loss per share of $0.16. 
For the full year, we delivered revenue of $4.7 billion, up 12%; non-GAAP operating income of $1.6 billion, up 36%; GAAP operating income of $1.2 billion, up 68%; non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.78, up 46%; and GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.69, up from $1.28 a year ago. 
As a reminder, our GAAP results for fiscal 2015 and 2016 reflect the decision to divest certain businesses in fiscal 2015 and the sale of those businesses in fiscal 2016. You can refer to our press release for more details. 
Turning to the business segments. Total Small Business segment revenue grew 10% for the quarter and 9% for the year. QuickBooks Online subscriber growth finished the year strong at 41%, as we cross the high end of our guidance to finish with 1,513,000 paid subs. Small Business Online Ecosystem revenue grew 25% for the full year, and we expect some acceleration in fiscal 2017. 
Within the online ecosystem, our payroll and payments businesses posted healthy growth for the year. Online Payroll customers grew 17%, online active payment customers grew 6%, and online payments charge volume grew 15%.
And while QuickBooks Online is driving the majority of our new customer acquisition, QuickBooks Desktop remains a resilient and important part of the business. Desktop units grew 14% in the quarter and 8% for the year as we saw a bump-up in customer upgrades. Roughly 2/3 of the desktop units we sold in fiscal 2016 were upgrades as opposed to new units. New desktop customers were essentially flat year-over-year. Total Small Business desktop ecosystem revenue grew 4% for the year. For fiscal 2017, we expect units to decline modestly and desktop ecosystem revenue to be flat to up slightly.
Moving over to tax. Consumer Tax revenue grew 10% for the year. As Brad said, we will continue to invest in the product experience and to prioritize growth in customers above margin expansion. 
ProConnect revenue grew 51% for the year due to changes in our offerings that resulted in lower ratable revenue recognition in fiscal 2015. As I mentioned on the earnings call in May, we expect ProConnect revenue to be roughly flat in fiscal 2017.
We continue to take a disciplined approach to capital management, investing the cash we generate in opportunities that yield a return on investment greater than 15%. With approximately $1.1 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet, our first priority is investing for customer growth. 
When it's the best use of cash, we'll return cash to our share holders via share repurchases. In fiscal 2016, we repurchased $2.3 billion worth of shares at an average price of $91. We reduced our weighted average share count by 7% net in fiscal 2016, and we expect to be in the market consistently in fiscal 2017. We have a total of $2.4 billion on our repurchase authorization, including $2 billion recently approved by our board.
Our plans include a cash dividend of up to $1.36 per share for fiscal 2017, with the first quarter dividend of $0.34 per share payable on October 18. This represents a 13% increase versus last year and reflects our confidence in our business strategy as well as more recurring and predictable revenue streams. You can find guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. 
Here are the highlights for fiscal 2017: QuickBooks Online subscribers of 2 million to 2.2 million, growth of 32% to 45%; revenue of $5 billion to $5.1 billion, growth of 7% to 9%; non-GAAP operating income of $1.675 billion to $1.725 billion, growth of 8% to 11%; GAAP operating income of $1.33 billion to $1.38 billion, growth of 7% to 11%; non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $4.30 to $4.40 for growth of 14% to 16%; GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.35 to $3.45 versus $3.69 in fiscal 2016. Fiscal 2016 earnings per share includes $0.65 net income per share from discontinued operations. 
We feel confident in our ability to deliver against our financial principles and our long-term strategic goals, and we look forward to sharing our progress with you throughout this fiscal year. 
On a personal note, we will miss Matt's outstanding contribution in investor relations. We are very fortunate to be adding his experience and business acumen to our ProConnect Group as we strengthen the connection between our accountant community and our Small Business ecosystem. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Brad."

We look forward to seeing all of you there. 
And with that, let's open it up to you to hear what's on your mind. So Latif, I'll get it back to you."

Really nice go-to-market plans and programs there to capitalize on the TAM opportunity we see before us, and I think we've given ourselves some good opportunities on the revenue side by not focusing on price increase to drive revenue growth. The revenue growth that you're going to see in 2017 is largely driven by customer growth and customer accounts, and as you saw this year in Consumer Tax in 2016, we think they're just big opportunities to grow our customer base and continue to expand. So I think the margin expansion you're going to see in 2017 is going to be very well balanced between investments to drive growth and product improvements and also a very reasonable approach on the pricing side."

We have an increased focus on product/market fit. We have really good lessons learned from this year in terms of go-to-market plans on a country-by-country basis.

But that's actually healthy when you actually normalize it. And our payments attach was at 11%. So right now, we feel good with those leading indicators.

Both girls are now at college. We love her. We celebrate her, and we're taking a 1-year victory lap because she let us know some time ago she was going to do that. And we began a very concerted search to look for someone who had digital experience, someone who had clear mobile experience and someone who have world-class marketing skills. And sometimes you'll find classical marketers from packaged goods who may not have as much digital experience. Or you'll find those who grew up in the digital world, but they don't really understand the platform marketing aspects. And we think we found a Rainer [ph] in Lucas, as I mentioned, 17 years at Procter & Gamble through a range of different product lines, leading them across the globe. He ultimately took P&G online and led their digital efforts. And then from there, he was recruited away by Google, and he helped monetize YouTube and, more recently, has been leading their innovative global solutions around the world. And so we're excited to have him because he brings both that classical marketing as well as digital experience. And what he'll be doing is be leading our sales channels. He'll be leading the company's marketing efforts, and the global country managers report directly into him. So he'll have the non-U.S. locations, and that's where his expertise will come to bare. And he'll work very closely with our general managers in the U.S. to try to help our global expansion."

We saw healthy growth across the board. We saw QuickBooks Online subs at 41%. We saw the desktop customers growing 8%. If you look at those that are new to the franchise in QBO, it was north of 80%. It was 84% this quarter. And so there's just healthy growth across the board. And what's driving it is we're expanding the TAM. We're expanding the TAM in 3 ways. With the shift to cloud and mobile, more people are now considering accounting software than they would have in the past. They can come in and try it for free and then sign up for it if it's actually improving their effectiveness. The second thing that's helping us is we're getting the opportunity to connect our products with other products like PayPal and American Express, and so it gives us more consideration. And last, but not least, is global expansion, which has opened up tens of million of more prospects to our product that we couldn't have served a couple of years ago. So that's one big bucket. It's just expanding the TAM. The second is we did see a strong repurchase cycle in desktop this year. So the desktop units rebounded, and it was primarily because of all people who are coming at the end of their 3-year cycle and they upgraded, and they were able to buy the newest version of QuickBooks desktop. And that gave us a little bit of bump here in the last pass of this fiscal year. But by and large, we do think this is sustainable. We've opened up the total addressable market. We think that cloud and mobile is going to help us. And we think there will be a group of customers that will still want to be on desktop, and we plan to have a great desktop product as well."

And so we pulled it out and we created a grow over problem. That's now in our rearview mirror. So Canada is moving in the right direction. India is the one that we're trying to develop a model that shifts away from the accountant and focuses directly on small business and then looks for ways to monetize that over the long term. And we're running a series of experiments in India, but this is a very small part of the base. But that's the one that I would tell you that we still have several alternatives that we're exploring, but we don't have the go-to-market model figured out in India yet. And so that's how I feel about overall global. I don't want to paint a black picture over this. I think there's some really shining areas, but when you put it all together, 287,000 paying subs growing at 45%, I know we're capable of more and our aspirations are to accelerate that performance."

And last fall, we said we're going to move it from 2 million to 2 million to 2.2 million. If you kind of take our current trajectory and you do the 40% growth rate, it will put you squarely in the middle of that guidance range.

In fact, the number of migrations who moved from desktop to QuickBooks Online this year within our own customer base was up 25%. So we've done work with our customer base in the desktop to figure out why they aren't interested in the cloud. And reasons 1 through 5 are all basically, I'm not ready to move to the cloud. I don't want to put my data in the cloud. I don't want to move to a subscription service. My current product is working just fine. My accountant is working with me and they've got a desktop version. Those are the kinds of reasons. In fact, only 14% cite feature parity. So we want to make sure we keep these customers in the franchise. We want to continue to get their accountant comfortable with using the cloud version. And we want to continue to let them know that we can help them migrate to the cloud when they're ready. As long as they stay with Intuit, we're happy. But right now, that's sort of Bucket 1 which is, there really aren't any major barriers other than their mindset and comfort level with the cloud. The second side is the repurchase cycle. We see this happen. And last year, we had raised the price on desktop. We did it for the first half of the year thinking that might actually drive people to the cloud. What we now realize is it wasn't a price issue, it was a mindset. And so when we brought it back down to more normalized promotions, we started to see the regular repurchase cycle happen again, and that's what carried into this year. And so I think what we see is a group of people who probably delayed an upgrade last year. And then this year, they came back in on their normal rhythm."

And we really learned a lot this year as we put the bundle together with TurboTax and we went after people like the Uber drivers and the Lyft drivers. So we think there's a lot of opportunity to continue to grow the customer base. Then when you get to monetization, there is an opportunity there, and we can see the tailwind at our back or we can feel the tailwind at our back rather. One is, we see opportunity to continue to improve attach. The second is, as those customers move off of promotional pricing and they hit their 13th month, the average revenue per customer goes up about 50%. And the third is, we did just pass through a modest price increase in QuickBooks Online. It's gone out to the new customers. And we're in the process of rolling it out to existing base. And those 3 things combined help us drive the average revenue per customer, which ultimately drives up the QBO revenue. So it's those 2 things that we see continuing to drive improved performance in QBO."

I'll start first with the strategic role ProConnect plays in the business. The accountants are not only the key to small businesses making their accounting, payroll and payments decisions so they have a very important role to help us work with small businesses and help them be successful. But obviously, they also have a business that they monetize, where they do tax returns for consumers and small businesses. And we are laser-focused on the multiservice firm. Those are the people who do both books and taxes, not only for consumers, but also for small businesses. And that's a very large population. So one of the things that we've chosen to do is we step back and said, let's look at how we lined up our product and pricing to better serve those customers. And some of it requires us building better collaboration between QuickBooks and their tax product, and so we're in the process of building that R&D out. And some of it is, we needed to stop pricing for every single piece that we were giving the accountant. So for example, this year, we've chosen to give QuickBooks Online for accountant -- to the accountants for free. We don't charge them. Another thing we chose to do this year is not to take a price increase at the normal levels we would on the tax product. And instead, we're starting to build that into the accounting product. So we've stopped taking price everywhere we historically did. And as a result of that, we're kind of backing off on the revenue growth short term on the ProTax side of the house, but we think long term that's going to accelerate the overall revenue growth for the company."

Well, first of all, one of the pieces of good news is, anyone who is in the desktop ProAdvisor network is also now in the cloud network. So we gave them a cloud package. We trained them. We certified them. And they're increasingly recommending their customers to use QuickBooks Online. In fact, the last number I saw, we were north of 600,000 accountants who had at least one customer on QBO. And then those who actually have 3-plus customers have more than doubled in the last 12 months. And we see those as great leading indicators of not only cloud adoption on the accountant side, but them recommending it to their clients. So that's one thing, which is the desktop ProAdvisors have come along with us. The second is our ProAdvisor program is a global program. So we're enrolling accountants in all the countries. And as I think you alluded to in your question, in some countries, the accountant's recommendation carries even more weight than it does in the U.S. There are some countries where, for example, France, the accountant is the end-all and be-all in terms of making the final decision on whether this product is ready for a small business client to use. So we partner very closely with those accounting professionals to make sure that they feel good, they're certified and they're endorsing our product. So by and large, what you see is on a case-by-case basis, this cloud-based product is available to desktop. It's available in all the countries. We have a similar approach where we work with those local accounting professionals to make sure it meets their needs so they in turn will endorse it with their clients."

I think the more -- the healthier statistic longer term is to see the customer growth accelerate, but that's the main driver between the improvement you see in the fourth quarter is just more of those customers coming off. We had a couple of big quarters a year ago, which meant that in the late third quarter, early fourth quarter, you had a little bit more customers than usual coming off at promotional period and paying the full price. That's just an indication that retention rate's holding up quite nicely as those customers do come off that promotional pricing.

For the fourth quarter, we delivered revenue of $754 million, which was up 8%. We've continued to build on our momentum throughout the year with fiscal 2016 revenue coming in at $4.7 billion, up 12%. 
Let me begin by sharing a few reflections on our business performance, and I'll start with Small Business.
With the shift to the cloud and mobile solutions, the opening of our platform to enable third parties to connect and our expansion into new geographies outside the U.S., we have more than doubled our total addressable market. Our primary goal is to penetrate this large addressable market, growing our customer base and expanding share in every geography. 
Our Small Business ecosystem remains vibrant, with total QuickBooks Online subscribers growing 41% this year to more than 1.5 million subs. We added more than 400,000 QuickBooks Online subscribers over the past 12 months. 
We're leaning in to new offerings like QuickBooks Self-Employed while continuing to post strong growth in QuickBooks Online overall. We finished the year with about 85,000 self-employed subscribers, which is up from 25,000 just 1 year ago. Outside the U.S., QuickBooks Online grew 45% to 287,000 paying subs. In short, QuickBooks Online continues on a strong trajectory, and we're executing well against a consistent set of priorities. We're realizing our goal to be the operating system behind small business success, helping small businesses save time and money so they can thrive when times are good, and they can remain resilient when times are tough. 
We're also delivering outstanding results against our other strategic goal: to do the nations' taxes. For the fiscal year, Consumer Tax revenue grew 10%, with TurboTax Online units growing 15% and total TurboTax units growing 12%. We performed extremely well this past year, introducing 2 dozen innovations in TurboTax, which helps expand the do-it-yourself software category while increasing our share in the category as well. We fully anticipate another competitive tax season next year, and our teams are already hard at work building on the next wave of innovations at a pace that promises to exceed this year's. 
On the ProConnect side, revenue came in as expected at $428 million. Our ProConnect team is continuing to increase the focus on multiservice accountants. Those are accountants who do both books and taxes for their clients. This is in service to driving those accounting firms' success as well as growing our own Small Business ecosystem.
To sum it up, fiscal 2016 was a strong year from start to finish. The QuickBooks Online ecosystem is driving Small Business growth, and our tax businesses are celebrating a successful season. We're heading into fiscal 2017 with the wind at our backs, and we have some exciting plans underway as we look ahead.
So with that, let me turn it over to Neil to walk you through the financial details."

For the fourth quarter, we delivered revenue of $754 million, up 8%; non-GAAP operating income of $36 million; a GAAP operating loss of $56 million; non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.08; and a GAAP loss",785,"Thanks, Brad, and good afternoon, everyone. For the fourth quarter, we delivered revenue of $754 million, up 8%; non-GAAP operating income of $36 million; a GAAP operating loss of $56 million; non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.08; and a GAAP loss per share of $0.16. 
For the full year, we delivered revenue of $4.7 billion, up 12%; non-GAAP operating income of $1.6 billion, up 36%; GAAP operating income of $1.2 billion, up 68%; non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.78, up 46%; and GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.69, up from $1.28 a year ago. 
As a reminder, our GAAP results for fiscal 2015 and 2016 reflect the decision to divest certain businesses in fiscal 2015 and the sale of those businesses in fiscal 2016. You can refer to our press release for more details. 
Turning to the business segments. Total Small Business segment revenue grew 10% for the quarter and 9% for the year. QuickBooks Online subscriber growth finished the year strong at 41%, as we crossed the high end of our guidance to finish with 1,513,000 paid subs. Small Business Online Ecosystem revenue grew 25% for the full year, and we expect some acceleration in fiscal 2017. 
Within the online ecosystem, our payroll and payments businesses posted healthy growth for the year: Online Payroll customers grew 17%; online active payment customers grew 6%; and online payments charge volume grew 15%.
And while QuickBooks Online is driving the majority of our new customer acquisition, QuickBooks Desktop remains a resilient and important part of the business. Desktop units grew 14% in the quarter and 8% for the year as we saw a bump-up in customer upgrades. Roughly 2/3 of the desktop units we sold in fiscal 2016 were upgrades as opposed to new units. New desktop customers were essentially flat year-over-year. Total Small Business desktop ecosystem revenue grew 4% for the year. For fiscal 2017, we expect units to decline modestly and desktop ecosystem revenue to be flat to up slightly.
Moving over to tax. Consumer Tax revenue grew 10% for the year. As Brad said, we will continue to invest in the product experience and to prioritize growth in customers above margin expansion. 
ProConnect revenue grew 51% for the year due to changes in our offerings that resulted in lower ratable revenue recognition in fiscal 2015. As I mentioned on the earnings call in May, we expect ProConnect revenue to be roughly flat in fiscal 2017.
We continue to take a disciplined approach to capital management, investing the cash we generate in opportunities that yield a return on investment greater than 15%. With approximately $1.1 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet, our first priority is investing for customer growth. 
When it's the best use of cash, we'll return cash to our shareholders via share repurchases. In fiscal 2016, we repurchased $2.3 billion worth of shares at an average price of $91. We reduced our weighted average share count by 7% net in fiscal 2016, and we expect to be in the market consistently in fiscal 2017. We have a total of $2.4 billion on our repurchase authorization, including $2 billion recently approved by our board.
Our plans include a cash dividend of up to $1.36 per share for fiscal 2017, with the first quarter dividend of $0.34 per share payable on October 18. This represents a 13% increase versus last year and reflects our confidence in our business strategy as well as more recurring and predictable revenue streams. You can find guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. 
Here are the highlights for fiscal 2017: QuickBooks Online subscribers of 2 million to 2.2 million, growth of 32% to 45%; revenue of $5 billion to $5.1 billion, growth of 7% to 9%; non-GAAP operating income of $1.675 billion to $1.725 billion, growth of 8% to 11%; GAAP operating income of $1.33 billion to $1.38 billion, growth of 7% to 11%; non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $4.30 to $4.40 for growth of 14% to 16%; GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.35 to $3.45 versus $3.69 in fiscal 2016. Fiscal 2016 earnings per share includes $0.65 net income per share from discontinued operations. 
We feel confident in our ability to deliver against our financial principles and our long-term strategic goals, and we look forward to sharing our progress with you throughout this fiscal year. 
On a personal note, we will miss Matt's outstanding contribution in investor relations. We are very fortunate to be adding his experience and business acumen to our ProConnect Group as we strengthen the connection between our accountant community and our Small Business ecosystem. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Brad."

Really nice go-to-market plans and programs there to capitalize on the TAM opportunity we see before us, and I think we've given ourselves some good opportunities on the revenue side by not focusing on price increase to drive revenue growth. The revenue growth that you're going to see in 2017 is largely driven by customer growth and customer accounts, and as you saw this year in Consumer Tax in 2016, we think they're just big opportunities to grow our customer base and continue to expand. So I think the margin expansion you're going to see in 2017 is going to be very well balanced between investments to drive growth in product improvements and also a very reasonable approach on the pricing side."

The most important metric at the end the day is the penetration into the base, which leads to an average revenue per customer. So on the attach rates this past quarter for new users, payroll is at 19%. Now, keep in mind that has an increasing base of QuickBooks Self-Employed. And so as you add more self-employed customers who, by definition, don't have employees, you're going to have an attach rate that looks like it's going in the wrong direction. But that's actually healthy when you actually normalize it. And our payments attach was at 11%. So right now, we feel good with those leading indicators. We think there's room to improve, and we have a focused effort to do that, particularly with the first-time use experience. But they're all moving in the direction we want, and we expect to have improved attach rates as we go into next year."

Caroline Donahue has been our Chief Sales and Marketing Officer, and she's a 21-year veteran of Intuit. And she reached a chapter in her life where she wanted to step away. Both girls are now at college. We love her. We celebrate her, and we're taking a 1-year victory lap because she let us know some time ago she was going to do that. And we began a very concerted search to look for someone who had digital experience, someone who had clear mobile experience and someone who had world-class marketing skills. And sometimes you'll find classical marketers from packaged goods who may not have as much digital experience. Or you'll find those who grew up in the digital world, but they don't really understand the platform marketing aspects. And we think we found a ringer in Lucas. As I mentioned, 17 years at Procter & Gamble through a range of different product lines, leading them across the globe; he ultimately took P&G online and led their digital efforts. And then from there, was recruited away by Google, and he helped monetize YouTube and, more recently, has been leading their innovative global solutions around the world. And so we're excited to have him because he brings both that classical marketing as well as digital experience. And what he'll be doing is be leading our sales channels. He'll be leading the company's marketing efforts, and the global country managers report directly into him. So he'll have the non-U.S. locations, and that's where his expertise will come to bear. And he'll work very closely with our general managers in the U.S. to try to help our global expansion."

We saw healthy growth across the board. We saw QuickBooks Online subs at 41%. We saw the desktop customers growing 8%. If you look at those that are new to the franchise in QBO, it was north of 80%. It was 84% this quarter. And so there's just healthy growth across the board. And what's driving it is we're expanding the TAM. We're expanding the TAM in 3 ways. With the shift to cloud and mobile, more people are now considering accounting software than they would have in the past. They can come in and try it for free and then sign up for it if it's actually improving their effectiveness. The second thing that's helping us is we're getting the opportunity to connect our products with other products like PayPal and American Express, and so it gives us more consideration. And last, but not least, is the global expansion, which has opened up tens of millions of more prospects to our product that we couldn't have served a couple of years ago. So that's one big bucket. It's just expanding the TAM. The second is we did see a strong repurchase cycle in desktop this year. So the desktop units rebounded, and it was primarily because we saw people who were coming at the end of their 3-year cycle and they upgraded, and they were able to buy the newest version of QuickBooks desktop. And that gave us a little bit of bump here in the last half of this fiscal year. But by and large, we do think this is sustainable. We've opened up the total addressable market. We think that cloud and mobile is going to help us. And we think there will be a group of customers that'll still want to be on desktop, and we plan to have a great desktop product as well."

We know we're capable of more. We have good products and we know we have the opportunity to get out there and accelerate this total addressable market and penetrating that market. So that's just the candid reality. We talk about it that way inside the company. But that said, I got to tell you, we have some real momentum being built up in the U.K., early start in France and Brazil, and strong momentum in Australia. Canada has rebounded. So as we told you, our one issue we had in Canada is we had tried to sell QuickBooks Online in a box in a retail store. It was an experiment we had tried in the U.S. that didn't work, and we shut it down, but we let it go in Canada a little while longer. We saw the same sort of attrition issues. And so we pulled it out and we created a grow-over problem. That's now in our rearview mirror. So Canada is moving in the right direction. India is the one that we're trying to develop a model that shifts away from the accountant and focuses directly on small business and then looks for ways to monetize that over the long term. And we're running a series of experiments in India, but it's is a very small part of the base. But that's the one that I would tell you that we still have several alternatives that we're exploring, but we don't have the go-to-market model figured out in India yet. And so that's how I feel about overall global. I don't want to paint a black picture over this. I think there are some really shining areas, but when you put it all together, 287,000 paid subs growing at 45%, I know we're capable of more and our aspirations are to accelerate that performance."

Let me step back and talk about that for a minute because we have a philosophy that we'll update our guidance when we have a change in our outlook. And right now, there is no change in our outlook. We've been trying to message for some time that our goal is to keep our subscriber growth north of 40% and our QBO ecosystem revenue growth between 25% and 30%. And this quarter, once again, showed that we were in the ZIP Code. And so we didn't feel the need to go out and change the guidance, which we had provided a year ago in the fall. But I do want to remind is that when we first set guidance for QBO subs a year ago at Investor Day, the number had been 2 million in 2017. And last fall, we said we're going to move it from 2 million to 2 million to 2.2 million. If you kind of take our current trajectory and you do the 40% growth rate, it will put you at squarely in the middle of that guidance range. And we'll talk to you at Investor Day about levers we're looking at around global -- or excuse me, global growth, QBSE and other things that can move us up in that guidance range. But since there is nothing meaningfully different, we did not want to change the guidance and signal anything that, quite frankly, hasn't changed."

In fact, the number of migrations who moved from desktop to QuickBooks Online this year within our own customer base was up 25%. So we've done work with our customer base in the desktop to figure out why they aren't interested in the cloud. And reasons 1 through 5 are all basically: I'm not ready to move to the cloud; I don't want to put my data in the cloud; I don't want to move to a subscription service; my current product is working just fine; my accountant is working with me and they've got a desktop version. Those are the kinds of reasons. In fact, only 14% cite feature parity. So we want to make sure we keep these customers in the franchise. We want to continue to get their accountant comfortable with using the cloud version. And we want to continue to let them know that we can help them migrate to the cloud when they're ready. As long as they stay with Intuit, we're happy. But right now, that's sort of bucket 1 which is, there really aren't any major barriers other than their mindset and comfort level with the cloud. The second side is the repurchase cycle. We see this happen. And last year, we had raised the price on desktop. We did it for the first half of the year thinking that might actually drive people to the cloud. What we now realize is it wasn't a price issue, it was a mindset. And so when we brought it back down to more normalized promotions, we started to see the regular repurchase cycle happen again, and that's what carried into this year. And so I think what we see is a group of people who probably delayed an upgrade last year. And then this year, they came back in on their normal rhythm."

I think, first of all, it has to do with both customers and monetization. On the customer side, while we continue to see strong growth in QBO in the U.S., we believe we have upside opportunity with better execution, stronger product, market fit and just a continued learning curve outside the U.S. And also, we're in the early days of QuickBooks Self-Employed; 85,000 paying subs now versus 25,000 12 months ago. And we really learned a lot this year as we put the bundle together with TurboTax and we went after people like the Uber drivers and the Lyft drivers. So we think there's a lot of opportunity to continue to grow the customer base. Then when you get to monetization, there is an opportunity there, and we can see the tailwind at our back or we can feel the tailwind at our back rather. One is, we see opportunity to continue to improve attach. The second is, as those customers move off of promotional pricing and they hit their 13th month, the average revenue per customer goes up about 50%. And the third is, we did just pass through a modest price increase in QuickBooks Online. It's gone out to the new customers. And we're in the process of rolling it out to existing base. And those 3 things combined help us drive the average revenue per customer, which ultimately drives up the QBO revenue. So it's those 2 things that we see continuing to drive improved performance in QBO."

I'll start first with the strategic role ProConnect plays in the business. The accountants are not only the key to small businesses making their accounting, payroll and payments decisions, so they have a very important role to help us work with small businesses and help them be successful. But obviously, they also have a business that they monetize, where they do tax returns for consumers and small businesses. And we are laser-focused on the multiservice firm. Those are the people who do both books and taxes, not only for consumers, but also for small businesses. And that's a very large population. So one of the things that we've chosen to do is we step back and said, let's look at how we lined up our product and pricing to better serve those customers. And some of it requires us building better collaboration between QuickBooks and their tax product, and so we're in the process of building that R&D out. And some of it is we needed to stop pricing for every single piece that we were giving the accountant. So for example, this year, we've chosen to give QuickBooks Online for accountants -- to the accountants for free. We don't charge them. Another thing we chose to do this year is not to take a price increase at the normal levels we would on the tax product. And instead, we're starting to build that into the accounting product. So we've stopped taking price everywhere we historically did. And as a result of that, we're kind of backing off on the revenue growth short term on the ProTax half of the house, but we think long term that's going to accelerate the overall revenue growth for the company."

Well, first of all, one of the pieces of good news is, anyone who is in the desktop ProAdvisor network is also now in the cloud network. So we gave them a cloud package. We trained them.

In fact, the last numbers I saw, we were north of 600,000 accountants who had at least 1 customer on QBO. And then those who actually have 3-plus customers have more than doubled in the last 12 months. And we see those as great leading indicators of not only cloud adoption on the accountant side, but them recommending it to their clients. So that's one thing, which is the desktop ProAdvisors have come along with us. The second is our ProAdvisor program is a global program. So we're enrolling accountants in all the countries. And as I think you alluded to in your question, in some countries, the accountant's recommendation carries even more weight than it does in the U.S. There are some countries where, for example, France, the accountant is the end-all and be-all in terms of making the final decision on whether this product is ready for a small business client to use. So we partner very closely with those accounting professionals to make sure that they feel good, they're certified and they're endorsing our product. So by and large, what you see is on a case-by-case basis, this cloud-based product is available to desktop. It's available in all the countries.

We had a couple of big quarters a year ago, which meant that in the late third quarter, early fourth quarter, you had a little bit more customers than usual coming off that promotional period and paying the full price.

For the fourth quarter, we delivered revenue of $754 million, which was up 8%. We've continued to build on our momentum throughout the year with fiscal 2016 revenue coming in at $4.7 billion, up 12%. 
Let me begin by sharing a few reflections on our business performance, and I'll start with Small Business.
With the shift to the cloud and mobile solutions, the opening of our platform to enable third parties to connect and our expansion into new geographies outside the U.S., we have more than doubled our total addressable market. Our primary goal is to penetrate this large addressable market, growing our customer base and expanding share in every geography. 
Our Small Business ecosystem remains vibrant, with total QuickBooks Online subscribers growing 41% this year to more than 1.5 million subs. We added more than 400,000 QuickBooks Online subscribers over the past 12 months. 
We're leaning in to new offerings like QuickBooks Self-Employed while continuing to post strong growth in QuickBooks Online overall. We finished the year with about 85,000 self-employed subscribers, which is up from 25,000 just 1 year ago. Outside the U.S., QuickBooks Online grew 45% to 287,000 paying subs. In short, QuickBooks Online continues on a strong trajectory, and we're executing well against a consistent set of priorities. We're realizing our goal to be the operating system behind small business success, helping small businesses save time and money so they can thrive when times are good, and they can remain resilient when times are tough. 
We're also delivering outstanding results against our other strategic goal: to do the nations' taxes. For the fiscal year, Consumer Tax revenue grew 10%, with TurboTax Online units growing 15% and total TurboTax units growing 12%. We performed extremely well this past year, introducing 2 dozen innovations in TurboTax, which helps expand the do-it-yourself software category while increasing our share in the category as well. We fully anticipate another competitive tax season next year, and our teams are already hard at work building on the next wave of innovations at a pace that promises to exceed this year's. 
On the ProConnect side, revenue came in as expected at $428 million. Our ProConnect team is continuing to increase the focus on multiservice accountants. Those are accountants who do both books and taxes for their clients. This is in service to driving those accounting firms' success as well as growing our own Small Business ecosystem.
To sum it up, fiscal 2016 was a strong year from start to finish. The QuickBooks Online ecosystem is driving Small Business growth, and our tax businesses are celebrating a successful season. We're heading into fiscal 2017 with the wind at our backs, and we have some exciting plans underway as we look ahead.
So with that, let me turn it over to Neil to walk you through the financial details."
21171,378256502,1038535,"Intuit Inc., Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 23, 2016",2016-08-23,"Earnings Calls","Intuit Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Brad, and good afternoon, everyone. For the fourth quarter, we delivered revenue of $754 million, up 8%; non-GAAP operating income of $36 million; a GAAP operating loss of $56 million; non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.08; and a GAAP loss",785,"Thanks, Brad, and good afternoon, everyone. For the fourth quarter, we delivered revenue of $754 million, up 8%; non-GAAP operating income of $36 million; a GAAP operating loss of $56 million; non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.08; and a GAAP loss per share of $0.16. 
For the full year, we delivered revenue of $4.7 billion, up 12%; non-GAAP operating income of $1.6 billion, up 36%; GAAP operating income of $1.2 billion, up 68%; non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.78, up 46%; and GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.69, up from $1.28 a year ago. 
As a reminder, our GAAP results for fiscal 2015 and 2016 reflect the decision to divest certain businesses in fiscal 2015 and the sale of those businesses in fiscal 2016. You can refer to our press release for more details. 
Turning to the business segments. Total Small Business segment revenue grew 10% for the quarter and 9% for the year. QuickBooks Online subscriber growth finished the year strong at 41%, as we crossed the high end of our guidance to finish with 1,513,000 paid subs. Small Business Online Ecosystem revenue grew 25% for the full year, and we expect some acceleration in fiscal 2017. 
Within the online ecosystem, our payroll and payments businesses posted healthy growth for the year: Online Payroll customers grew 17%; online active payment customers grew 6%; and online payments charge volume grew 15%.
And while QuickBooks Online is driving the majority of our new customer acquisition, QuickBooks Desktop remains a resilient and important part of the business. Desktop units grew 14% in the quarter and 8% for the year as we saw a bump-up in customer upgrades. Roughly 2/3 of the desktop units we sold in fiscal 2016 were upgrades as opposed to new units. New desktop customers were essentially flat year-over-year. Total Small Business desktop ecosystem revenue grew 4% for the year. For fiscal 2017, we expect units to decline modestly and desktop ecosystem revenue to be flat to up slightly.
Moving over to tax. Consumer Tax revenue grew 10% for the year. As Brad said, we will continue to invest in the product experience and to prioritize growth in customers above margin expansion. 
ProConnect revenue grew 51% for the year due to changes in our offerings that resulted in lower ratable revenue recognition in fiscal 2015. As I mentioned on the earnings call in May, we expect ProConnect revenue to be roughly flat in fiscal 2017.
We continue to take a disciplined approach to capital management, investing the cash we generate in opportunities that yield a return on investment greater than 15%. With approximately $1.1 billion in cash and investments on our balance sheet, our first priority is investing for customer growth. 
When it's the best use of cash, we'll return cash to our shareholders via share repurchases. In fiscal 2016, we repurchased $2.3 billion worth of shares at an average price of $91. We reduced our weighted average share count by 7% net in fiscal 2016, and we expect to be in the market consistently in fiscal 2017. We have a total of $2.4 billion on our repurchase authorization, including $2 billion recently approved by our board.
Our plans include a cash dividend of up to $1.36 per share for fiscal 2017, with the first quarter dividend of $0.34 per share payable on October 18. This represents a 13% increase versus last year and reflects our confidence in our business strategy as well as more recurring and predictable revenue streams. You can find guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. 
Here are the highlights for fiscal 2017: QuickBooks Online subscribers of 2 million to 2.2 million, growth of 32% to 45%; revenue of $5 billion to $5.1 billion, growth of 7% to 9%; non-GAAP operating income of $1.675 billion to $1.725 billion, growth of 8% to 11%; GAAP operating income of $1.33 billion to $1.38 billion, growth of 7% to 11%; non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $4.30 to $4.40 for growth of 14% to 16%; GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.35 to $3.45 versus $3.69 in fiscal 2016. Fiscal 2016 earnings per share includes $0.65 net income per share from discontinued operations. 
We feel confident in our ability to deliver against our financial principles and our long-term strategic goals, and we look forward to sharing our progress with you throughout this fiscal year. 
On a personal note, we will miss Matt's outstanding contribution in investor relations. We are very fortunate to be adding his experience and business acumen to our ProConnect Group as we strengthen the connection between our accountant community and our Small Business ecosystem. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Brad."

Really nice go-to-market plans and programs there to capitalize on the TAM opportunity we see before us, and I think we've given ourselves some good opportunities on the revenue side by not focusing on price increase to drive revenue growth. The revenue growth that you're going to see in 2017 is largely driven by customer growth and customer accounts, and as you saw this year in Consumer Tax in 2016, we think they're just big opportunities to grow our customer base and continue to expand. So I think the margin expansion you're going to see in 2017 is going to be very well balanced between investments to drive growth in product improvements and also a very reasonable approach on the pricing side."

We have an increased focus on product/market fit. We have really good lessons learned from this year in terms of go-to-market plans on a country-by-country basis. We've been adding incredible talents. You probably saw the announcement of Lucas Watson joining us after 17 years of global experience at Procter & Gamble and 5 years over at Google.

Both girls are now at college. We love her. We celebrate her, and we're taking a 1-year victory lap because she let us know some time ago she was going to do that. And we began a very concerted search to look for someone who had digital experience, someone who had clear mobile experience and someone who had world-class marketing skills. And sometimes you'll find classical marketers from packaged goods who may not have as much digital experience. Or you'll find those who grew up in the digital world, but they don't really understand the platform marketing aspects. And we think we found a ringer in Lucas. As I mentioned, 17 years at Procter & Gamble through a range of different product lines, leading them across the globe; he ultimately took P&G online and led their digital efforts. And then from there, was recruited away by Google, and he helped monetize YouTube and, more recently, has been leading their innovative global solutions around the world. And so we're excited to have him because he brings both that classical marketing as well as digital experience. And what he'll be doing is be leading our sales channels. He'll be leading the company's marketing efforts, and the global country managers report directly into him. So he'll have the non-U.S. locations, and that's where his expertise will come to bear.

We saw healthy growth across the board. We saw QuickBooks Online subs at 41%. We saw the desktop customers growing 8%. If you look at those that are new to the franchise in QBO, it was north of 80%. It was 84% this quarter. And so there's just healthy growth across the board. And what's driving it is we're expanding the TAM. We're expanding the TAM in 3 ways. With the shift to cloud and mobile, more people are now considering accounting software than they would have in the past. They can come in and try it for free and then sign up for it if it's actually improving their effectiveness. The second thing that's helping us is we're getting the opportunity to connect our products with other products like PayPal and American Express, and so it gives us more consideration. And last, but not least, is the global expansion, which has opened up tens of millions of more prospects to our product that we couldn't have served a couple of years ago. So that's one big bucket. It's just expanding the TAM. The second is we did see a strong repurchase cycle in desktop this year. So the desktop units rebounded, and it was primarily because we saw people who were coming at the end of their 3-year cycle and they upgraded, and they were able to buy the newest version of QuickBooks desktop. And that gave us a little bit of bump here in the last half of this fiscal year. But by and large, we do think this is sustainable. We've opened up the total addressable market. We think that cloud and mobile is going to help us. And we think there will be a group of customers that'll still want to be on desktop, and we plan to have a great desktop product as well."

We'll stand up in front you and share the things we feel good about and the areas we think we can improve.

We know we're capable of more. We have good products and we know we have the opportunity to get out there and accelerate this total addressable market and penetrating that market. So that's just the candid reality. We talk about it that way inside the company. But that said, I got to tell you, we have some real momentum being built up in the U.K., early start in France and Brazil, and strong momentum in Australia. Canada has rebounded. So as we told you, our one issue we had in Canada is we had tried to sell QuickBooks Online in a box in a retail store. It was an experiment we had tried in the U.S. that didn't work, and we shut it down, but we let it go in Canada a little while longer. We saw the same sort of attrition issues. And so we pulled it out and we created a grow-over problem. That's now in our rearview mirror. So Canada is moving in the right direction. India is the one that we're trying to develop a model that shifts away from the accountant and focuses directly on small business and then looks for ways to monetize that over the long term. And we're running a series of experiments in India, but it's is a very small part of the base. But that's the one that I would tell you that we still have several alternatives that we're exploring, but we don't have the go-to-market model figured out in India yet. And so that's how I feel about overall global. I don't want to paint a black picture over this. I think there are some really shining areas, but when you put it all together, 287,000 paid subs growing at 45%, I know we're capable of more and our aspirations are to accelerate that performance."

And so really, nothing has changed there. We're in the fourth year near -- fourth year now of a multiyear journey to basically get taxes done with little to no effort at all. And we've been putting a lot of innovation into the product. Last year, there were 2 dozen innovations we introduced in TurboTax. The typical year was 6. That platform is in place. And we anticipate as many or even more innovative new ideas going into the product this coming season. So it's really going to be about the product doing a better job and just growing our customer base. We're not going to rely on price increases, and we're just going to rely on continuing to expand the category and grow share."

If we see those customer growth rates expand faster than we expected, we see investments playing off, then we have opportunities to reallocate within the company and put dollars to where they're getting the best return and the best outlook. I think we have a pretty rigorous process, though, of reallocating internally to things that are working really well and dialing back things that are not generating what we expected when we built the plan together. So we have an internal process I think works pretty well. We look at the customer growth and how we're doing with the revenue per customer quite frequently. LTV-to-CAC, Brad's already mentioned. And so we have opportunities to adjust and reallocate money that we're going to spend internally pretty frequently throughout the year. And we do that, as a matter of fact."

In fact, the number of migrations who moved from desktop to QuickBooks Online this year within our own customer base was up 25%. So we've done work with our customer base in the desktop to figure out why they aren't interested in the cloud. And reasons 1 through 5 are all basically: I'm not ready to move to the cloud; I don't want to put my data in the cloud; I don't want to move to a subscription service; my current product is working just fine; my accountant is working with me and they've got a desktop version. Those are the kinds of reasons. In fact, only 14% cite feature parity. So we want to make sure we keep these customers in the franchise. We want to continue to get their accountant comfortable with using the cloud version. And we want to continue to let them know that we can help them migrate to the cloud when they're ready. As long as they stay with Intuit, we're happy. But right now, that's sort of bucket 1 which is, there really aren't any major barriers other than their mindset and comfort level with the cloud. The second side is the repurchase cycle. We see this happen. And last year, we had raised the price on desktop. We did it for the first half of the year thinking that might actually drive people to the cloud. What we now realize is it wasn't a price issue, it was a mindset. And so when we brought it back down to more normalized promotions, we started to see the regular repurchase cycle happen again, and that's what carried into this year. And so I think what we see is a group of people who probably delayed an upgrade last year. And then this year, they came back in on their normal rhythm."

I think, first of all, it has to do with both customers and monetization. On the customer side, while we continue to see strong growth in QBO in the U.S., we believe we have upside opportunity with better execution, stronger product, market fit and just a continued learning curve outside the U.S. And also, we're in the early days of QuickBooks Self-Employed; 85,000 paying subs now versus 25,000 12 months ago. And we really learned a lot this year as we put the bundle together with TurboTax and we went after people like the Uber drivers and the Lyft drivers. So we think there's a lot of opportunity to continue to grow the customer base. Then when you get to monetization, there is an opportunity there, and we can see the tailwind at our back or we can feel the tailwind at our back rather. One is, we see opportunity to continue to improve attach. The second is, as those customers move off of promotional pricing and they hit their 13th month, the average revenue per customer goes up about 50%. And the third is, we did just pass through a modest price increase in QuickBooks Online. It's gone out to the new customers. And we're in the process of rolling it out to existing base. And those 3 things combined help us drive the average revenue per customer, which ultimately drives up the QBO revenue. So it's those 2 things that we see continuing to drive improved performance in QBO."

I'll start first with the strategic role ProConnect plays in the business. The accountants are not only the key to small businesses making their accounting, payroll and payments decisions, so they have a very important role to help us work with small businesses and help them be successful. But obviously, they also have a business that they monetize, where they do tax returns for consumers and small businesses. And we are laser-focused on the multiservice firm. Those are the people who do both books and taxes, not only for consumers, but also for small businesses. And that's a very large population. So one of the things that we've chosen to do is we step back and said, let's look at how we lined up our product and pricing to better serve those customers. And some of it requires us building better collaboration between QuickBooks and their tax product, and so we're in the process of building that R&D out. And some of it is we needed to stop pricing for every single piece that we were giving the accountant. So for example, this year, we've chosen to give QuickBooks Online for accountants -- to the accountants for free. We don't charge them. Another thing we chose to do this year is not to take a price increase at the normal levels we would on the tax product. And instead, we're starting to build that into the accounting product. So we've stopped taking price everywhere we historically did. And as a result of that, we're kind of backing off on the revenue growth short term on the ProTax half of the house, but we think long term that's going to accelerate the overall revenue growth for the company."

Well, first of all, one of the pieces of good news is, anyone who is in the desktop ProAdvisor network is also now in the cloud network. So we gave them a cloud package. We trained them. We certified them. And they're increasingly recommending their customers to use QuickBooks Online. In fact, the last numbers I saw, we were north of 600,000 accountants who had at least 1 customer on QBO. And then those who actually have 3-plus customers have more than doubled in the last 12 months. And we see those as great leading indicators of not only cloud adoption on the accountant side, but them recommending it to their clients. So that's one thing, which is the desktop ProAdvisors have come along with us. The second is our ProAdvisor program is a global program. So we're enrolling accountants in all the countries. And as I think you alluded to in your question, in some countries, the accountant's recommendation carries even more weight than it does in the U.S. There are some countries where, for example, France, the accountant is the end-all and be-all in terms of making the final decision on whether this product is ready for a small business client to use. So we partner very closely with those accounting professionals to make sure that they feel good, they're certified and they're endorsing our product. So by and large, what you see is on a case-by-case basis, this cloud-based product is available to desktop. It's available in all the countries.

I think the more -- the healthier statistic longer term is to see the customer growth accelerate, but that's the main driver between the improvement you see in the fourth quarter is just more of those customers coming off. We had a couple of big quarters a year ago, which meant that in the late third quarter, early fourth quarter, you had a little bit more customers than usual coming off that promotional period and paying the full price.

In the first quarter, we grew revenue 9%, exceeded our QuickBook",687,"All right. Thank you, Jerry. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Fiscal 2017 is off to a strong start, and we're building on the momentum that we developed in fiscal 2016. 
In the first quarter, we grew revenue 9%, exceeded our QuickBooks Online subscriber guidance and we beat our overall financial targets. With that backdrop, let me begin by sharing a few reflections on our business performance, and I'll start with Small Business. 
QuickBooks Online continue to gain traction as we pursue a large global market opportunity. Our goal remains to be the operating system behind Small Business success, helping small businesses save time and improve their cash flow, so that they thrive when times are good and they remain resilient when times are tough.
Total QBO subscribers grew 41% in the quarter to more than 1.6 million subs. We drove acceleration in our Small Business market outside the U.S., where QuickBooks Online grew 50% to 323,000 subscribers, up from 45% in fiscal 2016. The increase came in Canada, the U.K. and Australia with subscriber growth in the U.K. accelerating to 87%, which was up from 78%. We continue to focus our efforts on improving the product market fit in the remaining countries, which include India, Brazil and France, and we'll report more on our progress with these efforts in the coming quarters. 
QuickBooks Self-Employed is also contributing to the acceleration of subscribers. Roughly 110,000 of our QBO subscribers are using QuickBooks Self-Employed. This is compared to 85,000 last quarter and 35,000 a year ago. We've now launched QuickBooks Self-Employed in the U.K. and in Australia as well. 
I'm encouraged by the start in our Small Business Group, but I also expect our momentum to continue accelerating in the second half as we drive towards our QBO subscriber target of 2 million to 2.2 million subs for the full fiscal year. I'm confident in this acceleration because of the innovation that we have coming to market, including improvements in the core QBO platform that simplify the first use experience, including enabling small businesses to generate their first profit and loss statement in less than 5 minutes. 
We've also introduced a new smart invoicing capability that allows for real-time tracking of the invoice status in both QuickBooks Online and QuickBooks Self-Employed. We've also enhanced the QuickBooks Self-Employed user experience with the ability to now receive payments on mobile devices and always on mileage tracking. And finally, our recently introduced partnership with Google enable the seamless integration between QuickBooks Online and Google Calendar. 
Based on the strong product market fit that we have with Canada, the U.K. and Australia, we're leaning into greater go-to-market activity behind QBO in these countries. It's these factors that support our confidence in the continued acceleration of QBO subscribers in the back half of the fiscal year.
With that overview on Small Business, let's talk tax. We're gearing up for another exciting tax season in TurboTax by continuing our multiyear investment and product innovation. Those product innovations are focused on reimagining the tax preparation process while driving customer growth and increasing market share. We also continue to promote a set of best practices and standards within the industry that enable the IRS and the state to improve the ability to combat tax fraud. 
In ProConnect, we're focused on serving multiservice accountants to do both books and taxes for their customers. Our goal is to be the operating system behind the accountant's successes as well. In service to this goal, we're providing one location within QuickBooks Online for accountant, where the accountant can access all of their workflows.
Several exciting innovations are underway to begin to leverage the capabilities that we've developed in TurboTax within our accountant's offering, including increasing the number of documents that can be automatically uploaded, which reduces data entry. 
We expect these innovations to help us further strengthen our accountant relationships by helping drive QuickBooks growth over time. So across the board, we're off to a strong start in all of our businesses. And with that, let me turn it over to Neil to walk you through the financials."

For the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we delivered revenue of $778 million, up 9%; GAAP operating loss of $61 million; non-GAAP operating income of $32 million; a GAAP loss per share of $0.12; and non-GAAP dilut",542,"Thanks, Brad, and good afternoon, everyone. For the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we delivered revenue of $778 million, up 9%; GAAP operating loss of $61 million; non-GAAP operating income of $32 million; a GAAP loss per share of $0.12; and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.06. Note that our GAAP earnings per share includes the impact of the early adoption of the new accounting standard update for share-based compensation. This update requires excess tax benefits realized upon the settlement of a share-based compensation award to flow through the earning statement instead of the balance sheet.
We expect this accounting change to reduce our GAAP tax rate from approximately 34% to approximately 32% for full fiscal 2017. The impact on GAAP earnings per share is an increase of approximately $0.07 in the first quarter and $0.12 for the full year.
Turning to the business segments. Total Small Business revenue grew 11% for the quarter. As Brad mentioned, QuickBooks Online subscriber growth remained strong, and we exceeded our guidance for the quarter, reaching 1,638,000 subs, up 41% year-over-year. Small Business Online Ecosystem revenue grew 26% for the quarter.
As we discussed at Investor Day, we're focused on driving customer growth first, followed by online ecosystem revenue. We expect online ecosystem revenue to grow 25% to 30% this year, accelerating as the year progresses. 
QuickBooks Desktop remains a resilient and important part of our business. The first quarter was exceptionally strong for desktop units, up 23%, as unusually higher renewals from existing desktop customers were driven by operating system upgrades. Our plan does not assume this growth continues throughout the year. Desktop ecosystem revenue grew 6% in the quarter.
Moving to tax. Consumer Tax revenue for Q1 was $60 million and ProConnect revenue was $112 million. This was in line with our expectations in a seasonally light quarter. To help with your modeling, we expect second quarter Consumer Tax revenue to grow about a point faster than last year given the way the calendar falls in January 2017. And as a reminder, we expect to provide a tax unit update in late February, concurrent with our second quarter earnings release. We will also provide a final unit update in late April after the tax season ends.
We continue to take a disciplined approach to capital management, investing the cash we generate and opportunities that yield a return on investment greater than 15% over 5 years. We ended the quarter with approximately $600 million in cash and investments on our balance sheet. Our first priority for the use of that cash is investing for customer growth. When is [ph] the best use of cash, we will return shareholders via share repurchase and dividends. We repurchased 1.8 million shares in the first quarter or $192 million and $2.2 billion remains on our authorization.
The board also approved the dividend of $0.34 per share payable January 18, 2017. You can find our fiscal 2017 Q2 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. We've reaffirmed our full year guidance with the one exception being higher GAAP earnings per share guidance due to the early adoption of the accounting standard update mentioned earlier. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Brad to close."

And as a result of that, Net Promoter Scores are going up, but we've leaned in to go-to-market activities in those countries.

And it was about 60-40 Windows and Mac. If you pull those out, it was basically flat to down 1% without the upgraders. And so I'd say that kind of normalizes things out for us. If you look at the total customer base and you count out the way we use to, which we no longer put out on the fact sheet, those are people using at least the last 3 years version of desktop or they're buying a subscription. The total base grew in the neighborhood of 5%, and that's up from where it was when we exited last year. And then if you break that down, you mentioned QBO subs are strong, 41%. The desktop got a boot to this upgrade cycle, which pushed it up to 23%. And you put it all together and the total paying customers in this last period was up a total of 33%. So I do not see cannibalization happening. I do think we were the beneficiary of this operating system upgrades. We are going to continue to have a good quality desktop offering, but we're leaning into the cloud and the customers are choosing the cloud. So I'd say that net-net, we're growing the category."

And what we found where we were getting units, but then they were thriving. They were driving off after a 90-day period. And so we literally didn't like the quality of the suband people got out and had to grow over. Canada has since been picking up momentum and growing. But the real upside was not just Canada. In the U.K. where we went from a 78% growth rate in Q4 to an 87% in Q1 shows that it is picking up momentum as is Australia. So I would tell you this is less about the year-over-year easy comp this is more of that product market fit and leaning to go-to-market and that's a kind of feedback we're hearing from customers.

The IRS working with the rest of the industry has decided to hold those refunds until February 15, which helps us increase W-2 verification and prevent fraud. We've been very supportive of that. We believe fundamentally, though, that the IRS and the industry still leaning in. So we're 9 out of 10 returns will actually get the refund back in 21 days. So we don't see a material change in the seasonality, but we're fully prepared to help those people get their money.

As talking about our first use experience.
The ability for a first-time user to come in and get to their P&L in less than 5 mins we think will be really cool for final conversion. The other thing is invoicing and tracking capability. Think about that like the ability to have uber or FedEx tracking for your invoice, where you literally can go in on your phone, you send the invoice and it lets you know it's been opened, then it lets you know if it's been paid and then it will send you an alter when factored into your account. And that's getting Small Businesses paid 15 days faster, over 2 weeks faster. And then we have other components for adding in as well as Google Calendar. The ability for someone to have their appointment in Google Calendar and then click on it, send an invoice and have a flow ride into QuickBooks and get paid. Those are all elements that not only help QBO outside the U.S, but what help accelerate our growth rate in the U.S. So we think there is fundamental strength in the United States.

And our goal is to eliminate 6 billion hours of tax. You don't even have to answer questions. And last year, we knocked off 40% of the time it takes to file an average tax return in TurboTax, and we leaned into a leading mobile offering that no one else has. And I think that is the source of our advantage and our market share gains. Just to give you a case in point. Last year, we had a competitor who matched Absolute Zero, not only matched it in terms of the product lineup, but they even kept it out in the market longer than we did. We ended the program March 31. They carried it through the end of tax season and we still took share. So my fundamental belief is that price is not a durable competitive advantage neither our promotions. It is the product and the experience you create for the customer. And we've got 3 or 4-year headstart on the players in the market by basically reimagining this next chapter. The second piece on the I mentioned a few minutes ago, we fought out of that business more than a decade ago. And you can go back and look, and I know you have spent  time talking about this. You can look at the do-it-yourself category group. You can also look at our market share gains within that category despite not having a refund anticipation loan. So we don't believe we're dealing with anything differently this year in terms of a row than we have for the last 10 to 12 years, and we're fundamentally leaning to the product experience.

Basically puts more energy into what are the other services you can offer a tax filer or if they willing to pay more for. And those are the things that our team has been leaning into over the last couple of years. So I would agree with the first concept. We don't believe it naturally suppresses ASP on the second concept. It just puts more innovation in the areas beyond the actual tax filing itself."

First of all, let me start with the reason why we try to talk about penetration rate is because we think that's in the ultimate pay off and that needs to ecosystem revenue growth. So right now, there's 2 big numbers that we look at. One is what's the QBO ecosystem revenue growth? And it's 26%, which is up a little from last quarter. And then the second peace is what are the penetration rates that payroll and payments into the QuickBooks Online base? And those are currently 15% for payroll and 6% for payment. Lots of upside opportunity but good stream. Now one of the leading indicators is an attach rate, which I to pull back on that because attach rates get muddied. They get modded because QuickBooks Self-Employed, by definition, does not have a payroll. They don't have anyplace but they go into the QuickBooks Online base. And if you start doing the math, you'll say, oh, we got a problem here. Attach is going down, but it's not. It's QuickBooks Self-Employed is coming a bigger part of the mix. The other thing that jumps off if you talk about attach rates is we will get promotions this time whether it say buy now without a bundle or it might even be something with a accountant to in turn and get the consumer start think about payroll and payments down the road, and then we can muddied the water. But I'll answer the question what are the attach rates right now. It was 15% in the quarter for payroll and it was 9% for payment that you have to put that caveat next to it, which is we had a big mix of QuickBooks Self-Employed and we also had some growth outside the United States where we don't yet offer for payroll and payments. And those numbers are going to make the attach rates with a little bit distorted. So I hope you stay focused on 26% ecosystem growth, which is up from 25%. That's the real help indicator."

In the first quarter, we grew revenue 9%, exceeded our QuickBook",687,"All right. Thank you, Jerry. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Fiscal 2017 is off to a strong start, and we're building on the momentum that we developed in fiscal 2016. 
In the first quarter, we grew revenue 9%, exceeded our QuickBooks Online subscriber guidance and we beat our overall financial targets. With that backdrop, let me begin by sharing a few reflections on our business performance, and I'll start with Small Business. 
QuickBooks Online continue to gain traction as we pursue a large global market opportunity. Our goal remains to be the operating system behind Small Business success, helping small businesses save time and improve their cash flow, so that they thrive when times are good and they remain resilient when times are tough.
Total QBO subscribers grew 41% in the quarter to more than 1.6 million subs. We drove acceleration in our Small Business market outside the U.S., where QuickBooks Online grew 50% to 323,000 subscribers, up from 45% in fiscal 2016. The increase came in Canada, the U.K. and Australia with subscriber growth in the U.K. accelerating to 87%, which was up from 78%. We continue to focus our efforts on improving the product market fit in the remaining countries, which include India, Brazil and France, and we'll report more on our progress with these efforts in the coming quarters. 
QuickBooks Self-Employed is also contributing to the acceleration of subscribers. Roughly 110,000 of our QBO subscribers are using QuickBooks Self-Employed. This is compared to 85,000 last quarter and 35,000 a year ago. We've now launched QuickBooks Self-Employed in the U.K. and in Australia as well. 
I'm encouraged by the start in our Small Business Group, but I also expect our momentum to continue accelerating in the second half as we drive towards our QBO subscriber target of 2 million to 2.2 million subs for the full fiscal year. I'm confident in this acceleration because of the innovation that we have coming to market, including improvements in the core QBO platform that simplify the first use experience, including enabling small businesses to generate their first profit and loss statement in less than 5 minutes. 
We've also introduced a new smart invoicing capability that allows for real-time tracking of the invoice status in both QuickBooks Online and QuickBooks Self-Employed. We've also enhanced the QuickBooks Self-Employed user experience with the ability to now receive payments on mobile devices and always on mileage tracking. And finally, our recently introduced partnership with Google enable the seamless integration between QuickBooks Online and Google Calendar. 
Based on the strong product market fit that we have with Canada, the U.K. and Australia, we're leaning into greater go-to-market activity behind QBO in these countries. It's these factors that support our confidence in the continued acceleration of QBO subscribers in the back half of the fiscal year.
With that overview on Small Business, let's talk tax. We're gearing up for another exciting tax season in TurboTax by continuing our multiyear investment and product innovation. Those product innovations are focused on reimagining the tax preparation process while driving customer growth and increasing market share. We also continue to promote a set of best practices and standards within the industry that enable the IRS and the state to improve the ability to combat tax fraud. 
In ProConnect, we're focused on serving multiservice accountants to do both books and taxes for their customers. Our goal is to be the operating system behind the accountant's successes as well. In service to this goal, we're providing one location within QuickBooks Online for accountant, where the accountant can access all of their workflows.
Several exciting innovations are underway to begin to leverage the capabilities that we've developed in TurboTax within our accountant's offering, including increasing the number of documents that can be automatically uploaded, which reduces data entry. 
We expect these innovations to help us further strengthen our accountant relationships by helping drive QuickBooks growth over time. So across the board, we're off to a strong start in all of our businesses. And with that, let me turn it over to Neil to walk you through the financials."

For the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we delivered revenue of $778 million, up 9%; GAAP operating loss of $61 million; non-GAAP operating income of $32 million; a GAAP loss per share of $0.12; and non-GAAP dilut",543,"Thanks, Brad, and good afternoon, everyone. For the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we delivered revenue of $778 million, up 9%; GAAP operating loss of $61 million; non-GAAP operating income of $32 million; a GAAP loss per share of $0.12; and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.06. Note that our GAAP earnings per share includes the impact of the early adoption of the new accounting standard update for share-based compensation. This update requires excess tax benefits realized upon the settlement of a share-based compensation award to flow through the earning statement instead of the balance sheet.
We expect this accounting change to reduce our GAAP tax rate from approximately 34% to approximately 32% for full fiscal 2017. The impact on GAAP earnings per share is an increase of approximately $0.07 in the first quarter and $0.12 for the full year.
Turning to the business segments. Total Small Business revenue grew 11% for the quarter. As Brad mentioned, QuickBooks Online subscriber growth remained strong, and we exceeded our guidance for the quarter, reaching 1,638,000 subs, up 41% year-over-year. Small Business Online Ecosystem revenue grew 26% for the quarter.
As we discussed at Investor Day, we're focused on driving customer growth first, followed by online ecosystem revenue. We expect online ecosystem revenue to grow 25% to 30% this year, accelerating as the year progresses. 
QuickBooks Desktop remains a resilient and important part of our business. The first quarter was exceptionally strong for desktop units, up 23%, as unusually higher renewals from existing desktop customers were driven by operating system upgrades. Our plan does not assume this growth continues throughout the year. Desktop ecosystem revenue grew 6% in the quarter.
Moving to tax. Consumer Tax revenue for Q1 was $60 million and ProConnect revenue was $112 million. This was in line with our expectations in a seasonally light quarter. To help with your modeling, we expect second quarter Consumer Tax revenue to grow about a point faster than last year, given the way the calendar falls in January 2017. And as a reminder, we expect to provide a tax unit update in late February, concurrent with our second quarter earnings release. We will also provide a final unit update in late April after the tax season ends.
We continue to take a disciplined approach to capital management, investing the cash we generate in opportunities that yield a return on investment greater than 15% over 5 years. We ended the quarter with approximately $600 million in cash and investments on our balance sheet. Our first priority for the use of that cash is investing for customer growth. When it's the best use of cash, we will return cash to shareholders via share repurchase and dividends. We repurchased 1.8 million shares in the first quarter for $192 million and $2.2 billion remains on our authorization. The board also approved the dividend of $0.34 per share payable January 18, 2017. 
You can find our fiscal 2017 Q2 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. We reaffirmed our full year guidance with the one exception being higher GAAP earnings per share guidance due to the early adoption of the accounting standard update mentioned earlier. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Brad to close."

You're right, at Investor Day, we were pretty candid and I was about seeing the opportunity outside the U.S. being much larger with the potential to grow faster than we were able to produce in fiscal year '16. Our teams are already on that. I'm simply the radioman. And the good news is they were working on closing out that last mile of getting the product compliant and at the levels that these countries expect. We got there for Canada, the U.K. and Australia. And as a result of that, Net Promoter Scores are going up, but we've leaned in to go-to-market activities in those countries. The team also had, and we've seen, by the way, the corresponding increase in growth from 45 up to 50. And I called out the U.K. specifically, which exited last year 78%, now it's 87%, and it's continued to build momentum. This other remaining countries have their own time line to get that last mile completed for product market fit and they're very near term that we expect to see those coming online as well. So I'm optimistic that we're on it. We know what the right levers are. And the first quarter shows that if we focus on, we can actually get the numbers moving in the direction we want. So you should hear some more optimistic in my tone now because I'm starting to see the proof points pay off."

So primarily, the desktop business was the result of the operating system upgrade. Windows 10 drove an upgrade cycle and then the operating system upgrade in Mac. And it was about 60-40 Windows and Mac. If you pull those out, it was basically flat to down 1% without the upgraders. And so I'd say that kind of normalizes things out for us. If you look at the total customer base and you count out the way we use to, which we no longer put out on the fact sheet, those are people using at least the last 3 years version of desktop or they're buying a subscription. The total base grew in the neighborhood of 5%, and that's up from where it was when we exited last year. And then if you break that down, you mentioned QBO subs are strong, 41%. The desktop got a boot to this upgrade cycle, which pushed it up to 23%. And you put it all together and the total paying customers in this last period was up a total of 33%. So I do not see cannibalization happening. I do think we were the beneficiary of this operating system upgrades. We are going to continue to have a good quality desktop offering, but we're leaning into the cloud and the customers are choosing the cloud. So I'd say that net-net, we're growing the category."

And the team is focused on that just like we are with our international expansion of QBO. I feel good that the team knows the right levers and we're continuing to optimize and improve.

And payments right now is in the neighborhood of 6% in penetration. And that's a little ahead of desktop. And we think that opportunity has more headroom as well. So our outlook is that we're going to continue to focus on this and we're going to continue to have you focus on the penetration numbers because that's the ultimate sign. But the payoff for us is we've been guiding subscriber growth at QBO greater than 40, and we saw it uptick to 41 and we've been guiding QBO ecosystem revenue of between 25 and 30, and we saw it tick up to 26 in this quarter.

Last year is we had a period where we didn't feel like our non-U.S. Growth was reflecting the kinds of opportunity that we see ahead of us. We did have 2 countries that were on a pivot, Canada and India. Canada was actually because we had tried to test the selling in QBO subscription in a retail box in retail stores. And what we found were we were getting units, but then they weren't thriving. They were dropping off after a 90-day period. And so we literally didn't like the quality of the sub and we pull that out and we had to grow over. Canada has since been picking up momentum and growing. But the real upside here was not just Canada. In the U.K. where we went from a 78% growth rate in Q4 to an 87% in Q1 shows that it's picking up momentum as is Australia. So I would tell you this is less about a year-over-year easy comp and this is more about that product market fit and leaning into go-to-market and that's the kind of feedback we're hearing from customers. And of course, we have the other 3 countries that we're getting to the last stage of product market fit as well and then we'll start to lean into those in the back half and that's why we feel like our 2 million to 2.2 million target is absolutely the right target to be given."

We're also very pleased with those results. And we think there's more in the barrel for us to get there. In fact, we talked about these innovations that really kicked in for the second half. As talking about that first-use experience.
The ability for a first-time user to come in and get to their P&L in less than 5 minutes, we think will be really cool for final conversion. The other thing is that invoicing tracking capability. Think about that like the ability to have Uber or FedEx tracking for your invoice, where you literally can go in on your phone, you send the invoice and it will let you know if it's been opened, then it will let you know if it's been paid, and then it will send you an alert when it's actually in your account. And that's getting Small Businesses paid 15 days faster, over 2 weeks faster. And then we have other components for adding in as well like Google Calendar. The ability for someone to have their appointment in Google Calendar and then click on it, send an invoice and have a flow right into QuickBooks and get paid. Those are all elements that not only help QBO outside the U.S, but will help accelerate our growth rate in the U.S. So we think there is fundamental strength in the United States. We're also looking at these non-U.S. markets, and we think these innovations would only add some fuel to that fire."

And our goal is to eliminate 6 billion hours of tax prep drudgery. You don't even have to answer questions. And last year, we knocked off 40% of the time it takes to file an average tax return in TurboTax, and we leaned into a leading mobile offering that no one else has. And I think that is the source of our advantage and our market share gains. Just to give you a case in point. Last year, we had a competitor who matched Absolute Zero, not only matched it in terms of the product lineup, but they even kept it out in the market longer than we did. We ended the program March 31. They carried it through the end of tax season and we still took share. So my fundamental belief is that price is not a durable competitive advantage, neither our promotions. It is the product and the experience you create for the customer. And we've got a 3- or 4-year head start on the players in the market by basically reimagining this next chapter. The second piece on the RAL, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, we fought out of that business more than a decade ago. And you can go back and look, and I know you have, and I'll spend time talking about this. You can look at the do-it-yourself category growth. You can also look at our market share gains within that category despite not having a refund anticipation loan. So we don't believe we're dealing with anything differently this year in terms of a RAL than we have for the last 10 to 12 years, and we're fundamentally leaning into the product experience, and we think it's going to be another competitive season, but I like what our team has in the pike and looking forward to the January 1 kickoff."

First of all, let me start with the reason why we try to talk about penetration rate is because we think that's the ultimate pay off and that leads to ecosystem revenue growth. So right now, there's 2 big numbers that we look at. One is what's the QBO Ecosystem revenue growth? And it's 26%, which is up a little from last quarter. And then the second piece is what are the penetration rates that payroll and payments into the QuickBooks Online base? And those are currently 15% for payroll and 6% for payment. Lots of upside opportunity but good strength. Now one of the leading indicators is an attach rate, we're trying to pull back on that because attach rates get muddied. They get muddied because QuickBooks Self-Employed, by definition, does not have a payroll. They don't have employees but they go into the QuickBooks Online base. And if you start doing the math, you'll say, oh, it looks like we got a problem here. Attach is going down, but it's not. It's QuickBooks Self-Employed becoming a bigger part of the mix. The other thing that throws you off when you talk about attach rates is we will do promotions at times whether it's a buy now without a bundle or it might even be something with accountant to in turn and get the consumer start to think about payroll and payments down the road, and those can muddy the water. But I'll answer the question on what are the attach rates right now. It was 15% in the quarter for payroll, and it was 9% for payment that you have to put that caveat next to it, which is we had a big mix of QuickBooks Self-Employed and we also had some growth outside of the United States where we don't yet offer payroll and payments. And those numbers are going to make the attach rates look a little bit distorted. So I would stay focused on 26% ecosystem growth, which is up from 25%. That's the real health indicator."

Fiscal 2017 is off to a strong start, and we're building on the momentum that we developed in fiscal 2016. 
In the first quarter, we grew revenue 9%, exceeded our QuickBooks Online subscriber guidance and we beat our overall financial targets. With that backdrop, let me begin by sharing a few reflections on our business performance, and I'll start with Small Business. 
QuickBooks Online continued to gain traction as we pursue a large global market opportunity. Our goal remains to be the operating system behind Small Business success, helping small businesses save time and improve their cash flow, so that they thrive when times are good and they remain resilient when times are tough.
Total QBO subscribers grew 41% in the quarter to more than 1.6 million subs. We drove acceleration in our Small Business market outside the U.S., where QuickBooks Online grew 50% to 323,000 subscribers, up from 45% in fiscal 2016. The increase came in Canada, the U.K. and Australia with subscriber growth in the U.K. accelerating to 87%, which was up from 78%. We continue to focus our efforts on improving the product market fit in the remaining countries, which include India, Brazil and France, and we'll report more on our progress with these efforts in the coming quarters. 
QuickBooks Self-Employed is also contributing to the acceleration of subscribers. Roughly 110,000 of our QBO subscribers are using QuickBooks Self-Employed. This is compared to 85,000 last quarter and 35,000 a year ago. We've now launched QuickBooks Self-Employed in the U.K. and in Australia as well. 
I'm encouraged by the start in our Small Business Group, but I also expect our momentum to continue accelerating in the second half as we drive towards our QBO subscriber target of 2 million to 2.2 million subs for the full fiscal year. I'm confident in this acceleration because of the innovation that we have coming to market, including improvements in the core QBO platform that simplify the first use experience, including enabling small businesses to generate their first profit and loss statement in less than 5 minutes. 
We've also introduced a new smart invoicing capability that allows for real-time tracking of the invoice status in both QuickBooks Online and QuickBooks Self-Employed. We've also enhanced the QuickBooks Self-Employed user experience with the ability to now receive payments on mobile devices and always on mileage tracking. And finally, our recently introduced partnership with Google enabled a seamless integration between QuickBooks Online and Google Calendar. 
Based on the strong product market fit that we have with Canada, the U.K. and Australia, we're leaning into greater go-to-market activity behind QBO in these countries. It's these factors that support our confidence in the continued acceleration of QBO subscribers in the back half of the fiscal year.
With that overview on Small Business, let's talk tax. We're gearing up for another exciting tax season in TurboTax by continuing our multiyear investment in product innovation. Those product innovations are focused on reimagining the tax preparation process while driving customer growth and increasing market share. We also continue to promote a set of best practices and standards within the industry that enable the IRS and the state to improve the ability to combat tax fraud. 
In ProConnect, we're focused on serving multiservice accountants to do both books and taxes for their customers. Our goal is to be the operating system behind the accountant's successes as well. In service to this goal, we're providing one location within QuickBooks Online for accountant, where the accountant can access all of their workflows.
Several exciting innovations are underway to begin to leverage the capabilities that we've developed in TurboTax within our accountant's offering, including increasing the number of documents that can be automatically uploaded, which reduces data entry. 
We expect these innovations to help us further strengthen our accountant relationships by helping drive QuickBooks growth over time. So across the board, we're off to a strong start in all of our businesses. And with that, let me turn it over to Neil to walk you through the financials."
21171,407644848,1089200,"Intuit Inc., Q1 2017 Earnings Call, Nov 17, 2016",2016-11-17,"Earnings Calls","Intuit Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Brad, and good afternoon, everyone. For the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we delivered revenue of $778 million, up 9%; GAAP operating loss of $61 million; non-GAAP operating income of $32 million; a GAAP loss per share of $0.12; and non-GAAP dilut",543,"Thanks, Brad, and good afternoon, everyone. For the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we delivered revenue of $778 million, up 9%; GAAP operating loss of $61 million; non-GAAP operating income of $32 million; a GAAP loss per share of $0.12; and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.06. Note that our GAAP earnings per share includes the impact of the early adoption of the new accounting standard update for share-based compensation. This update requires excess tax benefits realized upon the settlement of a share-based compensation award to flow through the earning statement instead of the balance sheet.
We expect this accounting change to reduce our GAAP tax rate from approximately 34% to approximately 32% for full fiscal 2017. The impact on GAAP earnings per share is an increase of approximately $0.07 in the first quarter and $0.12 for the full year.
Turning to the business segments. Total Small Business revenue grew 11% for the quarter. As Brad mentioned, QuickBooks Online subscriber growth remained strong, and we exceeded our guidance for the quarter, reaching 1,638,000 subs, up 41% year-over-year. Small Business Online Ecosystem revenue grew 26% for the quarter.
As we discussed at Investor Day, we're focused on driving customer growth first, followed by online ecosystem revenue. We expect online ecosystem revenue to grow 25% to 30% this year, accelerating as the year progresses. 
QuickBooks Desktop remains a resilient and important part of our business. The first quarter was exceptionally strong for desktop units, up 23%, as unusually higher renewals from existing desktop customers were driven by operating system upgrades. Our plan does not assume this growth continues throughout the year. Desktop ecosystem revenue grew 6% in the quarter.
Moving to tax. Consumer Tax revenue for Q1 was $60 million and ProConnect revenue was $112 million. This was in line with our expectations in a seasonally light quarter. To help with your modeling, we expect second quarter Consumer Tax revenue to grow about a point faster than last year, given the way the calendar falls in January 2017. And as a reminder, we expect to provide a tax unit update in late February, concurrent with our second quarter earnings release. We will also provide a final unit update in late April after the tax season ends.
We continue to take a disciplined approach to capital management, investing the cash we generate in opportunities that yield a return on investment greater than 15% over 5 years. We ended the quarter with approximately $600 million in cash and investments on our balance sheet. Our first priority for the use of that cash is investing for customer growth. When it's the best use of cash, we will return cash to shareholders via share repurchase and dividends. We repurchased 1.8 million shares in the first quarter for $192 million and $2.2 billion remains on our authorization. The board also approved a dividend of $0.34 per share payable January 18, 2017. 
You can find our fiscal 2017 Q2 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. We reaffirmed our full year guidance with the one exception being higher GAAP earnings per share guidance due to the early adoption of the accounting standard update mentioned earlier. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Brad to close."

And in Small Business, given we're in an expansion mode, investing and growing category, expanding into new geographies, we like to have that in the neighborhood of 40%. I wouldn't get too caught up in the first quarter. We had some things that we've moved around last year. We had our QuickBooks Connect conference that fell on the second quarter last year. This year, it fell on the first quarter. So that brought a little bit of the marketing spend forward. But right now, we actually feel good about the overall investments that we're making and our ability to deliver the kinds of margins that we typically talk to you about."

And the good news is they were working on closing out that last mile of getting the product compliant and at the levels that these countries expect. We got there for Canada, the U.K. and Australia. And as a result of that, Net Promoter Scores are going up, but we've leaned in to go-to-market activities in those countries. The team also had, and we've seen, by the way, the corresponding increase in growth from 45 up to 50. And I called out the U.K. specifically, which exited last year 78%, now it's at 87%, and it's continued to build momentum. These other remaining countries have their own time line to get that last mile completed for product market fit and they're very near term so we expect to see those coming online as well. So I'm optimistic that we're on it. We know what the right levers are. And the first quarter shows that if we focus on it, we can actually get the numbers moving in the direction we want.

So primarily, the desktop business was the result of the operating system upgrade. Windows 10 drove an upgrade cycle and then the operating system upgrade in the Mac. And it was about 60-40 Windows and Mac. If you pull those out, it was basically flat to down 1% without the upgraders. And so I'd say that kind of normalizes things out for us. If you look at the total customer base and you count it the way we used to, which we no longer put out on the fact sheet, those are people using at least the last 3 years’ version of desktop or they're buying a subscription. The total base grew in the neighborhood of 5%, and that's up from where it was when we exited last year. And then if you break that down, you mentioned QBO subs are strong, 41%. The desktop got a boot to this upgrade cycle, which pushed it up to 23%. And you put it all together and the total paying customers in this last period was up a total of 33%. So I do not see cannibalization happening. I do think we were the beneficiary of these operating system upgrades. We are going to continue to have a good quality desktop offering, but we're leaning into the cloud and the customers are choosing the cloud. So I'd say that net-net, we're growing the category."

And payments right now is in the neighborhood of 6% in penetration. And that's a little ahead of desktop. And we think that opportunity just has more headroom as well. So our outlook is that we're going to continue to focus on this and we're going to continue to have you focus on the penetration numbers because that's the ultimate sign. But the payoff for us is we've been guiding subscriber growth at QBO greater than 40, and we saw it uptick to 41 and we've been guiding QBO ecosystem revenue of between 25 and 30, and we saw it tick up to 26 in this quarter.

Last year is we had a period where we didn't feel like our non-U.S. growth was reflecting the kinds of opportunities we see ahead of us. We did have 2 countries that were in a pivot, Canada and India. Canada was actually because we had tried to test the selling of QBO subscription in a retail box in retail stores. And what we found were we were getting units, but then they weren't driving. They were dropping off after a 90-day period. And so we literally didn't like the quality of the sub and we pulled that out and we had to grow over. Canada has since been picking up momentum and growing. But the real upside here was not just Canada. In the U.K. where we went from a 78% growth rate in Q4 to an 87% in Q1 shows that it's picking up momentum as is Australia. So I would tell you this is less about a year-over-year easy comp and this is more about that product market fit and leaning into go-to-market and that's the kind of feedback we're hearing from customers. And of course, we have the other 3 countries that we're getting to the last stage of product market fit as well and then we'll start to lean into those in the back half and that's why we feel like our 2 million to 2.2 million target is absolutely the right target to be given."

Clearly, QuickBooks Self-Employed, as Brad mentioned, is growing quite nicely and, which is overall providing some downward pressure on our overall ASPs. We did implement a price change in QBO in the U.S. midway through the first quarter this year, which had a little bit of impact and will impact for the balance of the year. It's a very modest price increase, but it's on a fairly large base. And as we've already talked about, we're probably focused more on retention and driving the value of the accounting product outside of the U.S. where we don't have the same potential for payroll and payments attachment we do in the U.S. at this time. But first quarter looks good to us. Looks like we're very much on track with our expectations. You saw the acceleration in the Online Ecosystem revenue by a point. So it's early in the year.

As talking about that first-use experience.  The ability for a first-time user to come in and get to their P&L in less than 5 minutes, we think will be really cool for final conversion. The other thing is this invoicing tracking capability. Think about that like the ability to have Uber or FedEx tracking for your invoice, where you literally can go in on your phone, you send the invoice and it will let you know if it's been opened, then it will let you know if it's been paid, and then it will send you an alert when it's actually in your account.

The ability for someone to have their appointment in Google Calendar and then click on it, send an invoice and have it flow right into QuickBooks and get paid.

And our goal is to eliminate 6 billion hours of tax prep drudgery so you don't even have to answer questions.

Last year, we had a competitor who matched Absolute Zero, not only matched it in terms of the product lineup, but they even kept it out in the market longer than we did. We ended the program March 31. They carried it through the end of tax season and we still took share. So my fundamental belief is that price is not a durable competitive advantage, neither are promotions. It is the product and the experience you create for the customer. And we've got a 3- or 4-year head start on the players in the market by basically reimagining this next chapter. The second piece on RAL, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, we pulled out of that business more than a decade ago. And you can go back and look, and I know you have. You and I have spent time talking about this. You can look at the do-it-yourself category growth. You can also look at our market share gains within that category despite not having a refund anticipation loan.

But we feel even more optimistic as we look at the balance of the year because the new innovations that are hitting we think are going to add more fuel to the fire. And so I think if you look at QBO core in the United States, it's continuing to produce strong results with some cool innovations coming.
The second piece is we have QuickBooks Self-Employed that's going to add more fuel to the fire in the United States. And of course, we do have desktop migrators. In the first quarter, we got a little bit of a bump there with these operating system upgrades. The migrators were up about 50% year-over-year. Last year, they were up 25% overall. So that's always a little bit of tailwind as well. But we feel good about the United States and the QBO subs outlook as we look for the balance of the fiscal year."

So I know getting seasonality right on Consumer Tax is always a challenge for you guys. And so just to let you know, the way we see it playing out is we would see our second quarter growth in Consumer Tax about 1 point or so better than the growth rate we posted last year just because there are a couple of extra days customers can actually file their returns, taking into the weekend into account and getting them into our Q2.

And then the second piece is what are the penetration rates that payroll and payments into the QuickBooks Online base? And those are currently 15% for payroll and 6% for payments. Lots of upside opportunity but good strength. Now one of the leading indicators is an attach rate. We're trying to pull back on that because attach rates get muddied. They get muddied because QuickBooks Self-Employed, by definition, does not have a payroll. They don't have any employees but they go into the QuickBooks Online base. And if you start doing the math, you'll say, ""Uh-oh, it looks like we got a problem here. Attach is going down,"" but it's not. It's QuickBooks Self-Employed becoming a bigger part of the mix. The other thing that throws you off when you talk about attach rates is we will do promotions at times whether it's a buy now without a bundle or it might even be something with Accountant to in turn and get the consumer start to think about payroll and payments down the road, and those can muddy the water. But I'll answer the question on what are the attach rates right now. It was 15% in the quarter for payroll, and it was 9% for payments but you have to put that caveat next to it, which is we had a big mix of QuickBooks Self-Employed and we also had some growth outside of the United States where we don't yet offer payroll and payments. And those numbers are going to make the attach rates look a little bit distorted. So I would stay focused on 26% ecosystem growth, which is up from 25%. That's the real health indicator."

Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Fiscal 2017 is off to a strong start, and we're building on the momentum that we developed in fiscal 2016. In the first quarter, we grew revenue 9%, exceeded our QuickBook",687,"All right. Thank you, Jerry. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Fiscal 2017 is off to a strong start, and we're building on the momentum that we developed in fiscal 2016. 
In the first quarter, we grew revenue 9%, exceeded our QuickBooks Online subscriber guidance and we beat our overall financial targets. With that backdrop, let me begin by sharing a few reflections on our business performance, and I'll start with Small Business. 
QuickBooks Online continued to gain traction as we pursue a large global market opportunity. Our goal remains to be the operating system behind Small Business success, helping small businesses save time and improve their cash flow, so that they thrive when times are good and they remain resilient when times are tough.
Total QBO subscribers grew 41% in the quarter to more than 1.6 million subs. We drove acceleration in our Small Business market outside the U.S., where QuickBooks Online grew 50% to 323,000 subscribers, up from 45% in fiscal 2016. The increase came in Canada, the U.K. and Australia with subscriber growth in the U.K. accelerating to 87%, which was up from 78%. We continue to focus our efforts on improving the product market fit in the remaining countries, which include India, Brazil and France, and we'll report more on our progress with these efforts in the coming quarters. 
QuickBooks Self-Employed is also contributing to the acceleration of subscribers. Roughly 110,000 of our QBO subscribers are using QuickBooks Self-Employed. This is compared to 85,000 last quarter and 35,000 a year ago. We've now launched QuickBooks Self-Employed in the U.K. and in Australia as well. 
I'm encouraged by the start in our Small Business Group, but I also expect our momentum to continue accelerating in the second half as we drive towards our QBO subscriber target of 2 million to 2.2 million subs for the full fiscal year. I'm confident in this acceleration because of the innovation that we have coming to market, including improvements in the core QBO platform that simplify the first use experience, including enabling small businesses to generate their first profit and loss statement in less than 5 minutes. 
We've also introduced a new smart invoicing capability that allows for real-time tracking of the invoice status in both QuickBooks Online and QuickBooks Self-Employed. We've also enhanced the QuickBooks Self-Employed user experience with the ability to now receive payments on mobile devices and always on mileage tracking. And finally, our recently introduced partnership with Google enabled a seamless integration between QuickBooks Online and Google Calendar. 
Based on the strong product market fit that we have with Canada, the U.K. and Australia, we're leaning into greater go-to-market activity behind QBO in these countries. It's these factors that support our confidence in the continued acceleration of QBO subscribers in the back half of the fiscal year.
With that overview on Small Business, let's talk tax. We're gearing up for another exciting tax season in TurboTax by continuing our multiyear investment in product innovation. Those product innovations are focused on reimagining the tax preparation process while driving customer growth and increasing market share. We also continue to promote a set of best practices and standards within the industry that enable the IRS and the state to improve the ability to combat tax fraud. 
In ProConnect, we're focused on serving multiservice accountants to do both books and taxes for their customers. Our goal is to be the operating system behind the accountant's successes as well. In service to this goal, we're providing one location within QuickBooks Online for accountant, where the accountant can access all of their workflows.
Several exciting innovations are underway to begin to leverage the capabilities that we've developed in TurboTax within our accountant's offering, including increasing the number of documents that can be automatically uploaded, which reduces data entry. 
We expect these innovations to help us further strengthen our accountant relationships by helping drive QuickBooks growth over time. So across the board, we're off to a strong start in all of our businesses. And with that, let me turn it over to Neil to walk you through the financials."

For the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we delivered revenue of $778 million, up 9%; GAAP operating loss of $61 million; non-GAAP operating income of $32 million; a GAAP loss per share of $0.12; and non-GAAP dilut",543,"Thanks, Brad, and good afternoon, everyone. For the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we delivered revenue of $778 million, up 9%; GAAP operating loss of $61 million; non-GAAP operating income of $32 million; a GAAP loss per share of $0.12; and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.06. Note that our GAAP earnings per share includes the impact of the early adoption of the new accounting standard update for share-based compensation. This update requires excess tax benefits realized upon the settlement of a share-based compensation award to flow through the earning statement instead of the balance sheet.
We expect this accounting change to reduce our GAAP tax rate from approximately 34% to approximately 32% for full fiscal 2017. The impact on GAAP earnings per share is an increase of approximately $0.07 in the first quarter and $0.12 for the full year.
Turning to the business segments. Total Small Business revenue grew 11% for the quarter. As Brad mentioned, QuickBooks Online subscriber growth remained strong, and we exceeded our guidance for the quarter, reaching 1,638,000 subs, up 41% year-over-year. Small Business Online Ecosystem revenue grew 26% for the quarter.
As we discussed at Investor Day, we're focused on driving customer growth first, followed by online ecosystem revenue. We expect online ecosystem revenue to grow 25% to 30% this year, accelerating as the year progresses. 
QuickBooks Desktop remains a resilient and important part of our business. The first quarter was exceptionally strong for desktop units, up 23%, as unusually higher renewals from existing desktop customers were driven by operating system upgrades. Our plan does not assume this growth continues throughout the year. Desktop ecosystem revenue grew 6% in the quarter.
Moving to tax. Consumer Tax revenue for Q1 was $60 million and ProConnect revenue was $112 million. This was in line with our expectations in a seasonally light quarter. To help with your modeling, we expect second quarter Consumer Tax revenue to grow about a point faster than last year, given the way the calendar falls in January 2017. And as a reminder, we expect to provide a tax unit update in late February, concurrent with our second quarter earnings release. We will also provide a final unit update in late April after the tax season ends.
We continue to take a disciplined approach to capital management, investing the cash we generate in opportunities that yield a return on investment greater than 15% over 5 years. We ended the quarter with approximately $600 million in cash and investments on our balance sheet. Our first priority for the use of that cash is investing for customer growth. When it's the best use of cash, we will return cash to shareholders via share repurchase and dividends. We repurchased 1.8 million shares in the first quarter for $192 million and $2.2 billion remains on our authorization. The board also approved a dividend of $0.34 per share payable January 18, 2017. 
You can find our fiscal 2017 Q2 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. We reaffirmed our full year guidance with the one exception being higher GAAP earnings per share guidance due to the early adoption of the accounting standard update mentioned earlier. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to Brad to close."

Thank you, Neil. I have to say, I'm pleased with the strong start to the fiscal year, and I remain optimistic about the path we're on to grow our QuickBooks Online franchise here in the U.S. as well as in prioritized markets around the globe. 
We're building on our QBO momentum in Canada, the U.K. and Australia, and we've further expanded the category with relevant offerings, like QuickBooks Self-Employed. Our third annual QuickBooks Connect conference in late October was a great success with attendance up year-over-year, which reinforced the power of the ecosystem that is creating these indispensable connections between small businesses, accountants and developers. So in a headline, we like how we've come out of the gates in Q1, and we remain focused on delivering another great year. 
So with that, Latif, let's open it up and hear what's on everyone's minds."

And ultimately, as we look at the businesses, both tax businesses we like to see those business margins north of 60%. And in Small Business, given we're in an expansion mode, investing and growing category, expanding into new geographies, we like to have that in the neighborhood of 40%. I wouldn't get too caught up in the first quarter. We had some things that we've moved around last year. We had our QuickBooks Connect conference that fell on the second quarter last year. This year, it fell on the first quarter. So that brought a little bit of the marketing spend forward. But right now, we actually feel good about the overall investments that we're making and our ability to deliver the kinds of margins that we typically talk to you about."

Our teams are already on that. I'm simply the radioman. And the good news is they were working on closing out that last mile of getting the product compliant and at the levels that these countries expect. We got there for Canada, the U.K. and Australia. And as a result of that, Net Promoter Scores are going up, but we've leaned in to go-to-market activities in those countries. The team also had, and we've seen, by the way, the corresponding increase in growth from 45 up to 50. And I called out the U.K. specifically, which exited last year 78%, now it's at 87%, and it's continued to build momentum. These other remaining countries have their own time line to get that last mile completed for product market fit and they're very near term so we expect to see those coming online as well. So I'm optimistic that we're on it. We know what the right levers are. And the first quarter shows that if we focus on it, we can actually get the numbers moving in the direction we want. So you should hear some more optimistic in my tone now because I'm starting to see the proof points pay off."

So primarily, the desktop business was the result of the operating system upgrade. Windows 10 drove an upgrade cycle and then the operating system upgrade in the Mac. And it was about 60-40 Windows and Mac. If you pull those out, it was basically flat to down 1% without the upgraders. And so I'd say that kind of normalizes things out for us. If you look at the total customer base and you count it the way we used to, which we no longer put out on the fact sheet, those are people using at least the last 3 years’ version of desktop or they're buying a subscription. The total base grew in the neighborhood of 5%, and that's up from where it was when we exited last year. And then if you break that down, you mentioned QBO subs are strong, 41%. The desktop got a boot to this upgrade cycle, which pushed it up to 23%. And you put it all together and the total paying customers in this last period was up a total of 33%. So I do not see cannibalization happening. I do think we were the beneficiary of these operating system upgrades. We are going to continue to have a good quality desktop offering, but we're leaning into the cloud and the customers are choosing the cloud. So I'd say that net-net, we're growing the category."

And the team is focused on that just like we are with our international expansion of QBO. I feel good that the team knows the right levers and we're continuing to optimize and improve.

And payments right now is in the neighborhood of 6% in penetration. And that's a little ahead of desktop. And we think that opportunity just has more headroom as well. So our outlook is that we're going to continue to focus on this and we're going to continue to have you focus on the penetration numbers because that's the ultimate sign. But the payoff for us is we've been guiding subscriber growth at QBO greater than 40, and we saw it uptick to 41 and we've been guiding QBO ecosystem revenue of between 25 and 30, and we saw it tick up to 26 in this quarter.

Last year is we had a period where we didn't feel like our non-U.S. growth was reflecting the kinds of opportunities we see ahead of us. We did have 2 countries that were in a pivot, Canada and India. Canada was actually because we had tried to test the selling of QBO subscription in a retail box in retail stores. And what we found were we were getting units, but then they weren't driving. They were dropping off after a 90-day period. And so we literally didn't like the quality of the sub and we pulled that out and we had to grow over. Canada has since been picking up momentum and growing. But the real upside here was not just Canada. In the U.K. where we went from a 78% growth rate in Q4 to an 87% in Q1 shows that it's picking up momentum as is Australia. So I would tell you this is less about a year-over-year easy comp and this is more about that product market fit and leaning into go-to-market and that's the kind of feedback we're hearing from customers. And of course, we have the other 3 countries that we're getting to the last stage of product market fit as well and then we'll start to lean into those in the back half and that's why we feel like our 2 million to 2.2 million target is absolutely the right target to be given."

As talking about that first-use experience.  The ability for a first-time user to come in and get to their P&L in less than 5 minutes, we think will be really cool for final conversion. The other thing is this invoicing tracking capability. Think about that like the ability to have Uber or FedEx tracking for your invoice, where you literally can go in on your phone, you send the invoice and it will let you know if it's been opened, then it will let you know if it's been paid, and then it will send you an alert when it's actually in your account. And that's getting Small Businesses paid 15 days faster, over 2 weeks faster. And then we have other components for adding in as well like Google Calendar. The ability for someone to have their appointment in Google Calendar and then click on it, send an invoice and have it flow right into QuickBooks and get paid. Those are all elements that not only help QBO outside the U.S, but will help accelerate our growth rate in the U.S. So we think there is fundamental strength in the United States.

And our goal is to eliminate 6 billion hours of tax prep drudgery so you don't even have to answer questions. And last year, we knocked off 40% of the time it takes to file an average tax return in TurboTax, and we leaned into a leading mobile offering that no one else has. And I think that is the source of our advantage and our market share gains. Just to give you a case in point. Last year, we had a competitor who matched Absolute Zero, not only matched it in terms of the product lineup, but they even kept it out in the market longer than we did. We ended the program March 31. They carried it through the end of tax season and we still took share. So my fundamental belief is that price is not a durable competitive advantage, neither are promotions. It is the product and the experience you create for the customer. And we've got a 3- or 4-year head start on the players in the market by basically reimagining this next chapter. The second piece on RAL, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, we pulled out of that business more than a decade ago. And you can go back and look, and I know you have. You and I have spent time talking about this. You can look at the do-it-yourself category growth. You can also look at our market share gains within that category despite not having a refund anticipation loan. So we don't believe we're dealing with anything differently this year in terms of a RAL than we have for the last 10 to 12 years, and we're fundamentally leaning into the product experience, and we think it's going to be another competitive season, but I like what our team has in the pike and looking forward to the January 1 kickoff."

But if you go back to our Investor Day deck that we shared in the fall, we laid out some pretty good detail on the funnel, and it's actually on Page 63 of our Investor Day deck, just to let you know the specifics. And it talks about the facts we have roughly 92 million people who came in and visited TurboTax.com through tax season. And then it talks about how many of those converted into log in then actually filed a return. And then the net-net on that, and you'll see that we laid in there basically the improvements, the conversion and every step along the way and then the ultimate impact in retention. And I feel good about that. And then the following page talks on your -- talks to your free to paid. Obviously, we introduced free back in 2004, 2005, and we were getting about $29 of return and making about a 60% margin back then. Last year, even with the very aggressive Absolute Zero, we made $49 of return and margins were around 65%. And our free to pay continues to be a muscle we have refined and developed. We haven't broken down the actual percent, but how many of them we convert, but you can look at the aggregate number and see that not only are we driving the revenue per return, but we're also improving the margin. So that data is in that Investor Day material and hopefully, you'll get the chance to take a look at that, and it will give you a little more specifics on each of the key areas."

First of all, let me start with the reason why we try to talk about penetration rate is because we think that's the ultimate payoff and that leads to ecosystem revenue growth. So right now, there's 2 big numbers that we look at. One is what's the QBO Ecosystem revenue growth? And it's 26%, which is up a little from last quarter. And then the second piece is what are the penetration rates that payroll and payments into the QuickBooks Online base? And those are currently 15% for payroll and 6% for payments. Lots of upside opportunity but good strength. Now one of the leading indicators is an attach rate. We're trying to pull back on that because attach rates get muddied. They get muddied because QuickBooks Self-Employed, by definition, does not have a payroll. They don't have any employees but they go into the QuickBooks Online base. And if you start doing the math, you'll say, ""Uh-oh, it looks like we got a problem here. Attach is going down,"" but it's not. It's QuickBooks Self-Employed becoming a bigger part of the mix. The other thing that throws you off when you talk about attach rates is we will do promotions at times whether it's a buy now without a bundle or it might even be something with Accountant to in turn and get the consumer start to think about payroll and payments down the road, and those can muddy the water. But I'll answer the question on what are the attach rates right now. It was 15% in the quarter for payroll, and it was 9% for payments but you have to put that caveat next to it, which is we had a big mix of QuickBooks Self-Employed and we also had some growth outside of the United States where we don't yet offer payroll and payments. And those numbers are going to make the attach rates look a little bit distorted. So I would stay focused on 26% ecosystem growth, which is up from 25%. That's the real health indicator."
