This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's fourth quarter full year 2015 results.The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results",750,"Great. Thank you, Tia, and good morning, everyone. This is Ball Corporation's conference call regarding the company's fourth quarter full year 2015 results.
The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings, as well as the company news releases. Now if you don't already have our earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com.
Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found on our website. With regard to Ball's proposed offer for Rexam and consistent with the requirements of the U.K. Takeover Code, we will limit our comments regarding the transaction to: number one, what has already been made public via the 2/7 release; number two, where we are in the regulatory process; and number three, an update of ongoing economic hedging and debt activities related to the proposed transaction.
Also note that there may be limitations regarding the depth of our business commentary, as well as our future outlook, and certain other items we would normally discuss on a quarterly earnings conference call due to the nature of the proposed transaction and restrictions under the U.K Takeover Code.
Given the nature of our proposed offer, today's issued press release, webcast and conference call are advertisements and should not be considered a prospectus.

Now joining me on the call today is Scott Morrison, Senior Vice President and our Chief Financial Officer. I'll provide a brief overview of company's performance. Scott will discuss financial and global packaging metrics. And then I'll finish up with comments on our aerospace business and the outlook for 2016.
Our fourth quarter volumes, free cash flow and results from operations were in line with our expectations. The headwinds we acknowledged throughout 2015 around earnings translation, project start-up costs and tough volume comps in our North American food continued, while others like aluminum premium became a tailwind and a lower effective tax rate aided the quarter. Overall, however, we are pleased with the performance of our businesses. And Scott will go into more detail on the quarter and full year in just a moment.
Since we spoke last October, we've made notable progress to strategically and operationally position Ball for the future, including successfully beginning the production of beverage can ends in our existing Lublin, Poland facility, which is also slated for additional end modules in 2016. The successful start-up of our Monterrey, Mexico beverage can facility, which is serving multiple forum brewers importing their product into the U.S. The successful startup of the new aluminum impact impact extruded line in Devices U.K. as well as our recently announce aluminum impact extruded aerosol expansion in Belin, Czech Republic, which is expected to come online in early 2017.
The successful start-up of our new aluminum impact extruded aerosol facility in India, various investments to further the growth of our specialty can and new product portfolio; including our new contour bottle line in Conroe, Texas and our new tinplate aerosol technology in Chestnut, Hill, Tennessee. And the continued construction of our new beverage can plant in Myanmar now slated to open in April 2016.
We also completed the acquisition of the remaining interest in our Brazilian joint venture and received conditional regulatory approvals for our proposed offer for Rexam from the European Commission and Brazilian CADE. Discussions are ongoing with the FTC. 
We have weathered a very busy 2015 in terms of managing the headwinds, investing in our future and making progress with our Rexam acquisition. Everyone in our company has been extremely busy. And I want to thank everyone at Ball who has persevered and risen to the challenge. Thanks. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott for a review of our fourth quarter numbers."
170352,320626859,922430,"Ball Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2016",2016-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Ball Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John. Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share for fourth quarter 2015 were $0.80 versus last year's $0.84. And for the full year 2015, comparable diluted earnings per share were $3.48 versus $3.88 in 2014. Fourth quarter and full year compara",1064,"Thanks, John. Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share for fourth quarter 2015 were $0.80 versus last year's $0.84. And for the full year 2015, comparable diluted earnings per share were $3.48 versus $3.88 in 2014. Fourth quarter and full year comparable diluted earnings per share were unfavorably impacted by a net $0.04 and $0.49, respectively, related to foreign currency effects, start-up costs and other one-time items.
As John alluded to, the following factors contributed to to results in the fourth quarter. $0.06 of unfavorable foreign currency translation effects largely due to a weaker euro; $0.02 of start-up costs associated with capital projects and aluminum premium tailwind of $0.04. Year [indiscernible] for cash flow came in at $558 million after $520 million of CapEx and excluding roughly $80 million of cash costs associated with the Rexam transaction. 
Our GAAP results for the fourth quarter and full year 2015 were unfavorably impacted by the economic hedges we put in place to reduce currency exchange rate exposure associated with the British pound denominated cash portion of the announced acquisition price for Rexam and to mitigate exposure to interest rate changes associated with anticipated debt issuances, also in connection with the cash portion of the proposed transaction. These economic hedges allow us to lock in transaction's purchase price economics, where they will likely continue to cause disruption to quarterly GAAP earnings. Details on these economic hedges are provided in Note 2 of today's earnings release.
Credit quality and liquidity of the company remains very solid with comparable EBIT to interest coverage of 5.6x and net debt to comparable EBITDA of 2.5x, including the noncurrent restricted cash sitting in escrow from the December U.S. and Euro bond placements. The company has enough committed credit and available liquidity at year-end to consummate the proposed Rexam transaction and provide ongoing liquidity for the company.
For a complete summary of fourth quarter and full year 2015 results on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis and details regarding the fourth quarter and full year, please refer to the notes section of today's earnings release, which includes a simplified table format summarizing business consolidation activities.
Now moving to operations. Our metal beverage Americas and Asia segment comparable operating earnings for the fourth quarter and full year 2015 were down slightly year-over-year, mainly due to unfavorable pricing in China, slightly lower performance in Brazil and project start-up costs in North America. Segment volumes in the quarter were up approximately 5% and just up over 1% for the full year 2015. 
Our Monterrey, Mexico can plant just begun pressing cans and ends earlier this month. Our second can line will come up mid-year. In China, while volumes remain relatively healthy, the overall pricing environment remains extremely challenging, and our aggressive cost out programs have not been able to keep up with the price erosion and we expect to be down in profitability again in 2016 in this region.
European beverage comparable earnings were up nicely in the quarter due to aluminum premium tailwinds of EUR 6 million, as well as improved plant utilization for the full year. Comparable earnings were down approximately $20 million to unfavorable foreign earnings translation. On a constant currency basis, they were up year-over-year. Low single-digit volume growth and low double-digit specialty can growth continue to reflect the ongoing value-added benefits of the can with European consumers.
Food and household comparable segment earnings were down in the quarter, as segment volumes declined following the customer shift in U.S. food cans, as well as manufacturing inefficiencies. Excluding the customer shift, our food can volume or down slightly in the fourth quarter due to the earlier completion of the pack late in the third quarter went up for the full year.
For the fourth quarter and full year, the segment was also impacted by unfavorable earnings translation related to the European portion of the extruded aluminum aerosol business and startup costs related to luminous capital projects across the segment. Our next generation lightweight steel aerosoft can manufacturing technology is now commercially available on shelves, and further growth in our global extruded aluminum businesses, as well as significantly better operating performance in our tinplate businesses will provide good opportunity to improve segment performance in 2016.
In summary, our global packaging businesses are extremely focused on driving EVA dollars from our new capital projects. To employees listening in on today's call, thank you for all the great work during what has been one of the busiest times in our company's 136-year history. 
Now, as we look to 2016, reflecting Ball. As a stand-alone company today, here's a snapshot of some key financial metrics. We expect free cash flow to be in a similar range as 2015, excluding cash cost related to the Rexam transaction with CapEx expected to be in the range of $400 million and working capital expected to be generally flat year-over-year. Interest expense is expected to be roughly $145 million, excluding debt refinancing and other costs. The full year effective tax rate on comparable earnings is expected to be in the range of 25%.
Corporate undistributed is to be expected to be in the range of $75 million, a year-over-year reduction of $17 million. Also recall that due to the acquisition of our JV's partners interest in Brazil, our attorney shares at the beginning of this year are higher by 5.7 million shares, and we will no longer have any effects from this business in our noncontrolling just line on the income statement. We expect our dividend to remain unchanged from its current level during the proposed acquisition process.
In 2016, we expect all of our segments to be up on a full year basis with the exception of China beverage can business. And while we expect the first quarter to be relatively soft through the repricing of our contracts in China, challenging comps in our food and household products business, and the close out of startup expenses in our various capital projects, momentum will accelerate as we move through the years.
One final heads-up before I turn it over to John. As we look to the successful closing of the Rexam transaction, we currently plan to incorporate into our future comments a focus on cash, earnings per share to do large about of intangible amortization we expect to record for the Rexam transaction. And with that, I'll turn it back to you, John."

Subtractive backlog held steady ending the quarter at $617 million. More exciting, however, is what is in front of us. Over the past few months, our aerospace business has win a variety of classified and nonclassified programs that are worth over $800 million that have not yet been booked into our backlog as the contracts need to be signed and, in several cases, the funding needs to be approved by the U.S. government.
In addition, we still have a number of additional proposals submitted forward that collectively measuring the billions. A terrific job done by our folks, and we continue to be amazed by the creativity, agility and patience that they have shown. They near-term goals for the aerospace team are to finish strong on existing programs and ramp successfully on the new work throughout the second half of 2016.
Now turning to the future. We continue to make progress on our proposed offer for Rexam, and we look forward to reaping the benefits of growth capital deployed in 2015 to improve performance, as well as the higher EVA dollar generation that these important investments will provide. 
While our biggest challenge is to weather the unsustainable pricing environment in our China beverage can business, overall, we feel good about where we are. Our objectives are consistent with last year. Successfully execute our capital projects, generate strong free cash flow, grow our specialty businesses, focus on cost optimization and manufacturing performance and cross the finish line on the proposed offer for Rexam.
Together, we are working hard to improve Ball in 2016 and beyond, and we look forward to a successful year ahead. And with that, Tia, we are ready for questions."

I think on a Continental Europe basis, we are right in line with the market. Some of those exports that we had into Africa, as well as in the Middle East, which are a little bit slower. But again, I don't read into that much at all because it was in the fourth quarter, which is always seasonally slow. I will point out, and I have -- we've talked about this in the past that 2016 is an even numbered year. And typically, even numbered year, as there are many events, including the World Cup, including the various soccer matches that usually show a little bit better than the odd years. And so we're coming off an odd year where the overall market, as well as Ball, was up about 2%. So kind of in line with what our expectations.

We were up a bit more than that. I think a lot of the trends that we talked about in the past continue. Meaning, that the can continues to take share from other substrates in the beer category. I think specialty growth is occurring at a faster rate than the standard containers. We are almost at, not quite, but almost at a 50-50 mix between standard and specialty down in Brazil. And as we go into 2016, yes, there is a lot of political uncertainty and economic uncertainty. But the facts have not shown that the beverage can has been hurting. People are still eating. People are still drinking. And I think while the Olympics in Rio has helped, people have to remember, it is only just the Rio region, but that's a very densely populated area, so I think it should be beneficial. So as we sit here today, we're not expecting large growth in Brazil. But the can is holding up very well relative to other substrates and relative to other industries."

When you think about the projects we've talked about given on this call, let's start with Monterray, Mexico. It started up this month. And so, as you know, there's always a learning curve there, and Scott said we have alluded of start-up costs. So I would expect to kind of the typical learning curve and something like this is 3 to 6 months. And so I think, as we get to the certainly, the second half of the year, maybe a even a little second quarter, we'll start to see the benefit of that. And then we're going to get additional leverage as we put the second line on that's going to be starting up kind of second, late second, early third quarter. So you can hopefully see a trajectory there. In the fourth quarter last year, we started the new line into our devices in the U.K. and the impact extruded line. We started up the India plant. Anytime you start a new plant, the learning curve is a little bit longer than just adding existing lines or new lines into existing facilities. So I think that devices we feel pretty good about terms of getting results, how I think sooner rather than later. I think the India one is going to be a little bit longer. The Poland we talked about that we -- as we continue to ramp up the end production there, we should see the benefit as time goes on. But it's a ramp-up starting in early '16 as we go forward with that. and we talked about the Contour effects. Now in that we talked about the contour bottle rose to G3. it's on the -- we're making commercially -- commercial product right now. It's on the shelves right now. So we have high expectations as we go into 2016 that you're going to see some momentum there. All of that leads to exactly what Scott was saying that in the first quarter, we still have some sort of cost, and we're really not getting a lot of the benefits, but we're gaining momentum each month we go by in year 2016 and."

The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings as well as the company news releases. Now if you don't already have our earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com.
Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found on our website. With regard to Ball's proposed offer for Rexam and consistent with the requirements of the U.K. Takeover Code, we will limit our comments regarding the transaction to: number one, what has already been made public via the 2/7 release; number two, where we are in the regulatory process; and number three, an update of ongoing economic hedging and debt activities related to the proposed transaction.
Also note that there may be limitations regarding the depth of our business commentary as well as our future outlook, and certain other items we would normally discuss on an earnings conference call due to the nature of the proposed transaction and restrictions under the U.K Takeover Code.
Given the nature of our proposed offer, today's issued press release, webcast and conference call are advertisements and should not be considered a prospectus.

Now joining me on the call today is Scott Morrison, Senior Vice President and our Chief Financial Officer. I'll provide a brief overview of our company's performance, Scott will discuss financial and global packaging metrics and then I'll finish up with comments on our aerospace business and the outlook for 2016.
Our fourth quarter volumes, free cash flow and results from operations were in line with our expectations. The headwinds we acknowledged throughout 2015 around earnings translation, project start-up costs and tough volume comps in our North American food continued, while others like aluminum premium became a tailwind and a lower effective tax rate aided the quarter. Overall, however, we are pleased with the performance of our businesses. And Scott will go into more detail on the quarter and full year in just a moment.
Since we spoke last October, we've made notable progress to strategically and operationally position Ball for the future, including successfully beginning the production of beverage can ends in our existing Lublin, Poland facility, which is also slated for additional end modules in 2016. The successful start-up of our Monterrey, Mexico beverage can and end facility, which is serving multiple foreign brewers importing their product into the U.S. The successful start-up of a new aluminum impact extruded line in devices U.K. as well as our recently announced aluminum impact extruded aerosol expansion in Velim, Czech Republic, which is expected to come online in early 2017.
The successful start-up of our new aluminum impact extruded aerosol facility in India, various investments to further the growth of our specialty can and new product portfolio, including our new contour bottle line in Conroe, Texas; and our new tinplate aerosol technology in Chestnut Hill, Tennessee; and the continued construction of our new beverage can plant in Myanmar now slated to open in April 2016.
We also completed the acquisition of the remaining interest in our Brazilian joint venture and received conditional regulatory approvals for our proposed offer for Rexam from the European Commission and Brazilian CADE. Discussions are ongoing with the FTC.
We have weathered a very busy 2015 in terms of managing the headwinds, investing in our future and making progress with our Rexam acquisition. Everyone at our company has been extremely busy. And I want to thank everyone at Ball who has persevered and risen to the challenge. Thanks.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott for a review of our fourth quarter numbers."

Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share for fourth quarter 2015 were $0.80 versus last year's $0.84. And for the full year 2015, comparable diluted earnings per share were $3.48 versus $3.88 in 2014. Fourth quarter and full year compara",1061,"Thanks, John. Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share for fourth quarter 2015 were $0.80 versus last year's $0.84. And for the full year 2015, comparable diluted earnings per share were $3.48 versus $3.88 in 2014. Fourth quarter and full year comparable diluted earnings per share were unfavorably impacted by a net $0.04 and $0.49, respectively, related to foreign currency effects, start-up costs and other one-time items.
As John alluded to, the following factors contributed to results in the fourth quarter: $0.06 of unfavorable foreign currency translation effects largely due to a weaker euro; $0.02 of start-up costs associated with capital projects and aluminum premium tailwind of $0.04.
Year 2015 [ph] cash flow came in at $558 million after $528 million of CapEx and excluding roughly $80 million of cash costs associated with the Rexam transaction.
Our GAAP results for the fourth quarter and full year 2015 were unfavorably impacted by the economic hedges we put in place to reduce currency exchange rate exposure associated with the British pound denominated cash portion of the announced acquisition price for Rexam and to mitigate exposure to interest rate changes associated with anticipated debt issuances, also in connection with the cash portion of the proposed transaction. These economic hedges allow us to lock in transaction's purchase price economics, where they will likely continue to cause disruption to quarterly GAAP earnings. Details on these economic hedges are provided in Note 2 of today's earnings release.
Credit quality and liquidity of the company remains very solid with comparable EBIT to interest coverage at 5.6x and net debt to comparable EBITDA at 2.5x, including the noncurrent restricted cash sitting in escrow from the December U.S. and euro bond placements. The company has enough committed credit and available liquidity at year-end to consummate the proposed Rexam transaction and provide ongoing liquidity for the company.
For a complete summary of fourth quarter and full year 2015 results on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis and details regarding the fourth quarter and full year, please refer to the notes section of today's earnings release, which includes a simplified table format summarizing business consolidation activities.
Now moving to operations. Our metal beverage Americas and Asia segment comparable operating earnings for fourth quarter and full year 2015 were down slightly year-over-year, mainly due to unfavorable pricing in China, slightly lower performance in Brazil and project start-up costs in North America. Segment volumes in the quarter were up approximately 5% and just up over 1% for the full year 2015.
Our Monterrey, Mexico can plant just begun producing cans and ends earlier this month. Our second can line will come up mid-year. In China, while volumes remain relatively healthy, the overall pricing environment remains extremely challenging, and our aggressive cost out programs have not been able to keep up with the price erosion and we expect to be down in profitability again in 2016 in this region.
European beverage comparable earnings were up nicely in the quarter due to aluminum premium tailwinds of EUR 6 million as well as improved plant utilization for the full year. Comparable earnings were down approximately $20 million to unfavorable foreign earnings translation. On a constant currency basis, they were up year-over-year. Low single-digit volume growth and low double-digit specialty can growth continue to reflect the ongoing value-added benefits of the can with European consumers.
Food and household comparable segment earnings were down in the quarter, as segment volumes declined following the customer shift in U.S. food cans as well as manufacturing inefficiencies. Excluding the customer shift, our food can volumes were down slightly in the fourth quarter due to the earlier completion of the pack late in the third quarter, but up for the full year.
For the fourth quarter and full year, the segment was also impacted by unfavorable earnings translation related to the European portion of the extruded aluminum aerosol business and start-up costs related to numerous capital projects across the segment. Our next-generation lightweight steel aerosol can manufacturing technology is now commercially available on shelves, and further growth in our global extruded aluminum businesses as well as significantly better operating performance in our tinplate businesses will provide good opportunity to improve segment performance in 2016.
In summary, our global packaging businesses are extremely focused on driving EVA dollars from our new capital projects. To employees listening in on today's call, thank you for all the great work during what has been one of the busiest times in our company's 136-year history.
Now as we look to 2016, reflecting Ball, as a stand-alone company today, here's a snapshot of some key financial metrics. We expect free cash flow to be in a similar range as 2015, excluding cash cost related to the Rexam transaction with CapEx expected to be in the range of $400 million and working capital expected to be generally flat year-over-year. Interest expense is expected to be roughly $145 million, excluding debt refinancing and other costs. The full year effective tax rate on comparable earnings is expected to be in the range of 25%.
Corporate undistributed is to be expected to be in the range of $75 million, a year-over-year reduction of $17 million. Also recall that due to the acquisition of our JV's partners interest in Brazil, our outstanding shares at the beginning of this year are higher by 5.7 million shares, and we will no longer have any effects from this business in our noncontrolling interest line on the income statement. We expect our dividend to remain unchanged from its current level during the proposed acquisition process.
In 2016, we expect all of our segments to be up on a full year basis with the exception of China beverage can business. And while we expect the first quarter to be relatively soft through the repricing of our contracts in China, challenging comps in our food and household products business and the close out of start-up expenses in our various capital projects, momentum will accelerate as we move through the years.
One final heads-up before I turn it over to John. As we look to the successful closing of the Rexam transaction, we currently plan to incorporate into our future comments a focus on cash, earnings per share to do large about of intangible amortization we expect to record for the Rexam transaction.
And with that, I'll turn it back to you, John."

Over the past few months, our aerospace business has won a variety of classified and nonclassified programs that are worth over $800 million that have not yet been booked into our backlog as the contracts need to be signed and in several cases, the funding needs to be approved by the U.S. government.
In addition, we still have a number of additional proposals submitted for award that collectively measure in the billions. A terrific job done by our folks, and we continue to be amazed by the creativity, agility and patience that they have shown. The near-term goals for the aerospace team are to finish strong on existing programs and ramp successfully on the new work throughout the second half of 2016.
Now turning to the future. We continue to make progress on our proposed offer for Rexam, and we look forward to reaping the benefits of growth capital deployed in 2015 to improve performance as well as the higher EVA dollar generation that these important investments will provide.
While our biggest challenge is to weather the unsustainable pricing environment in our China beverage can business, overall, we feel good about where we are. Our objectives are consistent with last year. Successfully execute our capital projects, generate strong free cash flow, grow our specialty businesses, focus on cost optimization and manufacturing performance and cross the finish line on the proposed offer for Rexam.
Together, we are working hard to improve Ball in 2016 and beyond, and we look forward to a successful year ahead.

I think, overall, the market in the fourth quarter was down slightly and we were down a little bit more. Most of our decline had to do with actually exports. I think on a Continental Europe basis, we are right in line with the market. Some of those exports that we had into Africa as well as to the Middle East are a little bit slower. But again, I don't read into that much at all because it was the fourth quarter, which is always seasonally slow. I will point out and I have -- we've talked about this in the past that 2016 is an even numbered year. And typically, even numbered year, there are many events, including the World Cup, including the various soccer matches that usually show a little bit better than the odd years. And so we're coming off an odd year, where the overall market, as well as Ball, was up about 2%. So kind of in line with what our expectations. So depending on weather and depending on some other things, I think 2016, we see the same trends continue in Europe with growth in the beverage can at the expense of returnable glass and other substrates."

We were up a bit more than that. I think a lot of the trends that we talked about in the past continue. Meaning, that the can continues to take share from other substrates in the beer category. I think specialty growth is occurring at a faster rate than standard containers. We are almost at -- not quite, but almost at a 50-50 mix between standard and specialty down in Brazil. And as we go into 2016, yes, there is a lot of political uncertainty and economic uncertainty. But the facts have not shown that the beverage can has been hurting. People are still eating. People are still drinking. And I think while the Olympics in Rio was a help, people have to remember, it is only just the Rio region, but that's a very dense populated -- densely populated area. So I think it should be beneficial. So as we sit here today, we're not expecting large growth in Brazil.

Let me just clarify, our portfolio in Brazil is closer to 50-50. I don't necessarily think the overall market is. But to answer your question about where we think specialty can ultimately end up, specialty continues to grow and 12-ounce continues to decline in all categories in the United States. Where we'll ultimately get to, I can tell you. We're in at about 30% of specialty in North America relative to whole and that continues to grow. And so will it get to 50%? I think it's premature to look out that way. But certainly, the trends are saying, it's going to get bigger, not smaller. Even on the beer side of the business, the can penetration, to answer your question there, I don't have the numbers in front of me, but I can tell you that both in the United States and Brazil as well as most other countries, the can continues to take share relative to other substrates. For example, in North America, the overall beer market was up about 1%, cans were up about 2.5%, down. In Brazil, the beer market, I think was down slightly, but the can industry was up, and that was largely driven by beer. So the implication of all that is it continues to take share."

When you think about the projects we've talked about given on this call, let's start with Monterray, Mexico, it started up this month. And so, as you know, there's always a learning curve there, and Scott said we'd have a little bit of start-up costs. So I would expect to kind of the typical learning curve and something like this is 3 to 6 months. And so I think, as we get to certainly the second half of the year, maybe even a little second quarter, we'll start to see the benefit of that. And then we're going to get additional leverage as we put the second line on that's going to be starting up kind of second -- late second, early third quarter. So you can hopefully see a trajectory there. In the fourth quarter last year, we started the new line in devices in the U.K. and the impact extruded line. We started up the India plant. Anytime you start a new plant, the learning curve is a little bit longer than just adding existing line or new lines into existing facilities. So I think that devices we feel pretty good about in terms of getting results out of that sooner rather than later. I think the India one is going to be a little bit longer. The Lublin, Poland we talked about that we -- as we continue to ramp up the end production there, we should see some benefit as time goes on. But it does -- it's a ramp-up starting in early '16 as we go forward with that. And we talked about the contour effect. In the last couple of quarters, we talked about the contour bottle as well as the G3. It's on the shelf. We're making commercially -- commercial product right now. It's on the shelves right now. So we have high expectations as we go into 2016 that you're going to see some momentum there. All of that leads to exactly what Scott was saying that in the first quarter, we still have some start-up costs, and we're really not getting a lot of the benefits, but we're gaining momentum each month we go by in year 2016."

Our fourth quarter volumes, free cash flow and results from operations were in line with our expectations. The headwinds we acknowledged throughout 2015 around earnings translation, project start-up costs and tough volume comps in our North American food continued, while others like aluminum premium became a tailwind and a lower effective tax rate aided the quarter. Overall, however, we are pleased with the performance of our businesses. And Scott will go into more detail on the quarter and full year in just a moment.
Since we spoke last October, we've made notable progress to strategically and operationally position Ball for the future, including successfully beginning the production of beverage can ends in our existing Lublin, Poland facility, which is also slated for additional end modules in 2016. The successful start-up of our Monterrey, Mexico beverage can and end facility, which is serving multiple foreign brewers importing their product into the U.S. The successful start-up of a new aluminum impact extruded line in devices U.K. as well as our recently announced aluminum impact extruded aerosol expansion in Velim, Czech Republic, which is expected to come online in early 2017.
The successful start-up of our new aluminum impact extruded aerosol facility in India, various investments to further the growth of our specialty can and new product portfolio, including our new contour bottle line in Conroe, Texas; and our new tinplate aerosol technology in Chestnut Hill, Tennessee; and the continued construction of our new beverage can plant in Myanmar now slated to open in April 2016.
We also completed the acquisition of the remaining interest in our Brazilian joint venture and received conditional regulatory approvals for our proposed offer for Rexam from the European Commission and Brazilian CADE. Discussions are ongoing with the FTC.
We have weathered a very busy 2015 in terms of managing the headwinds, investing in our future and making progress with our Rexam acquisition. Everyone at our company has been extremely busy. And I want to thank everyone at Ball who has persevered and risen to the challenge. Thanks.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott for a review of our fourth quarter numbers."

Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share for fourth quarter 2015 were $0.80 versus last year's $0.84. And for the full year 2015, comparable diluted earnings per share were $3.48 versus $3.88 in 2014. Fourth quarter and full year compara",1060,"Thanks, John. Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share for fourth quarter 2015 were $0.80 versus last year's $0.84. And for the full year 2015, comparable diluted earnings per share were $3.48 versus $3.88 in 2014. Fourth quarter and full year comparable diluted earnings per share were unfavorably impacted by a net $0.04 and $0.49, respectively, related to foreign currency effects, start-up costs and other one-time items.
As John alluded to, the following factors contributed to results in the fourth quarter: $0.06 of unfavorable currency translation effects largely due to a weaker euro; $0.02 of start-up costs associated with capital projects and aluminum premium tailwind of $0.04.
Year 2015 free cash flow came in at $558 million after $528 million of CapEx and excluding roughly $80 million of cash costs associated with the Rexam transaction.
Our GAAP results for the fourth quarter and full year 2015 were unfavorably impacted by the economic hedges we put in place to reduce currency exchange rate exposure associated with the British pound denominated cash portion of the announced acquisition price for Rexam and to mitigate exposure to interest rate changes associated with anticipated debt issuances, also in connection with the cash portion of the proposed transaction. These economic hedges allow us to lock in transaction's purchase price economics, though they will likely continue to cause disruption to quarterly GAAP earnings. Details on these economic hedges are provided in Note 2 of today's earnings release.
Credit quality and liquidity of the company remains very solid with comparable EBIT to interest coverage at 5.6x and net debt to comparable EBITDA at 2.5x, including the noncurrent restricted cash sitting in escrow from the December U.S. and euro bond placements. The company has enough committed credit and available liquidity at year-end to consummate the proposed Rexam transaction and provide ongoing liquidity for the company.
For a complete summary of fourth quarter and full year 2015 results on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis and details regarding the fourth quarter and full year, please refer to the notes section of today's earnings release, which includes a simplified table format summarizing business consolidation activities.
Now moving to operations. Our metal beverage Americas and Asia segment comparable operating earnings for fourth quarter and full year 2015 were down slightly year-over-year, mainly due to unfavorable pricing in China, slightly lower performance in Brazil and project start-up costs in North America. Segment volumes in the quarter were up approximately 5% and just up over 1% for the full year 2015.
Our Monterrey, Mexico can plant just begun producing cans and ends earlier this month. Our second can line will come up mid-year. In China, while volumes remain relatively healthy, the overall pricing environment remains extremely challenging, and our aggressive cost out programs have not been able to keep up with the price erosion and we expect to be down in profitability again in 2016 in this region.
European beverage comparable earnings were up nicely in the quarter due to aluminum premium tailwinds of EUR 6 million as well as improved plant utilization for the full year. Comparable earnings were down approximately $20 million to unfavorable foreign earnings translation. On a constant currency basis, they were up year-over-year. Low single-digit volume growth and low double-digit specialty can growth continue to reflect the ongoing value-added benefits of the can with European consumers.
Food and household comparable segment earnings were down in the quarter, as segment volumes declined following the customer shift in U.S. food cans as well as manufacturing inefficiencies. Excluding the customer shift, our food can volumes were down slightly in the fourth quarter due to the earlier conclusion of the pack late in the third quarter, but up for the full year.
For the fourth quarter and full year, the segment was also impacted by unfavorable earnings translation related to the European portion of the extruded aluminum aerosol business and start-up costs related to numerous capital projects across the segment. Our next-generation lightweight steel aerosol can manufacturing technology is now commercially available on shelves, and further growth in our global extruded aluminum businesses as well as significantly better operating performance in our tinplate businesses will provide good opportunity to improve segment performance in 2016.
In summary, our global packaging businesses are extremely focused on driving EVA dollars from our new capital projects. To employees listening in on today's call, thank you for all the great work during what has been one of the busiest times in our company's 136-year history.
Now as we look to 2016, reflecting Ball, as a stand-alone company today, here's a snapshot of some key financial metrics. We expect free cash flow to be in a similar range as 2015, excluding cash cost related to the Rexam transaction, with CapEx expected to be in the range of $400 million and working capital expected to be generally flat year-over-year. Interest expense is expected to be roughly $145 million, excluding debt refinancing and other costs. The full year effective tax rate on comparable earnings is expected to be in the range of 25%.
Corporate undistributed is to be expected to be in the range of $75 million, a year-over-year reduction of $17 million. Also recall that due to the acquisition of our JV's partner’s interest in Brazil, our outstanding shares at the beginning of this year are higher by 5.7 million shares, and we will no longer have any effects from this business in our noncontrolling interest line on the income statement. We expect our dividend to remain unchanged from its current level during the proposed acquisition process.
In 2016, we expect all of our segments to be up on a full year basis with the exception of China beverage can business. And while we expect the first quarter to be relatively soft through the repricing of our contracts in China, challenging comps in our food and household products business and the close out of start-up expenses in our various capital projects, momentum will accelerate as we move through the years.
One final heads-up before I turn it over to John. As we look to the successful closing of the Rexam transaction, we currently plan to incorporate into our future comments a focus on cash, earnings per share due to large about of intangible amortization we expect to record for the Rexam transaction.
And with that, I'll turn it back to you, John."

Contracted backlog held steady ending the quarter at $617 million. More exciting, however, is what is in front of us. Over the past few months, our aerospace business has won a variety of classified and nonclassified programs that are worth over $800 million that have not yet been booked into our backlog, as the contracts need to be signed and in several cases the funding needs to be approved by the U.S. government.
In addition, we still have a number of additional proposals submitted for award that collectively measure in the billions. A terrific job done by our folks, and we continue to be amazed by the creativity, agility and patience that they have shown. The near-term goals for the aerospace team are to finish strong on existing programs and ramp successfully on the new work throughout the second half of 2016.
Now turning to the future. We continue to make progress on our proposed offer for Rexam, and we look forward to reaping the benefits of growth capital deployed in 2015 to improve performance as well as the higher EVA dollar generation that these important investments will provide.
While our biggest challenge is to weather the unsustainable pricing environment in our China beverage can business, overall, we feel good about where we are. Our objectives are consistent with last year: successfully execute our capital projects, generate strong free cash flow, grow our specialty businesses, focus on cost optimization and manufacturing performance and cross the finish line on the proposed offer for Rexam.
Together, we are working hard to improve Ball in 2016 and beyond, and we look forward to a successful year ahead.
And with that, Tia, we're ready for questions."

But again, I don't read into that much at all because it was the fourth quarter, which is always seasonally slow. I will point out and I have -- we've talked about this in the past that 2016 is an even numbered year. And typically, even numbered year, there are many events, including the World Cup, including the various soccer matches that usually show a little bit better than the odd years. And so we're coming off an odd year, where the overall market, as well as Ball, was up about 2%. So kind of in line with what our expectations. So depending on weather and depending on some other things, I think 2016, we see the same trends continue in Europe with growth in the beverage can at the expense of returnable glass and other substrates."

We were up a bit more than that. I think a lot of the trends that we talked about in the past continue. Meaning, that the can continues to take share from other substrates in the beer category. I think specialty growth is occurring at a faster rate than standard containers. We are almost at -- not quite, but almost at a 50-50 mix between standard and specialty down in Brazil. And as we go into 2016, yes, there is a lot of political uncertainty and economic uncertainty. But the facts have not shown that the beverage can has been hurting. People are still eating. People are still drinking. And I think while the Olympics in Rio was a help, people have to remember, it is only just the Rio region, but that's a very dense populated -- densely populated area. So I think it should be beneficial. So as we sit here today, we're not expecting large growth in Brazil.

We have -- on the aerosol side of tinplate, we have a new G3 technology that's out that Scott mentioned is on the shelf right now. Number 2, in terms of overall aluminum aerosol growth, that continues to grow well. Just to give you a sense, in 2015, we were up on a global basis in aluminum aerosol about 5%, 6%.

Even on the beer side of the business, the can penetration, to answer your question there, I don't have the numbers in front of me, but I can tell you that both in the United States and Brazil as well as most other countries, the can continues to take share relative to other substrates.

I'll -- as best trying to answer that. When you think about the projects we've talked about even on this call, let's start with Monterray, Mexico, it started up this month.

When you think about the projects we've talked about even on this call, let's start with Monterray, Mexico, it started up this month. And so, as you know, there's always a learning curve there, and Scott said we'd have a little bit of start-up costs. So I would expect to kind of the typical learning curve and something like this is 3 to 6 months. And so I think, as we get to certainly the second half of the year, maybe even a little second quarter, we'll start to see the benefit of that. And then we're going to get additional leverage as we put the second line on that's going to be starting up kind of second -- late second, early third quarter. So you can hopefully see a trajectory there. In the fourth quarter last year, we started the new line in devices in the U.K. and the impact extruded line. We started up the India plant. Anytime you start a new plant, the learning curve is a little bit longer than just adding existing line or new lines into existing facilities. So I think that devices we feel pretty good about in terms of getting results out of that sooner rather than later. I think the India one is going to be a little bit longer. The Lublin, Poland we talked about that we -- as we continue to ramp up the end production there, we should see some benefit as time goes on. But it does -- it's a ramp-up starting in early '16 as we go forward with that. And we talked about the contour. And in fact I know the last couple of quarters, we talked about the contour bottle as well as the G3. It's on the -- We're making commercially -- commercial product right now. It's on the shelves right now. So we have high expectations as we go into 2016 that you're going to see some momentum there. All of that leads to exactly what Scott was saying that in the first quarter, we still have some start-up costs, and we're really not getting a lot of the benefits, but we're gaining momentum each month we go by in year 2016."

The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings as well as the company news releases. Now if you don't already have our earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com.
Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found on our website. With regard to Ball's proposed offer for Rexam and consistent with the requirements of the U.K. Takeover Code, we will limit our comments regarding the transaction to: number one, what has already been made public via the 2/7 release; number two, where we are in the regulatory process; and number three, an update of ongoing economic hedging and debt activities related to the proposed transaction.
Also note that there may be limitations regarding the depth of our business commentary as well as our future outlook, and certain other items we would normally discuss on an earnings conference call due to the nature of the proposed transaction and restrictions under the U.K Takeover Code.
Given the nature of our proposed offer, today's issued press release, webcast and conference call are advertisements and should not be considered a prospectus.

Now joining me on the call today is Scott Morrison, Senior Vice President and our Chief Financial Officer. I'll provide a brief overview of our company's performance, Scott will discuss financial and global packaging metrics and then I'll finish up with comments on our aerospace business and the outlook for 2016.
Our fourth quarter volumes, free cash flow and results from operations were in line with our expectations. The headwinds we acknowledged throughout 2015 around earnings translation, project start-up costs and tough volume comps in our North American food continued, while others like aluminum premium became a tailwind and a lower effective tax rate aided the quarter. Overall, however, we are pleased with the performance of our businesses. And Scott will go into more detail on the quarter and full year in just a moment.
Since we spoke last October, we've made notable progress to strategically and operationally position Ball for the future, including successfully beginning the production of beverage can ends in our existing Lublin, Poland facility, which is also slated for additional end modules in 2016. The successful start-up of our Monterrey, Mexico beverage can and end facility, which is serving multiple foreign brewers importing their product into the U.S. The successful start-up of a new aluminum impact extruded line in devices U.K. as well as our recently announced aluminum impact extruded aerosol expansion in Velim, Czech Republic, which is expected to come online in early 2017.
The successful start-up of our new aluminum impact extruded aerosol facility in India, various investments to further the growth of our specialty can and new product portfolio, including our new contour bottle line in Conroe, Texas; and our new tinplate aerosol technology in Chestnut Hill, Tennessee; and the continued construction of our new beverage can plant in Myanmar now slated to open in April 2016.
We also completed the acquisition of the remaining interest in our Brazilian joint venture and received conditional regulatory approvals for our proposed offer for Rexam from the European Commission and Brazilian CADE. Discussions are ongoing with the FTC.
We have weathered a very busy 2015 in terms of managing the headwinds, investing in our future and making progress with our Rexam acquisition. Everyone at our company has been extremely busy. And I want to thank everyone at Ball who has persevered and risen to the challenge. Thanks.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott for a review of our fourth quarter numbers."

Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share for fourth quarter 2015 were $0.80 versus last year's $0.84. And for the full year 2015, comparable diluted earnings per share were $3.48 versus $3.88 in 2014. Fourth quarter and full year compara",1060,"Thanks, John. Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share for fourth quarter 2015 were $0.80 versus last year's $0.84. And for the full year 2015, comparable diluted earnings per share were $3.48 versus $3.88 in 2014. Fourth quarter and full year comparable diluted earnings per share were unfavorably impacted by a net $0.04 and $0.49, respectively, related to foreign currency effects, start-up costs and other one-time items.
As John alluded to, the following factors contributed to results in the fourth quarter: $0.06 of unfavorable currency translation effects largely due to a weaker euro; $0.02 of start-up costs associated with capital projects and aluminum premium tailwind of $0.04.
Year 2015 free cash flow came in at $558 million after $528 million of CapEx and excluding roughly $80 million of cash costs associated with the Rexam transaction.
Our GAAP results for the fourth quarter and full year 2015 were unfavorably impacted by the economic hedges we put in place to reduce currency exchange rate exposure associated with the British pound denominated cash portion of the announced acquisition price for Rexam and to mitigate exposure to interest rate changes associated with anticipated debt issuances, also in connection with the cash portion of the proposed transaction. These economic hedges allow us to lock in transaction's purchase price economics, though they will likely continue to cause disruption to quarterly GAAP earnings. Details on these economic hedges are provided in Note 2 of today's earnings release.
Credit quality and liquidity of the company remains very solid with comparable EBIT to interest coverage at 5.6x and net debt to comparable EBITDA at 2.5x, including the noncurrent restricted cash sitting in escrow from the December U.S. and euro bond placements. The company has enough committed credit and available liquidity at year-end to consummate the proposed Rexam transaction and provide ongoing liquidity for the company.
For a complete summary of fourth quarter and full year 2015 results on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis and details regarding the fourth quarter and full year, please refer to the notes section of today's earnings release, which includes a simplified table format summarizing business consolidation activities.
Now moving to operations. Our metal beverage Americas and Asia segment comparable operating earnings for fourth quarter and full year 2015 were down slightly year-over-year, mainly due to unfavorable pricing in China, slightly lower performance in Brazil and project start-up costs in North America. Segment volumes in the quarter were up approximately 5% and just up over 1% for the full year 2015.
Our Monterrey, Mexico can plant just begun producing cans and ends earlier this month. Our second can line will come up mid-year. In China, while volumes remain relatively healthy, the overall pricing environment remains extremely challenging, and our aggressive cost out programs have not been able to keep up with the price erosion and we expect to be down in profitability again in 2016 in this region.
European beverage comparable earnings were up nicely in the quarter due to aluminum premium tailwinds of EUR 6 million as well as improved plant utilization for the full year. Comparable earnings were down approximately $20 million to unfavorable foreign earnings translation. On a constant currency basis, they were up year-over-year. Low single-digit volume growth and low double-digit specialty can growth continue to reflect the ongoing value-added benefits of the can with European consumers.
Food and household comparable segment earnings were down in the quarter, as segment volumes declined following the customer shift in U.S. food cans as well as manufacturing inefficiencies. Excluding the customer shift, our food can volumes were down slightly in the fourth quarter due to the earlier conclusion of the pack late in the third quarter, but up for the full year.
For the fourth quarter and full year, the segment was also impacted by unfavorable earnings translation related to the European portion of the extruded aluminum aerosol business and start-up costs related to numerous capital projects across the segment. Our next-generation lightweight steel aerosol can manufacturing technology is now commercially available on shelves, and further growth in our global extruded aluminum businesses as well as significantly better operating performance in our tinplate businesses will provide good opportunity to improve segment performance in 2016.
In summary, our global packaging businesses are extremely focused on driving EVA dollars from our new capital projects. To employees listening in on today's call, thank you for all the great work during what has been one of the busiest times in our company's 136-year history.
Now as we look to 2016, reflecting Ball, as a stand-alone company today, here's a snapshot of some key financial metrics. We expect free cash flow to be in a similar range as 2015, excluding cash cost related to the Rexam transaction, with CapEx expected to be in the range of $400 million and working capital expected to be generally flat year-over-year. Interest expense is expected to be roughly $145 million, excluding debt refinancing and other costs. The full year effective tax rate on comparable earnings is expected to be in the range of 25%.
Corporate undistributed is to be expected to be in the range of $75 million, a year-over-year reduction of $17 million. Also recall that due to the acquisition of our JV's partner’s interest in Brazil, our outstanding shares at the beginning of this year are higher by 5.7 million shares, and we will no longer have any effects from this business in our noncontrolling interest line on the income statement. We expect our dividend to remain unchanged from its current level during the proposed acquisition process.
In 2016, we expect all of our segments to be up on a full year basis with the exception of China beverage can business. And while we expect the first quarter to be relatively soft through the repricing of our contracts in China, challenging comps in our food and household products business and the close out of start-up expenses in our various capital projects, momentum will accelerate as we move through the years.
One final heads-up before I turn it over to John. As we look to the successful closing of the Rexam transaction, we currently plan to incorporate into our future comments a focus on cash, earnings per share due to large about of intangible amortization we expect to record for the Rexam transaction.
And with that, I'll turn it back to you, John."

Contracted backlog held steady ending the quarter at $617 million. More exciting, however, is what is in front of us. Over the past few months, our aerospace business has won a variety of classified and nonclassified programs that are worth over $800 million that have not yet been booked into our backlog, as the contracts need to be signed and in several cases the funding needs to be approved by the U.S. government.
In addition, we still have a number of additional proposals submitted for award that collectively measure in the billions. A terrific job done by our folks, and we continue to be amazed by the creativity, agility and patience that they have shown. The near-term goals for the aerospace team are to finish strong on existing programs and ramp successfully on the new work throughout the second half of 2016.
Now turning to the future. We continue to make progress on our proposed offer for Rexam, and we look forward to reaping the benefits of growth capital deployed in 2015 to improve performance as well as the higher EVA dollar generation that these important investments will provide.
While our biggest challenge is to weather the unsustainable pricing environment in our China beverage can business, overall, we feel good about where we are. Our objectives are consistent with last year: successfully execute our capital projects, generate strong free cash flow, grow our specialty businesses, focus on cost optimization and manufacturing performance and cross the finish line on the proposed offer for Rexam.
Together, we are working hard to improve Ball in 2016 and beyond, and we look forward to a successful year ahead.
And with that, Tia, we're ready for questions."

I think, overall, the market in the fourth quarter was down slightly and we were down a little bit more. Most of our decline had to do with actually exports. I think on a Continental Europe basis, we are right in line with the market. Some of those exports that we had into Africa as well as to the Middle East were a little bit slower. But again, I don't read into that much at all because it was the fourth quarter, which is always seasonally slow. I will point out and I have -- we've talked about this in the past that 2016 is an even numbered year. And typically, even numbered year, there are many events, including the World Cup, including the various soccer matches that usually show a little bit better than the odd years. And so we're coming off an odd year, where the overall market, as well as Ball, was up about 2%. So kind of in line with what our expectations. So depending on weather and depending on some other things, I think 2016, we see the same trends continue in Europe with growth in the beverage can at the expense of returnable glass and other substrates."

And what we saw was it was relatively soft in the first half. And then the second half in Brazil picked up nicely. In the fourth quarter, I know the overall market was up 6%. We were up a bit more than that. I think a lot of the trends that we talked about in the past continue. Meaning, that the can continues to take share from other substrates in the beer category. I think specialty growth is occurring at a faster rate than standard containers. We are almost at -- not quite, but almost at a 50-50 mix between standard and specialty down in Brazil. And as we go into 2016, yes, there is a lot of political uncertainty and economic uncertainty. But the facts have not shown that the beverage can has been hurting. People are still eating. People are still drinking. And I think while the Olympics in Rio was a help, people have to remember, it is only just the Rio region, but that's a very dense populated -- densely populated area. So I think it should be beneficial. So as we sit here today, we're not expecting large growth in Brazil. But the can is holding up very well relative to other substrates and relative to other industries."

Let me just clarify, our portfolio in Brazil is closer to 50-50. I don't necessarily think the overall market is. But to answer your question about where we think specialty can ultimately end up, specialty continues to grow and 12-ounce continues to decline in all categories in the United States. Where it will ultimately get to, I can't tell you. I can tell you we're in at about 30% of specialty in North America relative to whole and that continues to grow. And so will it get to 50%? I think it's premature to look out that way. But certainly, the trends are saying it's going to get bigger, not smaller. Even on the beer side of the business, the can penetration, to answer your question there, I don't have the numbers in front of me, but I can tell you that both in the United States and Brazil as well as most other countries, the can continues to take share relative to other substrates. For example, in North America, the overall beer market was up about 1%, cans were up about 2.5%. Down in Brazil, the beer market, I think was down slightly, but the can industry was up, and that was largely driven by beer. So the implication of all that is it continues to take share."

When you think about the projects we've talked about even on this call, let's start with Monterrey, Mexico, it started up this month. And so, as you know, there's always a learning curve there, and Scott said we'd have a little bit of start-up costs. So I would expect to kind of the typical learning curve and something like this is 3 to 6 months. And so I think, as we get to certainly the second half of the year, maybe even a little second quarter, we'll start to see the benefit of that. And then we're going to get additional leverage as we put the second line on that's going to be starting up kind of second -- late second, early third quarter. So you can hopefully see a trajectory there. In the fourth quarter last year, we started the new line in devices in the U.K. and the impact extruded line. We started up the India plant. Anytime you start a new plant, the learning curve is a little bit longer than just adding existing line or new lines into existing facilities. So I think that devices we feel pretty good about in terms of getting results out of that sooner rather than later. I think the India one is going to be a little bit longer. The Lublin, Poland we talked about that we -- as we continue to ramp up the end production there, we should see some benefit as time goes on. But it does -- it's a ramp-up starting in early '16 as we go forward with that. And we talked about the contour. And in fact I know the last couple of quarters, we talked about the contour bottle as well as the G3. It's on the -- We're making commercially -- commercial product right now. It's on the shelves right now. So we have high expectations as we go into 2016 that you're going to see some momentum there. All of that leads to exactly what Scott was saying that in the first quarter, we still have some start-up costs, and we're really not getting a lot of the benefits, but we're gaining momentum each month we go by in year 2016."

Also note that there may be limitations regarding the depth of our business commentary and certain other items we would normally discuss on a quarterly earnings conference call due to the nature of the proposed transaction.

Now joining me today on the call is Scott Morrison, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'll provide a brief overview of our company's performance. Scott will discuss financial and global packaging metrics, and then I'll finish up with comments on our aerospace business and the outlook for the remainder of 2016. 
It's been an incredibly busy start to the year. Our first quarter volumes and results from operations were in line with our expectations. The headwinds from a very competitive pricing environment in China and tough first quarter comparisons in our Food and Household segment, as well a start-up costs from our various capital projects, all that we had mentioned in our January conference call, played out. 
Overall, we are pleased with the performance of our businesses given those headwinds during that seasonally weak quarter, and Scott will go into more detail on the quarter in just a moment. I'll say, however, that other than China, most of these headwinds are behind us and we feel momentum building in our affairs businesses. 
Since late January, we've made notable progress to strategically and operationally position Ball for the future, including signing the agreement for the required sale of the divestment business; producing cans and ends at our new Monterrey Mexico beverage facility; the successful groundbreaking of our aluminum impact extruded aerosol expansion in Velim, Czech Republic, which is expected to come early online in 2017; adding additional customers at our new aluminum impact aerosol facility in India; gaining efficiencies in our new contour bottle line in Connor, Texas and our new tinplate aerosol technology in Chestnut, Tennessee; and growing our aerospace contracted backlog, as well as acquiring wavefront technologies to further enhance our data and capabilities. 
We continue to navigate the highly complex process around the proposed offer for Rexam aerosol while keeping our to focus on things they can control that to day to keep our company strong and well-positioned for future growth. I again want to thank everyone at Ball for rising to the challenge over the past 15 months, and we feel good about the direction of our company, safe for the pricing environment in China with many of the transitory headwind issues now behind us. 
Our future is bright. And irrespective of the Rexam transaction, we see meaningful year-over-year improvement through the balance of the year and beyond. We are right on track and the best is ahead of us. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott for a review of our first quarter numbers. Scott?"

The first quarter played out exactly as we said in January with the repricing of our contracts in China, challenging comps in our Food and Household products business and the closeout of start-up cost and there's capital projects, resulting in the first quarter being soft. 
Our GAAP results in the first quarter were unfavorable impacted by the economic hedges we put in place to reduce currency, exchange rate exposure, associated with the British pound denominated cash portion of the announced acquisition price for Rexam, and to mitigate exposure to interest-rate changes associated with the anticipated debt issuances, also in connection with the cash portion of this proposed acquisition. These economic hedges allows us to lock in the transactions purchase price economics. Details on these economic hedges are provided in Note 2 of today's earnings release. 
Credit quality and liquidity of the company remains quite solid with comparable EBITDA interest coverage of 5.4x and net debt to comparable EBITDA at 3.3x. Including the noncurrent restricted cash sitting in escrow for the U.S. and Euro bond placements -- from the U.S. and Eur bond placements. The company is that have committed credit and available liquidity on hand to consummate the proposed Rexam transaction and provide ongoing liquidity for the company. 
For a complete summary of first quarter results on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis and details regarding the first quarter, please refer to the note section of today's earnings release, which includes a simplified table format summarizing business consolidation activities. Now moving to operations. Our Metal Beverage Americas and Asia segment comparable operating earnings for the first quarter 2016 were down year-over-year solely due to China pricing, a significant swing in China volume and project start-up costs related to Monterrey. Absent the startup cost in Q1 in North America, this region was up year-over-year. 
As we move through the year, the costs out programs in China will reduce the loss in this region. And despite the China headwinds, we will see year-over-year improvement across the segment in the back half of the year, as our Monterrey Mexico can plant second line comes online and startup cost moderate, more than offsetting the impact of China pricing. 
Segment volumes in the quarter were up approximately 2%, including mid single-digit volume growth in North America, low single-digit volume growth in Brazil and China volumes being down upper single-digits as we proactively prune business to the competitive pricing. 
European beverage comparable earnings were up nicely in the quarter due to aluminum premium tailwinds and strong manufacturing performance, offsetting slightly -- offset slightly by volumes being down low single-digits due exclusively to soft export sales to Africa. In fact, excluding such export sales, volumes in the EU were up low single-digits, in line with overall market. 
Industry demand for specialty can across Europe continues to grow and industry supply/demand remains -- remained balanced. Food and household comparable segment earnings were down in the quarter due to mid single-digit food can volume declines following the prior year benefit of certain volumes related to a past food can customer, inventory holding losses, as well a start-up costs related to our tinplate steel aerosol project in Chestnut Hill, Tennessee. 
We continue executing a disciplined cost control growth equation in the segment with cost out initiatives, like the announced closure of our were 10 West Virginia facility versus incremental investments to support continued metal aerosol growth and production efficiencies, finished gives in Mexico, Europe and India. These decisions will drive future quarter-on-quarter improvement for 2016 and beyond.
In summary, our global packaging businesses continued to be strictly focused on driving EVA dollars from our new capital projects as we get closer to being able to initiate the next exciting stage in our global metal beverage business. 
To employees listening on today's call, thank you for all of the work on all of these projects. Our business is embarking on next transformation, which is so exciting stuff, and the collective efforts of the entire team are critical to our shared success. Now as we look to the remainder of 2016 and the reflecting Ball as a stand-alone company today, there's a snapshot of key metrics, no real changes here. 
We expect free cash flow to be in a similar age as 2015, excluding cash costs related to the Rexam transaction with CapEx expected to be in the range of $400 million and working capital expected to be generally flat year-over-year. Interest expense is expected to be roughly $145 million, excluding the debt financing and other costs, and the full year effective tax rate on comparable earnings is now expected to be in the range of 25%. 
Corporate undistributed is estimated to be in the range of $75 million, a year-over-year reduction of $17 million. And we expect our dividend to remain unchanged from its current level during the proposed acquisition process. 
Exactly as we said in January, in 2016, we expect all our businesses to be up on a full year basis with the exception of China beverage can with momentum accelerating as we move through the year, particularly in the second half. As we indicated back in January and as we look to the successful closing of the Rexam transaction, we plan to focus our comments in terms of cash EPS post close due to the large amount of intangible amortization we expect to record for the Rexam transaction. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to you, John."

It's taking a fair amount of patience for us to get to this point, and I want to congratulate the entire aerospace team for their hard work. More exciting, however, is what is in front of us in our space, ramping up all the new contracts and integrating the acquisition of wavefront technologies. 
Now across the company and as we look forward. We are nearing the end of our marathon we began back in February 2015, and we cannot wait to step up to the starting line for the sprint to achieving synergies, cash flow growth and the higher EVA dollar generation that all of our investments can provide. As we said, we continue to face headwinds in our China business, although going forward, it will moderate. We expect all of our other business units to be up year-over-year and feel momentum building in our business. Together, we are working hard to improve Ball in 2016 and beyond, and we look forward to the hard work that lies ahead.

So your first question has anything changed relative to our expectations? The short answer is no. You always have timing issues of when you get signed because some of it is out of your control when you have to have varies government agencies go through their approval processes. We've had some in the first quarter, some in April, as you heard. And even as we expect going into the June, July, whether it's June, whether it's July, I can't tell you right now. But I know that we still have a fair amount of projects that we call one not booked, which is not in our backlog. But we wanted just we have to go through the signatory process and the funding process with the governments. So nothing has changed on that front. From a mix perspective, I think I talked about this on the January call. There's not an appreciable difference in the mix relative to fix price versus costs plus. It could be a little bit more of cost-plus in the overall scheme of this new business one only because a lot of it is new technology, which I think is good. And our folks have been executing very well on those types of things. So a lot of it is in the DoD, which is both from a satellite perspective, as well as the sensor perspective.

Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings, as well as company news releases. If you don't already have our earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com.
Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found on our website. With regard to Ball's proposed offer for Rexam, and consistent with the requirements of the UK Takeover Code, we will limit our comments regarding the transaction to, number one, what has already been made public via the 2/7 and other public releases; two, where we are in the regulatory process; and three, an update of ongoing economic hedging and debt activities related to the proposed transaction, including the proposed sale of the divestment business.
Also note that there may be limitations regarding the depth of our business commentary and certain other items we would normally discuss on a quarterly earnings conference call due to the nature of the proposed transaction.
Given the nature of our proposed offer, today's issued press release, webcast and conference calls are advertisements and should not be considered a prospectus. Investors should not make any investment decision in relation to the new Ball shares issued in connection with the Rexam transaction, except on the basis of information in the prospectus and the scheme document, which are proposed to be published in due course. This presentation and transcription of comments are not for release in whole or in part in, into or from any jurisdiction, where to do so would constitute a violation of the relevant laws of such jurisdiction. For more information on Ball's proposed acquisition of Rexam, visit the Offer For Rexam page on ball.com.
Now joining me today on the call is Scott Morrison, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'll provide a brief overview of our company's performance. Scott will discuss financial and global packaging metrics, and then I'll finish up with comments on our aerospace business and the outlook for the remainder of 2016. 
It's been an incredibly busy start to the year. Our first quarter volumes and results from operations were in line with our expectations. The headwinds from a very competitive pricing environment in China and tough first-quarter comparisons in our food and household segment, as well as startup costs from our various capital projects, all that we had mentioned in our January conference call, played out. 
Overall, we are pleased with the performance of our businesses given those headwinds during a seasonally weak quarter, and Scott will go into more detail on the quarter in just a moment. I'll say, however, that other than China, most of these headwinds are behind us, and we feel momentum building in our various businesses. 
Since late January, we have made notable progress to strategically and operationally position Ball for the future, including signing the agreement for the required sale of the divestment business; producing cans and ends at our new Monterrey Mexico beverage facility; the successful groundbreaking of our aluminum impact extruded aerosol expansion in Velim, Czech Republic, which is expected to come online in early 2017; adding additional customers at our new aluminum impact extruded aerosol facility in India; gaining efficiencies in our new contour bottle line in Conroe, Texas and our new tinplate aerosol technology in Chestnut Hill, Tennessee; and growing our aerospace-contracted backlog, as well as acquiring Wavefront Technologies to further enhance our data and cyber capabilities. 
We continue to navigate the highly complex process around the proposed offer for Rexam while keeping our team focused on things they can control day to day to keep our company strong and well-positioned for future growth. I, again, want to thank everyone at Ball for rising to the challenge over the past 15 months. And we feel good about the direction of our company, save for the pricing environment in China with many of the transitory headwind issues now behind us. 
Our future is bright. And irrespective of the Rexam transaction, we see meaningful year-over-year improvement through the balance of the year and beyond. We are right on track, and the best is ahead of us. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott for a review of our first quarter numbers. Scott?"

Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share for the first quarter 2016 were $0.59 versus last year's $0.69. First quarter comparable diluted earnings per share reflected the impact of $7 million in startup costs related to our sizable Monterrey project and the new tinplate steel project, as well as anticipated lower volumes in our North American food business and competitive pricing in China. 
The first quarter played out exactly as we said in January, with the repricing of our contracts in China, challenging comps in our food and household products business and the closeout of startup costs on various capital projects, resulting in the first quarter being soft. 
Our GAAP results for the first quarter were unfavorably impacted by the economic hedges we've put in place to reduce currency, exchange rate exposure, associated with the British pound-denominated cash portion of the announced acquisition price for Rexam, and to mitigate exposure to interest-rate changes associated with the anticipated debt issuances, also in connection with the cash portion of this proposed acquisition. These economic hedges allows us to lock in the transaction's purchased price economics. Details on these economic hedges are provided in Note 2 of today's earnings release. 
Credit quality and liquidity of the company remains quite solid with comparable EBIT to interest coverage of 5.4x and net debt to comparable EBITDA at 3.3x, including the noncurrent restricted cash sitting in escrow for the U.S. and Euro bond placements -- from the U.S. and Euro bond placements. The company has enough committed credit and available liquidity on hand to consummate the proposed Rexam transaction and provide ongoing liquidity for the company. 
For a complete summary of first quarter results on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis and details regarding the first quarter, please refer to the note section of today's earnings release, which includes a simplified table format summarizing business consolidation activities. Now moving to operations. Our metal beverage Americas and Asia segment comparable operating earnings for the first quarter 2016 were down year-over-year, solely due to China pricing, a significant swing in China volume and project startup costs related to Monterrey. Absent the startup costs in Q1 in North America, this region was up year-over-year. 
As we move through the year, the cost-out programs in China will reduce the loss in this region. And despite the China headwinds, we will see year-over-year improvement across the segment in the back half of the year, as our Monterrey Mexico can plant second line comes online and startup costs moderate, more than offsetting the impact of China pricing. 
Segment volumes in the quarter were up approximately 2%, including mid single-digit volume growth in North America, low single-digit volume growth in Brazil and China volumes being down upper-single digits as we proactively prune business due to competitive pricing. 
European beverage comparable earnings were up nicely in the quarter due to aluminum premium tailwinds and strong manufacturing performance, offsetting slightly -- offset slightly by volumes being down low-single digits due exclusively to soft export sales to Africa. In fact, excluding such export sales, volumes in the EU were up low-single digits, in line with the overall market. 
Industry demand for specialty cans across Europe continues to grow, and industry of supply/demand remains balanced. Food and household comparable segment earnings were down in the quarter due to mid-single digit food can volume declines following the prior-year benefit of certain volumes related to a past food can customer, inventory holding losses as well a startup costs related to our tinplate steel aerosol project in Chestnut Hill, Tennessee. 
We continue executing a disciplined cost control growth equation in the segment with cost-out initiatives, like the announced closure of our Weirton, West Virginia facility versus incremental investments to support continued metal aerosol growth and production efficiencies, initiatives in Mexico, Europe and India. These decisions will drive future quarter-on-quarter improvement for 2016 and beyond.
In summary, our global packaging businesses continue to be extremely focused on driving EVA dollars from our new capital projects, as we get closer to being able to initiate the next exciting stage in our global metal beverage business. 
To employees listening on today's call, thank you for all of the work on all of these projects. Our business is embarking on its next transformation, which is really exciting stuff, and the collective efforts of the entire team are critical to our shared success. Now as we look to the remainder of 2016 and reflecting Ball as a standalone company today, there's a snapshot of some key metrics, no real changes here. 
We expect free cash flow to be in a similar range as 2015, excluding cash costs related to the Rexam transaction, with CapEx expected to be in the range of $400 million and working capital expected to be generally flat year-over-year. Interest expense is expected to be roughly $145 million, excluding debt refinancing and other cost, and the full year effective tax rate on comparable earnings is now expected to be in the range of 25%. 
Corporate undistributed is estimated to be in the range of $75 million, a year-over-year reduction of $17 million, and we expect our dividend to remain unchanged from its current level during the proposed acquisition process. 
Exactly as we said in January, in 2016, we expect all our businesses to be up on a full-year basis, with the exception of China beverage can, with momentum accelerating as we move through the year, particularly in the second half. As we indicated back in January, and as we look to the successful closing of the Rexam transaction, we plan to focus our comments in terms of cash EPS post-close due to the large amount of intangible amortization we expect to record for the Rexam transaction. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to you, John."

Our aerospace business reported first-quarter results that were relatively flat with last year. However, I'm happy to report that our contracted backlog closed the quarter $100 million higher than year-end. And even happier to report that as of this week, our aerospace backlog stands at greater than $900 million, with even more opportunities for growth during the remainder of 2016. 
It's taking a fair amount of patience for us to get to this point, and I want to congratulate the entire aerospace team for their hard work. More exciting, however, is what is in front of us in aerospace, ramping up on all the new contracts and integrating the recent acquisition of Wavefront Technologies. 
Now across the company, and as we look forward, we are nearing the end of the marathon we began back in February 2015, and we cannot wait to step up to the starting line for the sprint to achieving synergies, cash flow growth and the higher EVA dollar generation that all of our investments can provide. As we said, we continue to face headwinds in our China business. Although going forward, it will moderate. We expect all of our other business units to be up year-over-year and feel momentum building in our business. Together, we are working hard to improve Ball in 2016 and beyond, and we look forward to the hard work that lies ahead. 
So with that, Lyn, we're ready for questions."

What I'd describe is operationally, we continue to drive a hell of a lot of costs out of the business in the range of $30-plus million this year alone. The pricing environment is just quite, quite challenging. The only thing I can really say beyond that is strategically, we are assessing and continue to assess how to make this a better business. As you all know, we're not in the business to lose EVA dollars. And so it's a very high focus for us. On the tinplate side, there has been a lot of change in that business. I think the Weirton, West Virginia closure, while unfortunate, allows us to spread a lot of that cutting and coding capability into other facilities. And that's exactly what we're doing.

You always have timing issues of when you get signed because some of it's out of our control when you have to have various government agencies go through their approval processes. We've had some in the first quarter, some in April, as you heard. And even as we expect going into the June, July, whether it's June, whether it's July, I can't tell you right now. But I know that we still have a fair amount of projects that we call, one not booked, which is not in our backlog, but we've won it. It's just we have to go through the signatory process and the funding process with the government. So nothing has changed on that front. From a mix perspective, I think I talked about this on the January call. There's not an appreciable difference in the mix relative to fixed price versus cost-plus. There could be a little bit more of cost-plus in the overall scheme of this new business won, only because a lot of it's new technology, which I think is good. And our folks have been executing very well on those types of things. So a lot of it's in the DoD, which is both from a satellite perspective as well as a sensor perspective. And then also in the NASA side, where we haven't done a tremendous amount with NASA because their budget's been so constrained. But we've been able to do a very good job or weaved our way back into that and are doing several neat things for NASA as we go forward there."

So those haven't really changed. The buckets haven't really changed either. There's  always a little bit of puts and takes. But essentially, it's the same as we thought 15 months ago when we first started talking about it. On the second part of that question, working capital, yes, that's obviously one of the areas that we expect to get after right after close. We manage our balance sheet every day of the year. And so that's one area in which we think there could be a meaningful amount of cash taken out over the course of some period of time, probably a year or 2."

If you don't already have our earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com.
Information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found on our website. With regard to Ball's proposed offer for Rexam, and consistent with the requirements of the UK Takeover Code, we will limit our comments regarding the transaction to, number one, what has already been made public via the 2.7 and other public releases; two, where we are in the regulatory process; and three, an update of ongoing economic hedging and debt activities related to the proposed transaction, including the proposed sale of the divestment business.
Also note that there may be limitations regarding the depth of our business commentary and certain other items we would normally discuss on a quarterly earnings conference call due to the nature of the proposed transaction.
Given the nature of our proposed offer, today's issued press release, webcast and conference calls are advertisements and should not be considered a prospectus. Investors should not make any investment decision in relation to the new Ball shares issued in connection with the Rexam transaction, except on the basis of information in the prospectus and the scheme document, which are proposed to be published in due course. This presentation and transcription of comments are not for release in whole or in part in, into or from any jurisdiction where to do so would constitute a violation of the relevant laws of such jurisdiction. For more information on Ball's proposed acquisition of Rexam, visit the Offer For Rexam page on ball.com.
Now joining me today on the call is Scott Morrison, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'll provide a brief overview of our company's performance. Scott will discuss financial and global packaging metrics, and then I'll finish up with comments on our aerospace business and the outlook for the remainder of 2016. 
It's been an incredibly busy start to the year. Our first quarter volumes and results from operations were in line with our expectations. The headwinds from a very competitive pricing environment in China and tough first-quarter comparisons in our food and household segment, as well as startup costs from our various capital projects, all that we had mentioned in our January conference call, played out. 
Overall, we are pleased with the performance of our businesses given those headwinds during a seasonally weak quarter, and Scott will go into more detail on the quarter in just a moment. I'll say, however, that other than China, most of these headwinds are behind us, and we feel momentum building in our various businesses. 
Since late January, we have made notable progress to strategically and operationally position Ball for the future, including signing the agreement for the required sale of the divestment business; producing cans and ends at our new Monterrey, Mexico beverage facility; the successful groundbreaking of our aluminum impact extruded aerosol expansion in Velim, Czechia, which is expected to come online in early 2017; adding additional customers at our new aluminum impact extruded aerosol facility in India; gaining efficiencies in our new contour bottle line in Conroe, Texas and our new tinplate aerosol technology in Chestnut Hill, Tennessee; and growing our aerospace-contracted backlog, as well as acquiring Wavefront Technologies to further enhance our data and cyber capabilities. 
We continue to navigate the highly complex process around the proposed offer for Rexam while keeping our team focused on things they can control day-to-day to keep our company strong and well-positioned for future growth. I, again, want to thank everyone at Ball for rising to the challenge over the past 15 months. And we feel good about the direction of our company, save for the pricing environment in China, with many of the transitory headwind issues now behind us. 
Our future is bright. And irrespective of the Rexam transaction, we see meaningful year-over-year improvement through the balance of the year and beyond. We are right on track, and the best is ahead of us. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott for a review of our first quarter numbers. Scott?"

Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share for the first quarter 2016 were $0.59 versus last year's $0.69. First quarter comparable diluted earnings per share reflected the impact of $7 million in startup costs related to our sizable Monterrey project and the new tinplate steel project as well as anticipated lower volumes in our North American food business and competitive pricing in China. 
The first quarter played out exactly as we said in January, with the repricing of our contracts in China, challenging comps in our food and household products business and the closeout of startup costs on various capital projects, resulting in the first quarter being soft. 
Our GAAP results for the first quarter were unfavorably impacted by the economic hedges we've put in place to reduce currency exchange rate exposure, associated with the British pound-denominated cash portion of the announced acquisition price for Rexam, and to mitigate exposure to interest-rate changes associated with the anticipated debt issuances, also in connection with the cash portion of this proposed acquisition. These economic hedges allow us to lock in the transaction's purchase price economics. Details on these economic hedges are provided in Note 2 of today's earnings release. 
Credit quality and liquidity of the company remains quite solid with comparable EBIT to interest coverage of 5.4x and net debt to comparable EBITDA at 3.3x, including the noncurrent restricted cash sitting in escrow for the U.S. and Euro bond placements -- from the U.S. and Euro bond placements. The company has enough committed credit and available liquidity on hand to consummate the proposed Rexam transaction and provide ongoing liquidity for the company. 
For a complete summary of first quarter results on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis and details regarding the first quarter, please refer to the note section of today's earnings release, which includes a simplified table format summarizing business consolidation activities. Now moving to operations. Our metal beverage Americas and Asia segment comparable operating earnings for the first quarter 2016 were down year-over-year, solely due to China pricing, a significant swing in China volume and project startup costs related to Monterrey. Absent the startup costs in Q1 in North America, this region was up year-over-year. 
As we move through the year, the cost-out programs in China will reduce the loss in this region. And despite the China headwinds, we will see year-over-year improvement across the segment in the back half of the year, as our Monterrey, Mexico can plant second line comes online and startup costs moderate, more than offsetting the impact of China pricing. 
Segment volumes in the quarter were up approximately 2%, including mid-single-digit volume growth in North America, low single-digit volume growth in Brazil and China volumes being down upper-single digits as we proactively prune business due to competitive pricing. 
European beverage comparable earnings were up nicely in the quarter due to aluminum premium tailwinds and strong manufacturing performance, offsetting slightly -- offset slightly by volumes being down low single digits due exclusively to soft export sales to Africa. In fact, excluding such export sales, volumes in the EU were up low single digits, in line with the overall market. 
Industry demand for specialty cans across Europe continues to grow, and industry supply/demand remains balanced. Food and household comparable segment earnings were down in the quarter due to mid-single-digit food can volume declines following the prior-year benefit of certain volumes related to a past food can customer, inventory holding losses as well startup costs related to our tinplate steel aerosol project in Chestnut Hill, Tennessee. 
We continue executing a disciplined cost control growth equation in the segment with cost-out initiatives, like the announced closure of our Weirton, West Virginia facility, versus incremental investments to support continued metal aerosol growth and production efficiencies initiatives in Mexico, Europe and India. These decisions will drive future quarter-on-quarter improvement for 2016 and beyond.
In summary, our global packaging businesses continue to be extremely focused on driving EVA dollars from our new capital projects as we get closer to being able to initiate the next exciting stage in our global metal beverage business. 
To employees listening on today's call, thank you for all of the work on all of these projects. Our business is embarking on its next transformation, which is really exciting stuff, and the collective efforts of the entire team are critical to our shared success. Now as we look to the remainder of 2016 and reflecting Ball as a standalone company today, here's a snapshot of some key metrics -- no real changes here. 
We expect free cash flow to be in a similar range as 2015, excluding cash costs related to the Rexam transaction, with CapEx expected to be in the range of $400 million and working capital expected to be generally flat year-over-year. Interest expense is expected to be roughly $145 million, excluding debt refinancing and other cost, and the full year effective tax rate on comparable earnings is now expected to be in the range of 25%. 
Corporate undistributed is estimated to be in the range of $75 million, a year-over-year reduction of $17 million, and we expect our dividend to remain unchanged from its current level during the proposed acquisition process. 
Exactly as we said in January, in 2016, we expect all our businesses to be up on a full-year basis, with the exception of China beverage can, with momentum accelerating as we move through the year, particularly in the second half. As we indicated back in January, and as we look to the successful closing of the Rexam transaction, we plan to focus our comments in terms of cash EPS post-close due to the large amount of intangible amortization we expect to record for the Rexam transaction. 
And with that, I'll turn it back to you, John."

Our aerospace business reported first-quarter results that were relatively flat with last year. However, I'm happy to report that our contracted backlog closed the quarter $100 million higher than year-end, and even happier to report that as of this week our aerospace backlog stands at greater than $900 million, with even more opportunities for growth during the remainder of 2016. 
It's taken a fair amount of patience for us to get to this point, and I want to congratulate the entire aerospace team for their hard work. More exciting, however, is what is in front of us in aerospace, ramping up on all the new contracts and integrating the recent acquisition of Wavefront Technologies. 
Now across the company, and as we look forward, we are nearing the end of the marathon we began back in February 2015, and we cannot wait to step up to the starting line for the sprint to achieving synergies, cash flow growth and the higher EVA dollar generation that all of our investments can provide. As we said, we continue to face headwinds in our China business. Although going forward, it will moderate. We expect all of our other business units to be up year-over-year and feel momentum building in our business. Together, we are working hard to improve Ball in 2016 and beyond, and we look forward to the hard work that lies ahead. 
So with that, Lyn, we're ready for questions."

The pricing environment is just quite, quite challenging. The only thing I can really say beyond that is, strategically, we are assessing and continue to assess how to make this a better business. As you all know, we're not in the business to lose EVA dollars. And so it's a very high focus for us. On the tinplate side, there has been a lot of change in that business. I think the Weirton, West Virginia closure, while unfortunate, allows us to spread a lot of that cutting and coding capability into other facilities. And that's exactly what we're doing.

You always have timing issues of when you get signed because some of it's out of our control when you have to have various government agencies go through their approval processes. We've had some in the first quarter, some in April, as you heard. And even as we expect going into the June, July, whether it's June, whether it's July, I can't tell you right now. But I know that we still have a fair amount of projects that we call ""won not booked,"" which is not in our backlog, but we've won it. It's just we have to go through the signatory process and the funding process with the government. So nothing has changed on that front. From a mix perspective, I think I talked about this on the January call. There's not an appreciable difference in the mix relative to fixed price versus cost-plus. There could be a little bit more of cost-plus in the overall scheme of this new business won, only because a lot of it's new technology, which I think is good. And our folks have been executing very well on those types of things. So a lot of it's in the DoD, which is both from a satellite perspective as well as a sensor perspective. And then also in the NASA side, where we haven't done a tremendous amount with NASA because their budget's been so constrained. But we've been able to do a very good job or weave our way back into that and are doing several neat things for NASA as we go forward there."

The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings, as well as the company news releases. If you don't already have our second quarter earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com.
Information regarding the pro forma's reference in today's presentation and the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found on our website and on today's webcast slides. 
Joining me on the call today is Scott Morrison, our Senior Vice President and CFO. I'll provide a brief of either of our company's performance, Scott will discuss financial and global packaging metrics, and then I'll finish up with comments on our aerospace business. 
In addition, while we normally do not give short-term guidance, given the complexity related to the simultaneous acquisition of Rexam and divestment of those assets required by the various regulatory agencies, as well as the purchase accounting and transaction-related activities related to such, we will be providing more assistance than typical in the outlook over the next couple of years from an earnings and cash flow perspective. In his comments, Scott will give you some visibilities where we are and what we see over the next 18 months at our company. And I'll talk a bit about our aspirations with respect to the earnings and cash flow generation capabilities over the long term.
The momentum in our business is visible from today's earnings release. Our strong second quarter results were operations led. We couldn't be prouder of our team to execute on our existing business while planning for the integration. As we have mentioned on the past couple of conference calls, we expect together earnings momentum as the year went on, and this is exactly what is happening. 
We are strategically and operationally positioned Ball for a multiyear value compounding period of growth on all key financial measures. Now in the second quarter, we began producing cans in our second line in our new Monterrey, Mexico beverage facility, serving our growing customers under long-term contracts. We began production on our new Myanmar facility. We improved operational performance in our food and aerosol business. We grew our aerospace-contracted backlog to over $1 billion. And we closed on the acquisition of Rexam while completing the required sale of the divestment business. Now that's one heck of a first half. The second half and beyond is where the real fun begins. It feels really good to finally have the steering wheel firmly in our grip following 17 months of external oversight and regulatory reviews.
Rest assured that our people executing our integration and valued capture initiatives have skin in the game, and we are all aligned with our fellow shareholders from an EVA and share ownership perspective. 
I'll share more about our exciting future in my closing comments. So Scott will now talk a bit about the second quarter performance, the baseline to work off and some key financial metrics so that the strength and trajectory of our businesses and cash flow can be seen through the fog of purchase and acquisition accounting.

Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share for second quarter 2016 were $1.05 versus last year's $0.89, an 18% increase. Second quarter comparable diluted earnings per share reflects strong year-over-year operational improvement, lower aluminum premiums and a more normal level of corporate costs, partially offset by higher interest cost, a higher share count and the tail end of startup costs related to recently completed projects. 
Our GAAP results for the first half were impacted by transaction-related hedging, purchase accounting and other customer and closing adjustments. Details are provided in Note 2 of today's earnings release and additional information will also be provided in our 10-Q expected to be filed next week. For a complete summary of second quarter results on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis and details regarding the second quarter, please refer to the note section of today's earnings release, which includes a simplified table format summarizing business consolidation activities.
Our model beverage Americas and Asia segment comparable operating earnings for second quarter 2016 were up year-over-year due to solid volumes and operational performance in North America and Brazil and cost-out initiatives in China, which is helping to offset some the impact of price compression in that region. The segment also saw a few million dollars of net start-up costs in the quarter. 
Now that we've computed the legacy capital projects, we do not expect any notable comments on startup cost for the rest the year. Segment volumes in the quarter were up just over 2%, with China volumes being down upper single-digits, as weather impacted demand and we proactively managed our business due to competitive industry pricing in that country.
Americas volumes were up 4.5% in the second quarter and specialty volume continues to grow nicely with specialty being up just over 10% in the first half. European beverage comparable earnings were up nicely in the quarter, due to the final benefit of aluminum premium tailwinds and low single-digit volume growth. The Europe market continues to grow, industry supply/demand remains tight and specialty demand remains strong. 
Food and aerosol comparable segment earnings improved in the quarter due to strong global demand for aerosol containers and improved operational performance, offset by high single-digit food can volume decline due to timing of Midwest pact related to our customer mix.
Initiatives to further improve production efficiencies are on track and set to benefit early 2017 performance. In summary, our global packaging businesses continue to be extremely focused on integrating the new assets, achieving their synergy goals and driving EVA dollars from the recent capital and efficiency projects. Thank you again to all of our global packaging people. 
Now as we speak about our results going forward, we will adjust for and identified all one-time items impacting free cash flow and operating earnings. Things like these associated with a transaction, severance and accelerated compensation payments to special one-time cash payment on the estimated gain on sale, et cetera, so that the underlying strength the business is clear.
Make no mistake, we have a cash machine on our hands. The business we acquired is not fundamentally different than our legacy business. It has great potential to generate cash. In 2016, the free cash flow will be clouded by all the one-off impacts and how much working capital we can squeeze out of the newly combined business in the back half the year. Regardless, we see no deterioration and definite potential in the comparable pro forma business. As we look at where we are now and for the remainder of 2016, we'll start with the baseline.
Using the U.S. pro forma filed in early July and today's reported first half performance, on our last 12 months basis, the business would roughly have been $1.53 billion of comparable EBITDA, which represents $1.1 billion of comparable operating earnings, plus $430 million of depreciation and amortization. This comparable EBITDA excludes amortization of customer-related intangibles of approximately $140 million annually and approximately $60 million of one-time inventory step up. Our baseline adjusted net debt is approximately $7 billion, which takes into account the repayment of Rexam's revolver, private placement and hybrid debt, settlement of derivatives, the U.K. change of control pension payment and the cash payments to the Rexam shareholders. As we think about the second half of 2016, here are some key metrics to keep in mind.
We expect full year 2016 comparable operating earnings just north of $1 billion. And to be clear, our comparable EPS going forward will exclude the amortization associated with acquired customer intangibles, which should be in the range of $70 million for the second half of 2016. Also excluding from comparable EPS would be roughly $60 [ph] million of inventory step up, most of which will occur over the remainder of 2016. The full year weighted average diluted shares outstanding for 2016 will be in the range of 161 million shares, which reflects the half year impact of the 32 million shares issued for the acquisition. For third quarter and fourth quarter, weighted average diluted shares outstanding will be approximately 177 million.
Full year 2016 interest expense will be in the range of $230 million. Given the negative care associate it with a timing of when the acquired revolver, private placement and hybrid debt came out, third quarter interest expense should run about $7 million higher than fourth quarter. The full year effective tax rate for 2016 on comparable earnings is now expected to be in the range of 28%, taking into account the earnings distribution of the combined company going forward.
Corporate undistributed is estimated to be in the range of $105 million for full year 2016, which includes second half incremental cost of approximately $30 million to support the integration from locations such as Milbank, Rexam's formal global headquarters location, which we will exit by December 2016. As we reference in debt reconciliation included in our earnings release, the funded status of acquired pensions was improved by either the change of control payment me to the U.K. pension plan at the closing the transaction. 
With the remainder of 2016, approximately $50 million of pension funding will occur in the U.S. plans. And given the size of the remaining cash transaction-related payments to be made during the remainder of 2016, we do not anticipate a meaningful reduction in net debt by year-end. 
So now, where are we going? As you can view on the reconciliation backup slide provided on our website and based on current operating conditions and FX rates, our preliminary target for 2017 comparable operating earnings is a range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, excluding the effect of approximately $140 million of intangible amortization. 
For 2017, we expect interest expense of approximately $280 million, a 28% effective tax rate, and full year weighted average diluted share count of approximately 177 million. Given that we are just 35 days post-close, our early estimate for full year 2017 free cash flow after $500 million of CapEx is that we'll be in the range of $750 million to $850 million, excluding one-time items related to the transaction, which is a great step towards our goal of free cash flow being in excess of $1 billion by 2019.
And with that, I'll turn it back to you, John."

Our aerospace business support the second quarter results that were relatively flat with last year. However, I'm happy to report that our contracted backlog closed the quarter at over $1 billion with approximately 70% under cost-plus approach and 30% more of a fixed price nature, which provides a good balance going forward. 
We are ramping up and staffing up for all of the new contracts, which will benefit second half in future year's performance. We are excited about the prospects of this business. And politics aside, we have more opportunities for growth assuming the government does not going to any prolonged continuing resolution. 
Now across the company and as we look forward, as Scott mentioned by year-end 2017, we currently believe we should achieve $150 million of synergies for the year and grow our operating earnings even greater than that on the back of our prior capital growth projects and show improvement in all of Ball's businesses. 
While recognizing it is early days in the integration processes, we have more visibilities into the opportunities we thought possible. And while no doubt there will be challenges, we still expect to generate an excess of $300 million of synergies by the end of 2019. 
And as Scott said, you were also tracking towards our goal to grow our comparable annualized free cash flow to an excess of $1 billion. And when our leverage gets to the 3 to 3.5x debt to EBITDA range, we are poised execute a more robust share repurchase program. 
In summary, our company is taking a step change forward as a result of this acquisition. And whether it be in the commercial arena, our cost-out efforts, our supply chain and footprint work, our innovation efforts positioning the can as the most a suitable package in the beverage world and/or any other area, we are going to take our responsibility as a leader seriously. And with our current aspiration of generating $2 billion of comparable EBITDA and in excess of $1 billion of comparable free cash flow by 2019, we see a clear path to growing EVA dollars, which will allow us to double our long-term goal of 10% to 15% comparable diluted earnings per share growth over each in the next several years. 
And with that, Demetra, we're ready for questions."

The United States, actually, has had 2 quarters as an industry of positive volume growth. We've had a little bit more than that just because of our customer mix and some of the new Monterrey facility, which is great. The can continues to win in the United States. I'd say the -- as we hear in the summer months, it's slowed up a little bit over the last month or so, but nothing appreciably. But if you assume flat, let's only flat growth in the United States, that's probably a good parameter. Down in Brazil, it's been relatively flat, don't know that. Ball second because our customer managed fairly well. But we're expecting the second half of this year and going into 2017 to be relatively flat. It could be down a little bit in the second half the year of sir the OpEx have finished up only because the economy is challenged. Europe continues to be growth area. It's up a couple of percent year-to-date, and we respect that. And then when you look at Asia, you have to look at China and as well as Southeast Asia. China continues to grow strong, but we actually have been declining in part because we're trying to rationalize our business not make these cans for practice. Southeast Asia continues to grow mid-to upper single digits. And then in some the newer region so that we're getting our hands around whether at least -- whether it's even Russia, I think Russia is doing regionally okay. The Middle East is a mixed bag. We can talk about what's going on in Turkey. We can talk about the challenges of Egypt as having with their currency, you can talk about some other places. But I think those fundamentals that I just laid out, we don't expect depreciable differences. But I do expect and we do expect, as we go forward, the can's going to continue to do well relative to other substrates."

It's based on EVA dollar generation and on free cash flow generation relative to our expectations and what our Board signed up on the acquisition. And so that's a -- it's a 3.5-year program. And it's paid out in stock, which is another important component of that. The second one is the deposit share program. It's a bit more limited for -- we have done a number of these programs, a number 3 or 4 of these over the past 15 years or so. The concept is up to a certain amount by individual, that individual has to buy their own stock. then would get a restricted stock that lapses over a period of time.

Obviously, we had to divest our, a majority of our old asset base. But I think the -- on apples-to-apples, it's relatively comparable. In the United States, we think there's opportunity. I think the level of housekeeping, the level of safety, we're going to have to think about putting a little bit of capital and then talking about $3 million to $5 million per plant, not wholesale capital, but to get it up to our standards from a quality perspective, from an efficiency perspective, from our purpose perspective. And then in many other regions that we talked about, many of those assets are relatively new. So while we're getting our hands around that, I think it really more has to do with the question was asked earlier about a risk adjusted return basis what we have done some the things that they had done. And it's -- let's look forward, not back. And we're going to manage these things as best as we possibly can. On the CapEx, and then I'll turn it over to Scott to talk about corporate unallocated. Remember that it's very preliminary. And Scott said the $500 million is a placeholder. What I would tell you is, as we think about it, the CapEx really falls in the 3 or 4 different buckets. Number one, we have level of maintenance CapEx. We always talk about Ball's was $150 million to $175 million. You ought to think probably adding about $50 million to $75 million on to that for the totality of what we acquired. But then, the additional capitals, like we always do and it's tried and true at Ball, is a bottoms up approach and it falls into the 3 of our drive for 10 buckets. It's about, number one, maxing the value, existing value of what we do. I talked a little bit about some of the opportunities we have in North America. It also talks about geographic growth, where as you know, we're just, in the last 12 months, we've started up in Mexico. We started up in Myanmar. There's probably some opportunities there, but we're going to be very judicious about that. And then last, but not least, in terms of new customers and new products, are especially continue to grow very strongly. We've been successful in converting our facilities into specialty containers. Rexam hasn't done nearly as much. And so there's probably opportunities along that path. But that's going to be customer and specific opportunity by opportunity. So that's a holistic context of the way to think about our capital as at least the way we are thinking about our capital going forward. And maybe I'll turn it over to Scott now."

I give our folks a menace amount of credit because without that, it would be a very, very challenging situation in China. The bigger question is, as you look forward, what does that mean? Because you can save your way to prosperity. We think the industry needs a level of consolidation in China market. There's too many independent players out there. The strategic question is how that occurs and when it occurs. And I can't go into detail, but we are taking it very seriously.

Some of it was market related from a pricing perspective. Some of it was self-inflicted related to the cost side. We are 70%, 80% of the way through completing a project that is going to have significant cost reduction in that business to make us more competitive. And that's were I think, Debbie, because of the growth in the aerosol and because the cost out we have in food, that's why we, as well as many other people, do expect a better 2017 relative to 2016.

Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings, as well as the company news releases. If you don't already have our second quarter earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com.
Information regarding the pro forma's reference in today's presentation and the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found on our website and in today's webcast slides. 
Joining me on the call today is Scott Morrison, our Senior Vice President and CFO. I'll provide a brief overview of our company's performance, Scott will discuss financial and global packaging metrics, and then I'll finish up with comments on our aerospace business. 
In addition, while we normally do not give short-term guidance. Given the complexity related to the simultaneous acquisition of Rexam and divestment of those assets required by the various regulatory agencies, as well as the purchase accounting and transaction-related activities related to such, we will be providing more assistance than typical on the outlook over the next couple of years from an earnings and cash flow perspective. In his comments, Scott will give you some visibility as to where we are and what we see over the next 18 months at our company. And I'll talk a bit about our aspirations with respect to the earnings and cash flow generation capabilities over the long term.
The momentum in our business is visible from today's earnings release. Our strong second quarter results for operations led. We couldn't be prouder of our team to execute on our existing business, while planning for the integration. As we had mentioned on the past couple of conference calls, we expected to gather earnings momentum as the year went on, and this is exactly what is happening. 
We are strategically and operationally positioned Ball for a multi-year value compounding period of growth on all key financial measures. Now in the second quarter, we began producing cans on our second line in our new Monterrey, Mexico beverage facility, serving our growing customers under long-term contracts. We began production on our new Myanmar facility. We improved operational performance in our food and aerosol business. We grew our aerospace-contracted backlog to over $1 billion. And we closed on the acquisition of Rexam, while completing the required sale of the divestment business. Now that's one heck of a first half. The second half and beyond is where the real fun begins. It feels really good to finally have the steering wheel firmly in our grip following 17 months of external oversight and regulatory reviews.
Rest assured that our people executing our integration and valued capture initiatives have skin in the game, and we are all aligned with our fellow shareholders from an EVA and share ownership perspective. 
I'll share more about our exciting future in my closing comments. So Scott will now talk a bit about the second quarter performance, the baseline to work of off, and some key financial metrics, so that the strength and trajectory of our businesses and cash flow can be seen through the fog of purchase and acquisition accounting.

I plan to bucket my comments in 3 areas: where we have been, where we are now, and we are going. Let me start with ""where we have been. ""
Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share for second quarter 2016 were $1.05 versus last year's $0.89, an 18% increase. Second quarter comparable diluted earnings per share reflects strong year-over-year operational improvement, lower aluminum premiums, and a more normal level of corporate costs, partially offset by higher interest costs, a higher share count, and the tail-end of startup costs related to recently completed projects. 
Our GAAP results for the first half were impacted by transaction-related hedging, purchase accounting, and other customary closing adjustments. Details are provided in Note 2 of today's earnings release, and additional information will also be provided in our 10-Q expected to be filed next week. For a complete summary of second quarter results on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis and details regarding the second quarter, please refer to the Note section of today's earnings release, which includes a simplified table format summarizing business consolidation activities.
Our metal beverage Americas and Asia segment comparable operating earnings for second quarter 2016 were up year-over-year, due to solid volumes and operational performance in North America and Brazil and cost-out initiatives in China, which is helping to offset some of the impact of price compression in that region. The segment also saw a few million dollars of net startup costs in the quarter. 
Now that we've completed the legacy capital projects, we do not expect any notable comments on startup costs for the rest of the year. Segment volumes in the quarter were up just over 2%, with China volumes being down upper single-digits, as weather impacted demand and we proactively managed our business, due to competitive industry pricing in that country.
Americas volumes were up 4.5% in the second quarter, and specialty volume continues to grow nicely with specialty being up just over 10% in the first half. European beverage comparable earnings were up nicely in the quarter, due to the final benefit of aluminum premium tailwinds and low single-digit volume growth. The Europe market continues to grow, industry's supply/demand remains tight, and specialty demand remains strong. 
Food and aerosol comparable segment earnings improved in the quarter, due to strong global demand for aerosol containers, and improved operational performance offset by high single-digit food can volume declines, due to timing of the Midwest pact related to our customer mix.
Initiatives to further improve production efficiencies are on track and set to benefit early 2017 performance. In summary, our global packaging businesses continued to be extremely focused on integrating the new assets, achieving their synergy goals and driving EVA dollars from the recent capital and efficiency projects. Thank you again to all of our global packaging people. 
Now as we speak about our results going forward, we will adjust for and identify our one-time items impacting free cash flow and operating earnings. Things like fees associated with the transaction, severance and accelerated compensation payments, the special one-time tax payment on the estimated gain on sale, et cetera, so that the underlying strength the business is clear.
Making no mistake, we have a cash machine on our hands. The business we acquired is not fundamentally different than our legacy business. It has great potential to generate cash. In 2016, the free cash flow will be clouded by all the one-off impacts and how much working capital we can squeeze out of the newly combined business in the back half of the year. Regardless, we see no deterioration and definitely potential in the comparable pro forma business. As we look at where we are now and for the remainder of 2016, we'll start with the baseline.
Using the U.S. pro forma's filed in early July and today's reported first half performance. On a last 12 months basis, the business would roughly have been $1.53 billion of comparable EBITDA, which represents $1.1 billion of comparable operating earnings, plus $430 million of depreciation and amortization. This comparable EBITDA excludes amortization of customer-related intangibles of approximately $140 million annually and approximately $60 million of one-time inventory step up. Our baseline adjusted net debt is approximately $7 billion, which takes into account the repayment of Rexam's revolver, private placement, and hybrid debt, settlement of derivatives, the U.K. change of control pension payment, and the cash payment to the Rexam shareholders. As we think about the second half of 2016, here are some key metrics to keep in mind.
We expect full year 2016 comparable operating earnings just north of a $1 billion. And to be clear, our comparable EPS going forward, will exclude the amortization associated with acquired customer intangibles, which should be in the range of $70 million for the second half of 2016. Also excluding from comparable EPS, will be roughly $60 million of inventory step up, most of which will occur over the remainder of 2016. The full year weighted average diluted shares outstanding for 2016 will be in the range of 161 million shares, which reflects the half year impact of the 32 million shares issued for the acquisition. For third quarter and fourth quarter, weighted average diluted shares outstanding will be approximately 177 million.
Full year 2016 interest expense will be in the range of $230 million, given the negative carry associated with the timing of when the acquired revolver, private placement, and hybrid debt came out. Third quarter interest expense should run about $7 million higher than fourth quarter. The full year effective tax rate for 2016 on comparable earnings is now expected to be in the range of 28%, taking into account, the earnings distribution of the combined company going forward.
Corporate undistributed is estimated to be in the range of $105 million for full year 2016, which includes second half incremental costs of approximately $30 million to support the integration from locations, such as Milbank, Rexam's formal global headquarters location, which we will exit by December 2016. As we referenced in the debt reconciliation, are included in our earnings release, the funded status of acquired pensions was improved by the change of control payment made to the U.K. pension plan at the closing of the transaction. 
With the remainder of 2016, approximately $50 million of pension funding will occur in the U.S. plans. And given the size of the remaining cash-transaction-related payments to be made during the remainder of 2016, we do not anticipate a meaningful reduction in net debt by year-end. 
So now. ""where are we going. "" As you can view on the reconciliation backup slide provided on our website and based on current operating conditions and FX rates, our preliminary target for 2017 comparable operating earnings is a range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, excluding the effect of approximately $140 million of intangible amortization. 
For 2017, we expect interest expense of approximately $280 million, a 28% effective tax rate, and full year weighted average diluted share count of approximately 177 million. Given that we are just 35 days post-close, our early estimate for full year 2017 free cash flow, after $500 million of CapEx is that, will be in the range of $750 million to $850 million, excluding one-time items related to the transaction, which is a great step towards our goal of free cash flow being in excess of $1 billion by 2019.
And with that, I'll turn it back to you, John."

Our aerospace business reported second quarter results that were relatively flat with last year. However, I'm happy to report that our contracted backlog closed the quarter at over $1 billion, with approximately 70% under cost-plus approach and 30% more of a fixed price nature, which provides a good balance going forward. 
We are ramping up and staffing up, for all of the new contracts, which will benefit second half and future year's performance. We are excited about the prospects of this business, and politics aside, we have more opportunities for growth, assuming the government does not go into any prolonged continuing resolution. 
Now across the company, and as we look forward, as Scott mentioned, by year-end 2017, we currently believe we should achieve $150 million of synergies for the year, and grow our operating earnings even greater than that on the back of our prior capital growth projects, and show improvement in all of Ball's businesses. 
While recognizing it is early days in the integration processes, we have more visibilities into the opportunities we thought possible. And while no doubt there will be challenges, we still expect to generate in excess of $300 million of synergies by the end of 2019. 
And as Scott said, we're also tracking towards our goal to grow our comparable annualized free cash flow to an -- in excess of about $1 billion. And when our leverage gets to the 3 to 3.5x debt to EBITDA range, we are poised execute a more robust share repurchase program. 
In summary, our company is taking a step change forward, as a result of this acquisition. And whether it be in the commercial arena, our cost-out efforts, our supply chain and footprint work, our innovation efforts, positioning the can as the most suitable package in the beverage world and/or any other area, we are going to take our responsibility as a leader seriously. And with our current aspiration of generating $2 billion of comparable EBITDA, and in excess of $1 billion of comparable free cash flow by 2019, we see a clear path growing EVA dollars, which will allow us to double our long-term goal of 10% to 15% comparable diluted earnings per share growth over each of the next several years. 
And with that, Dmitra, we're ready for questions."

United States, actually, has had 2 quarters as an industry of positive volume growth. We've had a little bit more than that just because of our customer mix and some of the new Monterrey facility, which is great. The can continues to win in the United States. I'd say that, as we hear in the summer months, it's slowed up a little bit over the last month or so, but nothing appreciably. But if you assume flat -- relatively flat growth in the United States, that's probably a good parameter. Down in Brazil, it's been relatively flat, down a little bit. Ball's, again, because of our customer mix has been done fairly well, but we're expecting, the second half of this year and going into 2017 to be relatively flat. It could be down a little bit at the second half of this year of, after the Olympics are finished up, only because the economy is challenged. Europe continues to be a growth area, it's up a couple of percent year-to-date, and we expect that. And then, when you look at Asia, you have to look at China, and as well as Southeast Asia. China continues to grow strong, but we actually have been declining in part because we're trying to rationalize our business and not make these cans for practice. Southeast Asia continues to grow mid- to upper single-digits. And then, in some of the newer regions, that we're getting our hands around whether it's the Middle East, whether its, even Russia, I think Russia is doing regionally okay. The Middle East is a mixed bag, we could talk about what's going on in Turkey. We can talk about the challenges of Egypt is having with their currency. You can talk about some other places.

It's based on EVA dollar generation and on free cash flow generation, relative to our expectations and what our Board signed up on the acquisition. And so that's a -- it's a 3.5-year program. And it's paid out in stock, which is another important component of that. The second one is the deposit-share program. It's a bit more limited for -- we have done in a number of these programs, a number 3 or 4 of these, over the past 15 years or so. The concept is up to a certain amount by individual, that individual has to buy their own stock, and then would get a restricted stock that lapses over a period of time. In this case, I believe it's 4 years, so as long as they hold onto the existing stock. So you have to put your own money in, and then you'll be matched up to a certain point.

In terms of what we're seeing and how we might do things similar or different from the old Rexam. One of the things, I'll point out, we are very excited about the engagement of the people, or the people that we acquired. I think this has reenergized everyone at our company. But also, our new employees that are coming in. And anyone who runs businesses know, that if you have the engagement of the people, that is a big chunk of it. So we're very, very excited. When you talk about the assets, you really have to go by region. And so I'll start in South America. They've got some great assets down there. They've got some great people down there. And we're very excited about that. In Europe, they've recently been doing some restructuring in Europe, which is actually helping them there. And I think the asset base there is very good. Obviously, we had to divest our -- a majority of our old asset base. But I think the -- on apples-to-apples, it's relatively comparable. In the United States, we think there's opportunity. I think the level of housekeeping, the level of safety, we're going to have to think about putting a little bit of capital, and then talking about, $3 million to $5 million per plant, not wholesale capital, but to get it up to our standards from a quality perspective, from a efficiency perspective, from an out-purpose perspective. And then in many of the other regions that we talked about, many of those assets are relatively new. So while we're getting our hands around that, I think it really more has to do is, with -- question was asked earlier upon the risk adjusted return basis. Would we have done some the things that they had done? And it's -- let's look forward, not back, and we're going to manage these things as best we possibly can. On the CapEx, and then I'll turn it over to Scott, to talk about corporate unallocated. Remember that it's very preliminary. And Scott said, the $500 million is a placeholder. What I would tell you is, as we think about it, the CapEx really falls in the 3 or 4 different buckets. Number one, we have a level of maintenance CapEx. We always talked about, Ball's was a $150 million to $175 million. You ought to think probably adding about $50 million to $75 million on to that for the totality of what we acquired. But then, the additional capital is, like we always do, and it's tried and true at Ball, it's a bottoms-up approach, and it falls into 3 of our drive for 10 buckets. It's about, number one, maxing the value, existing value of what we do. I talked a little bit about some of the opportunities we have in North America. It also talks about geographic growth, where as you know, we're just, in the last 12 months, we've started up in Mexico, and we started up in Myanmar. There's probably some opportunities there, but we're going to be very judicious about that. And then last, but not least, in terms of new customers and new products, especially continues to grow very strongly. We've been successful in converting our facilities into specialty containers. Rexam hasn't done nearly as much. And so there's some probably opportunities along that path. But that's going to be customer and specific opportunity-by-opportunity. So that's a holistic context, the way to think about our capital, as at least, the way we are thinking about our capital going forward. And maybe I'll turn it over to Scott now."

The bigger question is, as you look forward, what does that mean? Because you can't save your way to prosperity. We think the industry needs a level of consolidation in China market. There is too many independent players out there. The strategic question is how that occurs, and when it occurs. And I can't go into detail, but we are taking it very seriously.

Some of it was market related from a pricing perspective. Some of it was self-inflicted related to the cost side. We are 70%, 80% of the way through completing a project that is going to have significant cost reduction in that business to make us more competitive.

Information regarding the pro forma's reference in today's presentation and the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found on our website and in today's webcast slides. 
Joining me on the call today is Scott Morrison, our Senior Vice President and CFO. I'll provide a brief overview of our company's performance, Scott will discuss financial and global packaging metrics, and then I'll finish up with comments on our aerospace business. 
In addition, while we normally do not give short-term guidance. Given the complexity related to the simultaneous acquisition of Rexam and divestment of those assets required by the various regulatory agencies, as well as the purchase accounting and transaction-related activities related to such, we will be providing more assistance than typical on the outlook over the next couple of years from an earnings and cash flow perspective. In his comments, Scott will give you some visibility as to where we are and what we see over the next 18 months at our company. And I'll talk a bit about our aspirations with respect to the earnings and cash flow generation capabilities over the long term.
The momentum in our business is visible from today's earnings release. Our strong second quarter results were operations led. We couldn't be prouder of our team to execute on our existing business, while planning for the integration. As we had mentioned on the past couple of conference calls, we expected to gather earnings momentum as the year went on, and this is exactly what is happening. 
We have strategically and operationally positioned Ball for a multi-year value compounding period of growth on all key financial measures. Now in the second quarter, we began producing cans on our second line in our new Monterrey, Mexico beverage facility, serving our growing customers under long-term contracts. We began production on our new Myanmar facility. We improved operational performance in our food and aerosol business. We grew our aerospace-contracted backlog to over $1 billion. And we closed on the acquisition of Rexam, while completing the required sale of the divestment business. Now that's one heck of a first half. The second half and beyond is where the real fun begins. It feels really good to finally have the steering wheel firmly in our grip following 17 months of external oversight and regulatory reviews.
Rest assured that our people executing our integration and value-capture initiatives have skin in the game, and we are all aligned with our fellow shareholders from an EVA and share ownership perspective. 
I'll share more about our exciting future in my closing comments. So Scott will now talk a bit about the second quarter performance, the baseline to work of off, and some key financial metrics, so that the strength and trajectory of our businesses and cash flow can be seen through the fog of purchase and acquisition accounting.

I plan to bucket my comments in 3 areas: where we have been, where we are now, and we are going. Let me start with where we have been.
Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share for second quarter 2016 were $1.05 versus last year's $0.89, an 18% increase. Second quarter comparable diluted earnings per share reflects strong year-over-year operational improvement, lower aluminum premiums, and a more normal level of corporate costs, partially offset by higher interest costs, a higher share count, and the tail-end of startup costs related to recently completed projects. 
Our GAAP results for the first half were impacted by transaction-related hedging, purchase accounting, and other customary closing adjustments. Details are provided in Note 2 of today's earnings release, and additional information will also be provided in our 10-Q expected to be filed next week. For a complete summary of second quarter results on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis and details regarding the second quarter, please refer to the Notes section of today's earnings release, which includes a simplified table format summarizing business consolidation activities.
Our metal beverage Americas and Asia segment comparable operating earnings for second quarter 2016 were up year-over-year, due to solid volumes and operational performance in North America and Brazil and cost-out initiatives in China, which is helping to offset some of the impact of price compression in that region. The segment also saw a few million dollars of net startup costs in the quarter. 
Now that we've completed the legacy capital projects, we do not expect any notable comments on startup costs for the rest of the year. Segment volumes in the quarter were up just over 2%, with China volumes being down upper single-digits, as weather impacted demand and we proactively managed our business, due to competitive industry pricing in that country.
Americas volumes were up 4.5% in the second quarter, and specialty volume continues to grow nicely, with specialty being up just over 10% in the first half. European beverage comparable earnings were up nicely in the quarter, due to the final benefit of aluminum premium tailwinds and low single-digit volume growth. The Europe market continues to grow, industry's supply/demand remains tight, and specialty demand remains strong. 
Food and aerosol comparable segment earnings improved in the quarter, due to strong global demand for aerosol containers, and improved operational performance offset by high single-digit food can volume declines, due to timing of the Midwest pact related to our customer mix.
Initiatives to further improve production efficiencies are on track and set to benefit early 2017 performance. In summary, our global packaging businesses continued to be extremely focused on integrating the new assets, achieving their synergy goals and driving EVA dollars from the recent capital and efficiency projects. Thank you again to all of our global packaging people. 
Now as we speak about our results going forward, we will adjust for and identify our one-time items impacting free cash flow and operating earnings. Things like fees associated with the transaction, severance and accelerated compensation payments, the special onetime tax payment on the estimated gain on sale, et cetera, so that the underlying strength of the business is clear.
Making no mistake, we have a cash machine on our hands. The business we acquired is not fundamentally different than our legacy business. It has great potential to generate cash. In 2016, the free cash flow will be clouded by all the one-off impacts and how much working capital we can squeeze out of the newly combined business in the back half of the year. Regardless, we see no deterioration and definitely potential in the comparable pro forma business. As we look at where we are now and for the remainder of 2016, we'll start with the baseline.
Using the U.S. pro forma's filed in early July and today's reported first half performance, on a last-12-months’ basis, the business would roughly have been $1.53 billion of comparable EBITDA, which represents $1.1 billion of comparable operating earnings, plus $430 million of depreciation and amortization. This comparable EBITDA excludes amortization of customer-related intangibles of approximately $140 million annually and approximately $60 million of onetime inventory step-up. Our baseline adjusted net debt is approximately $7 billion, which takes into account the repayment of Rexam's revolver, private placement, and hybrid debt, settlement of derivatives, the U.K. change of control pension payment, and the cash payment to the Rexam shareholders. As we think about the second half of 2016, here are some key metrics to keep in mind.
We expect full year 2016 comparable operating earnings just north of $1 billion. And to be clear, our comparable EPS going forward will exclude the amortization associated with acquired customer intangibles, which should be in the range of $70 million for the second half of 2016. Also excluding from comparable EPS, will be roughly $60 million of inventory step up, most of which will occur over the remainder of 2016. The full year weighted average diluted shares outstanding for 2016 will be in the range of 161 million shares, which reflects the half year impact of the 32 million shares issued for the acquisition. For third quarter and fourth quarter, weighted average diluted shares outstanding will be approximately 177 million.
Full year 2016 interest expense will be in the range of $230 million. Given the negative carry associated with the timing of when the acquired revolver, private placement, and hybrid debt came out, third quarter interest expense should run about $7 million higher than fourth quarter. The full year effective tax rate for 2016 on comparable earnings is now expected to be in the range of 28%, taking into account, the earnings distribution of the combined company going forward.
Corporate undistributed is estimated to be in the range of $105 million for full year 2016, which includes second half incremental costs of approximately $30 million to support the integration from locations such as Milbank, Rexam's formal global headquarters location, which we will exit by December 2016. As we referenced in the debt reconciliation, are included in our earnings release, the funded status of acquired pensions was improved by the change of control payment made to the U.K. pension plan at the closing of the transaction. 
With the remainder of 2016, approximately $50 million of pension funding will occur in the U.S. plans. And given the size of the remaining cash-transaction-related payments to be made during the remainder of 2016, we do not anticipate a meaningful reduction in net debt by year-end. 
So now, where are we going? As you can view on the reconciliation backup slide provided on our website and based on current operating conditions and FX rates, our preliminary target for 2017 comparable operating earnings is a range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, excluding the effect of approximately $140 million of intangible amortization. 
For 2017, we expect interest expense of approximately $280 million, a 28% effective tax rate, and full year weighted average diluted share count of approximately 177 million. Given that we are just 35 days post-close, our early estimate for full year 2017 free cash flow, after $500 million of CapEx, is that we will be in the range of $750 million to $850 million, excluding one-time items related to the transaction, which is a great step towards our goal of free cash flow being in excess of $1 billion by 2019.
And with that, I'll turn it back to you, John."

Our aerospace business reported second quarter results that were relatively flat with last year. However, I'm happy to report that our contracted backlog closed the quarter at over $1 billion, with approximately 70% under cost-plus approach and 30% more of a fixed price nature, which provides a good balance going forward. 
We are ramping up and staffing up for all of the new contracts which will benefit second half and future year's performance. We are excited about the prospects of this business, and politics aside, we have more opportunities for growth, assuming the government does not go into any prolonged continuing resolution. 
Now across the company, and as we look forward, as Scott mentioned, by year-end 2017, we currently believe we should achieve $150 million of synergies for the year, and grow our operating earnings even greater than that on the back of our prior capital growth projects, and show improvement in all of Ball's businesses. 
While recognizing it is early days in the integration processes, we have more visibilities into the opportunities we thought possible. And while no doubt there will be challenges, we still expect to generate in excess of $300 million of synergies by the end of 2019. 
And as Scott said, we are also tracking towards our goal to grow our comparable annualized free cash flow to in excess of about $1 billion. And when our leverage gets to the 3 to 3.5x debt to EBITDA range, we are poised execute a more robust share repurchase program. 
In summary, our company is taking a step change forward, as a result of this acquisition. And whether it be in the commercial arena, our cost-out efforts, our supply chain and footprint work, our innovation efforts, positioning the can as the most suitable package in the beverage world and/or any other area, we are going to take our responsibility as a leader seriously. And with our current aspiration of generating $2 billion of comparable EBITDA, and in excess of $1 billion of comparable free cash flow by 2019, we see a clear path to growing EVA dollars, which will allow us to double our long-term goal of 10% to 15% comparable diluted earnings per share growth over each of the next several years. 
And with that, Dmitra, we're ready for questions."

United States, actually, has had 2 quarters as an industry of positive volume growth. We've had a little bit more than that just because of our customer mix and some of the new Monterrey facility, which is great. The can continues to win in the United States. I'd say that, as we hear in the summer months, it's slowed up a little bit over the last month or so, but nothing appreciably. But if you assume flat -- relatively flat growth in the United States, that's probably a good parameter. Down in Brazil, it's been relatively flat, down a little bit. Ball's, again, because of our customer mix has been done fairly well, but we're expecting, the second half of this year and going into 2017 to be relatively flat. It could be down a little bit at the second half of this year, after the Olympics are finished up, only because the economy is challenged. Europe continues to be a growth area. It's up a couple of percent year-to-date, and we expect that. And then, when you look at Asia, you have to look at China, and as well as Southeast Asia. China continues to grow strong, but we actually have been declining, in part because we're trying to rationalize our business and not make these cans for practice. Southeast Asia continues to grow mid- to upper single-digits. And then, in some of the newer regions that we're getting our hands around, whether it's the Middle East, whether it's even Russia, I think Russia is doing regionally okay. The Middle East is a mixed bag. We could talk about what's going on in Turkey. We can talk about the challenges of Egypt is having with their currency. You can talk about some other places. But I think those fundamentals that I've just laid out, we don't expect appreciable differences.

And like I talk about, we all have skin in the game. That's what I was referring to. There is a special incentive program that actually does go pretty deep in the organization, gets into the plant level. It's broad-based, distributed. The measurements are very similar to what we've done in the past, that is tried and true. It's based on EVA dollar generation and on free cash flow generation, relative to our expectations and what our Board signed up on the acquisition. And so that's a -- it's a 3.5-year program. And it's paid out in stock, which is another important component of that. The second one is the deposit-share program. It's a bit more limited for -- we have done a number of these programs, a number, 3 or 4 of these over the past 15 years or so. The concept is up to a certain amount by individual, that individual has to buy their own stock, and then would get a restricted stock that lapses over a period of time. In this case, I believe, it's 4 years, so as long as they hold onto the existing stock. So you have to put your own money in, and then you'll be matched up to a certain point.

In terms of what we're seeing and how we might do things similar or different from the old Rexam. One of the things, I'll point out, we are very excited about the engagement of the people, or the people that we acquired. I think this has reenergized everyone at our company. But also, our new employees that are coming in. And anyone who runs businesses know, that if you have the engagement of the people, that is a big chunk of it. So we're very, very excited. When you talk about the assets, you really have to go by region. And so I'll start in South America. They've got some great assets down there. They've got some great people down there. And we're very excited about that. In Europe, they've recently been doing some restructuring in Europe, which is actually helping them there. And I think the asset base there is very good. Obviously, we had to divest our -- a majority of our old asset base. But I think the -- on apples-to-apples, it's relatively comparable. In the United States, we think there's opportunity. I think the level of housekeeping, the level of safety, we're going to have to think about putting a little bit of capital, and I'm talking about $3 million to $5 million per plant, not wholesale capital, but to get it up to our standards from a quality perspective, from an efficiency perspective, from an out-purpose perspective. And then in many of the other regions that we talked about, many of those assets are relatively new. So while we're getting our hands around that, I think it really more has to do is -- with -- a question was asked earlier upon the risk adjusted return basis. Would we have done some the things that they had done? And it's -- let's look forward, not back, and we're going to manage these things as best we possibly can. On the CapEx, and then I'll turn it over to Scott to talk about corporate unallocated. Remember that it's very preliminary. And Scott said the $500 million is a placeholder. What I would tell you is, as we think about it, the CapEx really falls in the 3 or 4 different buckets. Number one, we have a level of maintenance CapEx. We always talked about, Ball's was a $150 million to $175 million. You ought to think probably adding about $50 million to $75 million on to that for the totality of what we acquired. But then the additional capital is, like we always do, and it's a tried and true at Ball, it's a bottoms-up approach, and it falls into 3 of our drive for 10 buckets. It's about, number one, maxing the value, existing value of what we do. I talked a little bit about some of the opportunities we have in North America. It also talks about geographic growth, where, as you know, we're just -- in the last 12 months, we've started up in Mexico and we started up in Myanmar. There's probably some opportunities there, but we're going to be very judicious about that. And then last, but not least, in terms of new customers and new products, our specialty continues to grow very strongly. We've been successful in converting our facilities into specialty containers. Rexam hasn't done nearly as much. And so there's some probably opportunities along that path. But that's going to be customer and specific opportunity by opportunity. So that's a holistic context, the way to think about our capital, as at least the way we are thinking about our capital going forward. And maybe I'll turn it over to Scott now."

And I give our folks a tremendous amount of credit because without that, it would be a very, very challenging situation in China. The bigger question is, as you look forward, what does that mean? Because you can't save your way to prosperity. We think the industry needs a level of consolidation in the China market. There’s too many independent players out there. The strategic question is how that occurs and when it occurs. And I can't go into detail, but we are taking it very seriously. Because as you look through, there is -- just from a supply demand perspective, there is too many suppliers chasing too few customers.

Some of it was market related from a pricing perspective. Some of it was self-inflicted related to the cost side. We are 70%, 80% of the way through completing a project that is going to have significant cost reduction in that business to make us more competitive.

The biggest question from my -- our perspective, George, on that is, is one consolidation enough to really change the dynamics?

Information regarding the pro forma's reference in today's presentation and the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found on our website and in today's webcast slides. 
Joining me on the call today is Scott Morrison, our Senior Vice President and CFO. I'll provide a brief overview of our company's performance, Scott will discuss financial and global packaging metrics, and then I'll finish up with comments on our aerospace business. 
In addition, while we normally do not give short-term guidance. Given the complexity related to the simultaneous acquisition of Rexam and divestment of those assets required by the various regulatory agencies, as well as the purchase accounting and transaction-related activities related to such, we will be providing more assistance than typical on the outlook over the next couple of years from an earnings and cash flow perspective. In his comments, Scott will give you some visibility as to where we are and what we see over the next 18 months at our company. And I'll talk a bit about our aspirations with respect to the earnings and cash flow generation capabilities over the long term.
The momentum in our business is visible from today's earnings release. Our strong second quarter results were operations led. We couldn't be prouder of our team to execute on our existing business, while planning for the integration. As we had mentioned on the past couple of conference calls, we expected to gather earnings momentum as the year went on, and this is exactly what is happening. 
We have strategically and operationally positioned Ball for a multi-year value compounding period of growth on all key financial measures. Now in the second quarter, we began producing cans on our second line in our new Monterrey, Mexico beverage facility, serving our growing customers under long-term contracts. We began production on our new Myanmar facility. We improved operational performance in our food and aerosol business. We grew our aerospace-contracted backlog to over $1 billion. And we closed on the acquisition of Rexam, while completing the required sale of the divestment business. Now that's one heck of a first half. The second half and beyond is where the real fun begins. It feels really good to finally have the steering wheel firmly in our grip following 17 months of external oversight and regulatory reviews.
Rest assured that our people executing our integration and value-capture initiatives have skin in the game, and we are all aligned with our fellow shareholders from an EVA and share ownership perspective. 
I'll share more about our exciting future in my closing comments. So Scott will now talk a bit about the second quarter performance, the baseline to work of off, and some key financial metrics, so that the strength and trajectory of our businesses and cash flow can be seen through the fog of purchase and acquisition accounting.

I plan to bucket my comments in 3 areas: where we have been, where we are now, and we are going. Let me start with where we have been.
Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share for second quarter 2016 were $1.05 versus last year's $0.89, an 18% increase. Second quarter comparable diluted earnings per share reflects strong year-over-year operational improvement, lower aluminum premiums, and a more normal level of corporate costs, partially offset by higher interest costs, a higher share count, and the tail-end of startup costs related to recently completed projects. 
Our GAAP results for the first half were impacted by transaction-related hedging, purchase accounting, and other customary closing adjustments. Details are provided in Note 2 of today's earnings release, and additional information will also be provided in our 10-Q expected to be filed next week. For a complete summary of second quarter results on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis and details regarding the second quarter, please refer to the Notes section of today's earnings release, which includes a simplified table format summarizing business consolidation activities.
Our metal beverage Americas and Asia segment comparable operating earnings for second quarter 2016 were up year-over-year, due to solid volumes and operational performance in North America and Brazil and cost-out initiatives in China, which is helping to offset some of the impact of price compression in that region. The segment also saw a few million dollars of net startup costs in the quarter. 
Now that we've completed the legacy capital projects, we do not expect any notable comments on startup costs for the rest of the year. Segment volumes in the quarter were up just over 2%, with China volumes being down upper single-digits, as weather impacted demand and we proactively managed our business, due to competitive industry pricing in that country.
Americas volumes were up 4.5% in the second quarter, and specialty volume continues to grow nicely, with specialty being up just over 10% in the first half. European beverage comparable earnings were up nicely in the quarter, due to the final benefit of aluminum premium tailwinds and low single-digit volume growth. The Europe market continues to grow, industry's supply/demand remains tight, and specialty demand remains strong. 
Food and aerosol comparable segment earnings improved in the quarter, due to strong global demand for aerosol containers, and improved operational performance offset by high single-digit food can volume declines, due to timing of the Midwest pact related to our customer mix.
Initiatives to further improve production efficiencies are on track and set to benefit early 2017 performance. In summary, our global packaging businesses continued to be extremely focused on integrating the new assets, achieving their synergy goals and driving EVA dollars from the recent capital and efficiency projects. Thank you again to all of our global packaging people. 
Now as we speak about our results going forward, we will adjust for and identify our one-time items impacting free cash flow and operating earnings. Things like fees associated with the transaction, severance and accelerated compensation payments, the special onetime tax payment on the estimated gain on sale, et cetera, so that the underlying strength of the business is clear.
Making no mistake, we have a cash machine on our hands. The business we acquired is not fundamentally different than our legacy business. It has great potential to generate cash. In 2016, the free cash flow will be clouded by all the one-off impacts and how much working capital we can squeeze out of the newly combined business in the back half of the year. Regardless, we see no deterioration and definitely potential in the comparable pro forma business. As we look at where we are now and for the remainder of 2016, we'll start with the baseline.
Using the U.S. pro forma's filed in early July and today's reported first half performance, on a last-12-months’ basis, the business would roughly have been $1.53 billion of comparable EBITDA, which represents $1.1 billion of comparable operating earnings, plus $430 million of depreciation and amortization. This comparable EBITDA excludes amortization of customer-related intangibles of approximately $140 million annually and approximately $60 million of onetime inventory step-up. Our baseline adjusted net debt is approximately $7 billion, which takes into account the repayment of Rexam's revolver, private placement, and hybrid debt, settlement of derivatives, the U.K. change of control pension payment, and the cash payment to the Rexam shareholders. As we think about the second half of 2016, here are some key metrics to keep in mind.
We expect full year 2016 comparable operating earnings just north of $1 billion. And to be clear, our comparable EPS going forward will exclude the amortization associated with acquired customer intangibles, which should be in the range of $70 million for the second half of 2016. Also excluding from comparable EPS, will be roughly $60 million of inventory step up, most of which will occur over the remainder of 2016. The full year weighted average diluted shares outstanding for 2016 will be in the range of 161 million shares, which reflects the half year impact of the 32 million shares issued for the acquisition. For third quarter and fourth quarter, weighted average diluted shares outstanding will be approximately 177 million.
Full year 2016 interest expense will be in the range of $230 million. Given the negative carry associated with the timing of when the acquired revolver, private placement, and hybrid debt came out, third quarter interest expense should run about $7 million higher than fourth quarter. The full year effective tax rate for 2016 on comparable earnings is now expected to be in the range of 28%, taking into account, the earnings distribution of the combined company going forward.
Corporate undistributed is estimated to be in the range of $105 million for full year 2016, which includes second half incremental costs of approximately $30 million to support the integration from locations such as Milbank, Rexam's formal global headquarters location, which we will exit by December 2016. As we referenced in the debt reconciliation, are included in our earnings release, the funded status of acquired pensions was improved by the change of control payment made to the U.K. pension plan at the closing of the transaction. 
With the remainder of 2016, approximately $50 million of pension funding will occur in the U.S. plans. And given the size of the remaining cash-transaction-related payments to be made during the remainder of 2016, we do not anticipate a meaningful reduction in net debt by year-end. 
So now, where are we going? As you can view on the reconciliation backup slide provided on our website and based on current operating conditions and FX rates, our preliminary target for 2017 comparable operating earnings is a range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion, excluding the effect of approximately $140 million of intangible amortization. 
For 2017, we expect interest expense of approximately $280 million, a 28% effective tax rate, and full year weighted average diluted share count of approximately 177 million. Given that we are just 35 days post-close, our early estimate for full year 2017 free cash flow, after $500 million of CapEx, is that we will be in the range of $750 million to $850 million, excluding one-time items related to the transaction, which is a great step towards our goal of free cash flow being in excess of $1 billion by 2019.
And with that, I'll turn it back to you, John."

Our aerospace business reported second quarter results that were relatively flat with last year. However, I'm happy to report that our contracted backlog closed the quarter at over $1 billion, with approximately 70% under cost-plus approach and 30% more of a fixed price nature, which provides a good balance going forward. 
We are ramping up and staffing up for all of the new contracts which will benefit second half and future year's performance. We are excited about the prospects of this business, and politics aside, we have more opportunities for growth, assuming the government does not go into any prolonged continuing resolution. 
Now across the company, and as we look forward, as Scott mentioned, by year-end 2017, we currently believe we should achieve $150 million of synergies for the year, and grow our operating earnings even greater than that on the back of our prior capital growth projects, and show improvement in all of Ball's businesses. 
While recognizing it is early days in the integration processes, we have more visibilities into the opportunities we thought possible. And while no doubt there will be challenges, we still expect to generate in excess of $300 million of synergies by the end of 2019. 
And as Scott said, we are also tracking towards our goal to grow our comparable annualized free cash flow to in excess of about $1 billion. And when our leverage gets to the 3 to 3.5x debt to EBITDA range, we are poised execute a more robust share repurchase program. 
In summary, our company is taking a step change forward, as a result of this acquisition. And whether it be in the commercial arena, our cost-out efforts, our supply chain and footprint work, our innovation efforts, positioning the can as the most suitable package in the beverage world and/or any other area, we are going to take our responsibility as a leader seriously. And with our current aspiration of generating $2 billion of comparable EBITDA, and in excess of $1 billion of comparable free cash flow by 2019, we see a clear path to growing EVA dollars, which will allow us to double our long-term goal of 10% to 15% comparable diluted earnings per share growth over each of the next several years. 
And with that, Dmitra, we're ready for questions."

United States, actually, has had 2 quarters as an industry of positive volume growth. We've had a little bit more than that just because of our customer mix and some of the new Monterrey facility, which is great. The can continues to win in the United States. I'd say that, as we hear in the summer months, it's slowed up a little bit over the last month or so, but nothing appreciably. But if you assume flat -- relatively flat growth in the United States, that's probably a good parameter. Down in Brazil, it's been relatively flat, down a little bit. Ball's, again, because of our customer mix has been done fairly well, but we're expecting, the second half of this year and going into 2017 to be relatively flat. It could be down a little bit at the second half of this year, after the Olympics are finished up, only because the economy is challenged. Europe continues to be a growth area. It's up a couple of percent year-to-date, and we expect that. And then, when you look at Asia, you have to look at China, and as well as Southeast Asia. China continues to grow strong, but we actually have been declining, in part because we're trying to rationalize our business and not make these cans for practice. Southeast Asia continues to grow mid- to upper single-digits. And then, in some of the newer regions that we're getting our hands around, whether it's the Middle East, whether it's even Russia, I think Russia is doing regionally okay. The Middle East is a mixed bag. We could talk about what's going on in Turkey. We can talk about the challenges of Egypt is having with their currency. You can talk about some other places. But I think those fundamentals that I've just laid out, we don't expect appreciable differences.

There is a special incentive program that actually does go pretty deep in the organization, gets into the plant level. It's broad-based, distributed. The measurements are very similar to what we've done in the past, that is tried and true. It's based on EVA dollar generation and on free cash flow generation, relative to our expectations and what our Board signed up on the acquisition. And so that's a -- it's a 3.5-year program. And it's paid out in stock, which is another important component of that. The second one is the deposit-share program. It's a bit more limited for -- we have done a number of these programs, a number, 3 or 4 of these over the past 15 years or so. The concept is up to a certain amount by individual, that individual has to buy their own stock, and then would get a restricted stock that lapses over a period of time. In this case, I believe, it's 4 years, so as long as they hold onto the existing stock. So you have to put your own money in, and then you'll be matched up to a certain point.

In terms of what we're seeing and how we might do things similar or different from the old Rexam. One of the things, I'll point out, we are very excited about the engagement of the people, or the people that we acquired. I think this has reenergized everyone at our company. But also, our new employees that are coming in. And anyone who runs businesses know, that if you have the engagement of the people, that is a big chunk of it. So we're very, very excited. When you talk about the assets, you really have to go by region. And so I'll start in South America. They've got some great assets down there. They've got some great people down there. And we're very excited about that. In Europe, they've recently been doing some restructuring in Europe, which is actually helping them there. And I think the asset base there is very good. Obviously, we had to divest our -- a majority of our old asset base. But I think the -- on apples-to-apples, it's relatively comparable. In the United States, we think there's opportunity. I think the level of housekeeping, the level of safety, we're going to have to think about putting a little bit of capital, and I'm talking about $3 million to $5 million per plant, not wholesale capital, but to get it up to our standards from a quality perspective, from an efficiency perspective, from an out-purpose perspective. And then in many of the other regions that we talked about, many of those assets are relatively new. So while we're getting our hands around that, I think it really more has to do is -- with -- a question was asked earlier upon the risk adjusted return basis. Would we have done some the things that they had done? And it's -- let's look forward, not back, and we're going to manage these things as best we possibly can. On the CapEx, and then I'll turn it over to Scott to talk about corporate unallocated. Remember that it's very preliminary. And Scott said the $500 million is a placeholder. What I would tell you is, as we think about it, the CapEx really falls in the 3 or 4 different buckets. Number one, we have a level of maintenance CapEx. We always talked about, Ball's was a $150 million to $175 million. You ought to think probably adding about $50 million to $75 million on to that for the totality of what we acquired. But then the additional capital is, like we always do, and it's a tried and true at Ball, it's a bottoms-up approach, and it falls into 3 of our drive for 10 buckets. It's about, number one, maxing the value, existing value of what we do. I talked a little bit about some of the opportunities we have in North America. It also talks about geographic growth, where, as you know, we're just -- in the last 12 months, we've started up in Mexico and we started up in Myanmar. There's probably some opportunities there, but we're going to be very judicious about that. And then last, but not least, in terms of new customers and new products, our specialty continues to grow very strongly. We've been successful in converting our facilities into specialty containers. Rexam hasn't done nearly as much. And so there's some probably opportunities along that path. But that's going to be customer and specific opportunity by opportunity. So that's a holistic context, the way to think about our capital, as at least the way we are thinking about our capital going forward. And maybe I'll turn it over to Scott now."

But if you go back and look at our CapEx, over the last couple of years, we probably spent around $300 million, $350 million plus or minus on some of these projects. And if you say that we're an EVA-based company and you've got to earn 9% after tax, you can quickly do the math on that, and see it's approaching $75 million or so.

And I give our folks a tremendous amount of credit because without that, it would be a very, very challenging situation in China. The bigger question is, as you look forward, what does that mean? Because you can't save your way to prosperity. We think the industry needs a level of consolidation in the China market. There’s too many independent players out there. The strategic question is how that occurs and when it occurs. And I can't go into detail, but we are taking it very seriously.

We are 70%, 80% of the way through completing a project that is going to have significant cost reduction in that business to make us more competitive.

Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings as well as company news releases.

Information regarding descriptions are in new segment reporting and the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found in the note section of today's earnings release, which includes a simplified table format summarizing business consolidation and other activities as well as reconciliation of comparable operating earnings and diluted earnings per share calculations.
Joining me on the call today is Scott Morrison, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. And if we sound a bit tired, we are. The Chicago Cubs won the World Series, baby. Dreams do come true.
I'll provide a brief overview of the company's performance. Scott will discuss financial and global packaging metrics, and then I'll finish up with comments on our aerospace business and the outlook for the future.
We are pleased with the new combined business as well as our existing businesses are right on track versus our expectations. And the anticipated earnings momentum has continued to materialize, particularly in beverage and aerospace.
Upon the close of the acquisition, we discussed that the second half of 2016 might be a bit choppy from an earnings and cash flow perspective due to one-time integration costs, but that we felt confident as we went into 2017 that we'd be able to generate comparable earnings and cash flow that we discussed for both 2017 and beyond. This is exactly how it is playing out, and we continue to expect to achieve all of the 2017 to 2019 financial metrics and synergy goals we laid out on our prior earnings call.
During our initial review of the new locations, we welcomed our new team members into the Ball culture and experienced a smooth integration to date. Where we have recognized the need for minor changes from a personnel or policy perspective, actions have been taken or are well underway. In the coming months, we will focus on securing the appropriate value for our products while fighting for our proportionate share of the volume. And at the same time, we'll be chasing the value capture opportunities in sourcing, freight, logistics and footprint optimization as well as ongoing cost saving initiatives like the closure of the London and Charlotte offices. Certain work from these locations has already begun to migrate to other Ball locations, and Ball will exit the Millbank office by December 2016 and close the Charlotte office in the first half of 2017. We thank the Millbank and Charlotte teams for their support during this integration. Future announcements regarding other changes will be made when decisions are finalized.
In addition to the complex integration and separation work, during the third quarter, we continued wrapping up line speeds at our new Monterrey, Mexico beverage facility. We shipped and invoiced saleable cans from our new Myanmar facility late in the third quarter. We continued the previously initiated European beverage cost-out initiatives, including the closure of the Berlin, Germany beverage can facility that was announced in December 2015. We achieved solid operational performance in our food and aerosol business despite depressed U.S. food can demand in the period. And we further grew our aerospace contracted backlog to a record $1.4 billion. It was an incredibly busy and rewarding quarter.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Mr. Morrison. Scott?"
170352,403008916,1072032,"Ball Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Ball Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John.Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share for the third quarter 2016 were $0.96 versus last year's $1.10 on a higher share count and a higher year-over-year effective tax rate.Third quarter comparable diluted earnings per share reflect",1460,"Thanks, John.
Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share for the third quarter 2016 were $0.96 versus last year's $1.10 on a higher share count and a higher year-over-year effective tax rate.
Third quarter comparable diluted earnings per share reflect year-over-year improvement largely due to the beverage can acquisition, solid global beverage can demand and improved aerospace performance, offset by higher corporate costs related to truing up our employee compensation accruals, the extra expense for stock plans due to the run up of our share price as well as some pension expense for inactives not tied to a continuing business segment, higher interest expense related to the timing of the Rexam debt pay off, a higher share count and tax rate.
Our GAAP results in the first 9 months were impacted by transaction-related earnings, hedging, purchase accounting and other customary closing adjustments. Details are provided in the Note 2 of today's earnings release, and additional information will also be provided in our 10-Q, which will be filed next week.
Our beverage packaging North and Central America segment, which comprises 17 legacy Ball facilities plus the 9 acquired facilities, including joint ventures, had comparable operating earnings for third quarter 2016 that were up year-over-year due to the contribution of the recently acquired plants in the U.S. and Mexico and continued specialty can growth. Industry demand across North America grew 1.5% in the third quarter. And on a comparable basis, Ball was in line with the industry during the quarter.
Our new Monterrey, Mexico facility continues to make productions strides, and Mexican domestic and export demand remained strong. Of note, the recently acquired JVs in Guatemala and Panama as well as our legacy Rocky Mountain metal container JV, are not consolidated and therefore, are included in equity earnings of affiliates.
Our beverage packaging South America segment, which consisted of the 12 acquired facilities plus 2 legacy Ball facilities, recorded a solid third quarter as can demand in Brazil gained traction in the quarter, in part because of the seasonal summer build. Brazilian market demand as well as our volume in the quarter was relatively flat and down 2% year-to-date. Both Brazilian and Argentine can demand has been impacted by the inflationary environment in those countries. The team in South America is managing the business well, given the current economic and supply/demand conditions in the region.
In the beverage packaging Europe segment results, which include Russia, were up nicely in the quarter due largely to the acquisition and strong can demand in Russia during September. Industry supply/demand remains tight, and specialty demand remains favorable, with a bias towards continued shift into specialty.
As we mentioned in today's release, Ball chose to retain certain volumes in Spain, which will be supplied from a newly constructed plant near Madrid. This investment is supported by a long-term customer contract that was known to all parties prior to the divestment occurring, and the plants will help to provide supply to a region that is experiencing sustainable growth.
Beginning in the third quarter, our new segment reporting incorporates the operating performance of Ball's legacy China Asia business and the acquired EMEA business into other, which also includes the legacy corporate undistributed costs. For clarity and going forward, we will include a footnote in Note 2 of our earnings release financials referencing the amount of corporate undistributed costs included in other.
Of note, the UAC JV 51% investment is consolidated and is also reflected in the other segment, and the 49% outflow is reflected in noncontrolling interest. While I have the opportunity, our team in China is doing everything they can, given the challenges they are faced with. They have met their cost-out goals, and the team in EMEA is fititng right in at Ball. The markets are dynamic like the currency situation in Egypt, and we have great teams in both regions managing the businesses appropriately.
Moving to aerosol. Comparable segment earnings were flat year-over-year due to lower food can volumes, offset by continued growth in global aerosol. Initiatives to further improve production efficiencies are on track and start [ph] to benefit 2017 performance.
In summary, our global packaging businesses posted results that were right on top of our expectations, and the teams continue to be extremely focused on integrating the new assets, achieving their synergy goals and driving EVA dollars from the recent capital and efficiency projects. Thank you again to our global packaging team members as well as the corporate support teams. Their collaboration and dedication is appreciated.
As I mentioned in the second quarter call, we will identify all one-time items impacting free cash flow and operating earnings so that the underlying strength of the business is clear. You will notice that our third quarter net debt, as expected, is about $400 million higher than the pro forma $7 billion net debt reflected in our second quarter earnings release.
During the third quarter, we paid out $110 million in severance and incentives to divested and separated employees; $90 million to settle Rexam's derivatives; $65 million in adviser, attorney and banker fees; $50 million in tax payments; a July 1 $50 million bond interest payment; and we spent $125 million in CapEx. Obviously, there were offsets like third quarter EBITDA and the French sale proceeds. We are on target to fill a lot of cash in the fourth quarter, which is typical. We obviously had a working capital build from the acquired locations, and as we said before, it will take time to address how Rexam manages its balance sheet versus how we will manage ours. Regardless, we still see -- we still target year-end net debt in the range of $7 billion at current FX rates.
As we think about the remainder of 2016, here are some key metrics. We expect full year 2016 comparable operating earnings in the range of $1 billion, and to be clear, our comparable earnings going forward will exclude the amortization associated with acquired customer intangibles, which should be roughly $33 million in the fourth quarter.
Since the $83 million inventory step-up was recognized in the third quarter, I wouldn't expect any additional inventory step-up impact in the fourth quarter. The full year weighted average diluted shares outstanding for 2016 will be in the range of 161 million shares, which reflects the half-year impact of the 32 million shares issued for the acquisition.
For Q4 2016 and full year 2017, weighted average diluted shares outstanding will be roughly 178 million, absent the impact of any share repurchases. Full year 2016 interest expense will be in the range of $230 million. Given the negative carry associated with the timing of when the acquired credit agreement, private placement and hybrid debt came out, third quarter interest ran about $8 million higher than it will in the fourth quarter. The full year effective tax rate for 2016 on comparable earnings is expected to be in the range of 28%.
Corporate undistributed is now to be -- expected to be in the range of $115 million for full year 2016 versus the $105 million we discussed in the second quarter call. The $115 million now includes: costs to support the integration from locations such as Millbank and Charlotte as well as a true-up for our employee compensation plan accruals that we'll pay out to current Ball employees in early 2017; and the impact of known pension expense for inactives in the U.S. and abroad, which will migrate to corporate undistributed in the near term. To be clear, these are not unanticipated costs. It's more about where we have now determined the cost will be reflected from a reporting perspective.
Before I turn it back to John, we have received a few questions to provide a detailed bridge for 2016 to 2017. And we ask that you recall what we said in our second quarter call: we will not be posting a slide every quarter. For now, we just remind you that in 2017, we still expect to be in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion of comparable operating earnings due to value capture savings in the areas of sourcing, manufacturing, logistics and other areas like footprint: 1 billion more of units through our new Monterrey plant, cost-out benefits from the FNA metals service center transition as well as additional global aerosol and specialty beverage can growth. Improvement in aerospace in the full year impacted the acquisition.
And by 2019, we aspire to be generating $2 billion of comparable EBITDA and generating in excess of $1 billion of comparable free cash flow. Our December investor field trip will also provide another chance to add to our messaging and engage in Q&A about our progress.
And with that, I'll turn it back to you, John."

Our aerospace business reported improved third quarter results driven by solid contract performance. Congratulations to the entire aerospace team. Their hard work paid off.
Our contracted backlog closed the quarter at a record $1.4 billion, which is 129% increase since the beginning of 2016. As I mentioned last quarter, we're ramping up and staffing up for these new contracts which will benefit the remainder of 2016 and more importantly, beyond.
Now across the company and as we look forward. We are on track to achieve the numbers that Scott just laid out. Every day, we gain even more visibility into the opportunities before us. And while there are always challenges, the team is up for proactively managing these.
In summary, I'm proud of what our team has accomplished so far. Everyone is taking to heart what it means to behave as a true owner. We all know there is much work still to be done, and we are focused on our balance sheet, cost out, footprint, supply/demand balance, supply chain and innovation. Advocating for the beverage can versus other substrates and improving the value generated for the products we sell are things we embrace as an industry leader.
As I mentioned in my introduction, our financial goals and aspirations for 2017 and beyond remain the same. And when our leverage gets to the range of 3x to 3.5x, we will return value to our fellow shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends.
And with that, James, we're ready for questions."

Should 1718 be $900 million revenue kind of numbers. Or what's in the path there?"

I mentioned the last quarter that we had a lot on our plates in terms of 1 not booked and the only -- of the big a price of that happen in the third quarter for us is given of that the governments pushed out the continuing resolution until after the election, we're pleasantly surprise. So some of the wins turned into funded wins, which went into our backlog. We're still chasing of right of things in the aerospace business and even getting back to the capital. I think over the next couple of years, it's not big dollars. But we're going to be investing in that in terms of new chambers, in terms of expanding our manufacturing capability and capacity and building out with some of our existing facilities because our backlog is the highest we've ever had and we're ramping up big-time in terms of hiring people, getting people going. It as I mentioned, think you're going to start to cede rollout as early as in the fourth quarter 2016 and then as we go into 2017 and beyond, we feel good about that business.

And it's going to be ramped up as we go into really get going. Is a difficult question to answer because as we -- likely and every time we have some contracts that are coming off, I will point out a couple of things though. The -- the majority of the business we've won is a cost plus, costs plus fixed fee business. And that usually, we've talked about this in the past. When you have a fixed price contract, usually, the margins, when you start off, are a bit lower. And then if you execute successfully, your margins will pick up as you deliver those. And a cost-plus environment, is a little bit more stable the margin as across. So I don't expect our margin profile having said that, to change meaningfully as we look forward. I think it's as much about growing the revenues go and some of these programs we won our multiyear program. Some of them are single year. It's a big mix. But the vast majority of this is cost-plus, which is actually good from an overall profitability perspective."

The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings as well as company news releases. If you don't already have our third quarter earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com.
Information regarding descriptions are in new segment reporting and the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found in the note section of today's earnings release, which includes a simplified table format summarizing business consolidation and other activities as well as reconciliation of comparable operating earnings and diluted earnings per share calculations.
Joining me on the call today is Scott Morrison, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. And if we sound a bit tired, we are. The Chicago Cubs won the World Series, baby. Dreams do come true.
I'll provide a brief overview of the company's performance. Scott will discuss financial and global packaging metrics, and then I'll finish up with comments on our aerospace business and the outlook for the future.
We are pleased with the new combined business as well as our existing businesses are right on track versus our expectations. And the anticipated earnings momentum has continued to materialize, particularly in beverage and aerospace.
Upon the close of the acquisition, we discussed that the second half of 2016 might be a bit choppy from an earnings and cash flow perspective due to one-time integration costs, but that we felt confident as we went into 2017 that we'd be able to generate comparable earnings and cash flow that we discussed for both 2017 and beyond. This is exactly how it is playing out, and we continue to expect to achieve all of the 2017 to 2019 financial metrics and synergy goals we laid out on our prior earnings call.
During our initial review of the new locations, we welcomed our new team members into the Ball culture and experienced a smooth integration to date. Where we have recognized the need for minor changes from a personnel or policy perspective, actions have been taken or are well underway. In the coming months, we will focus on securing the appropriate value for our products while fighting for our proportionate share of the volume. And at the same time, we'll be chasing the value capture opportunities in sourcing, freight, logistics and footprint optimization as well as ongoing cost saving initiatives like the closure of the London and Charlotte offices. Certain work from these locations has already begun to migrate to other Ball locations, and Ball will exit the Millbank office by December 2016 and close the Charlotte office in the first half of 2017. We thank the Millbank and Charlotte teams for their support during this integration. Future announcements regarding other changes will be made when decisions are finalized.
In addition to the complex integration and separation work, during the third quarter, we continued wrapping up line speeds at our new Monterrey, Mexico beverage facility. We shipped and invoiced saleable cans from our new Myanmar facility late in the third quarter. We continued the previously initiated European beverage cost-out initiatives, including the closure of the Berlin, Germany beverage can facility that was announced in December 2015. We achieved solid operational performance in our food and aerosol business despite depressed U.S. food can demand in the period. And we further grew our aerospace contracted backlog to a record $1.4 billion. It was an incredibly busy and rewarding quarter.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Mr. Morrison. Scott?"
170352,403008916,1072511,"Ball Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Ball Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John.Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share for the third quarter 2016 were $0.96 versus last year's $1.10 on a higher share count and a higher year-over-year effective tax rate.Third quarter comparable diluted earnings per share reflect",1460,"Thanks, John.
Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share for the third quarter 2016 were $0.96 versus last year's $1.10 on a higher share count and a higher year-over-year effective tax rate.
Third quarter comparable diluted earnings per share reflect year-over-year improvement largely due to the beverage can acquisition, solid global beverage can demand and improved aerospace performance, offset by higher corporate costs related to truing up our employee compensation accruals, the extra expense for stock plans due to the run up of our share price as well as some pension expense for inactives not tied to a continuing business segment, higher interest expense related to the timing of the Rexam debt pay off, a higher share count and tax rate.
Our GAAP results in the first 9 months were impacted by transaction-related earnings, hedging, purchase accounting and other customary closing adjustments. Details are provided in the Note 2 of today's earnings release, and additional information will also be provided in our 10-Q, which will be filed next week.
Our beverage packaging North and Central America segment, which comprises 17 legacy Ball facilities plus the 9 acquired facilities, including joint ventures, had comparable operating earnings for third quarter 2016 that were up year-over-year due to the contribution of the recently acquired plants in the U.S. and Mexico and continued specialty can growth. Industry demand across North America grew 1.5% in the third quarter. And on a comparable basis, Ball was in line with the industry during the quarter.
Our new Monterrey, Mexico facility continues to make productions strides, and Mexican domestic and export demand remained strong. Of note, the recently acquired JVs in Guatemala and Panama as well as our legacy Rocky Mountain metal container JV, are not consolidated and therefore, are included in equity earnings of affiliates.
Our beverage packaging South America segment, which consisted of the 12 acquired facilities plus 2 legacy Ball facilities, recorded a solid third quarter as can demand in Brazil gained traction in the quarter, in part because of the seasonal summer build. Brazilian market demand as well as our volume in the quarter was relatively flat and down 2% year-to-date. Both Brazilian and Argentine can demand has been impacted by the inflationary environment in those countries. The team in South America is managing the business well, given the current economic and supply/demand conditions in the region.
In the beverage packaging Europe segment results, which include Russia, were up nicely in the quarter due largely to the acquisition and strong can demand in Russia during September. Industry supply/demand remains tight, and specialty demand remains favorable, with a bias towards continued shift into specialty.
As we mentioned in today's release, Ball chose to retain certain volumes in Spain, which will be supplied from a newly constructed plant near Madrid. This investment is supported by a long-term customer contract that was known to all parties prior to the divestment occurring, and the plants will help to provide supply to a region that is experiencing sustainable growth.
Beginning in the third quarter, our new segment reporting incorporates the operating performance of Ball's legacy China Asia business and the acquired EMEA business into other, which also includes the legacy corporate undistributed costs. For clarity and going forward, we will include a footnote in Note 2 of our earnings release financials referencing the amount of corporate undistributed costs included in other.
Of note, the UAC JV 51% investment is consolidated and is also reflected in the other segment, and the 49% outflow is reflected in noncontrolling interest. While I have the opportunity, our team in China is doing everything they can, given the challenges they are faced with. They have met their cost-out goals, and the team in EMEA is fitting right in at Ball. The markets are dynamic like the currency situation in Egypt, and we have great teams in both regions managing the businesses appropriately.
Moving to aerosol. Comparable segment earnings were flat year-over-year due to lower food can volumes, offset by continued growth in global aerosol. Initiatives to further improve production efficiencies are on track and start [ph] to benefit 2017 performance.
In summary, our global packaging businesses posted results that were right on top of our expectations, and the teams continue to be extremely focused on integrating the new assets, achieving their synergy goals and driving EVA dollars from the recent capital and efficiency projects. Thank you again to our global packaging team members as well as the corporate support teams. Their collaboration and dedication is appreciated.
As I mentioned in the second quarter call, we will identify all one-time items impacting free cash flow and operating earnings so that the underlying strength of the business is clear. You will notice that our third quarter net debt, as expected, is about $400 million higher than the pro forma $7 billion net debt reflected in our second quarter earnings release.
During the third quarter, we paid out $110 million in severance and incentives to divested and separated employees; $90 million to settle Rexam's derivatives; $65 million in adviser, attorney and banker fees; $50 million in tax payments; a July 1 $50 million bond interest payment; and we spent $125 million in CapEx. Obviously, there were offsets like third quarter EBITDA and the French sale proceeds. We are on target to fill a lot of cash in the fourth quarter, which is typical. We obviously had a working capital build from the acquired locations, and as we said before, it will take time to address how Rexam manages its balance sheet versus how we will manage ours. Regardless, we still see -- we still target year-end net debt in the range of $7 billion at current FX rates.
As we think about the remainder of 2016, here are some key metrics. We expect full year 2016 comparable operating earnings in the range of $1 billion, and to be clear, our comparable earnings going forward will exclude the amortization associated with acquired customer intangibles, which should be roughly $33 million in the fourth quarter.
Since the $83 million inventory step-up was recognized in the third quarter, I wouldn't expect any additional inventory step-up impact in the fourth quarter. The full year weighted average diluted shares outstanding for 2016 will be in the range of 161 million shares, which reflects the half-year impact of the 32 million shares issued for the acquisition.
For Q4 2016 and full year 2017, weighted average diluted shares outstanding will be roughly 178 million, absent the impact of any share repurchases. Full year 2016 interest expense will be in the range of $230 million. Given the negative carry associated with the timing of when the acquired credit agreement, private placement and hybrid debt came out, third quarter interest ran about $8 million higher than it will in the fourth quarter. The full year effective tax rate for 2016 on comparable earnings is expected to be in the range of 28%.
Corporate undistributed is now to be -- expected to be in the range of $115 million for full year 2016 versus the $105 million we discussed in the second quarter call. The $115 million now includes: costs to support the integration from locations such as Millbank and Charlotte as well as a true-up for our employee compensation plan accruals that we'll pay out to current Ball employees in early 2017; and the impact of known pension expense for inactives in the U.S. and abroad, which will migrate to corporate undistributed in the near term. To be clear, these are not unanticipated costs. It's more about where we have now determined the cost will be reflected from a reporting perspective.
Before I turn it back to John, we have received a few questions to provide a detailed bridge for 2016 to 2017. And we ask that you recall what we said in our second quarter call: we will not be posting a slide every quarter. For now, we just remind you that in 2017, we still expect to be in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion of comparable operating earnings due to value capture savings in the areas of sourcing, manufacturing, logistics and other areas like footprint: 1 billion more of units through our new Monterrey plant, cost-out benefits from the FNA metals service center transition as well as additional global aerosol and specialty beverage can growth. Improvement in aerospace in the full year impacted the acquisition.
And by 2019, we aspire to be generating $2 billion of comparable EBITDA and generating in excess of $1 billion of comparable free cash flow. Our December investor field trip will also provide another chance to add to our messaging and engage in Q&A about our progress.
And with that, I'll turn it back to you, John."

Our aerospace business reported improved third quarter results driven by solid contract performance. Congratulations to the entire aerospace team. Their hard work paid off.
Our contracted backlog closed the quarter at a record $1.4 billion, which is 129% increase since the beginning of 2016. As I mentioned last quarter, we're ramping up and staffing up for these new contracts which will benefit the remainder of 2016 and more importantly, beyond.
Now across the company and as we look forward. We are on track to achieve the numbers that Scott just laid out. Every day, we gain even more visibility into the opportunities before us. And while there are always challenges, the team is up for proactively managing these.
In summary, I'm proud of what our team has accomplished so far. Everyone is taking to heart what it means to behave as a true owner. We all know there is much work still to be done, and we are focused on our balance sheet, cost out, footprint, supply/demand balance, supply chain and innovation. Advocating for the beverage can versus other substrates and improving the value generated for the products we sell are things we embrace as an industry leader.
As I mentioned in my introduction, our financial goals and aspirations for 2017 and beyond remain the same. And when our leverage gets to the range of 3x to 3.5x, we will return value to our fellow shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends.
And with that, James, we're ready for questions."

We're still chasing a variety of things in the aerospace business and even getting back to the capital. I think over the next couple of years, it's not big dollars. But we're going to be investing in that in terms of new chambers, in terms of expanding our manufacturing capability and capacity and building out some of our existing facilities because our backlog is the highest we've ever had, and we were ramping up big-time in terms of hiring people, getting people going and as I mentioned, I think you're going to start see it rollout as early as the fourth quarter of 2016 and then as we go to 2017 and beyond, we feel good about that business.

And that usually, from an -- we've talked about this in the past. When you have a fixed price contract, usually the margins, when you start off, are a bit lower. And then if you execute successfully, your margins will pick up as you deliver those. In a cost-plus environment, it's a little bit more stable, the margin is a cross. So I don't expect our margin profile, having said that, to change meaningfully as we look forward.

The information provided during this call will contain forward-looking statements. Actual results or outcomes may differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied. Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings as well as company news releases. If you don't already have our third quarter earnings release, it's available on our website at ball.com.
Information regarding descriptions are in new segment reporting and the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found in the note section of today's earnings release, which includes a simplified table format summarizing business consolidation and other activities as well as a reconciliation of comparable operating earnings and diluted earnings per share calculations.
Joining me on the call today is Scott Morrison, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. And if we sound a bit tired, we are. The Chicago Cubs won the World Series, baby. Dreams do come true.
I'll provide a brief overview of the company's performance. Scott will discuss financial and global packaging metrics, and then I'll finish up with comments on our aerospace business and the outlook for the future.
We are pleased with the new combined business as well as our existing businesses are right on track versus our expectations. And the anticipated earnings momentum has continued to materialize, particularly in beverage and aerospace.
Upon the close of the acquisition, we discussed that the second half of 2016 might be a bit choppy from an earnings and cash flow perspective due to one-time integration costs, but that we felt confident as we went into 2017 that we'd be able to generate comparable earnings and cash flow that we discussed for both 2017 and beyond. This is exactly how it is playing out, and we continue to expect to achieve all of the 2017 to 2019 financial metrics and synergy goals we laid out on our prior earnings call.
During our initial review of the new locations, we welcomed our new team members into the Ball culture and experienced a smooth integration to date. Where we have recognized the need for minor changes from a personnel or policy perspective, actions have been taken or are well underway. In the coming months, we will focus on securing the appropriate value for our products while fighting for our proportionate share of the volume. And at the same time, we'll be chasing the value capture opportunities in sourcing, freight, logistics and footprint optimization as well as ongoing cost saving initiatives like the closure of the London and Charlotte offices. Certain work from these locations has already begun to migrate to other Ball locations, and Ball will exit the Millbank office by December 2016 and close the Charlotte office in the first half of 2017. We thank the Millbank and Charlotte teams for their support during this integration. Future announcements regarding other changes will be made when decisions are finalized.
In addition to the complex integration and separation work, during the third quarter, we continued wrapping up line speeds at our new Monterrey, Mexico beverage facility. We shipped and invoiced saleable cans from our new Myanmar facility late in the third quarter. We continued the previously initiated European beverage cost-out initiatives, including the closure of the Berlin, Germany beverage can facility that was announced in December 2015. We achieved solid operational performance in our food and aerosol business despite depressed U.S. food can demand in the period. And we further grew our aerospace contracted backlog to a record $1.4 billion. It was an incredibly busy and rewarding quarter.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Mr. Morrison. Scott?"
170352,403008916,1072733,"Ball Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Ball Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John.Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share for the third quarter 2016 were $0.96 versus last year's $1.10 on a higher share count and a higher year-over-year effective tax rate.Third quarter comparable diluted earnings per share reflect",1460,"Thanks, John.
Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share for the third quarter 2016 were $0.96 versus last year's $1.10 on a higher share count and a higher year-over-year effective tax rate.
Third quarter comparable diluted earnings per share reflect year-over-year improvement largely due to the beverage can acquisition, solid global beverage can demand and improved aerospace performance, offset by higher corporate costs related to truing up our employee compensation accruals, the extra expense for stock plans due to the run up of our share price as well as some pension expense for inactives not tied to a continuing business segment, higher interest expense related to the timing of the Rexam debt pay off, a higher share count and tax rate.
Our GAAP results in the first 9 months were impacted by transaction-related earnings, hedging, purchase accounting and other customary closing adjustments. Details are provided in the Note 2 of today's earnings release, and additional information will also be provided in our 10-Q, which will be filed next week.
Our beverage packaging North and Central America segment, which comprises 17 legacy Ball facilities plus the 9 acquired facilities, including joint ventures, had comparable operating earnings for third quarter 2016 that were up year-over-year due to the contribution of the recently acquired plants in the U.S. and Mexico and continued specialty can growth. Industry demand across North America grew 1.5% in the third quarter. And on a comparable basis, Ball was in line with the industry during the quarter.
Our new Monterrey, Mexico facility continues to make productions strides, and Mexican domestic and export demand remained strong. Of note, the recently acquired JVs in Guatemala and Panama as well as our legacy Rocky Mountain metal container JV, are not consolidated and therefore, are included in equity earnings of affiliates.
Our beverage packaging South America segment, which consists of the 12 acquired facilities plus 2 legacy Ball facilities, recorded a solid third quarter as can demand in Brazil gained traction in the quarter, in part because of the seasonal summer build. Brazilian market demand as well as our volume in the quarter was relatively flat and down 2% year-to-date. Both Brazilian and Argentine can demand has been impacted by the inflationary environment in those countries. The team in South America is managing the business well, given the current economic and supply/demand conditions in the region.
In the beverage packaging Europe segment results, which include Russia, were up nicely in the quarter due largely to the acquisition and strong can demand in Russia during September. Industry supply/demand remains tight, and specialty demand remains favorable, with a bias towards continued shift into specialty.
As we mentioned in today's release, Ball chose to retain certain volumes in Spain, which will be supplied from a newly constructed plant near Madrid. This investment is supported by a long-term customer contract that was known to all parties prior to the divestment occurring, and the plant will help to provide supply to a region that is experiencing sustainable growth.
Beginning in the third quarter, our new segment reporting incorporates the operating performance of Ball's legacy China Asia business and the acquired EMEA business into other, which also includes the legacy corporate undistributed costs. For clarity and going forward, we will include a footnote in Note 2 of our earnings release financials referencing the amount of corporate undistributed costs included in other.
Of note, the UAC JV 51% investment is consolidated and is also reflected in the other segment, and the 49% outflow is reflected in noncontrolling interest. While I have the opportunity, our team in China is doing everything they can, given the challenges they are faced with. They have met their cost-out goals, and the team in EMEA is fitting right in at Ball. The markets are dynamic like the currency situation in Egypt, and we have great teams in both regions managing the businesses appropriately.
Moving to aerosol. Comparable segment earnings were flat year-over-year due to lower food can volumes, offset by continued growth in global aerosol. Initiatives to further improve production efficiencies are on track and start [ph] to benefit 2017 performance.
In summary, our global packaging businesses posted results that were right on top of our expectations, and the teams continue to be extremely focused on integrating the new assets, achieving their synergy goals and driving EVA dollars from the recent capital and efficiency projects. Thank you again to our global packaging team members as well as the corporate support teams. Their collaboration and dedication is appreciated.
As I mentioned in the second quarter call, we will identify all one-time items impacting free cash flow and operating earnings so that the underlying strength of the business is clear. You will notice that our third quarter net debt, as expected, is about $400 million higher than the pro forma $7 billion net debt reflected in our second quarter earnings release.
During the third quarter, we paid out $110 million in severance and incentives to divested and separated employees; $90 million to settle Rexam's derivatives; $65 million in adviser, attorney and banker fees; $50 million in tax payments; a July 1 $50 million bond interest payment; and we spent $125 million in CapEx. Obviously, there were offsets like third quarter EBITDA and the French sale proceeds. We are on target to flow a lot of cash in the fourth quarter, which is typical. We obviously had a working capital build from the acquired locations, and as we said before, it will take time to address how Rexam manages its balance sheet versus how we will manage ours. Regardless, we still see -- we still target year-end net debt in the range of $7 billion at current FX rates.
As we think about the remainder of 2016, here are some key metrics. We expect full year 2016 comparable operating earnings in the range of $1 billion, and to be clear, our comparable earnings going forward will exclude the amortization associated with acquired customer intangibles, which should be roughly $33 million in the fourth quarter.
Since the $83 million inventory step-up was recognized in the third quarter, I wouldn't expect any additional inventory step-up impact in the fourth quarter. The full year weighted average diluted shares outstanding for 2016 will be in the range of 161 million shares, which reflects the half-year impact of the 32 million shares issued for the acquisition.
For Q4 2016 and full year 2017, weighted average diluted shares outstanding will be roughly 178 million, absent the impact of any share repurchases. Full year 2016 interest expense will be in the range of $230 million. Given the negative carry associated with the timing of when the acquired credit agreement, private placement and hybrid debt came out, third quarter interest ran about $8 million higher than it will in the fourth quarter. The full year effective tax rate for 2016 on comparable earnings is expected to be in the range of 28%.
Corporate undistributed is now to be -- expected to be in the range of $115 million for full year 2016 versus the $105 million we discussed in the second quarter call. The $115 million now includes: costs to support the integration from locations such as Millbank and Charlotte as well as a true-up for our employee compensation plan accruals that we'll pay out to current Ball employees in early 2017; and the impact of known pension expense for inactives in the U.S. and abroad, which will migrate to corporate undistributed in the near term. To be clear, these are not unanticipated costs. It's more about where we have now determined the cost will be reflected from a reporting perspective.
Before I turn it back to John, we have received a few questions to provide a detailed bridge for 2016 to 2017. And we ask that you recall what we said in our second quarter call: we will not be posting a slide every quarter. For now, we just remind you that in 2017, we still expect to be in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion of comparable operating earnings due to value capture savings in the areas of sourcing, manufacturing, logistics and other areas like footprint: 1 billion more of units through our new Monterrey plant, cost-out benefits from the FNA metals service center transition as well as additional global aerosol and specialty beverage can growth. Improvement in aerospace and the full year impacted the acquisition.
And by 2019, we aspire to be generating $2 billion of comparable EBITDA and generating in excess of $1 billion of comparable free cash flow. Our December investor field trip will also provide another chance to add to our messaging and engage in Q&A about our progress.
And with that, I'll turn it back to you, John."

Our aerospace business reported improved third quarter results driven by solid contract performance. Congratulations to the entire aerospace team. Their hard work paid off.
Our contracted backlog closed the quarter at a record $1.4 billion, which is 129% increase since the beginning of 2016. As I mentioned last quarter, we're ramping up and staffing up for these new contracts which will benefit the remainder of 2016 and more importantly, beyond.
Now across the company and as we look forward. We are on track to achieve the numbers that Scott just laid out. Every day, we gain even more visibility into the opportunities before us. And while there are always challenges, the team is up for proactively managing these.
In summary, I'm proud of what our team has accomplished so far. Everyone is taking to heart what it means to behave as a true owner. We all know there is much work still to be done, and we are focused on our balance sheet, cost out, footprint, supply/demand balance, supply chain and innovation. Advocating for the beverage can versus other substrates and improving the value generated for the products we sell are things we embrace as an industry leader.
As I mentioned in my introduction, our financial goals and aspirations for 2017 and beyond remain the same. And when our leverage gets to the range of 3x to 3.5x, we will return value to our fellow shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends.
And with that, James, we're ready for questions."

Some factors that could cause the results or outcomes to differ are in the company's latest 10-K and in other company SEC filings as well as company news releases.

Information regarding descriptions are in new segment reporting and the use of non-GAAP financial measures may also be found in the note section of today's earnings release, which includes a simplified table format summarizing business consolidation and other activities as well as a reconciliation of comparable operating earnings and diluted earnings per share calculations.
Joining me on the call today is Scott Morrison, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. And if we sound a bit tired, we are. The Chicago Cubs won the World Series, baby. Dreams do come true.
I'll provide a brief overview of the company's performance. Scott will discuss financial and global packaging metrics, and then I'll finish up with comments on our aerospace business and the outlook for the future.
We are pleased with the new combined business as well as our existing businesses are right on track versus our expectations. And the anticipated earnings momentum has continued to materialize, particularly in beverage and aerospace.
Upon the close of the acquisition, we discussed that the second half of 2016 might be a bit choppy from an earnings and cash flow perspective due to one-time integration costs, but that we felt confident as we went into 2017 that we'd be able to generate comparable earnings and cash flow that we discussed for both 2017 and beyond. This is exactly how it is playing out, and we continue to expect to achieve all of the 2017 to 2019 financial metrics and synergy goals we laid out on our prior earnings call.
During our initial review of the new locations, we welcomed our new team members into the Ball culture and experienced a smooth integration to date. Where we have recognized the need for minor changes from a personnel or policy perspective, actions have been taken or are well underway. In the coming months, we will focus on securing the appropriate value for our products while fighting for our proportionate share of the volume. And at the same time, we'll be chasing the value capture opportunities in sourcing, freight, logistics and footprint optimization as well as ongoing cost saving initiatives like the closure of the London and Charlotte offices. Certain work from these locations has already begun to migrate to other Ball locations, and Ball will exit the Millbank office by December 2016 and close the Charlotte office in the first half of 2017. We thank the Millbank and Charlotte teams for their support during this integration. Future announcements regarding other changes will be made when decisions are finalized.
In addition to the complex integration and separation work, during the third quarter, we continued wrapping up line speeds at our new Monterrey, Mexico beverage facility. We shipped and invoiced saleable cans from our new Myanmar facility late in the third quarter. We continued the previously initiated European beverage cost-out initiatives, including the closure of the Berlin, Germany beverage can facility that was announced in December 2015. We achieved solid operational performance in our food and aerosol business despite depressed U.S. food can demand in the period. And we further grew our aerospace contracted backlog to a record $1.4 billion. It was an incredibly busy and rewarding quarter.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Mr. Morrison. Scott?"
170352,403008916,1074001,"Ball Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 03, 2016",2016-11-03,"Earnings Calls","Ball Corporation","Executives","Thanks, John.Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share for the third quarter 2016 were $0.96 versus last year's $1.10 on a higher share count and a higher year-over-year effective tax rate.Third quarter comparable diluted earnings per share reflect",1460,"Thanks, John.
Ball's comparable diluted earnings per share for the third quarter 2016 were $0.96 versus last year's $1.10 on a higher share count and a higher year-over-year effective tax rate.
Third quarter comparable diluted earnings per share reflect year-over-year improvement largely due to the beverage can acquisition, solid global beverage can demand and improved aerospace performance, offset by higher corporate costs related to truing up our employee compensation accruals, the extra expense for stock plans due to the run up of our share price as well as some pension expense for inactives not tied to a continuing business segment, higher interest expense related to the timing of the Rexam debt pay off, a higher share count and tax rate.
Our GAAP results in the first 9 months were impacted by transaction-related earnings, hedging, purchase accounting and other customary closing adjustments. Details are provided in the Note 2 of today's earnings release, and additional information will also be provided in our 10-Q, which will be filed next week.
Our beverage packaging North and Central America segment, which comprises 17 legacy Ball facilities plus the 9 acquired facilities, including joint ventures, had comparable operating earnings for third quarter 2016 that were up year-over-year due to the contribution of the recently acquired plants in the U.S. and Mexico and continued specialty can growth. Industry demand across North America grew 1.5% in the third quarter. And on a comparable basis, Ball was in line with the industry during the quarter.
Our new Monterrey, Mexico facility continues to make productions strides, and Mexican domestic and export demand remained strong. Of note, the recently acquired JVs in Guatemala and Panama as well as our legacy Rocky Mountain metal container JV, are not consolidated and therefore, are included in equity earnings of affiliates.
Our beverage packaging South America segment, which consists of the 12 acquired facilities plus 2 legacy Ball facilities, recorded a solid third quarter as can demand in Brazil gained traction in the quarter, in part because of the seasonal summer build. Brazilian market demand as well as our volume in the quarter was relatively flat and down 2% year-to-date. Both Brazilian and Argentine can demand has been impacted by the inflationary environment in those countries. The team in South America is managing the business well, given the current economic and supply/demand conditions in the region.
In the beverage packaging Europe segment results, which include Russia, were up nicely in the quarter due largely to the acquisition and strong can demand in Russia during September. Industry supply/demand remains tight, and specialty demand remains favorable, with a bias towards continued shift into specialty.
As we mentioned in today's release, Ball chose to retain certain volumes in Spain, which will be supplied from a newly constructed plant near Madrid. This investment is supported by a long-term customer contract that was known to all parties prior to the divestment occurring, and the plant will help to provide supply to a region that is experiencing sustainable growth.
Beginning in the third quarter, our new segment reporting incorporates the operating performance of Ball's legacy China Asia business and the acquired EMEA business into other, which also includes the legacy corporate undistributed costs. For clarity and going forward, we will include a footnote in Note 2 of our earnings release financials referencing the amount of corporate undistributed costs included in other.
Of note, the UAC JV 51% investment is consolidated and is also reflected in the other segment, and the 49% outflow is reflected in noncontrolling interest. While I have the opportunity, our team in China is doing everything they can, given the challenges they are faced with. They have met their cost-out goals, and the team in EMEA is fitting right in at Ball. The markets are dynamic like the currency situation in Egypt, and we have great teams in both regions managing the businesses appropriately.
Moving to aerosol. Comparable segment earnings were flat year-over-year due to lower food can volumes, offset by continued growth in global aerosol. Initiatives to further improve production efficiencies are on track and start [ph] to benefit 2017 performance.
In summary, our global packaging businesses posted results that were right on top of our expectations, and the teams continue to be extremely focused on integrating the new assets, achieving their synergy goals and driving EVA dollars from the recent capital and efficiency projects. Thank you again to our global packaging team members as well as the corporate support teams. Their collaboration and dedication is appreciated.
As I mentioned in the second quarter call, we will identify all one-time items impacting free cash flow and operating earnings so that the underlying strength of the business is clear. You will notice that our third quarter net debt, as expected, is about $400 million higher than the pro forma $7 billion net debt reflected in our second quarter earnings release.
During the third quarter, we paid out $110 million in severance and incentives to divested and separated employees; $90 million to settle Rexam's derivatives; $65 million in adviser, attorney and banker fees; $50 million in tax payments; a July 1 $50 million bond interest payment; and we spent $125 million in CapEx. Obviously, there were offsets like third quarter EBITDA and the French sale proceeds. We are on target to flow a lot of cash in the fourth quarter, which is typical. We obviously had a working capital build from the acquired locations, and as we said before, it will take time to address how Rexam manages its balance sheet versus how we will manage ours. Regardless, we still see -- we still target year-end net debt in the range of $7 billion at current FX rates.
As we think about the remainder of 2016, here are some key metrics. We expect full year 2016 comparable operating earnings in the range of $1 billion, and to be clear, our comparable earnings going forward will exclude the amortization associated with acquired customer intangibles, which should be roughly $33 million in the fourth quarter.
Since the $83 million inventory step-up was recognized in the third quarter, I wouldn't expect any additional inventory step-up impact in the fourth quarter. The full year weighted average diluted shares outstanding for 2016 will be in the range of 161 million shares, which reflects the half-year impact of the 32 million shares issued for the acquisition.
For Q4 2016 and full year 2017, weighted average diluted shares outstanding will be roughly 178 million, absent the impact of any share repurchases. Full year 2016 interest expense will be in the range of $230 million. Given the negative carry associated with the timing of when the acquired credit agreement, private placement and hybrid debt came out, third quarter interest ran about $8 million higher than it will in the fourth quarter. The full year effective tax rate for 2016 on comparable earnings is expected to be in the range of 28%.
Corporate undistributed is now to be -- expected to be in the range of $115 million for full year 2016 versus the $105 million we discussed in the second quarter call. The $115 million now includes: costs to support the integration from locations such as Millbank and Charlotte as well as a true-up for our employee compensation plan accruals that we'll pay out to current Ball employees in early 2017; and the impact of known pension expense for inactives in the U.S. and abroad, which will migrate to corporate undistributed in the near term. To be clear, these are not unanticipated costs. It's more about where we have now determined the cost will be reflected from a reporting perspective.
Before I turn it back to John, we have received a few questions to provide a detailed bridge for 2016 to 2017. And we ask that you recall what we said in our second quarter call: we will not be posting a slide every quarter. For now, we just remind you that in 2017, we still expect to be in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion of comparable operating earnings due to value capture savings in the areas of sourcing, manufacturing, logistics and other areas like footprint: 1 billion more of units through our new Monterrey plant, cost-out benefits from the FNA metals service center transition as well as additional global aerosol and specialty beverage can growth. Improvement in aerospace and the full year impacted the acquisition.

Our aerospace business reported improved third quarter results driven by solid contract performance. Congratulations to the entire aerospace team. Their hard work paid off.
Our contracted backlog closed the quarter at a record $1.4 billion, which is 129% increase since the beginning of 2016. As I mentioned last quarter, we're ramping up and staffing up for these new contracts which will benefit the remainder of 2016 and more importantly, beyond.
Now across the company and as we look forward. We are on track to achieve the numbers that Scott just laid out. Every day, we gain even more visibility into the opportunities before us. And while there are always challenges, the team is up for proactively managing these.
In summary, I'm proud of what our team has accomplished so far. Everyone is taking to heart what it means to behave as a true owner. We all know there is much work still to be done, and we are focused on our balance sheet, cost out, footprint, supply/demand balance, supply chain and innovation. Advocating for the beverage can versus other substrates and improving the value generated for the products we sell are things we embrace as an industry leader.
As I mentioned in my introduction, our financial goals and aspirations for 2017 and beyond remain the same. And when our leverage gets to the range of 3x to 3.5x, we will return value to our fellow shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends.
And with that, James, we're ready for questions."

I mentioned in the last quarter that we had a lot on our plates in terms of 1 not booked and the only -- the biggest surprise that happened in the third quarter for us is, given that the governments pushed out the continuing resolution until after the election, we were pleasantly surprised, and so some of the wins turned into funded wins, which went into our backlog. We're still chasing a variety of things in the aerospace business and even getting back to the capital. I think over the next couple of years, it's not big dollars. But we're going to be investing in that in terms of new chambers, in terms of expanding our manufacturing capability and capacity and building out some of our existing facilities because our backlog is the highest we've ever had, and we were ramping up big-time in terms of hiring people, getting people going and as I mentioned, I think you're going to start see it rollout as early as the fourth quarter of 2016 and then as we go to 2017 and beyond, we feel good about that business.

As we go and really get going -- it's a difficult question to answer because as we have that we have like -- and every time we have some contracts that are coming off, some contracts that are coming on. I will point out a couple of things, though. The majority of the business we've won is a cost plus business, costs plus fixed fee business. And that usually, from an -- we've talked about this in the past. When you have a fixed price contract, usually the margins, when you start out, are a bit lower. And then if you execute successfully, your margins will pick up as you deliver those. In a cost-plus environment, it's a little bit more stable, the margin is across. So I don't expect our margin profile, having said that, to change meaningfully as we look forward. I think it's as much about growing the revenues, and some of these programs we've won are multiyear programs. Some of are single year. It's a big mix. But the vast majority of this is cost-plus, which is actually good from an overall profitability perspective."
