I'm very pleased to be able to deliver strong results for both our fourth quarter and the full year performance, even with the mixed global economy. 
For the fourth quarter, after we adjust for the Euro and the Brazilian Real [ph] translations, we report net revenue growth of 9% and EPS growth of 22%, driven by solid underlying metrics. And for the full year, we saw a net revenue growth of 8% and EPS growth of 18%, excluding special items. And most importantly, when you remove the impact of the functional currency translation of that I just said for the euro and the Brazil Real, but also for what we call local FX, which is the impact from other transactional currency pairs, our fourth quarter net revenue growth was 12%. And on that basis, for the full year, net revenue growth was almost 11%.
Moving on to the global economy, we continue to see challenges in many parts of the world. The U.S. economy seems the most resilient and saw good growth in both consumer spending and jobs. In Europe, growth is expected to increase at the fastest pace since 2011. Although this is at a lower level driven by stronger domestic demand and exports. However, several big emerging market economies, China and Brazil being examples, are experiencing either weak or slowing growth. And of course, oil prices have that impact on oil sensitive markets around the world, political instability, security concerns in some tourist destinations, given all concerns, that they're careful watching. We are globally connected as a company. And so what you've got to do is to work to successfully navigate through these challenges exactly as we have in the past.
So with that backdrop, let's get it to our business. Our business continues to grow and our fundamentals remain strong. We saw double digit volume and transaction growth across all regions except the U.S. We saw growth in the mid to high-single digits. And additionally, our services businesses provide a nice complement to our volume-based core business and continued to show good growth. So moving on to a few highlights of the year and some of our recent business activity.
Overall, I've said 2015 was a year that had economic challenges, and then we also have to deal from partnership volatility. And as I said earlier, not just in the Euro in the Brazil Real, which are functional currencies but in the other local transaction currencies stands as well. But despite all of that, I think we have navigated these circumstances well, and we put significant points in the board us a result of our investments in digital payments, in safety and security as well as in the financial inclusion.
And this year, we talked about winning some significant customer deals. I've called out many of those in previous calls but the top of the year, let me mention a few that were added in the fourth quarter. So this past quarter, we've renewed, and we expanded our relationships with a number of our larger customers, including, in this case, Citigroup's commercial card portfolios in Asia Pacific, in Europe and the United States. The HSBC Premier consumer credit business covering 28 markets around the world. In Italy, we signed a long-term debit agreement with Post Italian to migrate their Maestro cards to debit MasterCard but we also expanded our advisory services to help the drive financial inclusion and digital products for their customers.
In Russia, we TB is in the second largest bank and the card ensuring that countries is converting their debit card portfolio to MasterCard. In another example, we've signed a long-term renewal with Qatar National Bank, one of the larger banks in the Arab world for their debit card portfolio.
Turning to China. [indiscernible] I reported to the opening of the domestic market. There's still a work in process. But we are executing on certain elements that have already been in the draft regulations such as building out our technology on the ground. Meanwhile, we are continuing to work with our Chinese customers, as they themselves prepare for the next wave of payments growth as well as to expand into the digital space. So let me give you 2 or 3 examples to give you some color on what we're doing.
We worked closely with both Bank of China and ICBM. These are 2 of China's top 5 state-owned commercial banks. To launch their mobile payments in China, they're utilizing our tokenization and cloud-based technologies for that.
Already for the new regulation, some banks are beginning to issue single branded cards with international networks.  In 2015, we have launched 32 single-branded programs in China, including 1 this past quarter with the Bank of Communications for their first single-branded EMV credit card. They also utilized our card management products. No, what I mean, by single-branded is that we are the only network brand on that card. There is no China, UnionPay on that card. That's what single-branded means. 
Finally, we're also seeing more issuance of commercial card products. In the fourth quarter, we won new business of the Bank of Beijing and we the agriculture bank of China for their commercial card portfolios.
Now 2015 was a big year for us in the digital space. We're actually pleased with our progress with our MasterPass. We have launched in 13 new markets this year, in the fourth quarter, Japan, Sweden, Ireland, Slovakia, where the latest markets to go live. And that brings the total number of MasterPass markets to 29.
In 2015, we launched a total of 64 new MasterPass enabled wallets, with some of the more recent additions being Access Bank in India, Net Bank in South Africa and the first wallet in Japan with UC card.
We are busy expanding acceptance with premier margins, representing the largest volume opportunities in the marketplace and ahead of our Walmart and Sam's Club, Staples, [indiscernible] JetBlue, Barnes & Noble College [indiscernible] Barrel [ph] , et cetera, et cetera. All of whom are launching MasterPass in this coming year of 2016.
And on our third quarter earnings call, I've talked about the launch of the MasterCard commerce for every device program, to enable any consumer gadget, any accessory available wherever to pick up a payment device. And we also mentioned we were working with fashion designers, with automakers, with smart band developers and last quarter, we announced our partnership with General Motors to integrate our Digital Enablement System into their own store platform. We are actually continuing to build on that momentum because this month, earlier at the Consumer Electronic Show, along with Samsung, we announced Grocery by MasterCard. That's basically a new app that allows consumers to order groceries directly from their new family hub refrigerator.
We've also announced the partnership with Coin, that's the consumer electronics and financial software company that will help us bring MasterCard payments to a wide area of fitness brands like those from Atlas, [indiscernible] or Smart watches from [indiscernible] and other variable devices.
While none of this is expected to be bigger in their own, kind of demonstrates the breadth of the opportunity in digital payments and our engagement to that opportunity as every device over the next 2 years begins to enable commerce.
Another area of focus for us in 2015 was safety and security. There have been some big moves in the states, including significant progress in the U.S. EMV migration and even though the industry was slightly short of its forecast of 50% of issued credit and debit card being chip-enabled by the end of the year, they're pretty close. And volume from chip-enabled cards continues to grow. We still expect almost all U.S. Cards to be upgraded before the end of 2017 and merchants are continuing to enable new terminals and ATMs are being upgraded as well. So this is kind of a work in process but in the right direction. 
Looking beyond the U.S, we deployed a number of security solutions, from tokenization to self e-pay, to something called safety net. And safety net is our real-time fraud solution. What it does is it detects attacks upon threats globally across all products, all channels that's point of sales and AVn and is a great example of how we're leveraging the unique capability of our global network and analytical capability. It can identify, isolate and stop cyber attacks often before the bank is even aware of them. And as a result now, more than any personal device around the world are now using safety net as a service from us. That's an example of the kinds of products we have building in our services business, which is, as you know, advisers consulting in full, services but all the safety and security products and loyalty and reward are all a part of this services effort that we're putting into place. 
So last year, part of our financial inclusion efforts, we signed about 600 new government programs, including, I think some very innovative ones. The example of the Egyptian government comes to mind that we're going to extend financial services to more than 54 million Egyptians by linking their national digital ID, something the government is issuing, to a mobile wallet to receive government benefits, employee payroll as well as our P2P capabilities across all banks and all telco by the way. It's a countrywide effort.
And finally, we've worked through various regulatory challenges, including the first network to migrate domestic card transactions to the new Russian and estate card switch [ph], as well as implementing the new European payment regulations.
So that's 2015. Some business wins, something about what we're doing in digital and MasterPass, we're up to in services and safety common security and the work and financial inclusion, kind of the backdrop behind the revenue numbers I gave you. But looking forward, 2016, we expect this year to be similar than what we saw 2015, in terms of complex environment, I consider that currency will remain a challenge over the course of the year. The dollar is going to keep strengthening, but our plan is to stay focused on executing our strategy to the space cash, to play a defining role in digital and innovate for the future. And that means, expanding our services businesses as well. We've got to grow our processing capabilities so they can see more transactions, that then enable us to provide greater insights through analytics, as well as providing robust safety and security solutions so we can offer better predictions for our card holders, for merchants and for our issuing bank partners.
We're going to continue to pursue profitable market share while diversifying our revenues. At the same time, I think you'll find us continue to work hard to manage our expenses so we can allocate more resources to these growth areas. 
And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Martina for an update on our financial results and operational metrics. Martina?"
6477196,320074166,923584,"MasterCard Incorporated, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2016",2016-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Mastercard Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Ajay, and good morning, everyone. As suggested, through despite strong FX headwinds we closed out the quarter well.

As suggested, through despite strong FX headwinds we closed out the quarter well. Let me give you some highlights on the fourth quarter starting with Page 3, where you can see the difference between as reported and FX adjusted growth rates.
So EPS growth was 14% or 22% after adjusting for currency. Continued revenue momentum, good cost control, executing on our attack strategies and repurchasing shares all contributed to that performance. Acquisitions that we made in 2014 and 2015 drove $0.03 of EPS dilution in the quarter.
Included in our other income and expense line was $83 million of impairment charges, predominantly related to some of our very early investments in mobile. In number of these investments have performed well while others have not met our expectations.
Next, our tax rate of 13.1% in the quarter was more favorable than we expected due to the benefits that resulted from the impact of settlements with tax authorities related to the tax audits that I have mentioned as a possibility at our Investor Day last September. Share repurchases contributed $0.02 per share to our fourth quarter results. As of January 22, we have $4.2 billion remaining under our current authorization.
Lastly, cash flow from operations was $1 billion. We ended the current quarter with cash, cash equivalents and other liquid investments of about $6.7 billion.
So let me turn to Page 4 where you can see the operational metrics for the fourth quarter. Our worldwide gross dollar volume, or GDV, was up 12% on a local currency basis, down 1 ppt from last quarter. Overall, our U.S. GDV grew 8%, made up of credit and debit growth of 9% and 8%, respectively. Total U.S. GDV had a continued almost 2 ppt headwind from lower gas prices. 
Outside of the U.S, volume growth was 14% on a local currency basis, down 2 ppt versus last quarter with midteens growth in each region. And on cross quarter [ph] volume, we grew 12% on a local currency basis, lower than the 16% we saw in the third quarter, primarily driven by the political instability and economic conditions around the world, as well as the lapping of some recent wins in Europe and Canada.
Turning to Page 5, you can see global process transaction growth was 12%, the same as what we saw in the third quarter. We continue to see double-digit growth in all regions outside of the U.S. And globally, the number of cards grew 7%, with 2.3 billion MasterCard and Maestro branded cards issued.
Now let's turn to Page 6 for some highlights on a few of the revenue line items. Net revenue growth was 4%, as reported, or 9% FX adjusted given currency headwinds. Additionally, the impact of local currency exchange rates was higher than we expected, more than 3 ppt, driven by currencies such as the Venezuelan Bolivar and the Canadian Dollar.  After eliminating both currency impact, our underlying net revenue growth was about 12%.
We base an incentive was slightly higher than we expected due to the timing of some deal in the works and acquisitions contributed about 2 ppt to net revenue growth, up slightly from the 1 ppt we saw last quarter.
Looking quickly at the individual line items, revenue line items, on an FX adjusted basis. Domestic assessments grew 10%, while worldwide GDV grew 12%. This 2 ppt gap is primarily due to the impact of local currency somewhat offset by pricing.
Cross-border volume fees grew 13% while cross-border grew 12%. Of the 1 ppt GAAP, the majority's due to a higher mix of inter-Europe activity, some local currency impact and lower inbound U.S. cross-border volume, essentially offset by pricing.
Transaction processing fees grew 13%, primarily driven by the 12% growth in process transactions. Finally, other revenue grew 26%, driven primarily by advisers as well as our APT and TNS acquisition.
Moving on to Page 7, you can see that total operating expenses increased 1% in the quarter or 4% on an FX-adjusted basis. This growth was essentially are driven by M&A activities as we focus on integrating the acquisitions we made in 2014 and '15.
So you can see the underlying expense growth was essentially flat from last year. The non-recurrence of the significant severance charge in last year's fourth quarter was offset by several factors including: Additional personal expense as a result of our investment and strategic growth area; higher processing costs due to both more transactions across our network as well as the fees paid to NSB car [ph] for processing domestic [indiscernible] transaction; and lower foreign currency-related gains versus the prior year.
Let me turn to Slide 8. And here we can discuss what we've seen in January through the 21st. Most of our business drivers are a bit higher or similar to what we experienced in the fourth quarter. So here are the numbers through January 21.
Starting with process volume, we saw global growth of 14%, up 2 ppt from the fourth quarter. In the U.S, our process volume grew 13%, up almost 4 ppt from the fourth quarter with higher growth in both credit and debit. Gas had an 1 ppt negative impact on our January growth compared to the almost 2 ppt drag in the fourth quarter.
Process volume outside the U.S. grew 16%, the same as the fourth quarter, with double-digit growth in each region. Globally, process transaction growth was 13%, up slightly from the 12% we saw in the fourth quarter. And growth outside the U.S. slowed just a bit primarily due to the lapping of some business wins as well as the slowdown in Brazil.
U.S. growth was up 2 ppt, driven by improvements in both credit and debit. And with respect to cross-border, our volumes grew at 12% globally, that's the same that we saw in the fourth quarter.
Now let me start out talking about our long-term performance objectives, which as you know, exclude the translation impact of our Euro and Brazilian Riel functional currencies. On that basis, for the 2013 to 2015 period, net revenue growth was 10.5%, close to the low end of the range. Beyond the euro and the Brazilian riel, we experienced extremely strong foreign exchange headwinds from the other local currency pairs that Ajay just referenced, which resulted in about 2 ppt impact to our compound annual growth rate. Therefore, the underlying net revenue growth for this period was over 12%.
We achieved our margin commitments and delivered a 19.2% compound annual growth for EPS over the period, excluding the tax benefits we saw in the fourth quarter of 2015. Again, when I exclude the impact from those local currency peers, the EPS CAGR was over 20%.
Now let's move on to our 2016 to 2018 performance objectives, which are net revenue, CAGR of low double digits, operating margin of at least 50% and an EPS CAGR in the midteens.
Remember, these objectives are on a constant currency basis and exclude any new M&A activities. Going forward, you should be using a pro forma 2015 EPS figure of $3.12 as the starting point for the 3-year EPS CAGR calculation. This pro forma number is calculated based on a normalized 2015 tax rate of 30.4%, which adjusts for several one-time tax benefits. The largest of these is from the significantly favorable outcome of some tax audits that concluded late in 2015. And consistent with the methodology we have used in the past, it also excludes the impact of special items.
So as you've heard from Ajay, we expect 2016 to be a continuation of 2015. For the U.S. and European economies are showing signs of strength but the rest of the world remains challenged. In addition, foreign exchange volatility will continue to be with us into 2016. We have navigated through periods like this before, and we will continue to run the company for growth both on the top and bottom line as well as balancing our investments with us to expense management.
So as we look at full year 2016, our underlying business fundamentals remain strong. However, we expect to be at the low end of our 3-year performance objectives due to current FX level relative to where they were back in September when we first developed these objectives. These objectives already included some level of local FX headwinds. Though, they are no expected to be higher than what we assumed in September. And I know, as you model all your numbers on an as reported basis, you need to adjust for the impact of our euro and Brazilian riel functional translation. And at current rates, that results in a 2 ppt headwind on net revenue growth and a 3 ppt headwing to bottom line growth.
For 2016, let me call out a few additional items that you should also consider. For rebates and incentives, we expect to see slightly lower growth this year than the 20% as reported growth rate that we saw in 2015, which is much different than what we see in some of your current models.
On expenses, just a couple of comments. You just heard Ajay talk about putting money into our growth areas. Well, for 2015 that was focused on a number of acquisitions. With that integration process well underway, this year, we will accelerate our investments in digital, certain geographies such as China as well as in safety and security.
Also, in last year's first quarter, we had $40 million of FX gains in the G&A line associated with the events in Venezuela that are not expected to recur this year.
As a result, you should expect our total operating expense growth to increase in the high single-digit range. Now having said that, as you all know, we always plan our investments with a certain degree of flexibility depending on the market Provus role in economic environment. We already prepared with contingency plans to adjust expenses should then need to course correct be necessary.
In the other expense line, interest expense associated with the euro-denominated debt that we issued last November at roughly $10 million to our normal underlying run rate of roughly $15 million per year for the quarter. So this is $15 million per quarter.
You should assume a roughly similar tax rate for 2016 as the 30% normalized rate I just spoke about for 2015.
And finally, we realized that it's becoming more difficult for many of you to model our business as FX rates continue to move around. We're thinking about how to make this entire topic more transparent, so stay tuned on this.
Now let me turn the call back to Barbara to begin the Q&A session. Barbara?"

And the base in 2012 are basically actual numbers, adjusted for only one line item, which was the tax line item. And basically, our special tax benefits that are not expected to be repeated. So that's the $2.14. When you walk to 2015, what we did do, is you have to adjust for foreign exchange for the euro and the B riel because that is -- we do our performance objective and FX adjusted basis, so you put basically back in $0.21 on top of the EPS that we print. So you start with an EPS of $3.35. You add in the special items of $0.08, which is $3.43. You add back the foreign exchange, which is $0.21. You're adding back the acquisition, and you're adding back these one-time tax items, all of which we call it out, which gets you to the $3.62. And when you do the differential between the $2.14 to the $3.62, you're getting actually that 19.2% compounded annual growth rate. So that is the history. Now let me focus on 2015 and going forward. So for the 2016 to 2018 financial objective. 2015, you're not starting with a $3.62 because that is an FX-adjusted number. Of course, we are going to have to start with a real number, with an actual number, right? So you start again with the $3.35, that's exactly our as reported number in the financials. You adjust for that for the special items, which is the $0.08. So you're going to $3.43. And then, you're putting in -- and then you're taking out the tax items, $0.31 of that. And that's how you get to $3.12. So your actual FX rates for this starting point, adjusted for the special item and you saw the adjusted for this special tax items. That's how you get to the $3.12, which is the basis upon which we calculate our future EPS performance."

So I don't know that nearly reading a few more deals will change the nature of revenue growth trajectory in China over the course of 1 year.

Clearly, margins, the lower cost of acceptance should be willing more to accept electronic payments than they use to.

I -- my view with cross-border right now is that the fact is that to resume around the world did get impacted in the fourth quarter of last year. There's no doubt that when the Paris terrorist attack happened, it impacted France for a while. There's no doubt that went the Egyptian plane went down, it impacted to them in that area. And so that's just reality. A lot of these tends to bounce back over time. Paris did come back, not exactly it will level, there were walls growing at the number. Paris is the world's #1 tourist destination, the world's #1. And so I -- cross-border, some portion of it comes from tourism. Some of the portion of the comes from corporate travel. Some portion of it comes from e-commerce. And these different elements have been impacted differently, by the way the world has seen these geopolitical circumstances, over the last 2, 3, 4 months. That's why I think our numbers are still running even in 12, in the first 21 days of this year. And they're not going higher or lower. It's kind of where we are. We're sitting there. I'm going to watch that very carefully because it does impact my revenue sort of every transaction and sort of many other things with cross-border is operatively the interesting part of it. And so we'll watch it carefully. And that's part of the reason why we believe that in 2016, one of the reasons where we think, take a look at it being at the low-end of our revenue guidance to you for the 3-year period. Is all these factors are inside that thinking of our budget for the year."

So first of all, my belief is that this thing is going through its cycle. 4, 5 years ago the conversation was that the mobile payment operators will be able to create their own payment systems because they had both consumers and a e-mail voice mail phone connectivity with millions and billions of consumers. Why would they need everybody else provide? As you saw over time, we have now got 50 of those M&Ls [ph] around the world signed up as our partners. And some of them, in fact, we went into JVs with, that have done well. Others have not done so well. That's actually one of the write-downs that Martina was referring to. So over time, they're going to invest in different directions. Some of them will do well, some of them will not. A couple of those as well as we like to. My general sense is the mobile network operated payment system for person to merchant has yet to prove itself in scale in any market place at all. For person-to-person payments, there's a little more going on. Okay, so I think that's a little bit of a challenge on where those are going. I think on known mobile network operator, that's to say hardware-based, Samsung and Apple, Google there's some interesting new developments. You've seen with contactless payments and in-app payments. I don't know yet that browser-based payments will go where with that bunch of digital giants. But remember, browser is the largest portion of digital payments today. And frankly, out 3 to 4 years, it will still be overwhelmingly the large percentage of digital payments. So that's another one to be part through. I do think that the biggest conversation that's going on in digital is the safety and security of those transactions. And a lot of our effort and energy has therefore gone into tokenization not just for MasterPass, for our banks and merchants but even for, not just new transactions, but even for cards in file. Because frankly, when EMV in the U.S, where do think fraud will migrate to? It's going to migrate to online. And that's what happened in every country around the world. So our focus there is not just in solving band aidisciplined of EMV, it's making the whole payment system more secure over time. That's why tokenization is key. And a large amount of our investment, and those of our competitors, is going to that space. That's why we agreed on industry standard for tokenization. So we shouldn't create friction between banks and merchants on, which standard to work with. So you're going to see a lot of energy and effort in that space. And I think the other piece of that will cover the plane digital will be the intelligence that will drive the capable don't banks and merchants to drive better transaction, better relationships with that consumers. That's why, we have put on services and analytics. So you kind of -- that's what I think about digital. I think of it as a big opportunity but 85% of the world's transaction is still in cash. There's a lot of space out there. And then it's to save you have about existing competitors in the payment system, whether to say, domestic debit scheme in the country or it's a larger competitor, or it's a China UnionPay or anybody else. My view is, there's a lot of space here. Gotta get off  in the 85%. We can all grow in there and have pretty good run rate for the industry for some years to come."

So for the services business, yes, I tried to give you a few points back in September at the Investor Day saying that our core business is substantially 75% of the company. And the services business is about 25% of the company. All of those growth explorations that we have in services, and you can actually see in the other revenue line where we have most of the services in there, it grows very, very fast. All of those expectations are actually embedded at our overall net revenue guidance. So I'm not splitting for your part in terms of what our core business versus of the services business DOS. The other thing that we said in September and I have no different expectations at this point in time, is that the services business, while its lower in margin than what we have today, then what we have in our core business, that we do believe that over time, that will be some margin improvement in the services business."

In fact, our advisers consulting business, with 6 years that I've been in the company. I have seen Martina working with the team there on improving the margin of that business through better utilization of people, lower downtime of consultants, creating centers of excellence.

Yes. Next 1 year, no. So let me give you an example, for Myanmar. Myanmar, was handled -- once the government of the United States opened up its relationship with Myanmar, the removal of sanctions in Myanmar happened pretty quickly after that and companies like us and our competitors were able to go in and begin to first enable ATM networks and then enable acceptance. And then we've been able issuance in the country. We di all that because Myanmar has a relatively underdeveloped payment system that entire thing is relatively slow. Now Iran, on the other hand, has a payment system domestically. Merchants do accept electronic payments already. It's not Myanmar in the form of being a completely cash economy. So if you could plug and play, you could probably get quicker results than in Myanmar. But the United States government is still to lift its sanctions. You just saw that the Iranian President came out and signed a fairly large set of deals on planes from Airbus, having it signed everything at Boeing. And that's all part of what's going on there has to be a whole change in the sanctioned regime that allows companies like us and our competitors, and banks to operate freely in Iran. That has yet to be seen. So I would say, Iran is more interesting because of a literate population with a relatively functioning electronic payment system. But until the sanctions actually get lifted, this is all very nice with regard to [indiscernible].
Okay questions done now? Right, closing comments. So thank you all for those questions. Let me give you a couple of closing comments. You saw it come through what Martina and I think we navigated at the economic environment this year. But [indiscernible] and honestly, the local currency, change into your question you that gave us even faster in the last 2, 3 months of the year. We met you at September, but something about local currency. By the time December came around, we had a different picture. December itself was a different picture from November and October. That's how rapid the local currency movement this is the dollar has been. But you know what? We've navigated that, and delivered strong results from a variety of protected financially, volume, share growth, deals, innovation. 2016 looks similar to 2015. So we're going to stay very focused on executing our strategy. We're going to translate defining roles in the digital opportunity. We're going to keep trying to innovate for the future, growth revenues from both our core and services business and work really hard to manage our expenses so we create the space for us to invest in our future. In the payment space, I think remains a great place to be at. Business continues to have strong momentum. We're going to keep pursuing profitable market share. We're going to keep trying to drive the conversion of cash to electronic payments around the world. I continue to believe that run rate is an enormous way of growth. We intend to maintain our leadership role in this industry effort in digital payments, in safety and security, in financial inclusion. And I'm quite confident we can run the company for growth and we'll try to deliver on all our 3-year objectives. I just appreciate your ongoing support for the company and for all of us.

And most importantly, when you remove the impact of the functional currency translation that I just said for the euro and the Brazilian real but also for what we call local FX, which is the impact from other transactional currency pairs, our fourth quarter net revenue growth was 12%. And on that basis, for the full year, net revenue growth was almost 11%.
Moving on to the global economy. We continue to see challenges in many parts of the world. The U.S. economy seems the most resilient and got good growth in both consumer spending and jobs. In Europe, growth is expected to increase at the fastest pace since 2011, although this is at a lower level, driven by stronger domestic demand and exports. However, several big emerging market economies, China and Brazil being examples, are experiencing either weak or slowing growth and, of course, oil prices and their impact on oil-sensitive markets around the world, political instability, security concerns in some tourist destinations, given all the concerns that they're careful watching. And we are globally connected as a company, and so what you've got to do is to work to successfully navigate through these challenges, exactly as we have in the past.
So with that backdrop, let's get into our business. Our business continues to grow, and our fundamentals remain strong. We saw double digit volume and transaction growth across all regions, except the U.S., which saw growth in the mid to high single digits. And additionally, our services businesses provide a nice complement to our volume-based core business and continue to show good growth. 
So moving on to a few highlights of the year and some of our recent business activity. Overall, I'd say 2015 was a year that had its economic challenges, and then we also had to deal with foreign exchange volatility, and as I said earlier, not just in the euro and the Brazilian real, which are our functional currencies, but in the other local transaction currency pairs as well. But despite all that, I think we have navigated these circumstances well, and we put significant points on the board as a result of our investments in digital payments, in safety and security as well as in financial inclusions.
And this year, we've talked about winning some significant customer deals. I've called out many of those in previous calls. But to cap off the year, let me mention a few that we had in the fourth quarter. So this past quarter, we renewed and we expanded our relationships with a number of our larger customers, including, in this case, Citigroup's commercial card portfolios in Asia-Pacific, in Europe and the United States; the HSBC Premier consumer credit business covering 28 markets around the world. In Italy, we signed a long-term debit agreement with Poste Italiane to migrate their Maestro cards to Debit MasterCard, but we also expanded our advisory services to help them drive financial inclusion and digital products for their customers.
In Russia, VTB24, which is the second largest bank and the card issuer in that country, is converting their debit card portfolio to MasterCard. And another example, we signed a long-term renewal with Qatar National Bank, one of the largest banks in the Arab world, for their debit card portfolio.
Turning to China. I have nothing new to report to you about the opening of the domestic market. That's still work in process. But we are executing on certain elements that have already been in the draft regulations such as building out our technology on the ground. Meanwhile, we are continuing to work with our Chinese customers as they themselves prepare for the next wave of payments growth as well as to expand into the digital space. So let me give you 2 or 3 examples to give you some color on what we are doing.
We've worked closely with both Bank of China and ICBC, and these are 2 of China's top 5 state-owned commercial banks. To launch their mobile payment products in China, they're utilizing our tokenization and cloud-based technologies for that.
While waiting for the new regulation, some banks are beginning to issue single-branded cards with international networks. In 2015, we have launched 32 single-branded programs in China, including 1 this past quarter with the Bank of Communications for their first single-branded EMV credit card. They also utilize our card management products. Now what I mean by single-branded is that we are the only network brand on that card. There is no China UnionPay on that card. That's what single-branded means. 
Finally, we are also seeing more issuance of commercial card products. In the fourth quarter, we won new business with the Bank of Beijing and with the Agricultural Bank of China for their commercial card portfolios.
Now 2015 was a big year for us in the digital space. We're actually pleased with our progress with our MasterPass. We have launched in 13 new markets this year, in the fourth quarter, Japan, Sweden, Ireland, Slovakia, with the latest markets to go live. And that brings the total number of MasterPass markets to 29.
In 2015, we launched a total of 64 new MasterPass-enabled wallets, with some of the more recent additions being Axis Bank in India, NedBank in South Africa and the first wallet in Japan with UC Card. We're busy expanding acceptance with premier merchants representing the largest volume opportunities in the marketplace, and you've read about Walmart and Sam's Club, Staples,  [indiscernible], JetBlue, Barnes & Noble College, Crate and Barrel, et cetera, et cetera, all of whom are launching MasterPass in this coming year of 2016.
And on our third quarter earnings call, I have talked about the launch of the MasterCard Commerce for Every Device program to enable any consumer gadget, any accessory available, whatever, to become a payment device. And we also mentioned we were working with fashion designers, with automakers, with SmartBand developers. And last quarter, we announced our partnership with General Motors to integrate our Digital Enablement System into their OnStar platform and actually continuing to build on that momentum because this month, earlier at the Consumer Electronics Show, along with Samsung, we announced Groceries by MasterCard. That's basically a new app that allows consumers to order groceries directly from their new Family Hub refrigerator.
We've also announced the partnership with Coin. That's the consumer electronics and financial software company that will help us bring MasterCard payments to a wide area of fitness bands like those from Atlas Wearables or Moov or smartwatches from Omate and other wearable devices.
While none of this is expected to be big on their own, it kind of demonstrates the breadth of the opportunity in digital payments and our engagement to that opportunity as every device over the next 2 years begins to enable commerce.
Another area of focus for us in 2015 was safety and security. There have been some big moves in the space, including significant progress in the U.S. EMV migration. And even though the industry was slightly short of its forecast of 50% of issued credit and debit cards being chip-enabled by the end of the year, they were pretty close, and volume from chip-enabled cards continues to grow. We still expect almost all U.S. cards to be upgraded before the end of 2017. And merchants are continuing to enable new terminals, and ATMs are being upgraded as well, so this is kind of work in process but in the right direction. 
Looking beyond the U.S., we deployed a number of security solutions from tokenization to self e-pay, to something called SafetyNet. And SafetyNet is our real-time fraud solution. What it does, it detects and acts upon threats globally across all products, all channels, that's point of sales and ATM, and it's a great example of how we are leveraging the unique capability of our global network and analytical capability. It can identify, isolate and stop cyber attacks often before the bank is even aware of them. And as a result now, more than 80% of our issuers around the world are now using SafetyNet as a service from us. That's an example of the kinds of products we are building in our services business, which is, as you know, advisers, consulting, information services. But all these safety and security products and loyalty and rewards are all a part of this services effort that we're putting into place. 
So last year, part of our financial inclusion efforts, we signed about 600 new government programs, including, I think, some very innovative ones. The example of the Egyptian government comes to mind, where we're going to extend financial services to more than 54 million Egyptians by linking their national digital ID, something the government is issuing, to a mobile wallet to receive government benefits, employee payroll as well as our P2P capabilities across all banks and all telcos, by the way. It's a countrywide effort.
And finally, we've worked through various regulatory challenges, including being the first network to migrate domestic card transactions to the new Russian NSPK switch as well as implementing the new European payment regulations.
So that's 2015, some business wins, something about what we're doing in digital and MasterPass, what we're up to in services and safety and security and the work in financial inclusion, kind of the backdrop behind the revenue numbers I gave you. But looking forward, 2016, we expect this year to be similar to what we saw in 2015. In terms of complex environment, I consider that currency will remain a challenge over the course of the year. The dollar is going to keep strengthening. But our plan is to stay focused on executing our strategy to displace cash, to play a defining role in digital and innovate for the future, and that means expanding our services businesses as well. We will grow our processing capabilities, so we can see more transactions that then enable us to provide greater insights through analytics as well as providing robust safety and security solutions, so we can offer better protection for our cardholders, for merchants and for our issuing bank partners.
We are going to continue to pursue profitable market share while diversifying our revenues. At the same time, I think you'll find us continue to work hard to manage our expenses, so we can allocate more resources to these growth areas. 
And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Martina for an update on our financial results and operational metrics. Martina?"
6477196,320074166,923744,"MasterCard Incorporated, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2016",2016-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Mastercard Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Ajay, and good morning, everyone. As you just heard, despite strong FX headwinds, we closed out the quarter well. Let me give you some highlights on the fourth quarter, starting with Page 3, where you can see the difference between as-reported and",1774,"Thanks, Ajay, and good morning, everyone. As you just heard, despite strong FX headwinds, we closed out the quarter well. Let me give you some highlights on the fourth quarter, starting with Page 3, where you can see the difference between as-reported and FX-adjusted growth rates.
So EPS growth was 14% or 22% after adjusting for currency. Continued revenue momentum, good cost control, executing on our tax strategies and repurchasing shares all contributed to that performance. Acquisitions that we made in 2014 and 2015 drove $0.03 of EPS dilution in the quarter.
Included in our Other Income and Expense line was $83 million of impairment charges predominantly related to some of our very early investments in mobile. A number of these investments have performed well, while others have not met our expectations.
Next, our tax rate of 13.1% in the quarter was more favorable than we expected due to the benefits that resulted from the impact of settlements with tax authorities related to the tax audits that I have mentioned as a possibility at our Investor Day last September. Share repurchases contributed $0.02 per share to our fourth quarter results. As of January 22, we have $4.2 billion remaining under our current authorization.
Lastly, cash flow from operations was $1 billion. We ended the current quarter with cash, cash equivalents and other liquid investments of about $6.7 billion.
So let me turn to Page 4, where you can see the operational metrics for the fourth quarter. Our worldwide gross dollar volume or GDV was up 12% on a local currency basis, down 1 ppt from last quarter. Overall, our U.S. GDV grew 8%, made up of credit and debit growth of 9% and 8%, respectively. Total U.S. GDV had a continued almost 2 ppt headwind from lower gas prices. Outside of the U.S, volume growth was 14% on a local currency basis, down 2 ppt versus last quarter, with mid-teens growth in each region. And on cross-border volume, we grew 12% on a local currency basis, lower than the 16% we saw in the third quarter, primarily driven by the political instability and economic conditions around the world as well as the lapping of some recent wins in Europe and Canada.
Turning to Page 5. Here, you can see global processed transaction growth was 12%, the same as what we saw in the third quarter. We continue to see double-digit growth in all regions outside of the U.S. And globally, the number of cards grew 7%, with 2.3 billion MasterCard and Maestro-branded cards issued.
Now let's turn to Page 6 for some highlights on a few of the revenue line items. Net revenue growth was 4% as reported or 9% FX-adjusted given currency headwinds. Additionally, the impact of local currency exchange rates was higher than we expected, more than 3 ppt, driven by currencies such as the Venezuelan bolivar and the Canadian dollar. After eliminating both currency impacts, our underlying net revenue growth was about 12%.
Rebates and incentives were slightly higher than we expected due to the timing of some deal in the works. And acquisitions contributed about 2 ppt to net revenue growth, up slightly from the 1 ppt we saw last quarter.
Looking quickly at the individual line items -- revenue line items on an FX-adjusted basis. Domestic assessments grew 10%, while worldwide GDV grew 12%. This 2 ppt gap is primarily due to the impact of local currency, somewhat offset by pricing. Cross-border volume fees grew 13%, while cross-border volume grew 12%. Of the 1 ppt gap, the majority is due to a higher mix of intra-Europe activity, some local currency impact and lower inbound U.S. cross-border volume, essentially offset by pricing. Transaction processing fees grew 13%, primarily driven by the 12% growth in processed transactions. Finally, other revenue grew 26%, driven primarily by advisers as well as our APT and TNS acquisitions.
Moving on to Page 7. You can see that total operating expenses increased 1% in the quarter or 4% on an FX-adjusted basis. This growth was essentially all driven by M&A activities as we focused on integrating the acquisitions we made in 2014 and '15.
So you can see the underlying expense growth was essentially flat from last year. The non-recurrence of a significant severance charge in last year's fourth quarter was offset by several factors, including additional personnel expense as a result of our investment in strategic growth areas; higher processing costs due to both more transactions across our network as well as the fees paid to NSPK for processing domestic Russian transactions; and lower foreign currency-related gains versus the prior year.
Let me turn to Slide 8. And here, we can discuss what we've seen in January through the 21st. Most of our business drivers are a bit higher or similar to what we experienced in the fourth quarter. So here are the numbers through January 21. Starting with processed volume, we saw global growth of 14%, up 2 ppt from the fourth quarter. In the U.S., our processed volume grew 13%, up almost 4 ppt from the fourth quarter, with higher growth in both credit and debit. Gas had a 1 ppt negative impact on our January growth compared to the almost 2 ppt drag in the fourth quarter.
Processed volume outside the U.S. grew 16%, the same as the fourth quarter, with double-digit growth in each region. Globally, processed transaction growth was 13%, up slightly from the 12% we saw in the fourth quarter. And growth outside the U.S. slowed just a bit primarily due to the lapping of some business wins as well as the slowdown in Brazil. U.S. growth was up 2 ppt, driven by improvements in both credit and debit. And with respect to cross-border, our volumes grew at 12% globally. That's the same that we saw in the fourth quarter.
Now let me start out talking about our long-term performance objectives, which, as you know, exclude the translation impact of our euro and Brazilian real functional currencies. On that basis, for the 2013 to 2015 period, net revenue growth was 10.5%, close to the low end of the range. Beyond the euro and the Brazilian real, we experienced extremely strong foreign exchange headwinds from the other local currency pairs that Ajay just referenced, which resulted in about 2 ppt impact to our compound annual growth rate. Therefore, the underlying net revenue growth for this period was over 12%.
We achieved our margin commitments and delivered a 19.2% compound annual growth for EPS over the period, excluding the tax benefits we saw in the fourth quarter of 2015. Again, when I exclude the impact from those local currency pairs, the EPS CAGR was over 20%.
Now let's move on to our 2016 to 2018 performance objectives, which are net revenue CAGR of low double digits, operating margin of at least 50% and an EPS CAGR in the mid-teens. Remember, these objectives are on a constant currency basis and exclude any new M&A activities. Going forward, you should be using a pro forma 2015 EPS figure of $3.12 as the starting point for the 3-year EPS CAGR calculation. This pro forma number is calculated based on a normalized 2015 tax rate of 30.4%, which adjusts for several onetime tax benefits. The largest of these is from the significantly favorable outcome of some tax audits that concluded late in 2015. And consistent with the methodology we have used in the past, it also excludes the impact of special items.
As you've heard from Ajay, we expect 2016 to be a continuation of 2015. The U.S. and European economies are showing signs of strength, but the rest of the world remains challenged. In addition, foreign exchange volatility will continue to be with us into 2016. We have navigated through periods like this before, and we will continue to run the company for growth, both on the top and bottom line as well as balancing our investments with astute expense management.
So as we look at full year 2016, our underlying business fundamentals remain strong. However, we expect to be at the low end of our 3-year performance objectives due to current FX levels relative to where they were back in September, when we first developed these objectives. These objectives already included some level of local FX headwinds, though they are now expected to be higher than what we assumed in September. And I know as you model all your numbers on an as-reported basis, you need to adjust for the impact of our euro and Brazilian real functional translation. And at current rates, that results in a 2 ppt headwind on net revenue growth and a 3 ppt headwind to bottom line growth.
For 2016, let me call out a few additional items that you should also consider. For rebates and incentives, we expect to see slightly lower growth this year than the 20% as-reported growth rate that we saw in 2015, which is much different than what we see in some of your current models. 
On expenses, just a couple of comments. You just heard Ajay talk about putting money into our growth areas. Well, for 2015, that was focused on a number of acquisitions. With that integration process well underway, this year, we will accelerate our investments in digital, certain geographies such as China as well as in safety and security. Also, in last year's first quarter, we had $40 million of FX gains in the G&A line associated with the events in Venezuela that are not expected to recur this year.  As a result, you should expect our total operating expense growth to increase in the high single-digit range. 
Now having said that, as you all know, we always plan our investments with a certain degree of flexibility, depending on the market or macroeconomic environment. We're already prepared with contingency plans to adjust expenses should the need to course-correct be necessary.
In the other expense line, interest expense associated with the euro-denominated debt that we issued last November adds roughly $10 million to our normal underlying run rate of roughly $15 million per year -- per quarter. So this is $15 million per quarter.
You should assume a roughly similar tax rate for 2016 as the 30% normalized rate I just spoke about for 2015.
And finally, we realized that it's becoming more difficult for many of you to model our business as FX rates continue to move around. We're thinking about how to make this entire topic more transparent, so stay tuned on this.
Now let me turn the call back to Barbara to begin the Q&A session. Barbara?"

So first of all, when you look at the objectives from 2013 to 2015, you have to start with the base in 2012, right?

And the base in 2012 are basically actual numbers adjusted for only one line item, which was the tax line item and basically, our special tax benefits that are not expected to be repeated. So that's the $2.14. When you walk to 2015, what we did do is you have to adjust for foreign exchange, for the euro and the BRL, because that is -- we do our performance objectives on an FX-adjusted basis. So you put basically back in $0.21 on top of the EPS that we print, right? So you start with an EPS of $3.35. You add in the special items of $0.08, which is $3.43. You add back the foreign exchange, which is $0.21. You're adding back the acquisitions, and you're adding back these onetime tax items, all of which we called out, which gets you to the $3.62. And when you do the differential between the $2.14 to the $3.62, you're getting actually that 19.2% compounded annual growth rate. So that is the history. Now let me focus on 2015 and going forward, so for the 2016 to 2018 financial objectives. 2015, you're not starting with the $3.62 because that is an FX-adjusted number. Of course, we're going to have to start with a real number, with an actual number, right? So you start again with the $3.35. That's exactly our as-reported number in the financials. You adjust for that for the special items, which is the $0.08, so you're going to $3.43. And then you're putting in -- and then you're taking out the tax items, $0.31 of that, and that's how you get to $3.12. So you're on actual FX rates for the starting point. You adjust it for the special item, and you adjust this for the special tax items. That's how you get to the $3.12, which is the basis upon which we calculate our future EPS performance."

So look, I don't think that China's wins were fatal of these single-branded cards and the like. They all take time to build their numbers.

They're either going to greater China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, a lot of that. Today, they're going more Japan as an example. Japan's actually seen a surge of 115% in tourist arrivals from China compared to the prior year. So the kind of that direction and location is changing. Domestic spending is certainly impacted in China. I was in China last weekend. You could see it there. So I don't know that merely bidding a few more deals will change the nature of revenue growth trajectory in China over the course of one year. Over the course of a couple of years, absolutely, it can help. But I wouldn't assume that China's revenue growth will be exactly as it used to be, just given the amount of economic change that's going on in that country."

Banks are clearly worried about the impact of their revenue stream. They're clearly looking at ways to make up that either through fees or through other methods. Clearly, merchants with a lower cost of acceptance should be willing more to accept electronic payments than they used to. As you know, Europe is a relatively under-penetrated market on electronic payments compared to its sophistication as a destination. And so there's a lot of opportunity there as well.

I -- my view of what's going on with cross-border right now is that -- the fact is that tourism around the world did get impacted in the fourth quarter of last year. There's no doubt that when the Parisian terrorist attacks happened, it impacted France for a while. There's no doubt that went the Egyptian plane went down, it impacted tourism into that area. And so that's just reality. A lot of these tend to bounce back over time. Paris did come back, not exactly to the level that it was growing at. Remember, Paris is the world's #1 tourist destination, the world's #1. And so I -- cross-border, some portion of it comes from tourism. Some portion of the comes from corporate travel. Some portion of it comes from e-commerce. And these different elements have been impacted differently by the way the world has seen its geopolitical circumstances over the last 2, 3, 4 months. That's why I think our numbers are still running even at 12% in the first 21 days of this year. And they're not going higher or lower, it's kind of where we are. We're sitting there. I'm going to watch that very carefully because it does impact my revenue. Sort of every transaction and sort of many other things with cross-border is a politically interesting part of it. And so we'll watch it carefully. And that's part of the reason why we believe that in 2016, one of the reasons where we're saying, take a look at us being at the low end of our revenue guidance to you for the 3-year period, is all these factors are inside that thinking of our budget for the year."

Okay. So I -- first of all, my belief is that this thing is going through its cycle. 4, 5 years ago, the conversation was that the mobile payment operators will be able to create their own payment systems because they had both consumers and an e-mail, voice mail, phone connectivity with millions and billions of consumers. Why would they need anybody else to provide? As you saw over time, we've now got 50 of those M&Ls around the world signed up as our partners. And some of them, in fact, we went into JVs with, that have done well, others that have not done so well. That's actually one of the write-downs that Martina was referring to. So over time, they're going to invest in different directions. Some of them will do well, some of them will not. And a couple of those haven't done as well as we'd like to. My general sense is the mobile network-operated payment system for person to merchant has yet to prove itself in scale in any marketplace at all. For person-to-person payments, there's a little more going on. Okay. So I think that's a bit of a challenge on where those are going. I think on known mobile network operators, that's to say hardware-based Samsung and Apple, Google, there's some interesting new developments, as you have seen with contactless payments and in-app payments. I don't know yet that browser-based payments will go where with that bunch of digital giants. And remember, browser is the largest portion of digital payments today. And frankly, out 3 to 4 years, it will still be overwhelmingly the large percentage of digital payments. So that's another one to be part through. I do think that the biggest conversation that's going on in digital is the safety and security of those transactions. And a lot of our effort and energy has therefore gone into tokenization not just for MasterPass, for our banks and merchants, but even for -- not just new transactions, but even for cards on file. Because frankly, with EMV in the U.S., where do you think fraud will migrate to? It's going to migrate to online. And that's what happened in every country around the world. So our focus there is not just in solving band aids with EMV, it's on making the whole payment system more secure over time. That's why tokenization is key. And a large amount of our investment and those of our competitors is going into that space. That's why we agreed on industry standard for tokenization, so there shouldn't be a friction between banks and merchants on which standard to work with. So you're going to see a lot of energy and effort in that space. And I think the other piece that will cover the play on digital will be the intelligence that will drive the capability of banks and merchants to drive better transactions, better relationships with their consumers. That's why we have put on services and analytics. So you kind of -- that's what I think about digital. I think of it as a big opportunity, but 85% of the world's transactions are still in cash. There's a lot of space out here. And then there's -- it's about existing competitors in the payment system, whether to say domestic debit scheme in a country or it's a larger competitor or it's a China UnionPay or anybody else, my view is there's a lot of space here. We've gotta get off of the 85%. We can all grow in there and still have a pretty good run rate for this industry for some years to come."

So for the services business, yes, I tried to give you a few points back in September at the Investor Day saying that our core business is substantially 75% of the company. And the services business is about 25% of the company. All of those growth explorations that we have in services, and you can actually see in the other revenue line where we have most of the services in there, it grows very, very fast. All of those expectations are actually embedded in our overall net revenue guidance. So I'm not splitting for your part in terms of what our core business versus the services business does. The other thing that we said in September, and I have no different expectations at this point in time, is that the services business, while it's lower in margin than what we have today, than what we have in our core business, that we do believe that over time, there will be some margin improvement in the services business."

Where it's more tech-intensive, it's more like our core business. Where it's more people-intensive, it's a lower-margin business. And therefore, as you build up a volume and scale on top of those businesses, you get better revenue and better margins out of them. That's what they're doing. In fact, our advisers consulting business, with 6 years that I've been in the company, I have seen Martina work it with the team there on improving the margin of that business through better utilization of people, lower downtime of consultants, creating centers of excellence, a series of steps that have been taken to improve that business. So that's the kind of thing that's underlying our commentary lower today on margin, but we have every expectation of continuing to improve that margin over time."

Yes. Next 1 year? No. So let me give you an example for Myanmar. Myanmar was handled -- once the government of the United States opened up its relationship with Myanmar, the removal of sanctions in Myanmar happened pretty quickly after that, and companies like us and our competitors were able to go in and begin to first enable ATM networks and then enable acceptance, and then we've enabled issuance in the country. We did all that because Myanmar has a relatively underdeveloped payment system. That entire thing is relatively slow. Now Iran, on the other hand, has a payment system domestically. Merchants do accept electronic payments already. It's not Myanmar in the form of being a completely cash economy. So if you could plug and play, you could probably get quicker results than in Myanmar, but the United States government is still to lift its sanctions. You just saw that the Iranian president came out and signed a fairly large set of deals on planes from Airbus, hasn't even signed anything at Boeing. That's all part of what's going on. There has to be a whole change in the sanctions regime that allows companies like us and our competitors and banks to operate freely in Iran. That has yet to be seen. So I would say Iran's more interesting because of a literate population with a relatively functioning electronic payment system. But until the sanctions actually get lifted, this is all very nice. But we can't do very much.
Okay. Questions done now? Right. Closing comments. So thank you all for those questions. Let me give you a couple of closing comments. You saw it come through what Martina and I was saying. We think we've navigated a tough economic environment this year, particularly the foreign exchange. And honestly, the local currency, Tien-tsin, to your question, that came at us even faster in the last 2, 3 months of the year. We mentioned in September about local currency. By the time December came around, it was a different picture. December itself was a different picture from November and October. That's how rapid the local currency movement, vis-a-vis the dollar has been. But you know what? We've navigated that and delivered strong results from a variety of perspectives: financially, volume, share growth, deals, innovation. 2016 looks similar to 2015. So we're going to stay very focused on executing our strategy. We're going to translate a defining role in the digital opportunity. We're going to keep trying to innovate for the future, grow revenues from both our core and our services business, and work really hard to manage our expenses so we create the space for us to invest in our future. And the payment space, I think, remains a great place to be at. Business continues to have strong momentum. We're going to keep pursuing profitable market share. We're going to keep trying to drive the conversion of cash to electronic payments around the world. I continue to believe that runway is an enormous runway of growth. We intend to maintain our leadership role in this industry effort in digital payment, in safety and security, in financial inclusion. And I'm quite confident we can run the company for growth, and we'll try to deliver on our 3-year objectives. I just appreciate your ongoing support for the company and for all of us, and thank you for joining us today."

Good morning, everybody. I'm very pleased that we were able to deliver strong results for both our fourth quarter and the full year performance, even with the mixed global economy. For the fourth quarter, after we adjust for the euro",1839,"Thank you, Barbara. Good morning, everybody. I'm very pleased that we were able to deliver strong results for both our fourth quarter and the full year performance, even with the mixed global economy. 
For the fourth quarter, after we adjust for the euro and the Brazilian real translations, we report net revenue growth of 9% and EPS growth of 22%, driven by solid underlying metrics. And for the full year, we saw net revenue growth of 8% and EPS growth of 18%, excluding special items. And most importantly, when you remove the impact of the functional currency translation that I just said for the euro and the Brazilian real but also for what we call local FX, which is the impact from other transactional currency pairs, our fourth quarter net revenue growth was 12%. And on that basis, for the full year, net revenue growth was almost 11%.
Moving on to the global economy. We continue to see challenges in many parts of the world. The U.S. economy seems the most resilient and got good growth in both consumer spending and jobs. In Europe, growth is expected to increase at the fastest pace since 2011, although this is at a lower level, driven by stronger domestic demand and exports. However, several big emerging market economies, China and Brazil being examples, are experiencing either weak or slowing growth and, of course, oil prices and their impact on oil-sensitive markets around the world, political instability, security concerns in some tourist destinations, these are all the concerns that they're careful watching. And we are globally connected as a company, and so what we've got to do is to work to successfully navigate through these challenges, exactly as we have in the past.
So with that backdrop, let's get into our business. Our business continues to grow, and our fundamentals remain strong. We saw double digit volume and transaction growth across all regions, except the U.S., which saw growth in the mid to high single digits. And additionally, our services businesses provide a nice complement to our volume-based core business and continue to show good growth. 
So moving on to a few highlights of the year and some of our recent business activity. Overall, I'd say 2015 was a year that had its economic challenges in that we also had to deal with foreign exchange volatility, and as I said earlier, not just in the euro and the Brazilian real, which are functional currencies, but in the other local transaction currency pairs as well. But despite all that, I think we have navigated these circumstances well, and we put significant points on the board as a result of our investments in digital payments, in safety and security as well as in financial inclusions.
And this year, we've talked about winning some significant customer deals. I've called out many of those in previous calls. But to cap off the year, let me mention a few that we had in the fourth quarter. So this past quarter, we renewed and we expanded our relationships with a number of our larger customers, including, in this case, Citigroup's commercial card portfolios in Asia-Pacific, in Europe and the United States; the HSBC Premier consumer credit business covering 28 markets around the world. In Italy, we signed a long-term debit agreement with Poste Italiane to migrate their Maestro cards to Debit MasterCard, but we also expanded our advisory services to help them drive financial inclusion and digital products for their customers.
In Russia, VTB24, which is the second largest bank and the card issuer in that country, is converting their debit card portfolio to MasterCard. And another example, we signed a long-term renewal with Qatar National Bank, one of the largest banks in the Arab world, for their debit card portfolio.
Turning to China. I have nothing new to report to you about the opening of the domestic market. That's still work in process. But we are executing on certain elements that have already been in the draft regulations such as building out our technology on the ground. Meanwhile, we are continuing to work with our Chinese customers as they themselves prepare for the next wave of payments growth as well as to expand into the digital space. So let me give you 2 or 3 examples to give you some color on what we are doing.
We've worked closely with both Bank of China and ICBC, and these are 2 of China's top 5 state-owned commercial banks. To launch their mobile payment products in China, they're utilizing our tokenization and cloud-based technologies for that.
While waiting for the new regulation, some banks are beginning to issue single-branded cards with international networks. In 2015, we have launched 32 single-branded programs in China, including 1 this past quarter with the Bank of Communications for their first single-branded EMV credit card. But they also utilize our card management products. Now what I mean by single-branded is that we are the only network brand on that card. There is no China UnionPay on that card. That's what single-branded means. 
Finally, we are also seeing more issuance of commercial card products. In the fourth quarter, we won new business with the Bank of Beijing and with the Agricultural Bank of China for their commercial card portfolios.
Now 2015 was a big year for us in the digital space. We're actually pleased with our progress with our MasterPass. We have launched in 13 new markets this year, in the fourth quarter, Japan, Sweden, Ireland, Slovakia, were the latest markets to go live. And that brings the total number of MasterPass markets to 29.
In 2015, we launched a total of 64 new MasterPass-enabled wallets, with some of the more recent additions being Axis Bank in India, NedBank in South Africa and the first wallet in Japan with UC Card. We're busy expanding acceptance with premier merchants representing the largest volume opportunities in the marketplace, and you've read about Walmart and Sam's Club, Staples, Zales, JetBlue, Barnes & Noble College, Crate and Barrel, et cetera, et cetera, all of whom are launching MasterPass in this coming year of 2016.
And on our third quarter earnings call, I have talked about the launch of the MasterCard Commerce for Every Device program to enable any consumer gadget, any accessory available, whatever, to become a payment device. And we also mentioned we were working with fashion designers, with automakers, with SmartBand developers. And last quarter, we announced our partnership with General Motors to integrate our Digital Enablement System into their OnStar platform and actually continuing to build on that momentum because this month, earlier at the Consumer Electronics Show, along with Samsung, we announced Groceries by MasterCard. That's basically a new app that allows consumers to order groceries directly from their new Family Hub refrigerator.
We've also announced the partnership with Coin. That's the consumer electronics and financial software company that will help us bring MasterCard payments to a wide array of fitness bands like those from Atlas Wearables or Moov or smartwatches from Omate and other wearable devices.
While none of these is expected to be big on their own, it kind of demonstrates the breadth of the opportunity in digital payments and our engagement to that opportunity as every device over the next 2 years begins to enable commerce.
Another area of focus for us in 2015 was safety and security. There have been some big moves in the space, including significant progress in the U.S. EMV migration. And even though the industry was slightly short of its forecast of 50% of issued credit and debit cards being chip-enabled by the end of the year, they were pretty close, and volume from chip-enabled cards continues to grow. We still expect almost all U.S. cards to be upgraded before the end of 2017. And merchants are continuing to enable new terminals, and ATMs are being upgraded as well, so this is kind of work in process but in the right direction. 
Looking beyond the U.S., we deployed a number of security solutions from tokenization to self e-pay, to something called SafetyNet. And SafetyNet is our real-time fraud solution. What it does, it detects and acts upon threats globally across all products, all channels, that's point of sales and ATM, and it's a great example of how we are leveraging the unique capability of our global network and analytical capability. It can identify, isolate and stop cyber-attacks often before the bank is even aware of them. And as a result now, more than 80% of our issuers around the world are now using SafetyNet as a service from us. That's an example of the kinds of products we are building in our services business, which is, as you know, advisers, consulting, information services. But all these safety and security products and loyalty and rewards are all a part of this services effort that we're putting into place. 
So last year, as part of our financial inclusion efforts, we signed about 600 new government programs, including, I think, some very innovative ones. The example of the Egyptian government comes to mind, where we're going to extend financial services to more than 54 million Egyptians by linking their national digital ID, something the government is issuing, to a mobile wallet to receive government benefits, employer [ph] payroll as well as our P2P capabilities across all banks and all telcos, by the way. It's a countrywide effort.
And finally, we've worked through various regulatory challenges, including being the first network to migrate domestic card transactions to the new Russian NSPK switch as well as implementing the new European payment regulations.
So that's 2015, some business wins, something about what we're doing in digital and MasterPass, what we're up to in services and safety and security and the work in financial inclusion, kind of the backdrop behind the revenue numbers I gave you. But looking forward, 2016, we expect this year to be similar to what we saw in 2015. In terms of complex environment, I consider that currency will remain a challenge over the course of the year. The dollar is going to keep strengthening. But our plan is to stay focused on executing our strategy to displace cash, to play a defining role in digital and innovate for the future, and that means expanding our services businesses as well. We will grow our processing capabilities, so we can see more transactions that then enable us to provide greater insights through analytics as well as providing robust safety and security solutions, so we can offer better protection for our cardholders, for merchants and for our issuing bank partners.
We are going to continue to pursue profitable market share while diversifying our revenues. At the same time, I think you'll find us continue to work hard to manage our expenses, so we can allocate more resources to these growth areas. 
And with that, I'm going to turn it over to Martina for an update on our financial results and operational metrics. Martina?"
6477196,320074166,923837,"MasterCard Incorporated, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 29, 2016",2016-01-29,"Earnings Calls","Mastercard Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Ajay, and good morning, everyone. As you just heard, despite strong FX headwinds, we closed out the quarter well. Let me give you some highlights on the fourth quarter, starting with Page 3, where you can see the difference between as-reported and",1774,"Thanks, Ajay, and good morning, everyone. As you just heard, despite strong FX headwinds, we closed out the quarter well. Let me give you some highlights on the fourth quarter, starting with Page 3, where you can see the difference between as-reported and FX-adjusted growth rates.
So EPS growth was 14% or 22% after adjusting for currency. Continued revenue momentum, good cost control, executing on our tax strategies and repurchasing shares all contributed to that performance. Acquisitions that we made in 2014 and 2015 drove $0.03 of EPS dilution in the quarter.
Included in our Other Income and Expense line was $83 million of impairment charges predominantly related to some of our very early investments in mobile. A number of these investments have performed well, while others have not met our expectations.
Next, our tax rate of 13.1% in the quarter was more favorable than we expected due to the benefits that resulted from the impact of settlements with tax authorities related to the tax audits that I have mentioned as a possibility at our Investor Day last September. Share repurchases contributed $0.02 per share to our fourth quarter results. As of January 22, we have $4.2 billion remaining under our current authorization.
Lastly, cash flow from operations was $1 billion. We ended the current quarter with cash, cash equivalents and other liquid investments of about $6.7 billion.
So let me turn to Page 4, where you can see the operational metrics for the fourth quarter. Our worldwide gross dollar volume or GDV was up 12% on a local currency basis, down 1 ppt from last quarter. Overall, our U.S. GDV grew 8%, made up of credit and debit growth of 9% and 8%, respectively. Total U.S. GDV had a continued almost 2 ppt headwind from lower gas prices. 
Outside of the U.S, volume growth was 14% on a local currency basis, down 2 ppt versus last quarter, with mid-teens growth in each region. And on cross-border volume, we grew 12% on a local currency basis, lower than the 16% we saw in the third quarter, primarily driven by the political instability and economic conditions around the world as well as the lapping of some recent wins in Europe and Canada.
Turning to Page 5. Here, you can see global processed transaction growth was 12%, the same as what we saw in the third quarter. We continue to see double-digit growth in all regions outside of the U.S. And globally, the number of cards grew 7%, with 2.3 billion MasterCard and Maestro-branded cards issued.
Now let's turn to Page 6 for some highlights on a few of the revenue line items. Net revenue growth was 4% as reported or 9% FX-adjusted given currency headwinds. Additionally, the impact of local currency exchange rates was higher than we expected, more than 3 ppt, driven by currencies such as the Venezuelan bolivar and the Canadian dollar. After eliminating both currency impacts, our underlying net revenue growth was about 12%.
Rebates and incentives were slightly higher than we expected due to the timing of some deal in the works. And acquisitions contributed about 2 ppt to net revenue growth, up slightly from the 1 ppt we saw last quarter.
Looking quickly at the individual line items -- revenue line items on an FX-adjusted basis. Domestic assessments grew 10%, while worldwide GDV grew 12%. This 2 ppt gap is primarily due to the impact of local currency, somewhat offset by pricing. Cross-border volume fees grew 13%, while cross-border volume grew 12%. Of the 1 ppt gap, the majority is due to a higher mix of intra-Europe activity, some local currency impact and lower inbound U.S. cross-border volume, essentially offset by pricing. Transaction processing fees grew 13%, primarily driven by the 12% growth in processed transactions. Finally, other revenue grew 26%, driven primarily by advisers as well as our APT and TNS acquisitions.
Moving on to Page 7. You can see that total operating expenses increased 1% in the quarter or 4% on an FX-adjusted basis. This growth was essentially all driven by M&A activities as we focused on integrating the acquisitions we made in 2014 and '15.
So you can see the underlying expense growth was essentially flat from last year. The non-recurrence of a significant severance charge in last year's fourth quarter was offset by several factors, including additional personnel expense as a result of our investment in strategic growth areas; higher processing costs due to both more transactions across our network as well as the fees paid to NSPK for processing domestic Russian transactions; and lower foreign currency-related gains versus the prior year.
Let me turn to Slide 8. And here, we can discuss what we've seen in January through the 21st. Most of our business drivers are a bit higher or similar to what we experienced in the fourth quarter. So here are the numbers through January 21. Starting with processed volume, we saw global growth of 14%, up 2 ppt from the fourth quarter. In the U.S., our processed volume grew 13%, up almost 4 ppt from the fourth quarter, with higher growth in both credit and debit. Gas had a 1 ppt negative impact on our January growth compared to the almost 2 ppt drag in the fourth quarter.
Processed volume outside the U.S. grew 16%, the same as the fourth quarter, with double-digit growth in each region. Globally, processed transaction growth was 13%, up slightly from the 12% we saw in the fourth quarter. And growth outside the U.S. slowed just a bit primarily due to the lapping of some business wins as well as the slowdown in Brazil. U.S. growth was up 2 ppt, driven by improvements in both credit and debit. And with respect to cross-border, our volumes grew at 12% globally. That's the same that we saw in the fourth quarter.
Now let me start out talking about our long-term performance objectives, which, as you know, exclude the translation impact of our euro and Brazilian real functional currencies. On that basis, for the 2013 to 2015 period, net revenue growth was 10.5%, close to the low end of the range. Beyond the euro and the Brazilian real, we experienced extremely strong foreign exchange headwinds from the other local currency pairs that Ajay just referenced, which resulted in about 2 ppt impact to our compound annual growth rate. Therefore, the underlying net revenue growth for this period was over 12%.
We achieved our margin commitments and delivered a 19.2% compound annual growth for EPS over the period, excluding the tax benefits we saw in the fourth quarter of 2015. Again, when I exclude the impact from those local currency pairs, the EPS CAGR was over 20%.
Now let's move on to our 2016 to 2018 performance objectives, which are net revenue CAGR of low double digits, operating margin of at least 50% and an EPS CAGR in the mid-teens. Remember, these objectives are on a constant currency basis and exclude any new M&A activities. Going forward, you should be using a pro forma 2015 EPS figure of $3.12 as the starting point for the 3-year EPS CAGR calculation. This pro forma number is calculated based on a normalized 2015 tax rate of 30.4%, which adjusts for several onetime tax benefits. The largest of these is from the significantly favorable outcome of some tax audits that concluded late in 2015. And consistent with the methodology we have used in the past, it also excludes the impact of special items.
As you've heard from Ajay, we expect 2016 to be a continuation of 2015. The U.S. and European economies are showing signs of strength, but the rest of the world remains challenged. In addition, foreign exchange volatility will continue to be with us into 2016. We have navigated through periods like this before, and we will continue to run the company for growth, both on the top and bottom line as well as balancing our investments with astute expense management.
So as we look at full year 2016, our underlying business fundamentals remain strong. However, we expect to be at the low end of our 3-year performance objectives due to current FX levels relative to where they were back in September, when we first developed these objectives. These objectives already included some level of local FX headwinds, though they are now expected to be higher than what we assumed in September. And I know as you model all your numbers on an as-reported basis, you need to adjust for the impact of our euro and Brazilian real functional translation. And at current rates, that results in a 2 ppt headwind on net revenue growth and a 3 ppt headwind to bottom line growth.
For 2016, let me call out a few additional items that you should also consider. For rebates and incentives, we expect to see slightly lower growth this year than the 20% as-reported growth rate that we saw in 2015, which is much different than what we see in some of your current models. 
On expenses, just a couple of comments. You just heard Ajay talk about putting money into our growth areas. Well, for 2015, that was focused on a number of acquisitions. With that integration process well underway, this year we will accelerate our investments in digital, certain geographies such as China as well as in safety and security. Also, in last year's first quarter, we had $40 million of FX gains in the G&A line associated with the events in Venezuela that are not expected to recur this year. As a result, you should expect our total operating expense growth to increase in the high single-digit range. 
Now having said that, as you all know, we always plan our investments with a certain degree of flexibility, depending on the market or macroeconomic environment. We're already prepared with contingency plans to adjust expenses should the need to course-correct be necessary.
In the other expense line, interest expense associated with the euro-denominated debt that we issued last November adds roughly $10 million to our normal underlying run rate of roughly $15 million per year -- per quarter. So this is $15 million per quarter.
You should assume a roughly similar tax rate for 2016 as the 30% normalized rate I just spoke about for 2015.
And finally, we realized that it's becoming more difficult for many of you to model our business as FX rates continue to move around. We're thinking about how to make this entire topic more transparent, so stay tuned on this.
Now let me turn the call back to Barbara to begin the Q&A session. Barbara?"

So first of all, when you look at the objectives from 2013 to 2015, you have to start with the base in 2012, right?

And the base in 2012 are basically actual numbers adjusted for only one line item, which was the tax line item and basically, our special tax benefits that are not expected to be repeated. So that's the $2.14. When you walk to 2015, what we did do is you have to adjust for foreign exchange, for the euro and the BRL, because that is -- we do our performance objectives on an FX-adjusted basis. So you put basically back in $0.21 on top of the EPS that we print, right? So you start with an EPS of $3.35. You add in the special items of $0.08, which is $3.43. You add back the foreign exchange, which is $0.21. You're adding back the acquisitions, and you're adding back these onetime tax items, all of which we called out, which gets you to the $3.62. And when you do the differential between the $2.14 to the $3.62, you're getting actually that 19.2% compounded annual growth rate. So that is the history. Now let me focus on 2015 and going forward, so for the 2016 to 2018 financial objectives. 2015, you're not starting with the $3.62 because that is an FX-adjusted number. Of course, we're going to have to start with a real number, with an actual number, right? So you start again with the $3.35. That's exactly our as-reported number in the financials. You adjust for that for the special items, which is the $0.08, so you're going to $3.43. And then you're putting in -- and then you're taking out the tax items, $0.31 of that, and that's how you get to $3.12. So you're on actual FX rates for the starting point. You adjust it for the special item, and you adjust this for the special tax items. That's how you get to the $3.12, which is the basis upon which we calculate our future EPS performance."

Japan's actually seen a surge of 115% in tourist arrivals from China compared to the prior year. So the kind of that direction and location is changing. Domestic spending is certainly impacted in China. I was in China last week and you could see it there. So I don't know that merely winning a few more deals will change the nature of revenue growth trajectory in China over the course of one year. Over the course of a couple of years, absolutely, it can help. But I wouldn't assume that China's revenue growth will be exactly as it used to be, just given the amount of economic change that's going on in that country."

It's all about the analytics that gets created and the transactions we see. So those are the kinds of investments that we think we should be making in 2016. But Martina, as we talked to our business people in the company, you will hear from them that Martina is a relatively painful person because she tracks it by quarter. And then she alluded to her astute expense management that's otherwise called a gatekeeper.

But frankly, I would tell you this, the conversation about the impact on banks, the impact on merchants, the likely impact on acceptance. That conversation has been going on from the day when the regulations are being contemplated. So there's nothing new to tell you from what we've discussed earlier. Banks are clearly worried about the impact of their revenue stream. They're clearly looking at ways to make up that either through fees or through other methods. Clearly, merchants with a lower cost of acceptance should be willing more to accept electronic payments than they used to. As you know, Europe is a relatively under-penetrated market on electronic payments compared to its sophistication as a destination. And so there's a lot of opportunity there as well. And then there are all these local schemes that are relooking at that context given the digital change and the investment that's required to upgrade themselves to digital.

And I've seen 12%, I've seen 16% and up and down from there. I -- my view of what's going on with cross-border right now is that -- the fact is that tourism around the world did get impacted in the fourth quarter of last year. There's no doubt that when the Parisian terrorist attacks happened, it impacted France for a while. There's no doubt that went the Egyptian plane went down, it impacted tourism into that area. And so that's just reality. A lot of these tend to bounce back over time. Paris did come back, not exactly to the level that it was growing at. Remember, Paris is the world's #1 tourist destination, the world's #1. And so I -- cross-border, some portion of it comes from tourism. Some portion of the comes from corporate travel. Some portion of it comes from e-commerce. And these different elements have been impacted differently by the way the world has seen its geopolitical circumstances over the last 2, 3, 4 months. That's why I think our numbers are still running even at 12% in the first 21 days of this year. And they're not going higher or lower, it's kind of where we are. We're sitting there. I'm going to watch that very carefully because it does impact my revenue. So does every transaction and so does many other things, but cross-border is a politically interesting part of it. And so we'll watch it carefully. And that's part of the reason why we believe that in 2016, one of the reasons why we're saying, take a look at us being at the lower end of our revenue guidance to you for the 3-year period, is all these factors are inside that thinking of our budget for the year."

So I was wondering if you could just help frame the public conversations, specifically with respect to what you're seeing in terms of internal opportunities, and also if you can share your views on its perception as an external threat?"

So I -- first of all, my belief is that this thing is going through its cycle. 4, 5 years ago, the conversation was that the mobile payment operators would be able to create their own payment systems because they had both consumers",616,"Digital overall? Okay. So I -- first of all, my belief is that this thing is going through its cycle. 4, 5 years ago, the conversation was that the mobile payment operators would be able to create their own payment systems because they had both consumers and an e-mail, voice mail, phone connectivity with millions and billions of consumers. Why would they need anybody else to provide? As you saw over time, we've now got 50 of those M&Ls [ph] around the world signed up as our partners. And some of them, in fact, we went into JVs with, that have done well, others that have not done so well. That's actually one of the write-downs that Martina was referring to. Several times, they're going to invest in different directions. Some of them will do well, some of them will not. And a couple of those haven't done as well as we'd like to. My general sense is the mobile network-operated payment system for person to merchant has yet to prove itself in scale in any marketplace at all. For person-to-person payments, there's a little more going on. Okay. So I think that's a bit of a challenge on where those are going. I think on known mobile network operators, that's to say hardware-based Samsung and Apple, Google, there's some interesting new developments, as you have seen with contactless payments and in-app payments. I don't know yet that browser-based payments will go where with that bunch of digital giants. And remember, browser is the largest portion of digital payments today. And frankly, out 3 to 4 years, it will still be overwhelmingly the large percentage of digital payments. So that's another one to be part through. I do think that the biggest conversation that's going on in digital is the safety and security of those transactions. And a lot of our effort and energy has therefore gone into tokenization not just for MasterPass, for our banks and merchants, but even for -- not just new transactions, but even for cards on file. Because frankly, with EMV in the U.S., where do you think fraud will migrate to? It's going to migrate to online. And that's what happened in every country around the world. So our focus there is not just in solving band aids with EMV, sort of making the whole payment system more secure over time. That's why tokenization is key. And a large amount of our investment and those of our competitors is going into that space. That's why we agreed on industry standard for tokenization, so there shouldn't be a friction between banks and merchants on which standard to work with. So you're going to see a lot of energy and effort in that space. And I think the other piece that will cover the play on digital will be the intelligence that will drive the capability of banks and merchants to drive better transactions, better relationships with their consumers. And that's why we have put on services and analytics. So you kind of -- that's what I think about digital. I think of it as a big opportunity, but 85% of the world's transactions are still in cash. There's a lot of space out here. And then there's -- it's the same view I have about existing competitors in the payment system, whether it's a domestic debit scheme in a country or it's a larger competitor or it's a China UnionPay or anybody else, my view is there's a lot of space here. We've got to get after the 85%. We can all grow in there and still have a pretty good run rate for this industry for some years to come."

And I said with 2016, it will be just a little lower than that 20%, okay? So that's a growth rate, and it's the 20% that you saw in 2015. By the way, that's an as reported number. So for the services business, yes, I tried to give you a few points back in September at the Investor Day saying that our core business is substantially 75% of the company. And the services business is about 25% of the company. All of those growth aspirations that we have in services, and you can actually see in the other revenue line where we have most of the services in there, it grows very, very fast. All of those expectations are actually embedded in our overall net revenue guidance. So I'm not splitting for you apart in terms of what our core business versus the services business does. The other thing that we said in September, and I have no different expectations at this point in time, is that the services business, while it's lower in margin than what we have today, than what we have in our core business, that we do believe that over time, there will be some margin improvement in the services business."

Where it's more tech-intensive, it's more like our core business. Where it's more people-intensive, it's a lower-margin business. And therefore, as you build up a volume and scale on top of those businesses, you get better revenue and better margins out of them. That's what they're doing. In fact, our advisers consulting business, in 6 years that I've been in the company, I have seen Martina working with the team there on improving the margin of that business through better utilization of people, lower downtime of consultants, creating centers of excellence, a series of steps that have been taken to improve that business. So that's the kind of thing that's underlying our commentary lower today on margin, but we have every expectation of continuing to improve that margin over time."

Yes. Next 1 year? No. So let me give you an example for Myanmar. Myanmar was handled -- once the government of the United States opened up its relationship with Myanmar, the removal of sanctions in Myanmar happened pretty quickly after that, and companies like us and our competitors were able to go in and begin to first enable ATM networks and then enable acceptance, and then we've enabled issuance in the country. We did all that because Myanmar has a relatively underdeveloped payment system. That entire thing is relatively slow. Now Iran, on the other hand, has a payment system domestically. Merchants do accept electronic payments already. It's not Myanmar in the form of being a completely cash economy. So if you could plug and play, you could probably get quicker results than in Myanmar, but the United States government is still to lift its sanctions. You just saw that the Iranian president came out and signed a fairly large set of deals on planes from Airbus, hasn't even signed anything at Boeing. That's all part of what's going on. There has to be a whole change in the sanctions regime that allows companies like us and our competitors and banks to operate freely in Iran. That has yet to be seen. So I would say Iran's more interesting because of a literate population with a relatively functioning electronic payment system. But until the sanctions actually get lifted, this is all very nice. But we can't do very much.
Okay. Questions done now? Right. Closing comments. So thank you all for those questions. Let me give you a couple of closing comments. You saw it come through what Martina and I were saying. We think we've navigated a tough economic environment this year, particularly the foreign exchange. And honestly, the local currency, Tien-tsin, to your question, that came at us even faster in the last 2, 3 months of the year. We mentioned in September about local currency. By the time December came around, it was a different picture. December itself was a different picture from November and October. That's how rapid the local currency movement, vis-a-vis the dollar has been. But you know what? We've navigated that and delivered strong results from a variety of perspectives: financially, volume, share growth, deals, innovation. 2016 looks similar to 2015. So we're going to stay very focused on executing our strategy. We're going to translate a defining role in the digital opportunity. We're going to keep trying to innovate for the future, grow revenues from both our core and our services business, and work really hard to manage our expenses so we create the space for us to invest in our future. And the payment space, I think, remains a great place to be at. Business continues to have strong momentum. We're going to keep pursuing profitable market share. We're going to keep trying to drive the conversion of cash to electronic payments around the world. I continue to believe that runway is an enormous runway of growth. We intend to maintain our leadership role in this industry effort in digital payment, in safety and security, in financial inclusion. And I'm quite confident we can run the company for growth, and we'll try to deliver on our 3-year objectives. I just appreciate your ongoing support for the company and for all of us, and thank you for joining us today."

Following comments from Ajay and Martina, the operator will announce your opportunity to get into the queue for the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] This morning's earnings release and the slide deck that will be referenced on this call can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at mastercard.com. The documents have also been attached to an 8-K that we filed with the SEC earlier this morning. A replay of this call will be posted on our website for 1 month.
Before we get started, I'd like to point out a change we have made around reporting the impact of currency on our business. As Martina mentioned on our last earnings call, we realized it has become more difficult for many of you to model our business as FX rates continue to move around. Therefore, beginning this quarter, instead of reporting FX-adjusted growth rates, which only reflected the transitional impact of 2 functional currencies, the euro and the Brazilian real, we are now reporting currency-neutral growth rates, which include both the impact from translating functional currencies into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes as well as the underlying impact of local currencies being converted into their functional currency. 
Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I need to remind everyone that today's call may include some forward-looking statements about MasterCard's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance are summarized at the end of our press release as well as contained in our recent SEC filings.
And now with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ajay."
6477196,329405740,965568,"MasterCard Incorporated, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Mastercard Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Barbara. Good morning, everybody. We're very pleased to deliver solid results this quarter, despite, I think, everybody would agree is an ongoing mixed global economic environment. On a currency-neutral basis, we reported net revenue growth of",2279,"Thank you, Barbara. Good morning, everybody. We're very pleased to deliver solid results this quarter, despite, I think, everybody would agree is an ongoing mixed global economic environment. On a currency-neutral basis, we reported net revenue growth of 14% and an EPS growth of 1%. But when you remove the impact of the nonrecurring discrete tax credit and the balance sheet remeasurement related to Venezuela in last year's first quarter, our EPS growth is 12%. 
Now let's take a look at the global economy earnings, and I think it's largely unchanged from what we discussed last quarter with the U.S. economy remaining solid, with inflation and wages growing at a similar pace and the unemployment rate kind of holding steady at 5% with the unemployment rate numbers coming out this morning as well. However, as we know from the Fed comments yesterday, uncertainty remains about when they might take action as well as the potential impact from the global economy. 
So the rest of the world, the economic outlook continues to be mixed. In Europe, both consumer confidence and economic sentiment declined slightly this quarter. However, recent stimulus measures by the European Central Bank and steady improvement in the unemployment rate, I think should continue to drive growth across the region, particularly in the U.K. and Germany. Asia is still challenged by the continued slowdown in China. Consumer confidence remains cloudy, with the exception being India, where both consumer and business sentiment remain high. 
In Latin America, Brazil still the worst recession in the country's history. And of course, economic conditions in Venezuela, particularly further. But Mexico is stable and seems to be driven by solid consumer spending and declining inflation. 
So none of these surprises us, but it does seem that it will likely remain period of economic uncertainty. And so that said, we've continued to work hard to ensure that our business maintains its strong growth trajectory, and we think double-digit volume and transaction growth across most of our markets. In addition, we're benefiting from the successful integration of our recent acquisitions and continuing to grow our services business. As I told Barbara yesterday, at this time, steady as she goes is what our focus is. 
So now let's move on to some of our recent business activity. During the quarter, we signed a number of new deals and renewals, supporting the expansion of our business around the world. I want to give you a few examples. In Europe, we extended our contract in Nordia, which is the largest bank in the Nordics, for their consumer credit and their commercial card portfolios, and we added the rollout of MasterPass and inControl with them. Same in Europe, we also renewed and extended our contract with the SGV, the largest banking group in Martina's home country of Germany for their credit business. We also included the rollout of MasterPass. 
Further, we added a new debit portfolio with Unicredit, a leading European financial group based in Italy. In Asia, we just recently renewed and expanded our contracts with both Mitsubishi U.S., which is one of the largest issuers in the region, for their consumer and their commercial credit business. And with Maybank, the largest bank in Malaysia, for their credit and debit business. 
And finally, I want to talk a little bit of an example of working with a number of our merchant partners. And I'm going to give you a specific example. This one is at McDonalds. We've talked in previous calls about a partnership with them and that most East now in South Africa as well. The McDonald's leveraging MasterPass to simplify the ordering process as well as utilizing contactless functionality at their restaurants. Of course, the idea is to improve the drive-through and the dining experience. 
But our McDonalds partnership actually has now gone beyond the core business. There also a customer of Applied Predictive Technologies, or APT, the cloud-based data and analytics company that we acquired last May. McDonald's used APT's software to analyze a variety of strategic initiatives, including new food and menu items, determining which items should be on the menu and other business priorities. And this is one of the many examples of value we can provide to our merchant partners. When you combine products that we have with the data analytics that we are capable of analyzing with them.
So next, I'd like to give you an update on how we're advancing our strategy in the digital payment space. And I'm going to start with MasterPass. So here, and we're making great progress with our digital-by-default strategy. That's about enabling issuers to auto-enroll cardholders onto the MasterPass platform without any additional effort having to be made by the consumer. We're looking forward to announcing some bank partners who will be leveraging this ability in the near future. And as we continue to drive new acceptance from MasterPass as well, we're closing in on signing up about 270,000 merchants, representing more than 160 billion in addressable volume. 
Earlier this month, Vodafone Egypt migrated nearly 2 million Vodafone cash wallets from their closed-loop system to our mobile payment gateway platform. That enables us to process all their transactions. This migration built in a goal of creating an interoperable network across the Egyptian mobile payment ecosystem that I spoke into an earlier call and helps to drive our strategy of financial inclusion and, of course, accelerate the conversion of cash. 
And then moving onto MasterCard digital enablement service or MDES. We continue to make significant progress around making digital transaction both secure while encryption and tokenization. In Asia, we are pleased to now have more than 30 issuers signed up for the MDES service. We also launched the first NSC-based wallet in Latin America, with in Mexico, utilizing our cloud-based payment technology. And by the way, this wallet, the one [ph] was created by developers from our C-SAM acquisition, which actually gave us access to a very talented pool of engineers who are enabling us to build our capabilities for issuers and merchants exactly like the example of Citi. 
And finally, we continue to support our digital partners by helping Android Pay launch in the U.K. and both Samsung Pay and Apple Pay are expanding to Singapore. We're also pleased to be partnering with Facebook as they leverage MDES to desk tokenization by enabling pilot participants to interact with sellers and advertisers directly on the platform to complete their purchases, all without ever having to leave the Facebook app. 
So moving on to safety and security. Me know that a lot of efforts from us and others going into the space. And as a result of successful biometric trials in the Netherlands and the U.S., that we announced last August, we're actually launching MasterCard Identity Check, fondly referred to as self e-pay in the U.S., Canada and parts of Europe this summer, with more countries to be announced soon. Much of the initial interest in Identity Check has come and been attached to the consumer side of these businesses. But interestingly, we are currently working with BMO Financial Group, that the Bank of Montréal, Canada, to roll out the first corporate credit card programs using self e-pay in both the U.S. and Canada. 
In addition, we recently launched IQ series. That's a suite of products which uses real-time intelligence to empower issuers to make more informed fraud management decisions as well as most importantly, potentially decrease the growing problem of false declines. Industry study are showing that 1 out of every 6 cardholders have experienced at least 1 decline because of suspected fraud in the past year. That, by the way, adds up to false declines of $118 billion a year or several times the actual amount of true card fraud. 
Next we worked with out issuers to deliver additional benefits to our cardholders and protect from fraud. As of 2 weeks ago, all MasterCard consumers and small business cardholders are now covered by the industry's first global around the world zero-liability promise, ensuring they're not responsible for any unauthorized charges. One of the topic of safety and security let's spend a minute on the status of EMV in the U.S. We now have about 67% of our consumer credit cards and 24% for our consumer debit cards with chips in them. Roughly 1.2 million U.S. merchant locations are now accepting these cards. And while that's good progress we're seeing across the industry also in our own numbers, everybody recognizes that checkout times at the terminal may appear longer when using a chip card. And to help address that concern, we announced an chip fast, which is to help speed EMV transactions. You leverage the capabilities of our existing contactless technology, which as you know, has been deployed in various applications around the world. Using that, cardholders will experience max time transaction speed, but with the added security of EMV and chip. At the same time, we're going to make this happen in collaboration with the industry, including other networks to look at how to bring a consistent approach to the market and best support the EMV checkout experience. And the point of all these examples is that people shop at all sorts of devices and through multiple channels. And they expect technology to simplify that process while keeping the transaction safe and secure. And I give you all these examples to demonstrate and reinforce our commitment to predicting every transaction. It doesn't matter whether it took place in the physical world or the digital world. We are committed to doing this.
So for the last several minutes talking to you how we've grown our business through a series of organic investments. And it's important to recognize we've also been growing our business by integrating the various acquisitions we made over the past few years, trying to expand our presence across the payment value chain. So let me give you a couple of examples across information services and processing. So let's start by information services, that business advisers. I mentioned APT earlier when I talked about McDonald's. One of the great things about that subscription-based business model is that it generates a recurring revenue stream with an average contract length of about 3 years. And since the acquisition, we've integrated the sales and product organizations of APT with advisers to drive some pretty good benefits. 
Let me give you an example. Since the acquisition, 30 organizations have subscribed to the APT platform in long-term contracts. And in addition to McDonald's that I talked about, I'll give you a few more. Asahi Breweries in Japan, Sunoco in the U.S. and in the U.K., KFC. We've also signed more than 15 new deals incremental to APT's earlier business-as-usual efforts. In other words, using MasterCard's client relationships and coverage, including, by the way, one of the largest airlines in Europe, one of the largest retailers in Brazil, 2 of the largest financial institutions in Asia and several in the U.S. What's exciting about all these deals is that they include expanding relationships with long-time APT clients who now also license newly created product modules, leveraging insights derived from MasterCard data. 
Finally, we launched APT Engage, which is a suite of products which leverages aggregated and anonymized MasterCard payment transaction data, combined with APT's proprietary analytics to help issuers and merchants better understand customer spending behavior high loyalty as well as planning for new retail locations. That's about information services.
On to processing. The idea there being to extend our capabilities beyond switching, getting the on authorizing clearing and settlement. Payment transaction services business, we signed a deal with BNP Paribas in Poland to provide issuer processing services which, by the way, has also enabled us to become one of the major third-party processors in the country. Here in the U.S., our year-old partnership with Green dot to process all of their debit and prepaid cards and has resulted in the successful migration of now approximately 50 million account files with another 50 million to over the balance of 2016. 
And lastly, in the same business, we enabled several transit operators in Turkey to begin using NSC capabilities of by processing contactless cards and thereby, allowing us to increase our share of domestic processed transactions. Same with processing, on the prepaid management services side, we just implemented a card program with British Airways to facilitate compensation payments, to BA passengers for delayed or canceled flights or lost luggage. We also launched the first dual-purpose travel insurance and multicurrency prepaid travel product with slight center, which is one of the large travel agencies. 
And lastly, the result of integrating our acquired assets into our payment gateway services business now able to offer products globally, which include integrated fraud and risk management solutions to both merchants and to acquirers. We're already seeing several new wins, including 4 new deals with key acquirers and resellers in Australia, India, Saudi Arabia, Singapore who can now offer these capabilities to their merchant base and in turn, helps us expand our footprint in these markets. We've also worked to ensure that our payment gateway provides acceptance of the latest digital payment methods. We now support both Apple Pay and Android Pay in addition to MasterPass. 
We all recognize these acquisitions require a certain amount of time, investment and resources to integrate. We worked very hard to ensure this happen seamlessly and efficiently. We're now clearly seeing the benefits come from them, both in our dialogues and in our engagements with our customers. 
So with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Martina for an update on our financial results and operational metrics. Martina?"
6477196,329405740,965568,"MasterCard Incorporated, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Mastercard Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Ajay, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by giving you some highlights on the first quarter, starting with Page 3, where you see the difference between as-reported and currency-neutral growth rates for this quarter. As Barbara explained at t",1516,"Thanks, Ajay, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by giving you some highlights on the first quarter, starting with Page 3, where you see the difference between as-reported and currency-neutral growth rates for this quarter. As Barbara explained at the start of this call, we have not changed how we report the impact of currency. So instead of reporting FX-adjusted growth rates, which only reflected the translational impact of the euro and the Brazilian real functional currencies, we are now reporting currency-neutral growth rates, which exclude all impacts of foreign exchange rates. This is both the impact from translating functional currencies into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes as well as the underlying impact of local currencies being converted into their functional currency. We hope that this change will make it easier for you to understand the underlying performance of our business. And all of my comments going forward will pertain to our new currency-neutral growth rates.
Net revenue growth was 14%. While operating expenses grew significantly, this was mostly due to the difference between FX hedging and balance sheet remeasurement gains that we had in the year-ago quarter versus foreign exchange losses on our hedging contracts in this quarter. I will talk more about this when we get into the detail of operating expenses. 
As expected, net income was also impacted by a higher tax rate than in the year-ago quarter due to the nonrecurrence of a discrete U.S. foreign tax credit from which we benefited in the first quarter of 2015. EPS was $0.86, up 1% year-over-year. But as Ajay said, it was impacted by $0.08 due to the discrete tax item that I just mentioned and the Venezuela balance sheet remeasurement gain in the year-ago quarter. When you exclude these 2 items, EPS grew 12%. 
Share repurchases contributed $0.03 per share. And as of April 21, we have $2.9 billion remaining under our current authorization. 
And lastly, cash flow from operations was $1 billion, and we ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalent and other liquid investments of about $6.2 billion.
So let me turn to Page 4 and here, you can see the operational metrics for the first quarter. Included in these numbers is a positive lift of about 1% due to leap day on all of our metrics. Our worldwide gross dollar volume or GDV growth was 13%. On a local-currency basis, it's about up 1 ppt from last quarter. Overall, our U.S. GDV grew 10%, made up of credit and debit growth of 11% and 8%, respectively. Total U.S. GDV have continued 1 ppt headwind from lower gas prices. 
Outside of the U.S., volume growth was 15% on a local-currency basis, also up about 1 ppt versus last quarter, with mid- to high-teens growth in each region, except Canada, which was impacted by the lapping of our Costco win. Cross-border volume grew 12% on a local-currency basis, and that's similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter.
Turning to Page 5. Processed transactions grew 14% globally to $12.6 billion, a 2 ppt increase from what we saw in the fourth quarter, with higher growth in all regions, except Canada, again, due to the lapping of our Costco win. Globally, the number of cards grew 7% with 2.3 billion MasterCard and Maestro-branded cards issued. 
Let me turn to Page 6 for highlights on a few of the revenue line items. Net revenue growth was 10% as reported or 14% on a currency-neutral basis, given currency headwinds. We saw strong volume and transaction growth, particularly in the U.S. and Europe, and some of which was due to the impact of leap year. Rebates and incentives was slightly higher than what we expected due to deal renewals. 
Looking quickly at the individual line -- revenue line items on a constant -- on a currency-neutral basis. Domestic assessments grew 13%, in line with worldwide GDV growth. Cross-border volume fees grew 14%, while cross-border volume grew 12%. The 2 ppt gap is due to a number of pricing actions, partially offset by a higher mix of intra-Europe activity. Transaction processing fees grew 18%, primarily driven by the 14% growth in processed transactions as well as some pricing. And finally, other revenues grew 22%, driven primarily by our APT acquisition and our safety and security product offerings.
Moving on to Page 7. Here, you can see that total operating expenses increased 25% in the quarter or 29% on a currency-neutral basis. Most of this increase is due to FX movements recorded in our G&A line. I mentioned on our last earnings call that we recorded a large amount of FX gains in the year-ago quarter, mostly due to onetime gains related to Venezuela. The absence of those gains, plus the unrealized losses we recorded this quarter on our FX hedging activity due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to year-end 2015, resulted in an almost $130 million increase to expenses. Excluding this and a 4 ppt impact from acquisitions, we did not have in the year-ago quarter, G&A grew 11% as a result of our continued investment in areas such as digital, data analytics and safety and security. The increase in depreciation and amortization expenses primarily due to the amortization of intangibles related to our acquisitions.
So now I'm going to turn to Slide 8. Let's discuss what we are seeing in April through the 21. While many of our business drivers are similar to the first quarter, direct comparisons to the first quarter are a bit difficult since it had the benefit of both leap day and Easter. The numbers through April 21 are as follows: Starting with processed volume, we saw global growth of 13%, the same as in the first quarter. In the U.S., our process volume grew 10%, down roughly 1 ppt from the first quarter, with slower growth in both credit and debit. Gas had less than 1 ppt negative impact on our April growth, down slightly from the first quarter impact. Process volume outside the U.S. grew 16%, up 1 ppt from the last quarter, with higher growth in most regions and primarily driven by Europe and Africa. Global process transaction growth was 14%, the same as we saw in the first quarter. Process transaction growth outside the U.S. was up a bit, with increases in AMEA and LAC while the U.S. growth was down almost 2 ppt due to slower growth in credit and debit. 
With respect to cross-border, our volumes grew at 11% globally, down 1 ppt from last quarter with slower growth in Europe, primarily due to the timing of Easter.
Let me start out with a quick comment about our long-term performance objectives for 2016 to '18, which excluded the impact from our 2 major functional currencies, the euro and the Brazilian real as well as excluded any new M&A activities. Since we are now making the change to recognize the impact of all foreign exchange on our business, we reviewed these objectives and determined that no change is required from what we issued previously because we had baked in very little local FX impact over the 3-year period. Therefore, our 2016 to '18 objectives remain as follows, but are now on a currency-neutral basis. Net revenue CAGR of low double digits; operating margin of at least 50%; and an EPS CAGR in the mid-teens and measured off a 2015 pro forma EPS CAGR of $3.12.
Now moving specifically to this year, there's really no change in our outlook for the business from what we discussed with you on our earnings call back in January. The U.S. and European economies are showing some sign of improvement, but the rest of the world remains challenged. In addition, FX headwinds will continue to be with us into 2016, although likely not as significant as 2015 given current FX rates. And our underlying business fundamentals remain strong. We will continue to run the company for growth, both on the top and on the bottom line as well as balancing our investments with astute expense management. 
As we look at full year 2016 and after factoring in our new currency-neutral methodology, we continue to expect to be at the low end of our 3-year revenue growth range. When you model on an as-reported basis, you will need to adjust for the impact of all currencies. And at the current rates, we estimate that it would mean about a 3 ppt headwind on net revenue growth and about a 4 ppt headwind to the bottom line. 
And let me call out a few other items that you should consider when modeling 2016. So for rebates and incentives, we continue to expect to see growth in the high teens, slightly lower than the 20% as-reported growth rate we saw in 2015. On expenses, we still expect total operating expense growth in the high single-digit range on an as-reported basis. And finally, you should assume a tax rate of slightly less than 30% for 2016. 
Now let me turn the call back to Barbara to begin the Q&A session. Barbara?"

So hopefully, by knowing the first quarter, you are able to charter the next 3 quarters for the year, given that we're giving guidance for the high single-digit number. In terms of operating leverage, what we have said when we looked at our business and we do that actually every year, that we feel very comfortable with an operating margin in excess of 50%. Remember, we are really running the business for revenue growth so for top line growth, which means that we are having to make a number of investments in -- on the OpEx side in order to generate the bottom line growth. So we are holding that as a metric.

And in truth, I think nobody actually knows. And I think and I said many times, it's going to take a few years for this to settle. That's why even companies like ours, in mobile, you've seen us place effort, energy, money bets in everything from whether the transaction data is on the handset or it's in the cloud, whether we're working with mobile network operators or hardware manufacturers or distributors that stuff. This whole mobile space whether it's such an evolving space. And I don't think anybody knows the answers. And I think what's going on even with the retailers. I think they're trying to find a way to offer a product and a wallet that their consumer can be connected to loyalty and not just that a digital player own that space. Also and not just let the banks own that space. The banks, by the way, are doing the same thing. They're trying to make sure they offer products that get the consumer loyal to them and not just let the digital player own that space or the merchant own that space, and of course, the digital players doing the same thing. So there are all doing right now. I don't think anybody knows the real answer. But I do believe in 2 or 3 underlying factors. The first one is we as a network, we believe that a focus on the person who wants the consumer relationship, in this case, the bank or the merchant because they are the ones who should be developing the loyalty with that consumer. People like us B2B, B2C company. We operate through them, and therefore, our role is to facilitate that and do it in a way that drives our business with them and enables our value-added services to be used. So we're very focused on going through them, whether it be through a Walmart or through a Citibank or through a different bank. The second rule that I think applies universally is that more consumer choice in tenders and payments is better than less. And I think that's just to reduce the friction. There's one large merchant in the United States who doesn't think that way. But otherwise, every other merchant around the world is keen to basically offer more tender choice to their consumer rather than less. So I think that's going to be even more important in the mobile world to reduce friction. And those kinds of rules apply. So my view of this, Jason, don't conclude too much yet, but be prepared to see many efforts going on in different places. I think the days of one model and only one big mobile network or one I say, one big mobile wallet or one big existed, those days are going away. There's going to be a lot of competition in that space with multiple tenders, with choice for consumers. And it's going to be interesting to watch when it settles."

And even though we saw a little bit of a weakening of the dollar for the first quarter, it's still at a very, very high level. So I think you will see all of that coming through this year, albeit at a lower level of impact than what we saw in 2015. In terms of reconciling it to competitors, that's a tough one. I mean, you have to ask them how they do the methodology. But I would presume that outside of Europe, we're seeing relatively similar trends.

It's just been announced by them that they're changing the terms of the manner in which the exact deals priced as well as the timing. I think over the next 2 or 3 months, we will see what that does in terms of how issuers are thinking. My senses it will make it easier for an issuer to know exactly what they're going to get paid from the exercise of the Port, and that will make it a little easier for them to comprehend what they're getting and what they're leaving behind if they make a decision. Which is in a sense, a good thing transparency. And this is part of it is going to be 3 months or so later. So it's just going to make it a little longer out on gestation period.

So when you just calculate normal yield, albeit on the domestic assessment side, be it on the cross-border side, be it on the transaction processing side, you're not going to see that impact."

So what I just said about the processing business typically, that is a much lower-margin type of business. When you look at some of the information services businesses, it's a higher margin. And when you look at the safety and security business, it's an even higher margin. So Dan, I can't just mix them all together because there are just a number of facets in there. But what we are doing, and this is what we said is, given that we have done a number of acquisitions, folding them together with our assets we have made, and you remember maybe the restructuring charge that we took 15 months ago or so, we have made some really good progress to increasing the margin of these businesses over time."

It has to have, obviously, enough of a substance in there so that these -- the unit can go to market as well as it can do its middle assets and back-office functions.

You see that reflected in our strong volume and transaction growth, and that's despite the somewhat uneven global economy. We're growing revenues from our core businesses, but also from our services as we just had a discussion of both organically and through the ongoing successful integration of our acquisitions over the last few years. We're pleased with our progress across MasterPass, across the MasterCard digital enablement system and our partnerships with many of the digital players. But as I said in the answer to Jason, there's a lot of things that are involved there. And as it's a marathon, not a sprint. We continue to build on our momentum in safety and security. We are committed to making sure that is what consumers get no matter which channel or which instrument or device they choose to use to shop on. We remain very focused on creating the better experience for both cardholders and merchants across all these channels.

The documents have also been attached to an 8-K that we filed with the SEC earlier this morning. A replay of this call will be posted on our website for 1 month.
Before we get started, I'd like to point out a change we have made around reporting the impact of currency on our business. As Martina mentioned on our last earnings call, we realized it has become more difficult for many of you to model our business as FX rates continue to move around. Therefore, beginning this quarter, instead of reporting FX-adjusted growth rates, which only reflected the translational impact of 2 functional currencies, the euro and the Brazilian real, we are now reporting currency-neutral growth rates, which include both the impact from translating functional currencies into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes as well as the underlying impact of local currencies being converted into their functional currency. 
Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I need to remind everyone that today's call may include some forward-looking statements about MasterCard's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance are summarized at the end of our press release as well as contained in our recent SEC filings.
And now with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ajay."
6477196,329405740,965991,"MasterCard Incorporated, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Mastercard Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Barbara. Good morning, everybody. We're very pleased to deliver solid results this quarter and despite what I think everybody would agree is an ongoing mixed global economic environment. On a currency-neutral basis, we reported net revenue grow",2319,"Thank you, Barbara. Good morning, everybody. We're very pleased to deliver solid results this quarter and despite what I think everybody would agree is an ongoing mixed global economic environment. On a currency-neutral basis, we reported net revenue growth of 14% and an EPS growth of 1%. But when you remove the impact of the nonrecurring discrete tax credit and the balance sheet remeasurement related to Venezuela in last year's first quarter, our EPS growth is 12%. 
So now let's take a look at the global economy. I think it's largely unchanged from what we discussed last quarter, with the U.S. economy remaining solid with inflation and wages growing at a similar pace and the unemployment rate kind of holding steady at 5%. We just saw the unemployment rate numbers coming out this morning as well. However, as we know from the Fed comments yesterday, uncertainty remains about when they might take action as well as the potential impact from the global economy. 
So with the rest of the world, the economic outlook continues to be mixed. In Europe, both consumer confidence and economic sentiment declined slightly this quarter. However, recent stimulus measures by the European Central Bank and steady improvement in the unemployment rate I think should continue to drive growth across the region, particularly in the U.K. and Germany. 
Asia is still challenged by the continued slowdown in China. Consumer confidence remains cloudy, with the exception being India, where both consumer and business sentiment remain high. 
In Latin America, Brazil is still in the worst recession in the country's history. And of course, economic conditions in Venezuela are deteriorating further. But Mexico is stable and seems to be driven by solid consumer spending and declining inflation. 
So none of this surprises us, but it does seem that we're likely to remain in a period of economic uncertainty. And so that said, we've continued to work hard to ensure that our business maintains its strong growth trajectory and we're seeing double-digit volume and transaction growth across most of our markets. In addition, we're benefiting from the successful integration of our recent acquisitions and continuing to grow our services business. As I told Barbara yesterday, at this time, steady as she goes is what our focus is. 
So now let's move on to some of our recent business activity. During the quarter, we signed a number of new deals and renewals supporting the expansion of our business around the world. I want to give you a few examples. In Europe, we extended our contract in Nordea, which is the largest bank in the Nordics, for their consumer credit and their commercial card portfolios. And we added the rollout of MasterPass and inControl with them. Same in Europe. We also renewed and extended our contract with DSGV, the largest banking group in Martina's home country of Germany, for their credit business. We also included the rollout of MasterPass. Further, we added a new debit portfolio with UniCredit, a leading European financial group based in Italy. In Asia, we just recently renewed and expanded our contracts with both Mitsubishi UFJ NICOS., which is one of the largest issuers in the region, for their consumer and their commercial credit business; and with Maybank, the largest bank in Malaysia, for their credit and debit business. 
And finally, I want to talk a little bit of an example of working with a number of our merchant partners. And I'm going to give you a specific example. This one is of McDonald's. We've talked in previous calls of a partnership with them in the Middle East, now in South Africa as well. The McDonald's are leveraging MasterPass to simplify the ordering process as well as utilizing contactless functionality at their restaurants. Of course, the idea is to improve the drive-through and the dining experience. 
But our McDonalds partnership actually has now gone beyond the core business. They're also a customer of Applied Predictive Technologies, or APT, the cloud-based data and analytics company that we acquired last May. McDonald's used APT's software to analyze a variety of strategic initiatives, including new food and menu items, determining which items should be on the menu and other business priorities. And this is one of the many examples of value we can provide to our merchant partners when you combine products that we have with the data analytics that we're capable of analyzing with them.
So next, I'd like to give you an update on how we're advancing our strategy in the digital payment space. And I'm going to start with MasterPass. So remember, here in a marathon here, and we're making great progress with our digital-by-default strategy. That's about enabling issuers to auto-enroll cardholders onto the MasterPass platform without any additional effort having to be made by the consumer. We're looking forward to announcing some bank partners who will be leveraging this ability in the near future. And as we continue to drive new acceptance for MasterPass as well, we're closing in on signing up about 270,000 merchants, representing more than $160 billion in addressable volume. 
Earlier this month, Vodafone Egypt migrated nearly 2 million Vodafone cash wallets from their closed-loop system to our mobile payment gateway platform. That enables us to process all of their transactions. This migration builds on our goal of creating an interoperable network across the Egyptian mobile payment ecosystem that I've spoken to in earlier call and helps to drive our strategy of financial inclusion and, of course, accelerate the conversion of cash. 
And then moving on to MasterCard Digital Enablement Service or MDES. We continue to make significant progress around making digital transaction more secure via encryption and tokenization. In Asia, we are pleased to now have more than 30 issuers signed up for the MDES service. We also launched the first NFC-based wallet in Latin America with Citi/Banamex in Mexico, utilizing our cloud-based payment technology. And by the way, this wallet, the Citi/Banamex one, was created by developers from our C-SAM acquisition, which actually gave us access to a very talented pool of engineers, who are enabling us to build out capabilities for issuers and merchants exactly like the example of Citi/Banamex. 
And finally, we continue to support our digital partners by helping Android Pay launch in the U.K. and both Samsung Pay and Apple Pay are expanding to Singapore. We're also pleased to be partnering with Facebook as they leverage MDES to test tokenization by enabling pilot participants to interact with sellers and advertisers directly on the platform to complete their purchases, all without ever having to leave the Facebook app. 
So moving on to safety and security. You know there's a lot of effort from us and others going into the space. And as a result of successful biometric trials in the Netherlands and the U.S., that we announced last August, we're actually launching MasterCard Identity Check, fondly referred to as Selfie Pay, in the U.S., Canada and parts of Europe this summer, with more countries to be announced soon. Much of the initial interest in Identity Check has come -- had been attached to the consumer side of these businesses. But interestingly, we're currently working with BMO Financial Group, that the Bank of Montreal in Canada, to roll out the first corporate credit card program using Selfie Pay in both the U.S. and Canada. 
In addition, we recently launched IQ series. That's a suite of products which uses real-time intelligence to empower issuers to make more informed fraud management decisions as well as, most importantly, potentially decrease the growing problem of false declines. Industry studies are showing that 1 out of every 6 cardholders have experienced at least 1 decline because of suspected fraud in the past year. That, by the way, adds up to false declines of $118 billion a year or several times the actual amount of true card fraud. 
Next, we worked with our issuers to deliver additional benefits to our cardholders and help protect them even from fraud. As of 2 weeks ago, all MasterCard consumer and small business cardholders are now covered by the industry's first global around-the-world 0 liability promise, ensuring they're not responsible for any unauthorized charges. 
And while on the topic of safety and security, let's spend a minute on the status of EMV in the U.S. We now have about 67% of our consumer credit cards and 24% for our consumer debit cards with chips in them. Roughly 1.2 million U.S. merchant locations are now accepting these cards. And while there's good progress we are seeing across the industry and also in our own numbers, I mean, everybody recognizes that checkout times at the terminal may appear longer when using a chip card. And to help address that concern, we announced M/Chip Fast, which is to help speed EMV transactions. You leverage the capabilities of our existing contactless technology, which as you know, has been deployed in various transits and other applications around the world. Using that, cardholders will experience magstripe transaction speed, but with the added security of EMV and chip. At the same time, we're going to make this happen in collaboration with the industry, including other networks, to look at how to bring a consistent approach to the market and best support the EMV checkout experience. 
And the point of all these examples is that people shop on all sorts of devices and through multiple channels. And they expect technology to simplify that process while keeping the transaction safe and secure. And I give you all these examples to demonstrate and reinforce our commitment to protecting every transaction. Doesn't matter whether it took place in the physical world or the digital world. We are committed to doing this.
So for the last several minutes talking to you on how we've grown our business through a series of organic investments. And it's important to recognize we've also been growing our business by integrating the various acquisitions we made over the past few years, trying to expand our presence across the payment value chain. So let me give you a couple of examples across information services and processing. 
So let's start by information services, that business within advisers. I mentioned APT earlier when I talked about McDonald's. One of the great things about that subscription-based business model is that it generates a recurring revenue stream with an average contract length of about 3 years. And since the acquisition, we've integrated the sales and product organizations of APT with advisers to drive some pretty good benefits. Let me give you an example. 
Since their acquisition, 30 organizations have subscribed to the APT platform in long-term contracts. And in addition to McDonald's that I talked about, I'll give you a few more: Asahi Breweries in Japan; Sunoco in the U.S.; and in the U.K., KFC. We've also signed more than 15 new deals incremental to APT's earlier business-as-usual efforts, in other words, using MasterCard's client relationships and coverage, including, by the way, one of the largest airlines in Europe, one of the largest retailers in Brazil, 2 of the largest financial institutions in Asia and several in the U.S. What's exciting about all these deals is that they include expanding relationships with long-time APT clients, who now also license newly created product modules, leveraging insights derived from MasterCard data. 
Then finally, we launched APT Engage, which is a suite of products which leverages aggregated and anonymized MasterCard payment transaction data, combined with APT's proprietary analytics to help issuers and merchants better understand customer spending behavior, which products have higher loyalty as well as planning for new retail locations. That's about information services.
On to processing. The idea there being to extend our capabilities beyond switching, getting beyond authorizing, clearing and settlement. So in our Payment Transaction Services business, we signed a deal with BNP Paribas in Poland to provide issuer processing services, which, by the way, has also enabled us to become one of the major third-party processors in the country. Here in the U.S., our year-old partnership with Green Dot to process all of their debit and prepaid cards and has resulted in the successful migration of now approximately 50 million account files with another 50 million to arc over the balance of 2016. And lastly, in the same business, we enabled several transit operators in Turkey to begin using NFC capability by processing contactless cards and thereby, allowing us to increase our share of domestic processed transactions. 
Staying with processing, on the Prepaid Management Services side, we've just implemented a card program with British Airways to facilitate compensation payments to BA passengers for delayed or canceled flights or lost luggage. We've also launched the first dual-purpose travel insurance and multicurrency prepaid travel product with Flight Centre, which is one of the world's largest travel agencies. 
And lastly, as a result of integrating our acquired assets into our Payment Gateway Services business, we're now able to offer products globally, which include integrated fraud and risk management solutions to both merchants and to acquirers. We're already seeing several new wins, including 4 new deals with key acquirers and resellers in Australia, India, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, who can now offer these capabilities to their merchant base and in turn, that kind of helps us expand our footprint in these markets. We've also worked to ensure that our payment gateway provides acceptance of the latest digital payment methods. We now support both Apple Pay and Android Pay in addition to MasterPass. 
We all recognize these acquisitions require a certain amount of time, investment and resources to integrate. We've worked very hard to ensure this happens seamlessly and efficiently. We're now clearly seeing the benefits that come from them, both in our dialogue and in our engagement with our customers. 
So with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Martina for an update on our financial results and operational metrics. Martina?"

Let me begin by giving you some highlights on the first quarter, starting with Page 3, where you see the difference between as-reported and currency-neutral growth rates for this quarter. As Barbara explained at t",1522,"Thanks, Ajay, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by giving you some highlights on the first quarter, starting with Page 3, where you see the difference between as-reported and currency-neutral growth rates for this quarter. As Barbara explained at the start of this call, we have now changed how we report the impact of currency. So instead of reporting FX-adjusted growth rates, which only reflected the translational impact of the euro and the Brazilian real functional currencies, we are now reporting currency-neutral growth rates, which exclude all impacts of foreign exchange rates. This is both the impact from translating functional currencies into U.S. dollar for reporting purposes as well as the underlying impact of local currencies being converted into their functional currency. We hope that this change will make it easier for you to understand the underlying performance of our business. And all of my comments going forward will pertain to our new currency-neutral growth rates.
Net revenue growth was 14%. While operating expenses grew significantly, this was mostly due to the difference between FX hedging and balance sheet remeasurement gains that we had in the year-ago quarter versus foreign exchange losses on our hedging contracts in this quarter. I will talk more about this when we get into the detail of operating expenses. 
As expected, net income was also impacted by a higher tax rate than in the year-ago quarter due to the nonrecurrence of a discrete U.S. foreign tax credit from which we benefited in the first quarter of 2015. EPS was $0.86, up 1% year-over-year. But as Ajay said, it was impacted by $0.08 due to the discrete tax item that I just mentioned and the Venezuela balance sheet remeasurement gain in the year-ago quarter. When you exclude these 2 items, EPS grew 12%. 
Share repurchases contributed $0.03 per share. And as of April 21, we have $2.9 billion remaining under our current authorization. And lastly, cash flow from operations was $1 billion, and we ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalent and other liquid investments of about $6.2 billion.
So let me turn to Page 4 and here, you can see the operational metrics for the first quarter. Included in these numbers is a positive lift of about 1% due to leap day on all of our metrics. Our worldwide gross dollar volume, or GDV growth, was 13%. On a local currency basis, that's about up 1 ppt from last quarter. Overall, our U.S. GDV grew 10%, made up of credit and debit growth of 11% and 8%, respectively. Total U.S. GDV had a continued 1 ppt headwind from lower gas prices. 
Outside of the U.S., volume growth was 15% on a local currency basis, also up about 1 ppt versus last quarter, with mid- to high teens growth in each region, except Canada, which was impacted by the lapping of our Costco win. Cross-border volume grew 12% on a local currency basis, and that's similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter.
Turning to Page 5. Processed transactions grew 14% globally to $12.6 billion, a 2 ppt increase from what we saw in the fourth quarter, with higher growth in all regions, except Canada, again, due to the lapping of our Costco win. Globally, the number of cards grew 7% with 2.3 billion MasterCard and Maestro-branded cards issued. 
Let me turn to Page 6 for highlights on a few of the revenue line items. Net revenue growth was 10% as reported or 14% on a currency-neutral basis, given currency headwinds. We saw strong volume and transaction growth, particularly in the U.S. and Europe, and some of which was due to the impact of leap year. Rebates and incentives was slightly higher than what we expected due to deal renewals. 
Looking quickly at the individual line -- revenue line items on a constant -- on a currency-neutral basis. Domestic assessments grew 13%, in line with worldwide GDV growth. Cross-border volume fees grew 14%, while cross-border volume grew 12%. The 2 ppt gap is due to a number of pricing actions, partially offset by a higher mix of intra-Europe activity. Transaction processing fees grew 18%, primarily driven by the 14% growth in processed transactions as well as some pricing. And finally, other revenues grew 22%, driven primarily by our APT acquisition and our safety and security product offerings.
Moving on to Page 7. Here, you can see that total operating expenses increased 25% in the quarter or 29% on a currency-neutral basis. Most of this increase is due to FX movements recorded in our G&A line. I mentioned on our last earnings call that we recorded a large amount of FX gains in the year-ago quarter, mostly due to onetime gains related to Venezuela. The absence of those gains, plus the unrealized losses we recorded this quarter on our FX hedging activity due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to year-end 2015, resulted in an almost $130 million increase to expenses. Excluding this and a 4 ppt impact from acquisitions we did not have in the year-ago quarter, G&A grew 11% as a result of our continual investment in areas such as digital, data analytics and safety and security. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense is primarily due to the amortization of intangibles related to our acquisitions.
So now I'm going to turn to Slide 8. Let's discuss what we had seen in April through the 21. While many of our business drivers are similar to the first quarter, direct comparisons to the first quarter are a bit difficult since it had the benefit of both leap day and Easter. 
The numbers through April 21 are as follows: Starting with processed volume, we saw global growth of 13%, the same as in the first quarter. In the U.S., our process volume grew 10%, down roughly 1 ppt from the first quarter, with slower growth in both credit and debit. Gas had less than 1 ppt negative impact on our April growth, down slightly from the first quarter impact. Process volume outside the U.S. grew 16%, up 1 ppt from the last quarter, with higher growth in most regions and primarily driven by Europe and APMEA. Global process transaction growth was 14%, the same as we saw in the first quarter. Process transaction growth outside the U.S. was up a bit, with increases in APMEA and LAC, while the U.S. growth was down almost 2 ppt due to slower growth in credit and debit. With respect to cross-border, our volumes grew at 11% globally, down 1 ppt from last quarter with slower growth in Europe, primarily due to the timing of Easter.
Let me start out with a quick comment about our long-term performance objectives for 2016 to '18, which excluded the impact from our 2 major functional currencies, the euro and the Brazilian real as well as excluded any new M&A activities. Since we are now making the change to recognize the impact of all foreign exchange on our business, we reviewed these objectives and determined that no change is required from what we issued previously because we had baked in very little local FX impact over the 3-year period. Therefore, our 2016 to '18 objectives remain as follows, but are now on a currency-neutral basis: net revenue CAGR of low double digits; operating margin of at least 50%; and an EPS CAGR in the mid-teens and measured off a 2015 pro forma EPS figure of $3.12.
Now moving specifically to this year, there's really no change in our outlook for the business from what we discussed with you on our earnings call back in January. The U.S. and European economies are showing some sign of improvement, but the rest of the world remains challenged. In addition, FX headwinds will continue to be with us into 2016, although likely not as significant as 2015 given current FX rates. And our underlying business fundamentals remain strong. We will continue to run the company for growth, both on the top and on the bottom line as well as balancing our investments with astute expense management. 
As we look at full year 2016 and after factoring in our new currency-neutral methodology, we continue to expect to be at the low end of our 3-year revenue growth range. When you model on an as-reported basis, you will need to adjust for the impact of all currencies. And at the current rates, we estimate that it would mean about a 3 ppt headwind on net revenue growth and about a 4 ppt headwind to the bottom line. 
And let me call out a few other items that you should consider when modeling 2016. So for rebates and incentives, we continue to expect to see growth in the high teens, slightly lower than the 20% as-reported growth rate we saw in 2015. On expenses, we still expect total operating expense growth in the high single-digit range on an as-reported basis. And finally, you should assume a tax rate of slightly less than 30% for 2016. 
Now let me turn the call back to Barbara to begin the Q&A session. Barbara?"

So hopefully, by knowing the first quarter, you are able to chart out the next 3 quarters for the year, given that we're giving guidance for the high single-digit number. In terms of operating leverage, what we have said when we looked at our business, and we do that actually every year, that we feel very comfortable with an operating margin in excess of 50%. Remember, we are really running the business for revenue growth, so for top line growth, which means that we are having to make a number of investments in -- on the OpEx side in order to generate the bottom line growth. So we are holding that as a metric. And at this point in time, the heavy-duty investments that are happening is in the digital arena, is in the data analytics arena as well as in the safety and security arena."

We're trying to build out capabilities in the areas we've identified over the last few years in our strategic plan in our Investor Day. Basically, that's in processing, so we get to see more transactions, and we get beyond the clearing, authorizing and settlement space of the existing card kind of business. So that's why you saw us doing -- and you saw in my opening remarks the commentary on the different processing entities and how they fit into what we are doing. It could be in the data cache kind of space, which is the payment gateway area. It could be with things like Provus and Trevica. Those are all in the regular transaction processing spaces. Or it could be in any space that allows us to get to see more transactions. When 6, 7 years ago, we used to see under 40% of our transactions. We now see close to 50%. That enables us to do a better job with our core products, but even more importantly, with our information services and advisers and safety and security products, which is where we're putting some emphasis. So that's the second area beyond processing. Anything that gives us capabilities, strengths, geography, product knowledge or skill sets in data analytics, in safety and security, in information services, in loyalty and rewards, hence, the acquisitions in Australia that we have done, that's all about those spaces. And we haven't wavered off that. You'll read speculation every once in a while, and speculation is speculation till we can announce anything to you. So don't take it to the bank."

Because in the surface, this does seem like a different approach from the merchants as opposed to the MCX approach because it will offer the consumers opportunity to use all tender types, including the traditional networks rather than being hyper focused on reducing acceptance cost and trying to force to use their private label and decouple debit payment types.

And in truth, I think nobody actually knows. And I think and I said many times, it's going to take a few years for this to settle. That's why even companies like ours, in mobile, you've seen us place effort, energy, money, bets in everything from whether the transaction data is on the handset or it's in the cloud, whether we're working with mobile network operators or hardware manufacturers or distributors of that stuff. This whole mobile space, whether -- is such an evolving space. And I don't think anybody knows the answers. And I think that's what's going on even with the retailers. I think they're trying to find a way to offer a product and a wallet that their consumer can be connected to for loyalty and not just let a digital player own that space, also not just let the banks own that space. The banks, by the way, are doing the same thing. They're trying to make sure they offer products that get the consumer loyal to them and not just let the digital player own that space or the merchant own that space. And of course, the digital player is doing the same thing. So we're all doing a dance right now and I don't think anybody knows the real answer. But I do believe in 2 or 3 underlying factors: The first one is, we, as a network, we believe that a focus on the person who owns the consumer relationship, in this case, the bank or the merchant as it may be, they are the ones who should be developing the loyalty with that consumer. People like us that are -- we're a B2B2C company. We operate through them and, therefore, our role is to facilitate that and do it in a way that drives our business with them and enables our value-added services to be used. So we're very focused on going through them, whether it be through a Walmart or through a Citibank or through a different bank. The second rule that I think applies universally is that more consumer choice in tenders and payments is better than less. And I think that's just to reduce the friction. There's one large merchant in the United States who doesn't think that way. But otherwise, every other merchant around the world is keen to basically offer more tender choice to their consumer rather than less. And I think that's going to be even more important in the mobile world, to reduce friction, and those kinds of rules apply. And so my view of this, Jason, don't conclude too much yet, but be prepared to see many efforts going on in different places. I think the days of one model and only one big mobile network or one, I'd say, one big mobile wallet or one big e-commerce wallet existed, those days are going away. There's going to be a lot of competition in that space with multiple tenders, with choice for consumers. And it's going to be interesting to watch where this settles."

So that number of -- so those economies are actually doing okay, but they're not traveling in dollar-indexed countries as much just because the dollar is so strong. And even though we saw a little bit of a weakening of the dollar for the first quarter, it's still at a very, very high level.

It's just been announced by them that they're changing the terms of the manner in which the exact deal's priced as well as the timing. I think over the next 2 or 3 months, we'll see what that does in terms of how issuers are thinking. My general sense is it'll make it easier for an issuer to know exactly what they're going to get paid from the exercise of the put, and that'll make it a little easier for them to comprehend what they're getting and what they're leaving behind if they make a decision, which, in a sense, is a good thing.

But I, honestly, I consider the whole commercial business to be a continuing area of growth. And I'm sure so do my peers, because it's not just about us or our peers. It's the marketplace. This commercial business has a nice opportunity for all of us. We signed a deal with Barclays in the U.K. recently. We expanded our global agreement with Citibank to include that commercial card portfolios in Asia, in Europe but also in the United States. And we kind of see continuing strong adoption of smartdata, which is our reporting and reconciliation tool. We are seeing continuing adoption of InControl for commercial payments. That's virtual cards. And most interestingly, we're starting to see increasing interest beyond the typical bankcard issuers. You're looking at technology providers, who embed their commercial payment solution into their software and platform. We're working with them. We're working with payment aggregators in insurance and health care. It's kind of a -- it's an interesting space. We're in the early stages of a long run in commercial, but we feel good about where we're going. And we continually see good growth in there, not just in the U.S., by the way.

That's kind of what we are trying to do: Manage our expenses in all aspects of our lines. 
Okay. So thank you all for your questions. I want to leave you with a couple of closing thoughts. I think the first part is, I think our business is performing well. You see that reflected in our strong volume and transaction growth, and that's despite the somewhat uneven global economy. We're growing revenues from our core businesses, but also from our services, as we just had a discussion of, both organically and through the ongoing successful integration of our acquisitions for the last few years. We're pleased with our progress across MasterPass, across the MasterCard Digital Enablement System and our partnerships with many of the digital players. But as I said in the answer to Jason, that's -- there's a lot of things that are involved there, and this is a marathon, not a sprint. We continue to build on our momentum in safety and security. We're committed to making sure that is what consumers get, no matter which channel or which instrument or device they choose to use to shop on. And we remain very focused on creating a better experience for both cardholders and merchants across all these channels.

This morning's earnings release and the slide deck that will be referenced on this call can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at mastercard.com. The documents have also been attached to an 8-K that we filed with the SEC earlier this morning. A replay of this call will be posted on our website for 1 month.
Before we get started, I'd like to point out a change we have made around reporting the impact of currency on our business. As Martina mentioned on our last earnings call, we realized it has become more difficult for many of you to model our business as FX rates continue to move around. Therefore, beginning this quarter, instead of reporting FX-adjusted growth rates, which only reflected the translational impact of 2 functional currencies, the euro and the Brazilian real, we are now reporting currency-neutral growth rates, which include both the impact from translating functional currencies into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes as well as the underlying impact of local currencies being converted into their functional currency. 
Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I need to remind everyone that today's call may include some forward-looking statements about MasterCard's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance are summarized at the end of our press release as well as contained in our recent SEC filings.
And now with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ajay."
6477196,329405740,966420,"MasterCard Incorporated, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Mastercard Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Barbara. Good morning, everybody. We're very pleased to deliver solid results this quarter and despite what I think everybody would agree is an ongoing mixed global economic environment. On a currency-neutral basis, we reported net revenue grow",2321,"Thank you, Barbara. Good morning, everybody. We're very pleased to deliver solid results this quarter and despite what I think everybody would agree is an ongoing mixed global economic environment. On a currency-neutral basis, we reported net revenue growth of 14% and an EPS growth of 1%. But when you remove the impact of the nonrecurring discrete tax credit and the balance sheet remeasurement related to Venezuela in last year's first quarter, our EPS growth is 12%. 
So now let's take a look at the global economy. I think it's largely unchanged from what we discussed last quarter, with the U.S. economy remaining solid with inflation and wages growing at a similar pace and the unemployment rate kind of holding steady at 5%. We just saw the unemployment rate numbers coming out this morning as well. However, as we know from the Fed comments yesterday, uncertainty remains about when they might take action as well as the potential impact from the global economy. 
So with the rest of the world, the economic outlook continues to be mixed. In Europe, both consumer confidence and economic sentiment declined slightly this quarter. However, recent stimulus measures by the European Central Bank and steady improvement in the unemployment rate, I think, should continue to drive growth across the region, particularly in the U.K. and Germany. 
Asia is still challenged by the continued slowdown in China. Consumer confidence remains cloudy, with the exception being India, where both consumer and business sentiment remain high. 
In Latin America, Brazil is still in the worst recession in the country's history. And of course, economic conditions in Venezuela are deteriorating further. But Mexico is stable and seems to be driven by solid consumer spending and declining inflation. 
So none of this surprises us, but it does seem that we're likely to remain in a period of economic uncertainty. And so that said, we've continued to work hard to ensure that our business maintains its strong growth trajectory and we're seeing double-digit volume and transaction growth across most of our markets. In addition, we're benefiting from the successful integration of our recent acquisitions and continuing to grow our services business. As I told Barbara yesterday, at this time, steady as she goes is what our focus is. 
So now let's move on to some of our recent business activity. During the quarter, we signed a number of new deals and renewals supporting the expansion of our business around the world. I want to give you a few examples. In Europe, we extended our contract in Nordea, which is the largest bank in the Nordics, for their consumer credit and their commercial card portfolios. And we added the rollout of MasterPass and inControl with them. Same in Europe, we also renewed and extended our contract with DSGV, the largest banking group in Martina's home country of Germany, for their credit business. We also included the rollout of MasterPass. Further, we added a new debit portfolio with UniCredit, a leading European financial group based in Italy. In Asia, we just recently renewed and expanded our contracts with both Mitsubishi UFJ NICOS, which is one of the largest issuers in the region, for their consumer and their commercial credit business; and with Maybank, the largest bank in Malaysia, for their credit and debit business. 
And finally, I want to talk a little bit of an example of working with a number of our merchant partners. And I'm going to give you a specific example. This one is of McDonald's. We've talked in previous calls of a partnership with them in the Middle East, now in South Africa as well. The McDonald's are leveraging MasterPass to simplify the ordering process as well as utilizing contactless functionality at their restaurants. Of course, the idea is to improve the drive-through and the dining experience. 
But our McDonald's partnership actually has now gone beyond the core business. They're also a customer of Applied Predictive Technologies, or APT, the cloud-based data and analytics company that we acquired last May. McDonald's used APT's software to analyze a variety of strategic initiatives, including new food and menu items, determining which items should be on the menu and other business priorities. And this is one of the many examples of value we can provide to our merchant partners when you combine products that we have with the data analytics that we're capable of analyzing with them. 
So next, I'd like to give you an update on how we're advancing our strategy in the digital payment space. And I'm going to start with MasterPass. So remember, we're in a marathon here, and we're making great progress with our digital-by-default strategy. That's about enabling issuers to auto-enroll cardholders onto the MasterPass platform without any additional effort having to be made by the consumer. We're looking forward to announcing some bank partners who will be leveraging this ability in the near future. And as we continue to drive new acceptance for MasterPass as well, we're closing in on signing up about 270,000 merchants, representing more than $160 billion in addressable volume. 
Earlier this month, Vodafone Egypt migrated nearly 2 million Vodafone cash wallets from their closed-loop system to our mobile payment gateway platform. That enables us to process all of their transactions. This migration builds on our goal of creating an interoperable network across the Egyptian mobile payment ecosystem that I've spoken to in earlier call and helps to drive our strategy of financial inclusion and, of course, accelerate the conversion of cash. 
And then moving on to MasterCard Digital Enablement Service or MDES. We continue to make significant progress around making digital transaction more secure via encryption and tokenization. In Asia, we are pleased to now have more than 30 issuers signed up for the MDES service. We've also launched the first NFC-based wallet in Latin America with Citi/Banamex in Mexico, utilizing our cloud-based payment technology. And by the way, this wallet, the Citi/Banamex one, was created by developers from our C-SAM acquisition, which actually gave us access to a very talented pool of engineers, who are enabling us to build out capabilities for issuers and merchants exactly like the example of Citi/Banamex. 
And finally, we continue to support our digital partners by helping Android Pay launch in the U.K. and both Samsung Pay and Apple Pay are expanding to Singapore. We're also pleased to be partnering with Facebook as they leverage MDES to test tokenization by enabling pilot participants to interact with sellers and advertisers directly on the platform to complete their purchases, all without ever having to leave the Facebook app. 
So moving on to safety and security. You know there's a lot of effort from us and others going into the space. And as a result of successful biometric trials in the Netherlands and the U.S., that we announced last August, we're actually launching MasterCard Identity Check, fondly referred to as Selfie Pay, in the U.S., Canada and parts of Europe this summer, with more countries to be announced soon. Much of the initial interest in Identity Check has come -- had been attached to the consumer side of these businesses. But interestingly, we were actually currently working with BMO Financial Group, that's the Bank of Montreal in Canada, to roll out the first corporate credit card program using Selfie Pay in both the U.S. and Canada. 
In addition, we recently launched IQ series. That's a suite of products which uses real-time intelligence to empower issuers to make more informed fraud management decisions as well as, most importantly, potentially decrease the growing problem of false declines. Industry studies are showing that 1 out of every 6 cardholders have experienced at least 1 decline because of suspected fraud in the past year. That, by the way, adds up to false declines of $118 billion a year or several times the actual amount of true card fraud. 
Next, we worked with our issuers to deliver additional benefits to our cardholders and helped protect them even more from fraud. As of 2 weeks ago, all MasterCard consumer and small business cardholders are now covered by the industry's first global around-the-world 0 liability promise, ensuring they're not responsible for any unauthorized charges. 
And while on the topic of safety and security, let's spend a minute on the status of EMV in the U.S. We now have about 67% of our consumer credit cards and 24% for our consumer debit cards with chips in them. Roughly 1.2 million U.S. merchant locations are now accepting these cards. And while that's good progress that we're seeing across the industry and also in our own numbers, I mean, everybody recognizes that checkout times at the terminal may appear longer when using a chip card. And to help address that concern, we announced M/Chip Fast, which is to help speed EMV transactions. You leverage the capabilities of our existing contactless technology, which as you know, has been deployed in various transits and other applications around the world. Using that, cardholders will experience magstripe transaction speed, but with the added security of EMV and chip. At the same time, we're going to make this happen in collaboration with the industry, including other networks, to look at how to bring a consistent approach to the market and best support the EMV checkout experience. 
And the point of all these examples is that people shop on all sorts of devices and through multiple channels. And they expect technology to simplify that process while keeping the transaction safe and secure. And I give you all these examples to demonstrate and reinforce our commitment to protecting every transaction. Doesn't matter whether it took place in the physical world or the digital world. We are committed to doing this.
So for the last several minutes talking to you on how we've grown our business through a series of organic investments. And it's important to recognize we've also been growing our business by integrating the various acquisitions we made over the past few years, trying to expand our presence across the payment value chain. So let me give you a couple of examples across information services and processing. 
So let's start by information services, that business within advisers. I mentioned APT earlier when I talked about McDonald's. One of the great things about that subscription-based business model is that it generates a recurring revenue stream with an average contract length of about 3 years. And since the acquisition, we've integrated the sales and product organizations of APT with advisers to drive some pretty good benefits. Let me give you an example. 
Since their acquisition, 30 organizations have subscribed to the APT platform in long-term contracts. And in addition to McDonald's that I talked about, I'll give you a few more: Asahi Breweries in Japan; Sunoco in the U.S.; and in the U.K., KFC. We've also signed more than 15 new deals incremental to APT's earlier business-as-usual efforts, in other words, using MasterCard's client relationships and coverage, including, by the way, one of the largest airlines in Europe, one of the largest retailers in Brazil, 2 of the largest financial institutions in Asia and several in the U.S. What's exciting about all these deals is that they include expanding relationships with long-time APT clients, who now also license newly created product modules, leveraging insights derived from MasterCard data. 
Then finally we launched APT Engage, which is a suite of products which leverages aggregated and anonymized MasterCard payment transaction data combined with APT's proprietary analytics, to help issuers and merchants better understand customer spending behavior, which products have higher loyalty as well as planning for new retail locations. That's about information services.
On to processing. The idea there being to extend our capabilities beyond switching, getting beyond authorizing, clearing and settlement. So in our Payment Transaction Services business, we signed a deal with BNP Paribas in Poland to provide issuer processing services, which, by the way, has also enabled us to become one of the major third-party processors in the country. Here in the U.S., our year-old partnership with Green Dot to process all of their debit and prepaid cards has resulted in the successful migration of now approximately 50 million account files with another 50 million to arc over the balance of 2016. And lastly, in the same business, we enabled several transit operators in Turkey to begin using NFC capability by processing contactless cards and thereby, allowing us to increase our share of domestic processed transactions. 
Staying with processing, on the Prepaid Management Services side, we've just implemented a card program with British Airways to facilitate compensation payments to BA passengers for delayed or canceled flights or lost luggage. We've also launched the first dual-purpose travel insurance and multicurrency prepaid travel product with Flight Centre, which is one of the world's largest travel agencies. 
And lastly, as a result of integrating our acquired assets into our Payment Gateway Services business, we're now able to offer products globally, which include integrated fraud and risk management solutions to both merchants and to acquirers. We're already seeing several new wins, including 4 new deals with key acquirers and resellers in Australia, India, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, who can now offer these capabilities to their merchant base and in turn, that kind of helps us expand our footprint in these markets. We've also worked to ensure that our payment gateway provides acceptance of the latest digital payment methods. We now support both Apple Pay and Android Pay in addition to MasterPass. 
We all recognize these acquisitions require a certain amount of time, investment and resources to integrate. We've worked very hard to ensure this happens seamlessly and efficiently. We're now clearly seeing the benefits that come from them, both in our dialogue and in our engagement with our customers. 
So with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Martina for an update on our financial results and operational metrics. Martina?"
6477196,329405740,966420,"MasterCard Incorporated, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Mastercard Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Ajay, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by giving you some highlights on the first quarter, starting with Page 3, where you see the difference between as-reported and currency-neutral growth rates for this quarter. As Barbara explained at t",1522,"Thanks, Ajay, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by giving you some highlights on the first quarter, starting with Page 3, where you see the difference between as-reported and currency-neutral growth rates for this quarter. As Barbara explained at the start of this call, we have now changed how we report the impact of currency. So instead of reporting FX-adjusted growth rates, which only reflected the translational impact of the euro and the Brazilian real functional currencies, we are now reporting currency-neutral growth rates, which exclude all impacts of foreign exchange rates. This is both the impact from translating functional currencies into U.S. dollar for reporting purposes as well as the underlying impact of local currencies being converted into their functional currency. We hope that this change will make it easier for you to understand the underlying performance of our business. And all of my comments going forward will pertain to our new currency-neutral growth rates.
Net revenue growth was 14%. While operating expenses grew significantly, this was mostly due to the difference between FX hedging and balance sheet remeasurement gains that we had in the year-ago quarter versus foreign exchange losses on our hedging contracts in this quarter. I will talk more about this when we get into the detail of operating expenses. 
As expected, net income was also impacted by a higher tax rate than in the year-ago quarter due to the nonrecurrence of a discrete U.S. foreign tax credit from which we benefited in the first quarter of 2015. EPS was $0.86, up 1% year-over-year. But as Ajay said, it was impacted by $0.08 due to the discrete tax item that I just mentioned and the Venezuela balance sheet remeasurement gain in the year-ago quarter. When you exclude these 2 items, EPS grew 12%. 
Share repurchases contributed $0.03 per share. And as of April 21, we have $2.9 billion remaining under our current authorization. And lastly, cash flow from operations was $1 billion, and we ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalent and other liquid investments of about $6.2 billion.
So let me turn to Page 4 and here, you can see the operational metrics for the first quarter. Included in these numbers is a positive lift of about 1% due to leap day on all of our metrics. Our worldwide gross dollar volume, or GDV growth, was 13%. On a local currency basis, that's about up 1 ppt from last quarter. Overall, our U.S. GDV grew 10%, made up of credit and debit growth of 11% and 8%, respectively. Total U.S. GDV had a continued 1 ppt headwind from lower gas prices. 
Outside of the U.S., volume growth was 15% on a local currency basis, also up about 1 ppt versus last quarter, with mid- to high teens growth in each region, except Canada, which was impacted by the lapping of our Costco win. Cross-border volume grew 12% on a local currency basis, and that's similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter.
Turning to Page 5. Processed transactions grew 14% globally to $12.6 billion, a 2 ppt increase from what we saw in the fourth quarter, with higher growth in all regions except Canada, again due to the lapping of our Costco win. Globally, the number of cards grew 7% with 2.3 billion MasterCard and Maestro-branded cards issued. 
Let me turn to Page 6 for highlights on a few of the revenue line items. Net revenue growth was 10% as reported or 14% on a currency-neutral basis, given currency headwinds. We saw strong volume and transaction growth, particularly in the U.S. and Europe, and some of which was due to the impact of leap year. Rebates and incentives was slightly higher than what we expected due to deal renewals. 
Looking quickly at the individual line -- revenue line items on a constant -- on a currency-neutral basis. Domestic assessments grew 13%, in line with worldwide GDV growth. Cross-border volume fees grew 14%, while cross-border volume grew 12%. The 2 ppt gap is due to a number of pricing actions, partially offset by a higher mix of intra-Europe activity. Transaction processing fees grew 18%, primarily driven by the 14% growth in processed transactions as well as some pricing. And finally, other revenues grew 22%, driven primarily by our APT acquisition and our safety and security product offerings.
Moving on to Page 7. Here, you can see that total operating expenses increased 25% in the quarter or 29% on a currency-neutral basis. Most of this increase is due to FX movements recorded in our G&A line. I mentioned on our last earnings call that we recorded a large amount of FX gains in the year-ago quarter, mostly due to onetime gains related to Venezuela. The absence of those gains, plus the unrealized losses we recorded this quarter on our FX hedging activity due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to year-end 2015, resulted in an almost $130 million increase to expenses. Excluding this and a 4 ppt impact from acquisitions we did not have in the year-ago quarter, G&A grew 11% as a result of our continuing investment in areas such as digital, data analytics and safety and security. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense is primarily due to the amortization of intangibles related to our acquisitions.
So now I'm going to turn to Slide 8. Let's discuss what we had seen in April through the 21st. While many of our business drivers are similar to the first quarter, direct comparisons to the first quarter are a bit difficult since it had the benefit of both leap day and Easter. 
The numbers through April 21 are as follows: Starting with processed volume, we saw global growth of 13%, the same as in the first quarter. In the U.S., our process volume grew 10%, down roughly 1 ppt from the first quarter, with slower growth in both credit and debit. Gas had less than 1 ppt negative impact on our April growth, down slightly from the first quarter impact. Process volume outside the U.S. grew 16%, up 1 ppt from the last quarter, with higher growth in most regions and primarily driven by Europe and APMEA. Global process transaction growth was 14%, the same as we saw in the first quarter. Process transaction growth outside the U.S. was up a bit, with increases in APMEA and LAC, while the U.S. growth was down almost 2 ppt due to slower growth in credit and debit. With respect to cross-border, our volumes grew at 11% globally, down 1 ppt from last quarter with slower growth in Europe, primarily due to the timing of Easter.
Let me start out with a quick comment about our long-term performance objectives for 2016 to '18, which excluded the impact from our 2 major functional currencies, the euro and the Brazilian real as well as excluded any new M&A activities. Since we are now making the change to recognize the impact of all foreign exchange on our business, we reviewed these objectives and determined that no change is required from what we issued previously because we had baked in very little local FX impact over the 3-year period. Therefore, our 2016 to '18 objectives remain as follows, but are now on a currency-neutral basis: net revenue CAGR of low double digits; operating margin of at least 50%; and an EPS CAGR in the mid-teens and measured off a 2015 pro forma EPS figure of $3.12.
Now moving specifically to this year, there's really no change in our outlook for the business from what we discussed with you on our earnings call back in January. The U.S. and European economies are showing some sign of improvement, but the rest of the world remains challenged. In addition, FX headwinds will continue to be with us into 2016, although likely not as significant as 2015 given current FX rates. And our underlying business fundamentals remain strong. We will continue to run the company for growth, both on the top and on the bottom line as well as balancing our investments with astute expense management. 
As we look at full year 2016 and after factoring in our new currency-neutral methodology, we continue to expect to be at the low end of our 3-year revenue growth range. When you model on an as-reported basis, you will need to adjust for the impact of all currencies. And at the current rates, we estimate that it would mean about a 3 ppt headwind on net revenue growth and about a 4 ppt headwind to the bottom line. 
And let me call out a few other items that you should consider when modeling 2016. So for rebates and incentives, we continue to expect to see growth in the high teens, slightly lower than the 20% as-reported growth rate we saw in 2015. On expenses, we still expect total operating expense growth in the high single-digit range on an as-reported basis. And finally, you should assume a tax rate of slightly less than 30% for 2016.

So hopefully, by knowing the first quarter, you are able to chart out the next 3 quarters for the year, given that we're giving guidance for the high single-digit number. In terms of operating leverage, what we have said when we looked at our business, and we do that actually every year, that we feel very comfortable with an operating margin in excess of 50%. Remember, we are really running the business for revenue growth, so for top line growth, which means that we are having to make a number of investments in -- on the OpEx side in order to generate the bottom line growth. So we are holding that as a metric. And at this point in time, the heavy-duty investments that are happening is in the digital arena, is in the data analytics arena, as well as in the safety and security arena."

We're trying to build out capabilities in the areas we've identified over the last few years in our strategic plans in our Investor Days. Basically, that's in processing, so we get to see more transactions, and we get beyond the clearing, authorizing and settlement space of the existing card kind of business. So that's why you saw us doing -- and you saw in my opening remarks the commentary on the different processing entities and how they fit into what we are doing. It could be in the data cache kind of space, which is the payment gateway area. It could be with things like Provus and Trevica. Those are all in the regular transaction processing spaces. Or it could be in any space that allows us to get to see more transactions. When 6, 7 years ago, we used to see under 40% of our transactions, we now see close to 50%. That enables us to do a better job with our core products, but even more importantly, with our information services and advisers and safety and security products, which is where we're putting some emphasis. So that's the second area beyond processing. Anything that gives us capabilities, strengths, geography, product knowledge or skill sets in data analytics, in safety and security, in information services, in loyalty and rewards, hence, the acquisitions in Australia that we have done, that's all about those spaces. And we haven't wavered off that. And you'll read speculation every once in a while, and speculation is speculation till we can announce anything to you. So don't take it to the bank."

Because on the surface, this does seem like a different approach from the merchants as opposed to the MCX approach because it'll offer the consumers opportunity to use all tender types, including the traditional networks rather than being hyper focused on reducing acceptance cost and trying to force the use of private label and decouple debit payment types. What's your perspective? Do you see a natural change in how the merchants are thinking about mobile wallets?"

And in truth, I think nobody actually knows.

And in truth, I think nobody actually knows. And I think and I said many times, it's going to take a few years for this to settle. That's why even companies like ours, in mobile, you've seen us place effort, energy, money, bets in everything from whether the transaction data is on the handset or it's in the cloud, whether we're working with mobile network operators or hardware manufacturers or distributors of that stuff. This whole mobile space, whether -- is such an evolving space, that I don't think anybody knows the answers. And I think that's what's going on even with the retailers. I think they're trying to find a way to offer a product and a wallet that their consumer can be connected to for loyalty and not just let a digital player own that space, also not just let the banks own that space. The banks, by the way, are doing the same thing. They're trying to make sure they offer products that get the consumer loyal to them and not just let the digital player own that space or the merchant own that space. And of course, the digital player is doing the same thing. So we're all doing a dance right now and I don't think anybody knows the real answer. But I do believe in 2 or 3 underlying factors. The first one is, we, as a network, we believe that a focus on the person who owns the consumer relationship, in this case, the bank or the merchant as it may be, that they are the ones who should be developing the loyalty with that consumer. People like us that are -- we're a B2B2C company. We operate through them and, therefore, our role is to facilitate that and do it in a way that drives our business with them and enables our value-added services to be used. So we're very focused on going through them, whether it be through a Walmart or through a Citibank or through a different bank. The second rule that I think applies universally is that more consumer choice in tenders and payments is better than less. And I think that's just to reduce the friction. There's one large merchant in the United States who doesn't think that way. But otherwise, every other merchant around the world is keen to basically offer more tender choice to their consumer rather than less. And I think that's going to be even more important in the mobile world, to reduce friction, and those kinds of rules apply. And so my view of this, Jason, don't conclude too much yet, but be prepared to see many efforts going on in different places. I think the days of one model when only one big mobile network or one, I'd say, one big mobile wallet or one big e-commerce wallet existed, those days are going away. There's going to be a lot of competition in that space with multiple tenders, with choice for consumers. And it's going to be interesting to watch where this settles."

And you don't see a lot of outbound travel from there. Secondly, there are number of other countries that are just impacted by the stronger dollar, right? And so you can see Australia, Canadian dollar. So there are a number of those economies are actually doing okay, but they're not traveling in dollar-indexed countries as much just because the dollar is so strong. And even though we saw a little bit of a weakening of the dollar for the first quarter, it's still at a very, very high level. So I think you will see all of that coming through this year, albeit at a lower level of impact than what we saw in 2015. In terms of reconciling it to competitors, that's a tough one, right? I mean, you're going have to ask them how they do their methodology. But I would presume that outside of Europe, we're seeing relatively similar trends.

It's just been announced by them that they're changing the terms of the manner in which the exact deal's priced as well as the timing. I think over the next 2 or 3 months, we'll see what that does in terms of how issuers are thinking. My general sense is it'll make it easier for an issuer to know exactly what they're going to get paid from the exercise of the put, and that'll make it a little easier for them to comprehend what they're getting and what they're leaving behind if they make a decision, which, in a sense, is a good thing. That's transparency. And the second part of it is, it's going to be 3 months or so later. So it's just going to make it a little longer out on gestation periods.

The way we manage this, like you manage acquisitions, once it's ours, it's ours. And we've got to find a way to cut expenses elsewhere while investing in the right things. And you will see us do that on Europe. You've seen us do that on Russia. You will see us do it with all these acquisitions and with the strategic investments. That's kind of what we're trying to do: Manage our expenses in all aspects of our lines. 
Okay. So thank you, all, for your questions. I want to leave you with a couple of closing thoughts. I think the first part is, I think our business is performing well. You see that reflected in our strong volume and transaction growth, and that's despite the somewhat uneven global economy. We're growing revenues from our core businesses, but also from our services, as we just had a discussion of, both organically and through the ongoing successful integration of our acquisitions for the last few years. We're pleased with our progress across MasterPass, across the MasterCard Digital Enablement System and our partnerships with many of the digital players. But as I said in the answer to Jason, that's -- there's a lot of things that will evolve there, and this is a marathon, not a sprint. We continue to build on our momentum in safety and security. We're committed to making sure that is what consumers get, no matter which channel or which instrument or device they choose to use to shop on. And we remain very focused on creating a better experience for both cardholders and merchants across all these channels. 
So thank you for your continuing support of the company, and thank you for joining us today."

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for a discussion about our first quarter 2016 financial results.

Following comments from Ajay and Martina, the operator will announce your opportunity to get into the queue for the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] 
This morning's earnings release and the slide deck that will be referenced on this call can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at mastercard.com. The documents have also been attached to an 8-K that we filed with the SEC earlier this morning. A replay of this call will be posted on our website for 1 month.
Before we get started, I'd like to point out a change we have made around reporting the impact of currency on our business. As Martina mentioned on our last earnings call, we realized it has become more difficult for many of you to model our business as FX rates continue to move around. Therefore, beginning this quarter, instead of reporting FX-adjusted growth rates, which only reflected the translational impact of 2 functional currencies, the euro and the Brazilian real, we are now reporting currency-neutral growth rates, which include both the impact from translating functional currencies into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes as well as the underlying impact of local currencies being converted into their functional currency. 
Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I need to remind everyone that today's call may include some forward-looking statements about MasterCard's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance are summarized at the end of our press release as well as contained in our recent SEC filings.
And now with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ajay."
6477196,329405740,967911,"MasterCard Incorporated, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Mastercard Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Barbara. Good morning, everybody. We're very pleased to deliver solid results this quarter and despite what I think everybody would agree is an ongoing mixed global economic environment. On a currency-neutral basis, we reported net revenue grow",2321,"Thank you, Barbara. Good morning, everybody. We're very pleased to deliver solid results this quarter and despite what I think everybody would agree is an ongoing mixed global economic environment. On a currency-neutral basis, we reported net revenue growth of 14% and an EPS growth of 1%. But when you remove the impact of the nonrecurring discrete tax credit and the balance sheet remeasurement related to Venezuela in last year's first quarter, our EPS growth is 12%. 
So now let's take a look at the global economy. I think it's largely unchanged from what we discussed last quarter, with the U.S. economy remaining solid with inflation and wages growing at a similar pace and the unemployment rate kind of holding steady at 5%. We just saw the unemployment rate numbers coming out this morning as well. However, as we know from the Fed comments yesterday, uncertainty remains about when they might take action as well as the potential impact from the global economy. 
So with the rest of the world, the economic outlook continues to be mixed. In Europe, both consumer confidence and economic sentiment declined slightly this quarter. However, recent stimulus measures by the European Central Bank and steady improvement in the unemployment rate, I think, should continue to drive growth across the region, particularly in the U.K. and Germany. 
Asia is still challenged by the continued slowdown in China. Consumer confidence remains cloudy, with the exception being India, where both consumer and business sentiment remain high. 
In Latin America, Brazil is still in the worst recession in the country's history. And of course, economic conditions in Venezuela are deteriorating further. But Mexico is stable and seems to be driven by solid consumer spending and declining inflation. 
So none of this surprises us, but it does seem that we're likely to remain in a period of economic uncertainty. And so that said, we've continued to work hard to ensure that our business maintains its strong growth trajectory and we're seeing double-digit volume and transaction growth across most of our markets. In addition, we're benefiting from the successful integration of our recent acquisitions and continuing to grow our services business. As I told Barbara yesterday, at this time, steady as she goes is what our focus is. 
So now let's move on to some of our recent business activity. During the quarter, we signed a number of new deals and renewals supporting the expansion of our business around the world. I want to give you a few examples. In Europe, we extended our contract in Nordea, which is the largest bank in the Nordics, for their consumer credit and their commercial card portfolios. And we added the rollout of MasterPass and inControl with them. Same in Europe, we also renewed and extended our contract with DSGV, the largest banking group in Martina's home country of Germany, for their credit business. We also included the rollout of MasterPass. Further, we added a new debit portfolio with UniCredit, a leading European financial group based in Italy. In Asia, we just recently renewed and expanded our contracts with both Mitsubishi UFJ NICOS, which is one of the largest issuers in the region, for their consumer and their commercial credit business; and with Maybank, the largest bank in Malaysia, for their credit and debit business. 
And finally, I want to talk a little bit of an example of working with a number of our merchant partners. And I'm going to give you a specific example. This one is of McDonald's. We've talked in previous calls of a partnership with them in the Middle East, now in South Africa as well. The McDonald's are leveraging MasterPass to simplify the ordering process as well as utilizing contactless functionality at their restaurants. Of course, the idea is to improve the drive-through and the dining experience. 
But our McDonald's partnership actually has now gone beyond the core business. They're also a customer of Applied Predictive Technologies, or APT, the cloud-based data and analytics company that we acquired last May. McDonald's used APT's software to analyze a variety of strategic initiatives, including new food and menu items, determining which items should be on the menu and other business priorities. And this is one of the many examples of value we can provide to our merchant partners when you combine products that we have with the data analytics that we're capable of analyzing with them. 
So next, I'd like to give you an update on how we're advancing our strategy in the digital payment space. And I'm going to start with MasterPass. So remember, we're in a marathon here, and we're making great progress with our digital-by-default strategy. That's about enabling issuers to auto-enroll cardholders onto the MasterPass platform without any additional effort having to be made by the consumer. We're looking forward to announcing some bank partners who will be leveraging this ability in the near future. And as we continue to drive new acceptance for MasterPass as well, we're closing in on signing up about 270,000 merchants, representing more than $160 billion in addressable volume. 
Earlier this month, Vodafone Egypt migrated nearly 2 million Vodafone cash wallets from their closed-loop system to our mobile payment gateway platform. That enables us to process all of their transactions. This migration builds on our goal of creating an interoperable network across the Egyptian mobile payment ecosystem that I've spoken to in earlier call and helps to drive our strategy of financial inclusion and, of course, accelerate the conversion of cash. 
And then moving on to MasterCard Digital Enablement Service or MDES. We continue to make significant progress around making digital transaction more secure via encryption and tokenization. In Asia, we are pleased to now have more than 30 issuers signed up for the MDES service. We've also launched the first NFC-based wallet in Latin America with Citi/Banamex in Mexico, utilizing our cloud-based payment technology. And by the way, this wallet, the Citi/Banamex one, was created by developers from our C-SAM acquisition, which actually gave us access to a very talented pool of engineers, who are enabling us to build out capabilities for issuers and merchants exactly like the example of Citi/Banamex. 
And finally, we continue to support our digital partners by helping Android Pay launch in the U.K. and both Samsung Pay and Apple Pay are expanding to Singapore. We're also pleased to be partnering with Facebook as they leverage MDES to test tokenization by enabling pilot participants to interact with sellers and advertisers directly on the platform to complete their purchases, all without ever having to leave the Facebook app. 
So moving on to safety and security. You know there's a lot of effort from us and others going into the space. And as a result of successful biometric trials in the Netherlands and the U.S., that we announced last August, we're actually launching MasterCard Identity Check, fondly referred to as Selfie Pay, in the U.S., Canada and parts of Europe this summer, with more countries to be announced soon. Much of the initial interest in Identity Check has come -- had been attached to the consumer side of these businesses. But interestingly, we were actually currently working with BMO Financial Group, that's the Bank of Montreal in Canada, to roll out the first corporate credit card program using Selfie Pay in both the U.S. and Canada. 
In addition, we recently launched IQ series. That's a suite of products which uses real-time intelligence to empower issuers to make more informed fraud management decisions as well as, most importantly, potentially decrease the growing problem of false declines. Industry studies are showing that 1 out of every 6 cardholders have experienced at least 1 decline because of suspected fraud in the past year. That, by the way, adds up to false declines of $118 billion a year or several times the actual amount of true card fraud. 
Next, we worked with our issuers to deliver additional benefits to our cardholders and helped protect them even more from fraud. As of 2 weeks ago, all MasterCard consumer and small business cardholders are now covered by the industry's first global around-the-world 0 liability promise, ensuring they're not responsible for any unauthorized charges. 
And while on the topic of safety and security, let's spend a minute on the status of EMV in the U.S. We now have about 67% of our consumer credit cards and 24% for our consumer debit cards with chips in them. Roughly 1.2 million U.S. merchant locations are now accepting these cards. And while that's good progress that we're seeing across the industry and also in our own numbers, I mean, everybody recognizes that checkout times at the terminal may appear longer when using a chip card. And to help address that concern, we announced M/Chip Fast, which is to help speed EMV transactions. You leverage the capabilities of our existing contactless technology, which as you know, has been deployed in various transits and other applications around the world. Using that, cardholders will experience magstripe transaction speed, but with the added security of EMV and chip. At the same time, we're going to make this happen in collaboration with the industry, including other networks, to look at how to bring a consistent approach to the market and best support the EMV checkout experience. 
And the point of all these examples is that people shop on all sorts of devices and through multiple channels. And they expect technology to simplify that process while keeping the transaction safe and secure. And I give you all these examples to demonstrate and reinforce our commitment to protecting every transaction. Doesn't matter whether it took place in the physical world or the digital world. We are committed to doing this.
So for the last several minutes talking to you on how we've grown our business through a series of organic investments. And it's important to recognize we've also been growing our business by integrating the various acquisitions we made over the past few years, trying to expand our presence across the payment value chain. So let me give you a couple of examples across information services and processing. 
So let's start by information services, that business within advisers. I mentioned APT earlier when I talked about McDonald's. One of the great things about that subscription-based business model is that it generates a recurring revenue stream with an average contract length of about 3 years. And since the acquisition, we've integrated the sales and product organizations of APT with advisers to drive some pretty good benefits. Let me give you an example. 
Since their acquisition, 30 organizations have subscribed to the APT platform in long-term contracts. And in addition to McDonald's that I talked about, I'll give you a few more: Asahi Breweries in Japan; Sunoco in the U.S.; and in the U.K., KFC. We've also signed more than 15 new deals incremental to APT's earlier business-as-usual efforts, in other words, using MasterCard's client relationships and coverage, including, by the way, one of the largest airlines in Europe, one of the largest retailers in Brazil, 2 of the largest financial institutions in Asia and several in the U.S. What's exciting about all these deals is that they include expanding relationships with long-time APT clients, who now also license newly created product modules, leveraging insights derived from MasterCard data. 
Then finally we launched APT Engage, which is a suite of products which leverages aggregated and anonymized MasterCard payment transaction data combined with APT's proprietary analytics, to help issuers and merchants better understand customer spending behavior, which products have higher loyalty as well as planning for new retail locations. That's about information services.
On to processing. The idea there being to extend our capabilities beyond switching, getting beyond authorizing, clearing and settlement. So in our Payment Transaction Services business, we signed a deal with BNP Paribas in Poland to provide issuer processing services, which, by the way, has also enabled us to become one of the major third-party processors in the country. Here in the U.S., our year-old partnership with Green Dot to process all of their debit and prepaid cards has resulted in the successful migration of now approximately 50 million account files with another 50 million to arc over the balance of 2016. And lastly, in the same business, we enabled several transit operators in Turkey to begin using NFC capability by processing contactless cards and thereby, allowing us to increase our share of domestic processed transactions. 
Staying with processing, on the Prepaid Management Services side, we've just implemented a card program with British Airways to facilitate compensation payments to BA passengers for delayed or canceled flights or lost luggage. We've also launched the first dual-purpose travel insurance and multicurrency prepaid travel product with Flight Centre, which is one of the world's largest travel agencies. 
And lastly, as a result of integrating our acquired assets into our Payment Gateway Services business, we're now able to offer products globally, which include integrated fraud and risk management solutions to both merchants and to acquirers. We're already seeing several new wins, including 4 new deals with key acquirers and resellers in Australia, India, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, who can now offer these capabilities to their merchant base and in turn, that kind of helps us expand our footprint in these markets. We've also worked to ensure that our payment gateway provides acceptance of the latest digital payment methods. We now support both Apple Pay and Android Pay in addition to MasterPass. 
We all recognize these acquisitions require a certain amount of time, investment and resources to integrate. We've worked very hard to ensure this happens seamlessly and efficiently. We're now clearly seeing the benefits that come from them, both in our dialogue and in our engagement with our customers. 
So with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Martina for an update on our financial results and operational metrics. Martina?"

Let me begin by giving you some highlights on the first quarter, starting with Page 3, where you see the difference between as-reported and currency-neutral growth rates for this quarter. As Barbara explained at t",1522,"Thanks, Ajay, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by giving you some highlights on the first quarter, starting with Page 3, where you see the difference between as-reported and currency-neutral growth rates for this quarter. As Barbara explained at the start of this call, we have now changed how we report the impact of currency. So instead of reporting FX-adjusted growth rates, which only reflected the translational impact of the euro and the Brazilian real functional currencies, we are now reporting currency-neutral growth rates, which exclude all impacts of foreign exchange rates. This is both the impact from translating functional currencies into U.S. dollar for reporting purposes as well as the underlying impact of local currencies being converted into their functional currency. We hope that this change will make it easier for you to understand the underlying performance of our business. And all of my comments going forward will pertain to our new currency-neutral growth rates.
Net revenue growth was 14%. While operating expenses grew significantly, this was mostly due to the difference between FX hedging and balance sheet remeasurement gains that we had in the year-ago quarter versus foreign exchange losses on our hedging contracts in this quarter. I will talk more about this when we get into the detail of operating expenses. 
As expected, net income was also impacted by a higher tax rate than in the year-ago quarter due to the nonrecurrence of a discrete U.S. foreign tax credit from which we benefited in the first quarter of 2015. EPS was $0.86, up 1% year-over-year. But as Ajay said, it was impacted by $0.08 due to the discrete tax item that I just mentioned and the Venezuela balance sheet remeasurement gain in the year-ago quarter. When you exclude these 2 items, EPS grew 12%. 
Share repurchases contributed $0.03 per share. And as of April 21, we have $2.9 billion remaining under our current authorization. And lastly, cash flow from operations was $1 billion, and we ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalent and other liquid investments of about $6.2 billion.
So let me turn to Page 4 and here, you can see the operational metrics for the first quarter. Included in these numbers is a positive lift of about 1% due to leap day on all of our metrics. Our worldwide gross dollar volume, or GDV growth, was 13%. On a local currency basis, that's about up 1 ppt from last quarter. Overall, our U.S. GDV grew 10%, made up of credit and debit growth of 11% and 8%, respectively. Total U.S. GDV had a continued 1 ppt headwind from lower gas prices. 
Outside of the U.S., volume growth was 15% on a local currency basis, also up about 1 ppt versus last quarter, with mid- to high teens growth in each region, except Canada, which was impacted by the lapping of our Costco win. Cross-border volume grew 12% on a local currency basis, and that's similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter.
Turning to Page 5. Processed transactions grew 14% globally to $12.6 billion, a 2 ppt increase from what we saw in the fourth quarter, with higher growth in all regions except Canada, again due to the lapping of our Costco win. Globally, the number of cards grew 7% with 2.3 billion MasterCard and Maestro-branded cards issued. 
Let me turn to Page 6 for highlights on a few of the revenue line items. Net revenue growth was 10% as reported or 14% on a currency-neutral basis, given currency headwinds. We saw strong volume and transaction growth, particularly in the U.S. and Europe, and some of which was due to the impact of leap year. Rebates and incentives was slightly higher than what we expected due to deal renewals. 
Looking quickly at the individual line -- revenue line items on a constant -- on a currency-neutral basis. Domestic assessments grew 13%, in line with worldwide GDV growth. Cross-border volume fees grew 14%, while cross-border volume grew 12%. The 2 ppt gap is due to a number of pricing actions, partially offset by a higher mix of intra-Europe activity. Transaction processing fees grew 18%, primarily driven by the 14% growth in processed transactions as well as some pricing. And finally, other revenues grew 22%, driven primarily by our APT acquisition and our safety and security product offerings.
Moving on to Page 7. Here, you can see that total operating expenses increased 25% in the quarter or 29% on a currency-neutral basis. Most of this increase is due to FX movements recorded in our G&A line. I mentioned on our last earnings call that we recorded a large amount of FX gains in the year-ago quarter, mostly due to onetime gains related to Venezuela. The absence of those gains, plus the unrealized losses we recorded this quarter on our FX hedging activity due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to year-end 2015, resulted in an almost $130 million increase to expenses. Excluding this and a 4 ppt impact from acquisitions we did not have in the year-ago quarter, G&A grew 11% as a result of our continuing investment in areas such as digital, data analytics and safety and security. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense is primarily due to the amortization of intangibles related to our acquisitions.
So now I'm going to turn to Slide 8. Let's discuss what we had seen in April through the 21st. While many of our business drivers are similar to the first quarter, direct comparisons to the first quarter are a bit difficult since it had the benefit of both leap day and Easter. 
The numbers through April 21 are as follows: Starting with processed volume, we saw global growth of 13%, the same as in the first quarter. In the U.S., our process volume grew 10%, down roughly 1 ppt from the first quarter, with slower growth in both credit and debit. Gas had less than 1 ppt negative impact on our April growth, down slightly from the first quarter impact. Process volume outside the U.S. grew 16%, up 1 ppt from the last quarter, with higher growth in most regions and primarily driven by Europe and APMEA. Global process transaction growth was 14%, the same as we saw in the first quarter. Process transaction growth outside the U.S. was up a bit, with increases in APMEA and LAC, while the U.S. growth was down almost 2 ppt due to slower growth in credit and debit. With respect to cross-border, our volumes grew at 11% globally, down 1 ppt from last quarter with slower growth in Europe, primarily due to the timing of Easter.
Let me start out with a quick comment about our long-term performance objectives for 2016 to '18, which excluded the impact from our 2 major functional currencies, the euro and the Brazilian real as well as excluded any new M&A activities. Since we are now making the change to recognize the impact of all foreign exchange on our business, we reviewed these objectives and determined that no change is required from what we issued previously because we had baked in very little local FX impact over the 3-year period. Therefore, our 2016 to '18 objectives remain as follows, but are now on a currency-neutral basis: net revenue CAGR of low double digits; operating margin of at least 50%; and an EPS CAGR in the mid-teens and measured off a 2015 pro forma EPS figure of $3.12.
Now moving specifically to this year, there's really no change in our outlook for the business from what we discussed with you on our earnings call back in January. The U.S. and European economies are showing some sign of improvement, but the rest of the world remains challenged. In addition, FX headwinds will continue to be with us into 2016, although likely not as significant as 2015 given current FX rates. And our underlying business fundamentals remain strong. We will continue to run the company for growth, both on the top and on the bottom line as well as balancing our investments with astute expense management. 
As we look at full year 2016 and after factoring in our new currency-neutral methodology, we continue to expect to be at the low end of our 3-year revenue growth range. When you model on an as-reported basis, you will need to adjust for the impact of all currencies. And at the current rates, we estimate that it would mean about a 3 ppt headwind on net revenue growth and about a 4 ppt headwind to the bottom line. 
And let me call out a few other items that you should consider when modeling 2016. So for rebates and incentives, we continue to expect to see growth in the high teens, slightly lower than the 20% as-reported growth rate we saw in 2015. On expenses, we still expect total operating expense growth in the high single-digit range on an as-reported basis. And finally, you should assume a tax rate of slightly less than 30% for 2016. 
Now let me turn the call back to Barbara to begin the Q&A session. Barbara?"

The -- our investments does bounce around by quarter-over-quarter, but we don't give really a quarterly outlook for you. So you're really going to have to think about the high single-digit as-reported numbers for OpEx in total that I was just telling you about. And that does include all of our operating expenses, including the foreign exchange losses that we booked in the first quarter. So hopefully, by knowing the first quarter, you are able to chart out the next 3 quarters for the year, given that we're giving guidance for the high single-digit number. In terms of operating leverage, what we have said when we looked at our business, and we do that actually every year, that we feel very comfortable with an operating margin in excess of 50%. Remember, we are really running the business for revenue growth, so for top line growth, which means that we are having to make a number of investments in -- on the OpEx side in order to generate the bottom line growth. So we are holding that as a metric. And at this point in time, the heavy-duty investments that are happening is in the digital arena, is in the data analytics arena, as well as in the safety and security arena."

So that's why you saw us doing -- and you saw in my opening remarks the commentary on the different processing entities and how they fit into what we are doing. It could be in the data cache kind of space, which is the payment gateway area. It could be with things like Provus and Trevica. Those are all in the regular transaction processing spaces. Or it could be in any space that allows us to get to see more transactions. When 6, 7 years ago, we used to see under 40% of our transactions, we now see close to 50%. That enables us to do a better job with our core products, but even more importantly, with our information services and advisers and safety and security products, which is where we're putting some emphasis. So that's the second area beyond processing. Anything that gives us capabilities, strengths, geography, product knowledge or skill sets in data analytics, in safety and security, in information services, in loyalty and rewards, hence, the acquisitions in Australia that we have done, that's all about those spaces.

And in truth, I think nobody actually knows. And I think and I said many times, it's going to take a few years for this to settle. That's why even companies like ours, in mobile, you've seen us place effort, energy, money, bets in everything from whether the transaction data is on the handset or it's in the cloud, whether we're working with mobile network operators or hardware manufacturers or distributors of that stuff. This whole mobile space, whether -- is such an evolving space, that I don't think anybody knows the answers. And I think that's what's going on even with the retailers. I think they're trying to find a way to offer a product and a wallet that their consumer can be connected to for loyalty and not just let a digital player own that space, also not just let the banks own that space. The banks, by the way, are doing the same thing. They're trying to make sure they offer products that get the consumer loyal to them and not just let the digital player own that space or the merchant own that space. And of course, the digital player is doing the same thing. So we're all doing a dance right now and I don't think anybody knows the real answer. But I do believe in 2 or 3 underlying factors. The first one is, we, as a network, we believe that a focus on the person who owns the consumer relationship, in this case, the bank or the merchant as it may be, that they are the ones who should be developing the loyalty with that consumer. People like us that are -- we're a B2B2C company. We operate through them and, therefore, our role is to facilitate that and do it in a way that drives our business with them and enables our value-added services to be used. So we're very focused on going through them, whether it be through a Walmart or through a Citibank or through a different bank. The second rule that I think applies universally is that more consumer choice in tenders and payments is better than less. And I think that's just to reduce the friction. There's one large merchant in the United States who doesn't think that way. But otherwise, every other merchant around the world is keen to basically offer more tender choice to their consumer rather than less. And I think that's going to be even more important in the mobile world, to reduce friction, and those kinds of rules apply. And so my view of this, Jason, don't conclude too much yet, but be prepared to see many efforts going on in different places. I think the days of one model when only one big mobile network or one, I'd say, one big mobile wallet or one big e-commerce wallet existed, those days are going away. There's going to be a lot of competition in that space with multiple tenders, with choice for consumers. And it's going to be interesting to watch where this settles."

And you don't see a lot of outbound travel from there. Secondly, there are number of other countries that are just impacted by the stronger dollar, right? And so you can see Australia, Canadian dollar. So there are a number of those economies are actually doing okay, but they're not traveling in dollar-indexed countries as much just because the dollar is so strong. And even though we saw a little bit of a weakening of the dollar for the first quarter, it's still at a very, very high level. So I think you will see all of that coming through this year, albeit at a lower level of impact than what we saw in 2015. In terms of reconciling it to competitors, that's a tough one, right? I mean, you're going have to ask them how they do their methodology. But I would presume that outside of Europe, we're seeing relatively similar trends.

Belgium and Turkey are both in our European numbers, and both Belgium and Turkey have had a somewhat difficult time with their security situation over the last few months. And Paris, which got impacted so unfortunately in November last year, has still not recovered to what it used to be prior to the number. And so there's a little bit of that inside Europe as well.

The second part about Visa and its Visa Europe stuff, as I said, to the first question when I got asked in the beginning, it's still early. It's just been announced by them that they're changing the terms of the manner in which the exact deal's priced as well as the timing. I think over the next 2 or 3 months, we'll see what that does in terms of how issuers are thinking. My general sense is it'll make it easier for an issuer to know exactly what they're going to get paid from the exercise of the put, and that'll make it a little easier for them to comprehend what they're getting and what they're leaving behind if they make a decision, which, in a sense, is a good thing. That's transparency. And the second part of it is, it's going to be 3 months or so later. So it's just going to make it a little longer out on gestation periods.

Okay. So thank you all for your questions. I want to leave you with a couple of closing thoughts. I think the first part is, I think our business is performing well. You see that reflected in our strong volume and transaction growth, and that's despite the somewhat uneven global economy. We're growing revenues from our core businesses, but also from our services, as we just had a discussion of, both organically and through the ongoing successful integration of our acquisitions for the last few years. We're pleased with our progress across MasterPass, across the MasterCard Digital Enablement System and our partnerships with many of the digital players. But as I said in the answer to Jason, that's -- there's a lot of things that will evolve there, and this is a marathon, not a sprint. We continue to build on our momentum in safety and security. We're committed to making sure that is what consumers get, no matter which channel or which instrument or device they choose to use to shop on. And we remain very focused on creating a better experience for both cardholders and merchants across all these channels.

And finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I need to remind everyone that today's call may include some forward-looking statements about MasterCard's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance are summarized at the end of our press release as well as contained in our SEC filings. 
With that, I will now turn the call over to Ajay."
6477196,369244781,1015127,"MasterCard Incorporated, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Mastercard Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Barbara.

Our business continues to perform well. We're very pleased with our strong results this quarter. As you could see from the release on a currency-neutral basis and excluding the special items related to litigation, we reported both net revenue and EPS growth of 14%. Martina is going to get into the financial details, so I'm going to talk a little bit about the global economy first. And other than the Brexit vote, very little has changed since the last quarter. The United States economy is still holding steady. Consumer confidence up slightly, stable job growth, low inflation. And frankly, prior to the Brexit vote, many parts of Europe were showing steady signs of improvement in both consumer confidence and unemployment. And while it's still too early to predict the full impact of Brexit, we will obviously watch that situation very carefully. 
The outlook for Asia remains cautious. We've got a prolonged slowdown in China, weaker-than-expected recovery in Australia. India continues to be a bright spot, both consumer and business sentiment there remain. 
In Latin America, Brazil is still in a deep recession, but interestingly, a modest increase in business confidence is beginning to show signs that the economy may be reaching a bottom. 
In Venezuela, economic conditions continue to deteriorate, but Mexico is in a steady growth. It's been driven by solid consumer spending and low unemployment. And so as a result, it's likely we're going to remain in a period of economic and political uncertainty at least in the near term. Having said all of this, our business continues to grow. Our fundamentals remain strong. We are seeing double-digit volume and transaction growth across most of our markets, and we continue to win deals by differentiating ourselves with services. 
Now I wasn't on the call last week that Martina and Tim had on VocaLink, so let me just quickly share my views about the planned acquisition of VocaLink. The deal is an important component of our strategy to participate in all forms of electronic payments and to enhance our services for the benefit of our customers and our partners. And VocaLink itself is very interesting to us for a couple of reasons. First, when you look at all payment floors in the world's top 50 countries, and this is not just retail payments, ACH represents about 50% of that total. And the potential of Fast ACH is growing, especially given that it is being promoted by a number of regulatory bodies in Europe, the United States and in other parts of the world. 
Second, we believe that VocaLink is the best asset in this space from both a technology standpoint as well as having a very talented group of people who are respected across the industry. Beyond the opportunity available in that primary U.K. market, they have been successful in operating and licensing their Fast ACH technology in other markets, in Sweden, in Singapore and Thailand. They're also the primary supplier of Fast ACH technology to the clearinghouse in the United States. 
And finally, the ability to see both card and ACH transactions would enable us to offer an even broader range of data analytics and other services through our partners. Our card network has been powering our growth in both consumer and commercial payment for many years. And with this acquisition, we will now have a new set of capabilities to capture additional opportunities in B2B, in P2P and government payment flows regardless of what payment they will use. 
So that's VocaLink. Then we move on to a brief update on China. In June, the People's Bank of China released the final regulation foreign card networks to operate domestically in China. We are currently working through the requirements. We need a much better understanding around their national security and cybersecurity standards before we determine how best to proceed. We got way whether apply for license alone or with a business partner. It's all connected to this deeper understanding. Meanwhile, what we are doing is we're continuing to work on building out our technology on the ground as well as working with our Chinese customers on new issuance and broadening acceptance. 
So moving on from there, a couple of recent developments on the legal front. In the United States, the Brooklyn District Court's 2013 approval of the U.S. merchant class action settlement, as you know, was overturned by the Court of Appeals in late June. And obviously, we're disappointed by that decision. The Charlie and Visa are in some detail on their earnings call last week. So I will rehash the same details. The case will be sent back to the District Court. we expect the first order of business appoint counsel to be injunctive release class. MasterCard will then work with all parties to see if they can find ways to rebound the settlement in line with the Court of Appeals decision. And as you'd expect, our forecast on that work will be on rule changes and the scope of the release, which were issues in the Court of Appeals decision, not the money damages. 
On the money damages, to our financial exposure remains capped at 12% of any settlement or judgment under the agreements we entered into with the bank defendant and with Visa in 2011. 
Additionally, in July, a U.K. court issued a decision in one of the U.K. merchant suits seeking interchange damages. That court have ordered a portion of the damages that have been seeking. And that amount, along with anticipated legal fees and costs, was taken as a charge in the second quarter. That's a special item you see in our results. Although we don't believe that suffered any damages, they're gratified by several aspects of the court's decision. Just one example, the court recognized that an appropriate level of domestic interchange is substantially higher than the 20 and 30 basis points imposed by the European interchange fee regulation that went into effect last December. 
So now let's move on to some of our recent business activity. And during the quarter, we find a number of new deals and renewals, supporting the extension of our business around the world. I'm going to run through a few examples. We continue to make progress in our U.S. consumer business. Recent highlights include the renewal of our partnership with Huntington National Bank across their debit, credit and commercial businesses, expanded acquisitions of new consumer credit accounts with several of the largest banks in the market. In addition, we had an important business in cobrand space, including American Airlines, the Citi and Barclay card, with both issuers, as well as Intercontinental Hotels, Bed Bath & Beyond and some others. 
We also renewed, just announced it yesterday actually, our consumer credit co-brand with PayPal, an important complement of our overall relationship with them, which as you heard from Dan on his call, we're all actively seeking to expand.APT
We continue to drive our commercial business. One of the most important verticals for us is travel. And now, in addition to our relationship with Enit and Travelport that we've talked of in previous calls, we just signed a new global deal with Amadeus, a leading travel technology company. Today, travel agencies make more than $300 billion in the annual payments to airlines, hotels and other travel providers, largely via bank transfers and checks. What this agreement does is it combines Amadeus' new B2B wallet and virtual payment technology with MasterCard's commercial card capabilities. We will provide travel agencies and travel providers with a fast, secure and automated way to pay and get paid. 
We continue perform well outside of the U.S. In Canada, we signed 2 new issuer deals, renewed 4 issuer in co-brand deals, including NBNA, which is a division now of the Toronto Dominion Bank and Presidents Charged Financial, which is part of, one of the largest retailers in Canada, which, by the way, included issuance. 
In Europe, we are pleased to sign an expanded agreement with the, one of the market leaders in Turkey for a larger portion of their credit portfolio. Prior to this deal, most of their credit business was with a competitor. 
In addition to the deals I mentioned previously, we're continuing our momentum in the co-brand space globally. We are very excited. We renewed our partnership with Walmart in Canada and also signed a new agreement with them in China. 
We have partnered with Access Bank in India as well as Miles and More, one of the largest global frequent flyer and rewards programs to launch India's first multicurrency, co-branded, prepaid card that supports up to 17 currencies to facilitate both domestic and international card users. 
Finally, you've heard us say many times how we've been successful in using services as a key strategic differentiator for winning deals. As one example of this, we're happy to have renewed a long-term debit agreement with Bank, one of Australia's largest retail banks into [ph] commercial cards and a flip of the majority of their consumer credit business. That deal includes a full complement of our services, consisting of advisers, loyalty solutions and our suite of safety and security products. We signed a deal with, one of the largest card issuers in Italy to begin issuing debit cards as well as to use advisers consulting services. We've made a lot more from about how we're differentiating with services at our upcoming Investor Day in September. 
So moving on to our digital strategy. You know we've long said this is a marathon, not a sprint. But we've made some significant progress this past quarter and there's more to come. So about 2 weeks ago, we announced some important industry milestone when we became the first network to deliver a digital payment service across all devices, all channels. With MasterPass, consumers can now decide how and where they prefer to shop, whether that's in app, online or in store using a bank-branded offering from the issuer of their choice, knowing that their payment information is protected by our technology. 
We've also previously talked about our digital by default strategy, which enables issuers to auto-enroll cardholders onto the MasterPass service through their online banking app without any additional effort by the consumer. We're very pleased that more than 18 million accounts will be automatically enabled by the end of this year. 18 [ph] million. As the services began to roll out globally, starting with Europe and Asia later this year, in the United States, the Bank of America with Citibank and Capital One. 
Further, issuers can use MasterPass to differentiate their own wallet offering by using our open APIs to integrate other services from us, such as purchase alerts or paying with points or services that they have developed themselves. 
And lastly, in terms of geography, including the recent expansion to Greece, Switzerland, Columbia and Ukraine, we are now live in 33 markets. 
From an acceptance standpoint, MasterPass is currently available at hundreds of thousands of merchants online and in-app. We are pleased to have recently added IKEA. We'll soon be adding Saks, Lauren Taylor and the Cheesecake Factory as more examples. With the introduction of NFC capability, consumers allow to use MasterPass at the more than 5 million merchant locations in 77 countries that accept contactless payments today. Contactless will first be available to Android device owners in the United States later this month, with a global expansion to follow shortly thereafter. 
Last topic is tokenization technology. The MasterCard digital enablement service, or MDES. We continue to make solid progress and are making transactions more secure for MasterPass, which by the way, is already enabled for contactless transactions with online and in-app to follow, but also for our digital partners. 
Most recently, we helped Android Pay expand to Singapore as well as Apple Pay to Canada, Hong Kong, Switzerland and France. In addition, we're also pleased to be partnering with Microsoft on the launch of their cloud-based mobile wallet solution for Windows 10 compatible devices. Other examples illustrates our continued commitment to deliver secure consumer payment experience to our cardholders using the mobile device of their choice. 
So with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Martina for an update on our financial results and operational metrics. Martina?"
6477196,369244781,1015127,"MasterCard Incorporated, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Mastercard Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Ajay, and good morning, everyone. So let me begin by giving you some highlights on the second quarter, starting with Page 3, where you see the difference between non-GAAP reported and currency-neutral growth rates for this quarter. So these figure",1417,"Thanks, Ajay, and good morning, everyone. So let me begin by giving you some highlights on the second quarter, starting with Page 3, where you see the difference between non-GAAP reported and currency-neutral growth rates for this quarter. So these figures exclude the impact of the special items taken in both this quarter and the previous quarter related to the judgment issued on Saints Barry and the settlement we made with Tesco, the 2 largest merchants involved in the U.K. merchant litigation. I'd like to point out a few items using the currency-neutral growth rate. 
As Ajay said, net revenue growth was 14% for the quarter, coming in a bit higher than our expectations. Operating expenses grew 13%, primarily due to continued investments to support our strategic initiative as well as higher legal costs, of which the majority are not likely to recur. We saw a higher tax rate than the year ago -- in the year-ago quarter due to the non-recurrence of a discrete U.S. foreign tax credit, from which we benefited in the second quarter of 2015. 
And with all that, EPS was $0.96, up 14% year-over-year. Share repurchases contributed about $0.03 per share. And as of July 21, we have $2.7 billion remaining under our current authorization. 
And lastly, cash flow from operations was $1.1 billion, and we ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and other liquid investments of about $6.4 billion. 
So let's turn to Page 4, where you can see the operational metrics for the second quarter. When comparing these numbers to the last quarter, just remember, the first quarter saw about a 1 ppt benefit from leap day, which explains most of the differences. Our worldwide gross dollar volume, or GDV, growth was 11% on a local currency basis, down 2 ppt from last quarter. 
Overall, our U.S. GDV grew 8%, made up of credit and debit growth of 7% and 8%, respectively. Total U.S. GDV had less than 1 ppt headwind from lower gas prices. 
Now outside of the U.S., volume growth was 13% on a local currency basis, and that's about down 2 ppt versus last quarter, with low to mid-teens growth in each region. 
And beginning on June 9, as a result of the new EU regulations, our volume numbers reflect the absence of domestic co-badge volume that we do not process, particularly in France. In the second quarter, we saw an impact of 1 ppt on worldwide volume growth and a 3 ppt impact to European volume growth. The impact will become more pronounced over the next year, and this has been contemplated in all of our forward guidance. 
Cross-border volume grew 10% on a local currency basis, slightly lower than the 12% we saw in the first quarter. 
Let me turn to Page 5. And here, you can see processed transactions grew 14% globally to $13.7 billion. That's a very similar increase from what we saw in the first quarter. And globally, the number of cards grew 7%, with 2.3 billion MasterCard and Maestro-branded cards issued. 
On Page 6, here, you see some highlights on a few of the detailed revenue line items. Unless otherwise stated, the growth numbers I call out both here and on the next slide are all on a currency-neutral basis. So as I said, net revenue growth was 14%, a bit stronger than we expected. We saw continued strong volume and transaction growth, plus a higher contribution from some of our services businesses. Rebates and incentives grew 23%, primarily due to higher volumes as well as some deal renewals. 
Looking particularly at the individual revenue line items. Domestic assessments grew 10%, while worldwide GDV grew by 11%. And the difference is primarily due to mix. Cross-border volume fees grew 14%, while cross-border volume grew 10%. The 4 ppt gap is due to a number of pricing actions, partially offset by a higher mix of intra-Europe activity. Transaction processing fees grew 21%, primarily driven by the 14% growth in processed transactions as well as some pricing. 
And finally, other revenue grew 25%, driven primarily by services such as advisers, APT and our safety and security product offerings. 
Moving now to Page 7. Here, you can see the total operating expenses after excluding special items increased 12% in the quarter or 13% on a currency-neutral basis. Our APT acquisition contributed about 1 ppt to these growth rates. In addition, 5 ppt was due to higher legal costs. As I already said, the majority of these aren't likely to recur. So the remaining 7 ppt was primarily due to higher personnel costs related to our continued investments in strategic areas such as digital, data analytics and geographic expansion. Also, our data processing expense growth is normally in line with transaction growth. However, this past quarter, the growth was higher due to the fee. We now paid to for processing domestic Russian transactions. 
Let me turn to Slide 8. And here, we can discuss what we have seen in July through the 21st, when most of our drivers are up from the second quarter. The numbers through July 21 are as follows. Starting with processed volume, we saw global growth of 11%, slightly lower than the 12% we saw in the second quarter. In the U.S., our process to volume grew 8%, down 1 ppt from the second quarter, with slower growth in credit, but higher growth in debit. GAAP had less than 1 ppt negative impact on our July growth. That's very similar to the second quarter. And processed volume outside of the U.S. grew 15%, up a bit from the second quarter, primarily driven by Europe and Latin America. Globally, processed transactions growth was 17%, up 3 ppt from what we saw in the second quarter. Processed transaction growth outside the U.S. was up 1 ppt, with increases in Europe and Latin America, and the U.S. growth was up 6 ppt, driven by new opportunities of PAN routing. 
With respect to cross-border, our volumes actually grew 14% globally, and that's up 4 ppt from last quarter, with faster growth in Europe. We also saw faster growth in Middle East and Africa, which was likely related to the timing of Ramadan. 
So now looking to the full year of 2016, there's really no change in our business outlook from what we discussed with you in our earnings back in April. Currently, we don't anticipate any significant impact from Brexit this year. However, foreign exchange headwinds will continue to be with us in 2016, although they continue to moderate from the recent past given current FX rates. 
Our underlying business fundamentals remain strong, and we will continue to run the company for growth, both on the top and bottom line as well as balancing our investments with astute expense management. 
As we look at full year 2016 and after factoring in our currency-neutral methodology, we continue to expect to be at the low end of our 3-year revenue growth range. When you model on an as-reported basis, you will need to adjust for the impact of our currencies. And at current rates, we estimate that that would mean about a 2 ppt headwind to net revenue growth and the bottom line, which is less of a headwind than what we said on our April earnings call. 
Now let me call out a few other items that you should consider when modeling 2016. For rebates and incentives, we now expect to see growth of about the same as the 20% as-reported growth rate we saw in 2015 after factoring in the impact of the new American Airlines co-brand renewal. On expenses, we continue to expect total operating expense growth in the high single-digit range for our as-reported results, excluding special items. On a currency-neutral basis, we continue to expect low double-digit growth. Be mindful that we're ramping up our efforts on MasterPass, which impacts G&A and A&M, particularly in the third quarter. You should now assume a tax rate of slightly less than 29% for 2016. 
And finally, on the subject of share repurchases. Now while year-to-date, we have bought back about $1.8 billion, most of that occurred earlier in the year, as we were out of the market for most of the second quarter given the pending transaction. As I said last week, once our trading window opens in early August, we expect to continue our repurchasing activity. 
So now let me turn the call back to Barbara to begin the Q&A session. Barbara?"

The second one is the most transactional question, and I can tell you that places like Turkey and other locations. There's no doubt that the impact of some of this activity does impact what's going on there. Our cross-border growth to Turkey is down significantly compared to last year. Cardholders from Germany, Russia, Sweden and the U.S. are not traveling there with the same level of frequency as they work early. also watching travel to other markets in France, and so on. Interestingly, in the U.K., there's actually an increase of inbound cross-border expense. So it's kind of bouncing around, but specifically in a couple of countries by terrorism. There's no doubt that it causes some angst in cross-border travel. Having said that, remember what Martina said. Right now, our cross-border volumes for the first few weeks of this quarter. So in these [ph] few weeks are up compared to where we were last quarter. And in fact, Europe was one of the contributors to that being up. So the Visa and PayPal. I've said this a few times to number of you when I met you. Back in June of 2013, we have implemented a new approach to digital wallet operators that applied to all stage wallets. And by the way, not just PayPal. So I want you to understand that. With the intent of bringing consistency and transparency to the system. Transactions should go flow through with clear data flowing through the brand of the bank and the network should be visible to the consumer and the merchant. There are many reasons for us to be thoughtful about that digital wallet operator principles. We're still exactly those principles, and I think what I'm really pleased to see through a constructive dialogue with Dan Sherman and his management team at PayPal. The PayPal is actually working to resolve some of those concerns we all have around the lack of transparency, around these wallets as well as ACH clearing. And that's what you saw in the announcement that he and Charlie made a few days ago. And if you heard Dan mentioned in his earnings call, during discussions other payment space to work with similar concepts are somewhat different, but the same space. We have worked with PayPal for many years. We have good working relationship with them and a wide range of opportunities. I just told you we just renewed credit co-brand portfolio with them, in fact, yesterday. And so I'll give you a sense of the PayPal trying to work with the industry. I think this is actually a good thing for PayPal and for the industry because at the end of the day, providing consumers the ability of having seamless simple ways of paying is good for all of us. Everything better than use cash and that's where we're headed."

The little challenges of the new national security and cybersecurity policy has not yet actually been passed into a form that is visible to us in a document where we can say, ""Okay, got it.

So we're a little bit of in between territory, between understanding that they want to have a thoughtful national security and cybersecurity policy, which they're entitled to. But we don't understand implications for us in terms of operating a network on the ground. So whether we operate with our own license are we operate with a JV with someone else or we do some creative thinking about this, will all depend on clarity of these kinds of elements that they put into the policy they've recently announced. That's what we're trying to sort out. Meanwhile, there's a lot of stuff to do for us in China. We're continuing work on issuance, continuing work on building up acceptance or we've been continuing some work on basic technology development, so that when we get clarity of this, and Martina and I are confident we understand what we're signing up for, then we can move forward relatively quickly from that space.

And it's not just about pricing. It's also about speed of approval. It's about many different things that they look at.

What I've been telling folks is it's actually not that different if you get down to the bank level, your actually closer to apples-to-apples on a pricing business.

And lastly, in terms of what kind of services we're actually delivering to the client. When you look at the largest client, I have to believe that we have very similar pricing to Visa. It might be different in terms of when you look at the medium and then the smaller clients. Now having said that, what Javier and his team have done in a really great way is using the global capability of MasterCard, with all the products and services that we have around the globe, to be bringing that in a seamless fashion to our European clients. And that's what they really like to see, right? And this is what -- does not happen with our competitor given that they were 2 different companies. And given that we are generally the smaller company, I always have to say that we have to put more points on the board.

VocaLink is about us wanting to the real players in every aspect of electronic payments and the way they are developing.

And VocaLink is one of the few players that have not only an outstanding Fast ACH platform implemented in the U.K., but also implemented in other countries. And most of ACH tends to be local. VocaLink demonstrate an ability to take that Fast ACH platform and make it globally adaptable. And you can imagine the possibilities of that over the next decade. So I really want you to think about us and the VocaLink transaction. If it all works out, once we're through all the regulatory steps, our strategic intent is to play across all aspects of these payments players for individual consumer merchants payments, but also B2B, P2P and government payment flows.

Second, we've got a work really hard between now and the next few months to get the VocaLink acquisition through all the processes of regulatory approval and get our company to be an excellent player in the ACH and Fast ACH game, first with the responsibility to the U.K. because we are going to be a large player there in terms of this, but also with the ability to see how we take it elsewhere. Our priorities remain in the area of loyalty and rewards, in the area of data analytics and information services, in the area of safety and security. To some degree, all this depends on us being able to see more transactions. To be able to see and handle and touch more transactions. Processing assets are very helpful in that space, so we tend to play through these as we go along.

And so we're seeing a fairly large-scale changes coming through with some very large merchants. So that's what we're seeing first. So for instance, a grocery store like Aldi, which is a very gruffy discount store. They don't even have shelves in their store. You grab actually goods out of the boxes. They just flip open. They're finally -- actually opening or have opened card payments. And there on the number of those large retailers who are now willing to do it. And we see it pretty much in every European country. What we haven't seen yet as much movement is on the smaller merchants, and that's obviously where there's a lot of work that we still have to do. And we're hoping that, that will continue to allow us to change the secular trend in Europe, which outside of the U.K., right, in the U.K. a lot of of the electronic side.

I can tell you that I'm not clearly understanding enough about what exclusivity is Visa signed with PayPal because we're not encountering any difficulty while talking to PayPal in that space. So I don't know exactly what the nature of that exclusivity is. You've got to ask PayPal or Visa because pretty clear we've got enough good conversations going on not just now, but for a little while. Obviously, we're stressed between these conversations, right? I mean, our digital wallet operator rules when they went into place in 2013, were not replicated by others. As well it position clear at that time that we wanted to clear -- to have a clear transparent, fair, methodology in this digital wallet development. It's been sometimes good, sometimes stressful, but constructive. And my view always have been that if PayPal wants or everybody else like that a digital wallet operator wants to use our rails of credit and debit to be able to build their own model, then they can't just use our when it suits them and use another rail to go around us and the banks when it suits them there's got to be a more constructive partnership. So yes, we have a constructive partnership on co-branded cards, yes, we do. We've had it earlier. We've renewed again literally yesterday so that tells you that, that partnership has depth beyond one signature or one contract with somebody or the other. We're also -- we've all been discussing the whole aspect of how this digital wallet operator system would work. Now if PayPal's methodology from what I've learned from their announcement from Visa. If they reflect what our digital wallet operator policies put into place then any fees you make from them they'll go it because the fees not meant to be there if they're doing what's in the policy. But I can tell you that that fee is de minimis. That's not use fee to get them to change their policy. The fee use to manage through all the difficulties that their policies are creating in terms of data and transaction management. So that's to be clear about what this is all about. This is forcing this is about our perspective of how the market should develop transparently and openly to merchants, to consumers, to banks, to PayPal and to all of us. That's what we're trying to build. So I think it's a constructive dialogue. I think PayPal is very much a part of that dialogue. Then this could all end up in a good way for the industry at all for banks as well as for networks, as well as for PayPal. Will there be changes in the dynamics for economics bank versus the network versus with PayPal? Everything to do with digital changes though his economics. But that doesn't mean just taking out other transactions and growing in volume as well. So I have sort of generally positive view about where this is going. I'm not by the way, I'm not saying there aren't hurdles along the way, there aren't roadblocks along the way. We've been talking about for 2, 3 years. We don't yet have an announcement to tell you of the kind of transaction that Visa has. So everybody has their own ways of approaching transactions. Enough their own competitive dynamic and their own way of thinking about where the strategy is going. That's actually okay in an open competitive market. It's a good thing."

And so I think you made it pretty clear that you want to work more closely with PayPal, et cetera, but from a -- just a process perspective and as it relates to the stage wallet fee, do you have to reach some sort of agreement with PayPal or others that would be perfect to that? Or can they just start passing through the transaction data and hence, avoid the stage wallet fee? And then I guess, more importantly, as we look at the case with the merchants in like your prepared comments, you indicated that you wanted to pursue an adjusted settlement, et cetera. I'm just wondering if there would be perhaps any benefit to MasterCard to open up the discussions with those groups more widely. So perhaps we could address some of the issues that may be evolving out of EMV, et cetera. Or you prefer to keep those 2 cases separate, if you will."

So the second question honestly, the litigation is complicated enough without trying to broaden things. When you already have an agreement with between tons of banks, Visa, MasterCard, tons of people in the other end, it doesn't pay to start broadening things. Who knows how this will go. I can't predict because there's other players who all have to come to an agreement. But we'll see. We -- I think we made real progress in the other actually good deal on the ground, which previous signed off on. But they do, and while we could be disappointed, we got a bite. So we're going to find our way through that working with other folks. I don't think I can tell you which way that'll get resolved. I wouldn't even like to speculate on that. The part of PayPal I want to make for you guys get focused on some stage wallet fee because that's actually not that this is about. The fee is de minimis. This is not a large fee either for us or for PayPal, by the way. That's what this is about. It's about a set of rules and policies around what the digital wallet operator rules out yet that's what this is. And could PayPal comply with those rules without some master agreement to this? Yes, we could. But we already have an agreement so there are a number of things. And they're the only additional wallet operator out there who wants to work closer with banks and networks and merchants. In my view of this is if we can collaborate together, if we can make this easier for consumer in the process and for a merchant in the process, that's a good thing. We should be doing it."

Our business continues to perform well. We're very pleased with our strong results this quarter. As you could see from the release, on a currency-neutral basis and excluding the special items related to litigation, we reported both net revenue and EPS growth of 14%. Martina is going to get into the financial details, so I'm going to talk a little bit about the global economy first. And frankly, other than the Brexit vote, very little has changed since the last quarter. The United States economy is still holding steady. Consumer confidence up slightly, stable job growth, low inflation. And frankly, prior to the Brexit vote, many parts of Europe were showing steady signs of improvement in both consumer confidence and unemployment. And while it's still too early to predict the full impact of Brexit, we will obviously watch that situation very carefully. 
The outlook for Asia remains cautious. We've got a prolonged slowdown in China, weaker-than-expected recovery in Australia. India continues to be a bright spot, both consumer and business sentiment there remain strong.
In Latin America, Brazil is still in a deep recession but interestingly, a modest increase in business confidence is beginning to show signs that the economy may be reaching a bottom. 
In Venezuela, economic conditions continue to deteriorate, but Mexico is in a steady growth path. It's been driven by solid consumer spending and low unemployment. And so as a result, it's likely we're going to remain in a period of economic and political uncertainty at least in the near term. Having said all of this, our business continues to grow. Our fundamentals remain strong. We are seeing double-digit volume and transaction growth across most of our markets, and we continue to win deals by differentiating ourselves with services. 
Now I wasn't on the call last week that Martina and Tim had on VocaLink, so let me just quickly share my views about the planned acquisition of VocaLink. The deal is an important component of our strategy to participate in all forms of electronic payments and to enhance our services for the benefit of our customers and our partners. And VocaLink itself is very interesting to us for a couple of reasons. First, when you look at all payment flows in the world's top 50 countries, and this is not just retail payments, ACH represents about 50% of that total. And the potential of Fast ACH is growing, especially given that it is being promoted by a number of regulatory bodies in Europe, the United States and in other parts of the world. 
Second, we believe that VocaLink is the best asset in this space from both a technology standpoint as well as having a very talented group of people who are respected across the industry. Beyond the opportunities available in that primary U.K. market, they have been successful in operating and licensing their Fast ACH technology in other markets: in Sweden, in Singapore and Thailand. They're also the primary supplier of Fast ACH technology to the clearing house in the United States. 
And finally, the ability to see both card and ACH transactions would enable us to offer an even broader range of data analytics and other services through our partners. Our card network has been powering our growth in both consumer and commercial payment for many years. And with this acquisition, we will now have a new set of capabilities to capture additional opportunities in B2B, in P2P and government payment flows regardless of what payment rail they use. So that's VocaLink. 
Then we move on to a brief update on China. In June, the People's Bank of China released the final regulation to foreign card networks to operate domestically in China. We are currently working through the requirements. We need a much better understanding around their national security and cybersecurity standards before we determine how best to proceed. We've got to weigh whether we can apply for license alone or with a business partner. It's all connected to this deeper understanding. 
Meanwhile, what we are doing is we're continuing to work on building out our technology on the ground as well as working with our Chinese customers on new issuance and broadening acceptance. 
So moving on from there, a couple of recent developments on the legal front. In the United States, the Brooklyn District Court's 2013 approval of the U.S. merchant class action settlement, as you know, was overturned by the Court of Appeals in late June. And obviously, we're disappointed by that decision. Charlie and Visa revealed it in some detail on their earnings call last week. So I won't rehash the same details. The case will be sent back to a District Court. There we expect the first order of business will be to appoint counsel to the injunctive release class. MasterCard will then work with all parties to see if they can find ways to rebound the settlement in line with the Court of Appeals decision. And as you'd expect, our forecast on that work will be on rule changes and the scope of the release, which were the issues in the Court of Appeals decision, not the money damages. 
On the money damages, note that our financial exposure remains capped at 12% of any settlement or judgment under the agreements we entered into with the bank defendant and with Visa in 2011. 
Additionally, in July, a U.K. court issued a decision in one of the U.K. merchant suits seeking interchange damages. That court awarded Sainsbury's  a portion of the damages that they'd been seeking. And that amount, along with anticipated legal fees and costs, was taken as a charge in the second quarter. That's a special item you see in our results. Although we don't believe the retailer suffered any damages, they gratified by several aspects of the court's decision. Just one example, the court recognized that an appropriate level of domestic interchange is substantially higher than the 20 and 30 basis points imposed by the European interchange fee regulation that went into effect last December. 
So now let's move on to some of our recent business activity. And during the quarter, as been normal, we find a number of new deals and renewals, supporting the expansion of our business around the world. I'm going to run through a few examples. We continue to make progress in our U.S. consumer business. Recent highlights include the renewal of our partnership with Huntington National Bank across their debit, credit and commercial businesses, expanded acquisitions of new consumer credit accounts with several of the largest banks in the market. In addition, we had important wins in the co-brand space, including American Airlines, the Citi and Barclaycard, with both JV assured [ph] as well as Intercontinental Hotels, Bed Bath & Beyond and some others. 
We also renewed, just announced it yesterday actually, our consumer credit co-brand with PayPal, an important complement of our overall relationship with them, which as you heard from Dan Schulman on his call, we're all actively seeking to expand.
We continue to drive our commercial business forward. One of the most important verticals for us is travel. And now, in addition to our relationship with eNett and Travelport that we've talked of in previous calls, we just signed a new global deal with Amadeus, a leading travel technology company. Today, travel agencies make more than $300 billion in the annual payments to airlines, hotels and other travel providers, largely via bank transfers and checks. What this agreement does is it combines Amadeus' new B2B wallet and virtual payment technology with MasterCard's commercial card capabilities. We will provide travel agencies and travel providers with a fast, secure and automated way to pay and get paid. 
We continue to perform well outside of the U.S. In Canada, we signed 2 new issuer deals, renewed 4 issuer and co-brand deals, including: NBNA, which is a division now of the Toronto Dominion Bank; and President's Choice Financial, which is part of Loblaw, one of the largest retailers in Canada, which, by the way, included exclusive issuance. 
In Europe, we are pleased to sign an expanded agreement with Yapi Kredi, one of the market leaders in Turkey, for a larger portion of their credit portfolio. Prior to this deal, most of their credit business was with a competitor. 
In addition to the deals I mentioned previously, we're continuing our momentum in the co-brand space globally. We are very excited. We renewed our partnership with Walmart in Canada and also signed a new agreement with them in China. 
We have partnered with Access Bank in India as well as Miles & More, one of the largest global frequent flyer and rewards programs to launch India's first multicurrency, co-branded, prepaid card that supports up to 17 currencies to facilitate both domestic and international card usage. 
Finally, you've heard us say many times how we've been successful with using services as a key strategic differentiator for winning deals. As one example of this, we're happy to have renewed a long-term debit agreement with Bendigo and Adelaide Bank, one of Australia's largest retail banks, includes commercial cards and a flip of the majority of their consumer credit business. That deal includes a full complement of our services, consisting of advisers, loyalty solutions and our suite of safety and security products. We signed a deal with CartaSi, one of the largest card issuers in Italy, to begin issuing debit cards as well as to use advisers' consulting services. You'll hear a lot more from us about how we're differentiating with services at our upcoming Investor Day in September. 
So moving on to our digital strategy. You know we've long said this is a marathon, not a sprint. But we've made some significant progress this past quarter and there's more to come. So about 2 weeks ago, we announced some important industry milestone when we became the first network to deliver a digital payment service across all devices, all channels. With MasterPass, consumers can now decide how and where they prefer to shop, whether that's in app, online or in store using a bank-branded offering from the issuer of their choice, knowing that their payment information is protected by our technology. 
We've also previously talked about our digital by default strategy, which enables issuers to auto-enroll cardholders on to the MasterPass service through their online banking app without any additional effort by the consumer. We're very pleased that more than 18 million accounts will be automatically enabled by the end of this year. 18 million. As the services began to roll out globally, starting with Europe and Asia and later this year in the United States, the Bank of America with Citibank and Capital One. 
Further, issuers can use MasterPass to differentiate their own wallet offering by using our open APIs to integrate other services from us, such as purchase alerts or paying with points or services that they have developed themselves. 
And lastly, in terms of geography, including the recent expansions to Greece, Switzerland, Colombia and Ukraine, we are now live in 33 markets. 
From an acceptance standpoint, MasterPass is currently available at hundreds of thousands of merchants online and in-app. We are pleased to have recently added IKEA. We'll soon be adding Saks, Lord and Taylor and The Cheesecake Factory as more examples. With the introduction of NFC capability, consumers will now be able to use MasterPass at the more than 5 million merchant locations in 77 countries that accept contactless payments today. Contactless will first be available to Android device owners in the United States later this month, with a global expansion to follow shortly thereafter. 
Last topic is tokenization technology, the MasterCard Digital Enablement service, or MDES. We continue to make solid progress and are making transactions more secure for MasterPass, which by the way, is already enabled for contactless transactions with online and in-app to follow but also for our digital partners. 
Most recently, we helped Android Pay expand to Singapore as well as Apple Pay to move into Canada, Hong Kong, Switzerland and France. In addition, we're also pleased to be partnering with Microsoft on the launch of their cloud-based mobile wallet solution for Windows 10 compatible devices. All these examples illustrates our continued commitment to deliver secure consumer payment experience to our cardholders using the mobile device of their choice. 
So with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Martina for an update on our financial results and operational metrics. Martina?"
6477196,369244781,1015670,"MasterCard Incorporated, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Mastercard Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Ajay, and good morning, everyone. So let me begin by giving you some highlights on the second quarter, starting with Page 3, where you see the difference between non-GAAP reported and currency-neutral growth rates for this quarter. So these figure",1422,"Thanks, Ajay, and good morning, everyone. So let me begin by giving you some highlights on the second quarter, starting with Page 3, where you see the difference between non-GAAP reported and currency-neutral growth rates for this quarter. So these figures exclude the impact of the special items taken in both this quarter and the previous quarter related to the judgment issued on Sainsbury's and the settlement we made with Tesco, the 2 largest merchants involved in the U.K. merchant litigation. I'd like to point out a few items using the currency-neutral growth rate. 
As Ajay said, net revenue growth was 14% for the quarter, coming in a bit higher than our expectations. Operating expenses grew 13%, primarily due to continued investments to support our strategic initiative as well as higher legal costs, of which the majority are not likely to recur. We saw a higher tax rate than the year ago -- in the year-ago quarter due to the non-recurrence of a discrete U.S. foreign tax credit, from which we benefited in the second quarter of 2015. 
And with all that, EPS was $0.96, up 14% year-over-year. Share repurchases contributed about $0.03 per share. And as of July 21, we have $2.7 billion remaining under our current authorization. And lastly, cash flow from operations was $1.1 billion, and we ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and other liquid investments of about $6.4 billion. 
So let's turn to Page 4, where you can see the operational metrics for the second quarter. When comparing these numbers to the last quarter, just remember, the first quarter saw about a 1 ppt benefit from leap day, which explains most of the differences. Our worldwide gross dollar volume, or GDV, growth was 11% on a local currency basis, down 2 ppt from last quarter. 
Overall, our U.S. GDV grew 8%, made up of credit and debit growth of 7% and 8%, respectively. Total U.S. GDV had less than 1 ppt headwind from lower gas prices. 
Now outside of the U.S., volume growth was 13% on a local currency basis, and that's about down 2 ppt versus last quarter, with low to mid-teens growth in each region. 
And beginning on June 9, as a result of the new EU regulation, our volume numbers reflect the absence of domestic co-badge volume that we do not process, particularly in France. In the second quarter, we saw an impact of 1 ppt on worldwide volume growth and a 3 ppt impact to European volume growth. The impact will become more pronounced over the next year, and this has been contemplated in all of our forward guidance. 
Cross-border volume grew 10% on a local currency basis, slightly lower than the 12% we saw in the first quarter. 
Let me turn to Page 5. And here, you can see processed transactions grew 14% globally to $13.7 billion. That's a very similar increase from what we saw in the first quarter. And globally, the number of cards grew 7%, with 2.3 billion MasterCard and Maestro-branded cards issued. 
On Page 6. Here you see some highlights on a few of the detailed revenue line items. Unless otherwise stated, the growth numbers I call out both here and on the next slide are all on a currency-neutral basis. So as I said, net revenue growth was 14%, a bit stronger than we expected. We saw continued strong volume and transaction growth, plus a higher contribution from some of our services businesses. Rebates and incentives grew 23%, primarily due to higher volumes as well as some deal renewals. 
Looking particularly at the individual revenue line items. Domestic assessments grew 10%, while worldwide GDV grew by 11%. And the difference is primarily due to mix. Cross-border volume fees grew 14%, while cross-border volume grew 10%. The 4 ppt gap is due to a number of pricing actions, partially offset by a higher mix of intra-Europe activity. Transaction processing fees grew 21%, primarily driven by the 14% growth in processed transactions as well as some pricing. 
And finally, other revenue grew 25%, driven primarily by services such as advisers, APT and our safety and security product offerings. 
Moving now to Page 7. Here, you can see the total operating expenses after excluding special items increased 12% in the quarter or 13% on a currency-neutral basis. Our APT acquisition contributed about 1 ppt to these growth rates. In addition, 5 ppt was due to higher legal costs. As I already said, the majority of these aren't likely to recur. So the remaining 7 ppt was primarily due to higher personnel costs related to our continued investments in strategic areas such as digital, data analytics and geographic expansion. Also, our data processing expense growth is normally in line with transaction growth. However, this past quarter, the growth was higher due to the fee. We now pay to NSP Cards for processing domestic Russian transactions. 
Let me turn to Slide 8. And here, we can discuss what we have seen in July through the 21, where most of our drivers are up from the second quarter. The numbers through July 21 are as follows. Starting with processed volume, we saw global growth of 11%, slightly lower than the 12% we saw in the second quarter. In the U.S., our process volume grew 8%, down 1 ppt from the second quarter, with slower growth in credit but higher growth in debit. GAAP has less than a 1 ppt negative impact on our July growth. That's very similar to the second quarter. And processed volume outside of the U.S. grew 15%, up a bit from the second quarter, primarily driven by Europe and Latin America. Globally, processed transactions growth was 17%, up 3 ppt from what we saw in the second quarter. Processed transaction growth outside the U.S. was up 1 ppt, with increases in Europe and Latin America. And the U.S. growth was up 6 ppt, driven by new opportunities of PIN routing. 
With respect to cross-border -- across border our volumes actually grew 14% globally, and that's up 4 ppt from last quarter with faster growth in Europe. We also saw faster growth in Middle East and Africa, which was likely related to the timing of Ramadan. 
So now looking to the full year of 2016, there's really no change in our business outlook from what we discussed with you in our earnings back in April. Currently, we don't anticipate any significant impact from Brexit this year. However, foreign exchange headwinds will continue to be with us in 2016, although they continue to moderate from the recent past given current FX rates. 
Our underlying business fundamentals remain strong, and we will continue to run the company for growth, both on the top and bottom line as well as balancing our investments with astute expense management. 
As we look at full year 2016 and after factoring in our currency-neutral methodology, we continue to expect to be at the low end of our 3-year revenue growth range. When you model on an as-reported basis, you will need to adjust for the impact of our currencies. And at current rates, we estimate that, that would mean about a 2 ppt headwind to net revenue growth and the bottom line, which is less of a headwind than what we said on our April earnings call. 
Now let me call out a few other items that you should consider when modeling 2016. For rebates and incentives, we now expect to see growth of about the same as the 20% as-reported growth rate we saw in 2015 after factoring in the impact of the new American Airlines co-brand renewal. On expenses, we continue to expect total operating expense growth in the high single-digit range for our as-reported results, excluding special items. On a currency-neutral basis, we continue to expect low double-digit growth. Be mindful that we're ramping up our efforts on MasterPass, which impacts G&A and A&M, particularly in the third quarter. You should now assume a tax rate of slightly less than 29% for 2016. 
And finally, on the subject of share repurchases. Now while year-to-date, we have bought back about $1.8 billion, most of that occurred earlier in the year, as we were out of the market for most of the second quarter given the pending VocaLink transaction. As I said last week, once our trading window opens in early August, we expect to continue our repurchasing activity. 
So now let me turn the call back to Barbara to begin the Q&A session. Barbara?"

Our",505,"So a little bit of both. The second one is the most transactional question, and I can tell you that places like Turkey and other such locations, there's no doubt that the impact of some of this activity in terrorism does impact what's going on there. Our cross-border growth to Turkey is down significantly compared to last year. Cardholders from Germany, Russia, Sweden and the U.S. are not traveling there with the same level of frequency as they were clearly. They also could be watching travel to other markets in France, and so on. Interestingly, in the U.K., there's actually an increase of inbound cross-border expense. So it's kind of bouncing around but specifically in a couple of countries impacted by terrorism. There's no doubt that it causes some angst in cross-border travel. Having said that, remember what Martina said. Right now, our cross-border volumes for the first few weeks of this quarter, so in the few weeks are up compared to where we were last quarter. And in fact, Europe is one of the contributors to that being up. So about Visa and PayPal. I've said this a few times to a number of you when I met you. Back in June of 2013, we have implemented a new approach to digital wallet operators that apply to all stage wallets. And by the way, not just PayPal. So I want you to understand that. With the intent of bringing consistency and transparency to the system, transactions should flow through with clear data flowing through the brand of the bank and the network should be visible to the consumer and the merchant. There are many reasons for us to be thoughtful about that digital wallet operator principles. We're still exactly where we are with those principles, and I think what I'm really pleased to see through a constructive dialogue with Dan Schulman and his management team at PayPal, that PayPal is actually working to resolve some of those concerns we all have around the lack of transparency, around these stage wallets as well as ACH clearing. And that's what you saw in the announcement that he and Charlie made a few days ago. And if you heard Dan mention in his earnings call, they're in discussions with others in the payment space to work with similar concepts or somewhat different but the same space. We have worked with PayPal for many years. We have good working relationship with them and a wide range of opportunities. I just told you we just renewed a credit co-brand portfolio with them, in fact, yesterday. And so I'll give you a sense of the -- on the manner in which PayPal is trying to work with the industry. I think this is actually a good thing for PayPal and for the industry because at the end of the day, providing consumers the ability of having seamless simple ways of paying is good for all of us. Everything is better than having to use cash and that's where we're headed."

They put in a couple of classes around complying with their new national security and cybersecurity policy. The little challenges of the new national security and cybersecurity policy has not yet actually been passed into a form that is visible to us in a document where we can say, ""Okay, got it. Got it. Got it. Do this, do that. We're okay."" It's not in that form. So we're a little bit of in between territory, between understanding that they want to have a thoughtful national security and cybersecurity policy, which they're entitled to. But we don't understand the implications for us in terms of operating a network on the ground. So whether we operate with our own license or we operate with a JV with somebody else or we do some other creative thinking around this, will all depend on clarity of these kinds of elements that they put into the policy they've recently announced. That's what we're trying to sort out. Meanwhile, there's a lot of stuff to do for us in China. We're continuing work on issuance, continuing work on building out acceptance or we've been continuing some work on basic technology development, so that when we get clarity of this, and Martina and I are confident we understand what we are signing up for, then we can move forward relatively quickly from that space.

And lastly, in terms of what kind of services we're actually delivering to the client. When you look at the largest client, I have to believe that we have very similar pricing to Visa. It might be different in terms of when you look at the medium and then the smaller clients. Now having said that, what Javier and his team have done in a really great way is using the global capability of MasterCard, with all the products and services that we have around the globe, to be bringing that in a seamless fashion to our European clients. And that's what they really like to see, right. And this is what -- did not happen with our competitor given that they were 2 different companies.

I think, you remember like I said VocaLink is not about competing with Visa Europe, by the way. VocaLink is about us wanting to be real players in every aspect of electronic payments and the way they are developing.

And VocaLink is one of the few players that have not only an outstanding Fast ACH platform implemented in the U.K. but also implemented in other countries, and most of ACH tends to be local. VocaLink demonstrates an ability to take that Fast ACH platform and make it globally adaptable. And you can imagine the possibilities of that over the next decade. So I really want you to think about us during the VocaLink transaction. If it all works out, once we're through all the regulatory steps, our strategic intent is to play across all aspects of these payments rails for individual consumer to merchants payments, but also B2B, P2P and government payment flows.

To some degree, all this depends on us being able to see more transactions. To be able to see and handle and touch more transactions. Processing assets are very helpful in that space, so we tend to play through these as we go along. And I -- honestly, I think Martina's done great working with me because she's looking at a few deals all the time. So talking about it great sartorial comment but that's true."

And as you might remember, or during the last couple of years leading up to the changes that came in last December of 2015, we were hoping that, that would actually change, the view of some of the merchants to be wanting to accept card payments because quite frankly, now card payments are heck a lot cheaper than what you have to do with cash, right? And so we are seeing fairly large-scale changes coming through with some very large merchants. So that's what we're seeing first. So for instance, a grocery store like ALDI, which is a very gruffy discount store, they don't even have shelves in their store. You grab actually goods out of the boxes. They just flip open. They're finally actually opening or have opened card payments. And there are a number of those large retailers who are now willing to do it. And we see it pretty much in every European country. What we haven't seen yet as much movement is on the smaller merchants, and that's obviously where there's a lot of work that we still have to do. And we are hoping that, that will continue to allow us to change the secular trends in Europe, which outside of the U.K., right, in the U.K. a lot is already electronic side but in the rest of the Europe, in the continent, I always call it that this is still an emerging country for us. That will help us on the secular trend from cash and check to electronic forms of payments and we'll help our numbers over time."

I can tell you that I'm not clearly understanding enough about what exclusivity Visa signed with PayPal because we're not encountering any difficulty while talking to PayPal in that space. So I don't know exactly what the nature of that exclusivity is. You've got to ask PayPal or Visa because that's pretty clear that we've got enough good conversations going on not just now but for a little while. Obviously, we're stressed between these conversations, right? I mean, our digital wallet operator rules when they went into place in 2013, were not replicated by others. As well it may not position during that time that we wanted to clear -- to have a clear transparent, fair, methodology in this digital wallet development. It's been sometimes good, sometimes stressful, but constructive. And my view always have been that if PayPal wants or everybody else like that, a digital wallet operator wants to use our rails of credit and debit to be able to build their own model, then they can't just use our rails when it suits them and use another rail to go around us and the banks when it suits them. There's got to be a more constructive partnership. So yes, we have a constructive partnership on co-branded cards, yes, we do. We've had it earlier. We've renewed again literally yesterday. So that tells you that, that partnership has depth beyond one signature or one contract with somebody or the other. We're also -- we've all been discussing the whole aspect of how this digital wallet operator system would work. Now if PayPal's methodology of operations from what I've learned from their announcements with Visa, if they reflect what our digital wallet operator policies put into place so, yes, then any fees you make from them they'll go away because the fee is not meant to be there if they're doing what's in the policy. But I can tell you that, that fee is de minimis. That's not -- they will not try to use a fee to get them to change their policy. The fee was used to manage through all the difficulties that their policies are creating in terms of data and transaction management. So let's just be clear about what this is all about. This is not about forcing and doing anything, this is about our perspective of how the market should develop transparently and openly to merchants, to consumers, to banks, to PayPal and to all of us. That's what we're trying to build. So I think it's a constructive dialogue. I think PayPal is very much a part of that dialogue. Then this could all end up in a good way for the industry as a whole, for banks as well as for networks, as well as for PayPal. So will there be changes in the dynamics of the economics for a bank versus the network versus with PayPal? Everything to do with digital changes the whole economics. But that doesn't mean that, that is just taking out other transactions and growing in volume as well. So I have sort of generally positive view about where this is going. I'm not -- by the way, I'm not saying there aren't hurdles along the way, there aren't roadblocks along the way. Remember, we've been talking about it for 2, 3 years. We don't yet have an announcement to tell you of the kind of transaction that Visa has. So everybody has their own ways of approaching transactions, and has their own competitive dynamic and their own way of thinking about where the strategy is going. That's actually okay in an open competitive market. It's a good thing."

And then, I guess, more importantly as we look at the case with the merchants, and like your prepared comments you then indicate that you wanted to pursue an adjusted settlement, et cetera. I'm just wondering if there would be perhaps any benefit to MasterCard to open up the discussions with those groups more widely.

This is not a large fee either for us or for PayPal, by the way. That's not what this is about. It's about a set of rules and policies around what the digital wallet operator rules are. That's what this is. And could PayPal comply with those rules without some master agreement to this? Yes, they could. But we already have an agreement with them on a number of things. And they're the only digital wallet operator out there who wants to work closer with banks and networks and merchants. My view of this is if we can collaborate together, if we can make this easier for a consumer in the process and for a merchant in the process, that's a good thing. We should be doing it."

Our business continues to perform well. We're very pleased with our strong results this quarter. As you could see from the release, on a currency-neutral basis and excluding the special items related to litigation, we reported both net revenue and EPS growth of 14%. Martina is going to get into the financial details, so I'm going to talk a little bit about the global economy first. And frankly, other than the Brexit vote, very little has changed since the last quarter. The United States economy is still holding steady. Consumer confidence up slightly, stable job growth, low inflation. And frankly, prior to the Brexit vote, many parts of Europe were showing steady signs of improvement in both consumer confidence and unemployment. And while it's still too early to predict the full impact of Brexit, we will obviously watch that situation very carefully. 
The outlook for Asia remains cautious. We've got a prolonged slowdown in China, weaker-than-expected recovery in Australia. India continues to be a bright spot, both consumer and business sentiment there remain strong.
In Latin America, Brazil is still in a deep recession but interestingly, a modest increase in business confidence is beginning to show signs that the economy may be reaching a bottom. 
In Venezuela, economic conditions continue to deteriorate, but Mexico is in a steady growth path. It's been driven by solid consumer spending and low unemployment. And so as a result, it's likely we're going to remain in a period of economic and political uncertainty at least in the near term. Having said all of this, our business continues to grow. Our fundamentals remain strong. We are seeing double-digit volume and transaction growth across most of our markets, and we continue to win deals by differentiating ourselves with services. 
Now I wasn't on the call last week that Martina and Tim had on VocaLink, so let me just quickly share my views about the planned acquisition of VocaLink. The deal is an important component of our strategy to participate in all forms of electronic payments and to enhance our services for the benefit of our customers and our partners. And VocaLink itself is very interesting to us for a couple of reasons. First, when you look at all payment flows in the world's top 50 countries, and this is not just retail payments, ACH represents about 50% of that total. And the potential of Fast ACH is growing, especially given that it is being promoted by a number of regulatory bodies in Europe, the United States and in other parts of the world. 
Second, we believe that VocaLink is the best asset in this space from both a technology standpoint as well as having a very talented group of people who are respected across the industry. Beyond the opportunities available in that primary U.K. market, they have been successful in operating and licensing their Fast ACH technology in other markets: in Sweden, in Singapore and Thailand. They're also the primary supplier of Fast ACH technology to the clearing house in the United States. 
And finally, the ability to see both card and ACH transactions would enable us to offer an even broader range of data analytics and other services through our partners. Our card network has been powering our growth in both consumer and commercial payment for many years. And with this acquisition, we will now have a new set of capabilities to capture additional opportunities in B2B, in P2P and government payment flows regardless of what payment rail they use. So that's VocaLink. 
Let me move on to a brief update on China. In June, the People's Bank of China released the final regulation to foreign card networks to operate domestically in China. We are currently working through the requirements. We need a much better understanding around their national security and cybersecurity standards before we determine how best to proceed. We've got to weigh whether we can apply for license alone or with a business partner. It's all connected to this deeper understanding. Meanwhile, what we are doing is we're continuing to work on building out our technology on the ground as well as working with our Chinese customers on new issuance and broadening acceptance. 
So moving on from there, a couple of recent developments on the legal front. In the United States, the Brooklyn District Court's 2013 approval of the U.S. merchant class action settlement, as you know, was overturned by the Court of Appeals in late June. And obviously, we're disappointed by that decision. Charlie and Visa revealed it in some detail on their earnings call last week. So I won't rehash the same details. The case will be sent back to a District Court. There we expect the first order of business will be to appoint counsel to the injunctive release class. MasterCard will then work with all parties to see if they can find ways to reform the settlement in line with the Court of Appeals decision. And as you'd expect, our forecast on that work will be on rule changes and the scope of the release, which were the issues in the Court of Appeals decision, not the money damages. 
On the money damages, note that our financial exposure remains capped at 12% of any settlement or judgment under the agreements we entered into with the bank defendant and with Visa in 2011. 
Additionally, in July, a U.K. court issued a decision in one of the U.K. merchant suits seeking interchange damages. That court awarded Sainsbury's a portion of the damages that they'd been seeking. And that amount, along with anticipated legal fees and costs, was taken as a charge in the second quarter. That's the special item you see in our results. Although we don't believe the retailer suffered any damages, we’re gratified by several aspects of the court's decision. Just one example, the court recognized that an appropriate level of domestic interchange is substantially higher than the 20 and 30 basis points imposed by the European interchange fee regulation that went into effect last December. 
So now let's move on to some of our recent business activity. And during the quarter, as been normal, we find a number of new deals and renewals supporting the expansion of our business around the world. I'm going to run through a few examples. We continue to make progress in our U.S. consumer business. Recent highlights include the renewal of our partnership with Huntington National Bank across their debit, credit and commercial businesses, expanded acquisitions of new consumer credit accounts with several of the largest banks in the market. In addition, we had important wins in the co-brand space, including American Airlines, the Citi and Barclaycard, with both JV assured [ph] as well as Intercontinental Hotels, Bed Bath & Beyond and some others. 
We also renewed, just announced it yesterday actually, our consumer credit co-brand with PayPal, an important complement of our overall relationship with them, which as you heard from Dan Schulman on his call, we're all actively seeking to expand.
We continue to drive our commercial business forward. One of the most important verticals for us is travel. And now, in addition to our relationship with eNett and Travelport that we've talked of in previous calls, we just signed a new global deal with Amadeus, a leading travel technology company. Today, travel agencies make more than $300 billion in the annual payments to airlines, hotels and other travel providers, largely via bank transfers and checks. What this agreement does is it combines Amadeus' new B2B wallet and virtual payment technology with MasterCard's commercial card capabilities. We will provide travel agencies and travel providers with a fast, secure and automated way to pay and get paid. 
We continue to perform well outside of the U.S. In Canada, we signed 2 new issuer deals, renewed 4 issuer and co-brand deals, including: NBNA, which is a division now of the Toronto Dominion Bank; and President's Choice Financial, which is part of Loblaw, one of the largest retailers in Canada, which, by the way, included exclusive issuance. 
In Europe, we are pleased to sign an expanded agreement with Yapi Kredi, one of the market leaders in Turkey, for a larger portion of their credit portfolio. Prior to this deal, most of their credit business was with a competitor. 
In addition to the deals I mentioned previously, we're continuing our momentum in the co-brand space globally. We are very excited. We renewed our partnership with Walmart in Canada and also signed a new agreement with them in China. 
We have partnered with Access Bank in India as well as Miles & More, one of the largest global frequent flyer and rewards programs, to launch India's first multicurrency, co-branded, prepaid card that supports up to 17 currencies to facilitate both domestic and international card usage. 
Finally, you've heard us say many times how we've been successful with using services as a key strategic differentiator for winning deals. As one example of this, we're happy to have renewed a long-term debit agreement with Bendigo and Adelaide Bank, one of Australia's largest retail banks, includes commercial cards and a flip of the majority of their consumer credit business. That deal includes a full complement of our services, consisting of advisers, loyalty solutions and our suite of safety and security products. We signed a deal with CartaSi, one of the largest card issuers in Italy, to begin issuing debit cards as well as to use advisers' consulting services. You'll hear a lot more from us about how we're differentiating with services at our upcoming Investor Day in September. 
So moving on to our digital strategy. You know we've long said this is a marathon, not a sprint. But we've made some significant progress this past quarter and there's more to come. So about 2 weeks ago, we announced some important industry milestone when we became the first network to deliver a digital payment service across all devices, all channels. With MasterPass, consumers can now decide how and where they prefer to shop, whether that's in app, online or in store using a bank-branded offering from the issuer of their choice, knowing that their payment information is protected by our technology. 
We've also previously talked about our digital by default strategy, which enables issuers to auto-enroll cardholders on to the MasterPass service through their online banking app without any additional effort by the consumer. We're very pleased that more than 18 million accounts will be automatically enabled by the end of this year. 18 million, as the services began to roll out globally, starting with Europe and Asia and later this year in the United States, the Bank of America with Citibank and Capital One. 
Further, issuers can use MasterPass to differentiate their own wallet offering by using our open APIs to integrate other services from us, such as purchase alerts or paying with points or services that they have developed themselves. 
And lastly, in terms of geography, including the recent expansions to Greece, Switzerland, Colombia and Ukraine, we are now live in 33 markets. 
From an acceptance standpoint, MasterPass is currently available at hundreds of thousands of merchants online and in-app. We are pleased to have recently added IKEA. We'll soon be adding Saks, Lord and Taylor and The Cheesecake Factory as more examples. With the introduction of NFC capability, consumers will now be able to use MasterPass at the more than 5 million merchant locations in 77 countries that accept contactless payments today. Contactless will first be available to Android device owners in the United States later this month, with a global expansion to follow shortly thereafter. 
Last topic is tokenization technology, the MasterCard Digital Enablement service, or MDES. We continue to make solid progress and are making transactions more secure for MasterPass, which by the way, is already enabled for contactless transactions with online and in-app to follow but also for our digital partners. 
Most recently, we helped Android Pay expand to Singapore as well as Apple Pay to move into Canada, Hong Kong, Switzerland and France. In addition, we're also pleased to be partnering with Microsoft on the launch of their cloud-based mobile wallet solution for Windows 10 compatible devices. All these examples illustrate our continued commitment to deliver secure consumer payment experience to our cardholders using the mobile device of their choice. 
So with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Martina for an update on our financial results and operational metrics. Martina?"
6477196,369244781,1015959,"MasterCard Incorporated, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Mastercard Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Ajay, and good morning, everyone. So let me begin by giving you some highlights on the second quarter, starting with Page 3, where you see the difference between non-GAAP reported and currency-neutral growth rates for this quarter. So these figure",1422,"Thanks, Ajay, and good morning, everyone. So let me begin by giving you some highlights on the second quarter, starting with Page 3, where you see the difference between non-GAAP reported and currency-neutral growth rates for this quarter. So these figures exclude the impact of the special items taken in both this quarter and the previous quarter related to the judgment issued on Sainsbury's and the settlement we made with Tesco, the 2 largest merchants involved in the U.K. merchant litigation. I'd like to point out a few items using the currency-neutral growth rate. 
As Ajay said, net revenue growth was 14% for the quarter, coming in a bit higher than our expectations. Operating expenses grew 13%, primarily due to continued investments to support our strategic initiatives as well as higher legal costs, of which the majority are not likely to recur. We saw a higher tax rate than the year ago -- in the year-ago quarter due to the non-recurrence of a discrete U.S. foreign tax credit from which we benefited in the second quarter of 2015. 
And with all that, EPS was $0.96, up 14% year-over-year. Share repurchases contributed about $0.03 per share. And as of July 21, we have $2.7 billion remaining under our current authorization. And lastly, cash flow from operations was $1.1 billion, and we ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and other liquid investments of about $6.4 billion. 
So let's turn to Page 4, where you can see the operational metrics for the second quarter. When comparing these numbers to the last quarter, just remember, the first quarter saw about a 1 ppt benefit from leap day, which explains most of the differences. Our worldwide gross dollar volume, or GDV, growth was 11% on a local currency basis, down 2 ppt from last quarter. 
Overall, our U.S. GDV grew 8%, made up of credit and debit growth of 7% and 8%, respectively. Total U.S. GDV had less than 1 ppt headwind from lower gas prices. 
Now outside of the U.S., volume growth was 13% on a local currency basis, and that's about down 2 ppt versus last quarter, with low to mid-teens growth in each region. 
And beginning on June 9, as a result of the new EU regulation, our volume numbers reflect the absence of domestic co-badge volume that we do not process, particularly in France. In the second quarter, we saw an impact of 1 ppt on worldwide volume growth and a 3 ppt impact to European volume growth. The impact will become more pronounced over the next year, and this has been contemplated in all of our forward guidance. 
Cross-border volume grew 10% on a local currency basis, slightly lower than the 12% we saw in the first quarter. 
Let me turn to Page 5. And here, you can see processed transactions grew 14% globally to $13.7 billion. That's a very similar increase from what we saw in the first quarter. And globally, the number of cards grew 7%, with 2.3 billion MasterCard and Maestro-branded cards issued. 
On Page 6. Here you see some highlights on a few of the detailed revenue line items. Unless otherwise stated, the growth numbers I call out both here and on the next slide are all on a currency-neutral basis. So as I said, net revenue growth was 14%, a bit stronger than we expected. We saw continued strong volume and transaction growth, plus a higher contribution from some of our services businesses. Rebates and incentives grew 23%, primarily due to higher volumes as well as some deal renewals. 
Looking strictly at the individual revenue line items. Domestic assessments grew 10%, while worldwide GDV grew by 11%. And the difference is primarily due to mix. Cross-border volume fees grew 14%, while cross-border volume grew 10%. The 4 ppt gap is due to a number of pricing actions, partially offset by a higher mix of intra-Europe activity. Transaction processing fees grew 21%, primarily driven by the 14% growth in processed transactions as well as some pricing. And finally, other revenue grew 25%, driven primarily by services such as advisers, APT and our safety and security product offerings. 
Moving now to Page 7. Here, you can see the total operating expenses after excluding special items increased 12% in the quarter or 13% on a currency-neutral basis. Our APT acquisition contributed about 1 ppt to these growth rates. In addition, 5 ppt was due to higher legal costs. As I already said, the majority of these aren't likely to recur. So the remaining 7 ppt was primarily due to higher personnel costs related to our continued investments in strategic areas such as digital, data analytics and geographic expansion. Also, our data processing expense growth is normally in line with transaction growth. However, this past quarter, the growth was higher due to the fee we now pay to NSP Cards for processing domestic Russian transactions. 
Let me turn to Slide 8. And here, we can discuss what we have seen in July through the 21, where most of our drivers are up from the second quarter. The numbers through July 21 are as follows. Starting with processed volume, we saw global growth of 11%, slightly lower than the 12% we saw in the second quarter. In the U.S., our process volume grew 8%, down 1 ppt from the second quarter, with slower growth in credit but higher growth in debit. GAAP had less than a 1 ppt negative impact on our July growth. That's very similar to the second quarter. And processed volume outside of the U.S. grew 15%, up a bit from the second quarter, primarily driven by Europe and Latin America. Globally, processed transactions growth was 17%, up 3 ppt from what we saw in the second quarter. Processed transaction growth outside the U.S. was up 1 ppt, with increases in Europe and Latin America. And the U.S. growth was up 6 ppt, driven by new opportunities of PIN routing. 
With respect to cross-border -- across border, our volumes actually grew 14% globally, and that's up 4 ppt from last quarter with faster growth in Europe. We also saw faster growth in Middle East and Africa, which was likely related to the timing of Ramadan. 
So now looking to the full year of 2016, there's really no change in our business outlook from what we discussed with you in our earnings back in April. Currently, we don't anticipate any significant impact from Brexit this year. However, foreign exchange headwinds will continue to be with us in 2016, although they continue to moderate from the recent past given current FX rates. 
Our underlying business fundamentals remain strong, and we will continue to run the company for growth, both on the top and bottom line as well as balancing our investments with astute expense management. 
As we look at full year 2016 and after factoring in our currency-neutral methodology, we continue to expect to be at the low end of our 3-year revenue growth range. When you model on an as-reported basis, you will need to adjust for the impact of all currencies. And at current rates, we estimate that, that would mean about a 2 ppt headwind to net revenue growth and the bottom line, which is less of a headwind than what we said on our April earnings call. 
Now let me call out a few other items that you should consider when modeling 2016. For rebates and incentives, we now expect to see growth of about the same as the 20% as-reported growth rate we saw in 2015 after factoring in the impact of the new American Airlines co-brand renewal. On expenses, we continue to expect total operating expense growth in the high single-digit range for our as-reported results, excluding special items. On a currency-neutral basis, we continue to expect low double-digit growth. Be mindful that we're ramping up our efforts on MasterPass, which impacts G&A and A&M, particularly in the third quarter. You should now assume a tax rate of slightly less than 29% for 2016. 
And finally, on the subject of share repurchases. Now while year-to-date, we have bought back about $1.8 billion, most of that occurred earlier in the year, as we were out of the market for most of the second quarter given the pending VocaLink transaction. As I said last week, once our trading window opens in early August, we expect to continue our repurchasing activity. 
So now let me turn the call back to Barbara to begin the Q&A session. Barbara?"

The second one is the most transactional question, and I can tell you that places like Turkey and other such locations, there's no doubt that the impact of some of this activity and terrorism does impact what's going on there.",504,"So a little bit about both. The second one is the most transactional question, and I can tell you that places like Turkey and other such locations, there's no doubt that the impact of some of this activity and terrorism does impact what's going on there. Our cross-border growth to Turkey is down significantly compared to last year. Cardholders from Germany, Russia, Sweden and the U.S. are not traveling there with the same level of frequency as they were, clearly. We’re also closely watching travel to other markets, France and so on. Interestingly, in the U.K., there's actually an increase of inbound cross-border expense. So it's kind of bouncing around but specifically in a couple of countries impacted by terrorism. There's no doubt that it causes some angst in cross-border travel. Having said that, remember what Martina said. Right now, our cross-border volumes for the first few weeks of this quarter, so only a few weeks, are up compared to where we were last quarter. And in fact, Europe is one of the contributors to that being up. So about Visa and PayPal. I've said this a few times to a number of you when I met you. Back in June of 2013, we had implemented a new approach to digital wallet operators that apply to all staged wallets. And by the way, not just PayPal. So I want you to understand that. With the intent of bringing consistency and transparency to the system, transactions should flow through with clear data flowing through, the brand of the bank and the network should be visible to the consumer and the merchant. There are many reasons for us to be thoughtful about that digital wallet operator principles. We're still exactly where we are with those principles, and I think what I'm really pleased to see through a constructive dialogue with Dan Schulman and his management team at PayPal, that PayPal is actually working to resolve some of those concerns we all have around the lack of transparency, around these stage wallets as well as ACH clearing. And that's what you saw in the announcement that he and Charlie made a few days ago. And if you heard Dan mention in his earnings call, they're in discussions with others in the payment space to work with similar concepts or somewhat different but in the same space. We have worked with PayPal for many years. We have good working relationship with them and a wide range of opportunities. I just told you we just renewed our credit co-brand portfolio with them, in fact, yesterday. And so that gives you a sense of the -- of the manner in which PayPal is trying to work with the industry. I think this is actually a good thing for PayPal and for the industry because at the end of the day, providing consumers the ability of having seamless simple ways of paying is good for all of us. Everything is better than having to use cash and that's where we're headed."

It's solvable. It's not the best thing to do, but it's solvable. What I'm referring to is that they recently in their policy regarding the opening up of the market for people like us to come in, they put in a couple of clauses around complying with their new national security and cybersecurity policy. The little challenges of the new national security and cybersecurity policy has not yet actually been passed into a form that is visible to us in a document where we can say, ""Okay, got it. Got it. Got it. Do this, do that. We're okay."" It's not in that form. So we're in a little bit of an in between territory, between understanding that they want to have a thoughtful national security and cybersecurity policy, which they're entitled to. But we don't understand the implications for us in terms of operating a network on the ground. So whether we operate with our own license or we operate with a JV with somebody else or we do some other creative thinking around this, will all depend on clarity of these kinds of elements that they put into the policy they've recently announced. That's what we're trying to sort out. Meanwhile, there's a lot of stuff to do for us in China. We're continuing work on issuance, continuing work on building out acceptance or we've been continuing some work on basic technology development, so that when we get clarity of this, and Martina and I are confident we understand what we are signing up for, then we can move forward relatively quickly from that space. So it's kind of one of those in-between spaces."

And it's not just about pricing. It's also about speed of approval. It's about many different things that they look at.

And I just want to talk about, maybe you can just refresh our memories, like how are you driving these market share gains, growing more than double the rate of Visa Europe at this point despite the higher perceived pricing levels? What I've been telling folks is it's actually not that different if you get down to the bank level, you're actually closer to apples-to-apples on a pricing basis. But maybe just give us some of your thoughts on that current dynamic and how it might change with Visa Europe now being part of Visa.

It's not quite at the level where our global pricing is. It's lower because as you know, in every geography and in the country, it depends in terms of whether we just were to be able to license so that we get the volume assessment. And whether or not we actually get to see the transaction from a processing point of view, all of you guys know in Europe we process about 40% of our transactions only. And lastly, in terms of what kind of services we're actually delivering to the client. When you look at the largest client, I have to believe that we have very similar pricing to Visa. It might be different in terms of when you look at the medium and then the smaller clients. Now having said that, what Javier and his team have done in a really great way is using the global capability of MasterCard, with all the products and services that we have around the globe, to be bringing that in a seamless fashion to our European clients. And that's what they really like to see, right. And this is what -- did not happen with our competitor given that they were 2 different companies. And given that we are generally the smaller company, I always have to say that we have to put more points on the board. That means we have to rise higher in order to make sure that the customer gets that differentiated product and service that they're seeking in order to basically address their pain points and have fantastic products for their consumers.

I think, you remember like I said VocaLink is not about competing with Visa Europe, by the way. VocaLink is about us wanting to be real players in every aspect of electronic payments and the way they are developing. And the reality is that today, across the world, 50% of payments, not just Visa, are ACH. But within that, what's really interesting is the opportunity to grow Fast ACH. And VocaLink is one of the few players that has not only an outstanding Fast ACH platform implemented in the U.K. but also implemented in other countries, and most of ACH tends to be local. VocaLink demonstrated an ability to take that Fast ACH platform and make it globally adaptable. And you can imagine the possibilities of that over the next decade. So I really want you to think about us during the VocaLink transaction. If it all works out, once we're through all the regulatory steps, our strategic intent is to play across all aspects of these payments rails for individual consumer to merchants payments, but also B2B, P2P and government payment flows.

It's not a coincidence that our other revenue line is growing at the rate it's been growing for quite a few quarters. It's not a coincidence. And remember, after a year when you anniversary an acquisition, it comes into the base. After 2 years, the entire P&L comes into our base. So we're quite disciplined about tracking ourselves against it. Some of the acquisitions do better than what we thought we could do with them. Some of them don't do as well. That's just the reality of what we're trying to go through. But in the process, we’ve built out a decent capability in data analytics and information services. We've added to our capability in loyalty and rewards. We've added to our capability in technology and connectivity for e-commerce and gateways as well as the connected bank accounts around the world, even before the VocaLink acquisition. So that's kind of what we are trying to do. I honestly -- at any point of time in any quarter, I think Martina and her team are working on a number of possible acquisitions. What tends to happen is 2%, 5%, 6% of them show up at any level of second level [indiscernible]. By the time we are done, one out of many gets done. So it's tough for me to tell you that I have 2 next quarter or 3 in the fourth quarter. I'm not going to do all of that.

Second, we've got to work really hard between now and the next few months to get the VocaLink acquisition through all the processes of regulatory approval and get our company to be an excellent player in the ACH and Fast ACH game, first with the responsibility to the U.K. because we are going to be a large player there in terms of this, but also with the ability to see how we take it elsewhere. Our priorities remain in the area of loyalty and rewards, in the area of data analytics and information services, in the area of safety and security. To some degree, all this depends on us being able to see more transactions. To be able to see and handle and touch more transactions. Processing assets are very helpful in that space, so we tend to play through these as we go along. And I -- honestly, I think Martina's done great working with me because she's looking at a few deals all the time. This is probably not a great sartorial comment but that's true."

And as you might remember, or during the last couple of years leading up to the changes that came in last December of 2015, we were hoping that, that would actually change the view of some of the merchants to be wanting to accept card payments because quite frankly, now card payments are heck a lot cheaper than what you have to do with cash, right? And so we are seeing fairly large-scale changes coming through with some very large merchants. So that's what we're seeing first. So for instance, a grocery store like ALDI, which is a very gruffy discount store, they don't even have shelves in their store. You grab actually goods out of the boxes that they just rip open. They're finally actually opening or have opened card payments. And there are a number of those large retailers who are now willing to do it. And we see it pretty much in every European country. Where we haven't seen yet as much movement is on the smaller merchants, and that's obviously where there's a lot of work that we still have to do. And we are hoping that, that will continue to allow us to change the secular trends in Europe, which outside of the U.K., right, in the U.K. a lot is already electronic side but in the rest of the Europe, in the continent, I always call it that this is still an emerging country for us. That will help us on the secular trend from cash and check to electronic forms of payments and will help our numbers over time."

I can tell you that I'm not clearly understanding enough about what exclusivity Visa signed with PayPal because we're not encountering any difficulty while talking to PayPal in that space. So I don't know exactly what the nature of that exclusivity is. You've got to ask PayPal or Visa because that's pretty clear that we've got enough good conversations going on not just now but for a little while. Obviously, they’re stressed between these conversations, right? I mean, our digital wallet operator rules when they went into place in 2013, were not replicated by others. As well, we made our position clear at that time that we wanted to clear -- to have a clear, transparent, fair methodology in this digital wallet development. It's been sometimes good, sometimes stressful, but constructive. And my view always has been that if PayPal wants or everybody else like that, a digital wallet operator wants to use our rails of credit and debit to be able to build their own model, then they can't just use our rails when it suits them and use another rail to go around us and the banks when it suits them. There's got to be a more constructive partnership. So yes, we have a constructive partnership on co-branded cards, yes, we do. We've had it earlier. We've renewed again literally yesterday. So that tells you that, that partnership has depth beyond one signature or one contract with somebody or the other. But also -- we've all been discussing the whole aspect of how this digital wallet operator system would work. Now if PayPal's methodology of operations from what I've learned from their announcements with Visa, if they reflect what our digital wallet operator policies put into place so, yes, then any fees you make from them will go away because the fee is not meant to be there if they're doing what's in the policy. But I can tell you that, that fee is de minimis. That's not -- we were not trying to use a fee to get them to change their policy. The fee was used to manage through all the difficulties that their policies were creating in terms of data and transaction management. So let's just be clear about what this is all about. This is not about forcing them to do anything, this is about our perspective of how the marketplace should develop, transparently and openly to merchants, to consumers, to banks, to PayPal and to all of us. That's what we're trying to build. So I think it's a constructive dialogue. I think PayPal is very much a part of that dialogue. Then this could all end up in a good way for the industry as a whole, for banks as well as for networks, as well as for PayPal. So will there be changes in the dynamics of the economics for a bank versus the network versus for PayPal? Everything to do with digital changes those economics. But that doesn't mean that, that is just taking out other transactions and growing in volume as well. So I have sort of generally positive view about where this is going. I'm not -- by the way, I'm not saying there aren't hurdles along the way, there aren't roadblocks along the way. Remember, we've been talking to them for 2, 3 years. We don't yet have an announcement to tell you of the kind of transaction that Visa has. So everybody has their own ways of approaching transactions, and has their own competitive dynamic and their own way of thinking about where the strategy is going. That's actually okay in an open, competitive market. It's a good thing."

I don't think I can tell you which way that'll get resolved. I wouldn't even like to speculate on that. The part about PayPal, I want to make sure you guys don't get focused on some staged wallet fee because that's actually not what this is about. The fee is de minimis. This is not a large fee either for us or for PayPal, by the way. That's not what this is about. It's about a set of rules and policies around what the digital wallet operator rules are. That's what this is. And could PayPal comply with those rules without some master agreement to this? Yes, they could. But we already have an agreements with them on a number of things. And they're the only digital wallet operator out there who wants to work closer with banks and networks and merchants. My view of this is if we can collaborate together, if we can make this easier for a consumer in the process and for a merchant in the process, that's a good thing. We should be doing it."

Our business continues to perform well. We're very pleased with our strong results this quarter. As you could see from the release, on a currency-neutral basis and excluding the special items related to litigation, we reported both net revenue and EPS growth of 14%. Martina is going to get into the financial details, so I'm going to talk a little bit about the global economy first. And frankly, other than the Brexit vote, very little has changed since the last quarter. The United States economy is still holding steady. Consumer confidence up slightly, stable job growth, low inflation. And frankly, prior to the Brexit vote, many parts of Europe were showing steady signs of improvement in both consumer confidence and unemployment. And while it's still too early to predict the full impact of Brexit, we will obviously watch that situation very carefully. 
The outlook for Asia remains cautious. We've got a prolonged slowdown in China, weaker-than-expected recovery in Australia. India continues to be a bright spot, both consumer and business sentiment there remain strong.
In Latin America, Brazil is still in a deep recession but interestingly, a modest increase in business confidence is beginning to show signs that the economy may be reaching a bottom. 
In Venezuela, economic conditions continue to deteriorate, but Mexico is in a steady growth path. It's been driven by solid consumer spending and low unemployment. And so as a result, it's likely we're going to remain in a period of economic and political uncertainty at least in the near term. Having said all of this, our business continues to grow. Our fundamentals remain strong. We are seeing double-digit volume and transaction growth across most of our markets, and we continue to win deals by differentiating ourselves with services. 
Now I wasn't on the call last week that Martina and Tim had on VocaLink, so let me just quickly share my views about the planned acquisition of VocaLink. The deal is an important component of our strategy to participate in all forms of electronic payments and to enhance our services for the benefit of our customers and our partners. And VocaLink itself is very interesting to us for a couple of reasons. First, when you look at all payment flows in the world's top 50 countries, and this is not just retail payments, ACH represents about 50% of that total. And the potential of Fast ACH is growing, especially given that it is being promoted by a number of regulatory bodies in Europe, the United States and in other parts of the world. 
Second, we believe that VocaLink is the best asset in this space from both a technology standpoint as well as having a very talented group of people who are respected across the industry. Beyond the opportunities available in that primary U.K. market, they have been successful in operating and licensing their Fast ACH technology in other markets: in Sweden, in Singapore and Thailand. They're also the primary supplier of Fast ACH technology to the clearing house in the United States. 
And finally, the ability to see both card and ACH transactions would enable us to offer an even broader range of data analytics and other services through our partners. Our card network has been powering our growth in both consumer and commercial payment for many years. And with this acquisition, we will now have a new set of capabilities to capture additional opportunities in B2B, in P2P and government payment flows regardless of what payment rail they use. So that's VocaLink. 
Let me move on to a brief update on China. In June, the People's Bank of China released the final regulation to foreign card networks to operate domestically in China. We are currently working through the requirements. We need a much better understanding around their national security and cybersecurity standards before we determine how best to proceed. We've got to weigh whether we can apply for license alone or with a business partner. It's all connected to this deeper understanding. Meanwhile, what we are doing is we're continuing to work on building out our technology on the ground as well as working with our Chinese customers on new issuance and broadening acceptance. 
So moving on from there, a couple of recent developments on the legal front. In the United States, the Brooklyn District Court's 2013 approval of the U.S. merchant class action settlement, as you know, was overturned by the Court of Appeals in late June. And obviously, we're disappointed by that decision. Charlie and Visa revealed it in some detail on their earnings call last week. So I won't rehash the same details. The case will be sent back to a District Court. There we expect the first order of business will be to appoint counsel to the injunctive release class. MasterCard will then work with all parties to see if they can find ways to reform the settlement in line with the Court of Appeals decision. And as you'd expect, our forecast on that work will be on rule changes and the scope of the release, which were the issues in the Court of Appeals decision, not the money damages. 
On the money damages, note that our financial exposure remains capped at 12% of any settlement or judgment under the agreements we entered into with the bank defendant and with Visa in 2011. 
Additionally, in July, a U.K. court issued a decision in one of the U.K. merchant suits seeking interchange damages. That court awarded Sainsbury's a portion of the damages that they'd been seeking. And that amount, along with anticipated legal fees and costs, was taken as a charge in the second quarter. That's the special item you see in our results. Although we don't believe the retailer suffered any damages, we’re gratified by several aspects of the court's decision. Just one example, the court recognized that an appropriate level of domestic interchange is substantially higher than the 20 and 30 basis points imposed by the European interchange fee regulation that went into effect last December. 
So now let's move on to some of our recent business activity. And during the quarter, as been normal, we find a number of new deals and renewals supporting the expansion of our business around the world. I'm going to run through a few examples. We continue to make progress in our U.S. consumer business. Recent highlights include the renewal of our partnership with Huntington National Bank across their debit, credit and commercial businesses, expanded acquisitions of new consumer credit accounts with several of the largest banks in the market. In addition, we had important wins in the co-brand space, including American Airlines, the Citi and Barclaycard, with both JV assured [ph] as well as Intercontinental Hotels, Bed Bath & Beyond and some others. 
We also renewed, just announced it yesterday actually, our consumer credit co-brand with PayPal, an important complement of our overall relationship with them, which as you heard from Dan Schulman on his call, we're all actively seeking to expand.
We continue to drive our commercial business forward. One of the most important verticals for us is travel. And now in addition to our relationship with eNett and Travelport that we've talked of in previous calls, we just signed a new global deal with Amadeus, a leading travel technology company. Today, travel agencies make more than $300 billion in the annual payments to airlines, hotels and other travel providers, largely via bank transfers and checks. What this agreement does is it combines Amadeus' new B2B wallet and virtual payment technology with MasterCard's commercial card capabilities. We will provide travel agencies and travel providers with a fast, secure and automated way to pay and get paid. 
We continue to perform well outside of the U.S. In Canada, we signed 2 new issuer deals, renewed 4 issuer and co-brand deals, including: NBNA, which is a division now of the Toronto Dominion Bank; and President's Choice Financial, which is part of Loblaw, one of the largest retailers in Canada, which, by the way, included exclusive issuance. 
In Europe, we are pleased to sign an expanded agreement with Yapi Kredi, one of the market leaders in Turkey, for a larger portion of their credit portfolio. Prior to this deal, most of their credit business was with a competitor. 
In addition to the deals I mentioned previously, we're continuing our momentum in the co-brand space globally. We are very excited. We renewed our partnership with Walmart in Canada and also signed a new agreement with them in China. 
We have partnered with Access Bank in India as well as Miles & More, one of the largest global frequent flyer and rewards programs, to launch India's first multicurrency, co-branded, prepaid card that supports up to 17 currencies to facilitate both domestic and international card usage. 
Finally, you've heard us say many times how we've been successful with using services as a key strategic differentiator for winning deals. As one example of this, we're happy to have renewed a long-term debit agreement with Bendigo and Adelaide Bank, one of Australia's largest retail banks, includes commercial cards and a flip of the majority of their consumer credit business. That deal includes a full complement of our services, consisting of advisers, loyalty solutions and our suite of safety and security products. We signed a deal with CartaSi, one of the largest card issuers in Italy, to begin issuing debit cards as well as to use advisers' consulting services. You'll hear a lot more from us about how we're differentiating with services at our upcoming Investor Day in September. 
So moving on to our digital strategy. You know we've long said this is a marathon, not a sprint. But we've made some significant progress this past quarter and there's more to come. So about 2 weeks ago, we announced some important industry milestone when we became the first network to deliver a digital payment service across all devices, all channels. With MasterPass, consumers can now decide how and where they prefer to shop, whether that's in app, online or in store using a bank-branded offering from the issuer of their choice, knowing that their payment information is protected by our technology. 
We've also previously talked about our digital by default strategy, which enables issuers to auto-enroll cardholders on to the MasterPass service through their online banking app without any additional effort by the consumer. We're very pleased that more than 18 million accounts will be automatically enabled by the end of this year. 18 million, as the services began to roll out globally, starting with Europe and Asia and later this year in the United States, the Bank of America with Citibank and Capital One. 
Further, issuers can use MasterPass to differentiate their own wallet offering by using our open APIs to integrate other services from us, such as purchase alerts or paying with points or services that they have developed themselves. 
And lastly, in terms of geography, including the recent expansions to Greece, Switzerland, Colombia and Ukraine, we are now live in 33 markets. 
From an acceptance standpoint, MasterPass is currently available at hundreds of thousands of merchants online and in-app. We are pleased to have recently added IKEA. We'll soon be adding Saks, Lord and Taylor and The Cheesecake Factory as more examples. With the introduction of NFC capability, consumers will now be able to use MasterPass at the more than 5 million merchant locations in 77 countries that accept contactless payments today. Contactless will first be available to Android device owners in the United States later this month, with a global expansion to follow shortly thereafter. 
Last topic is tokenization technology, the MasterCard Digital Enablement service, or MDES. We continue to make solid progress and are making transactions more secure for MasterPass, which by the way, is already enabled for contactless transactions with online and in-app to follow but also for our digital partners. 
Most recently, we helped Android Pay expand to Singapore as well as Apple Pay to move into Canada, Hong Kong, Switzerland and France. In addition, we're also pleased to be partnering with Microsoft on the launch of their cloud-based mobile wallet solution for Windows 10 compatible devices. All these examples illustrate our continued commitment to deliver secure consumer payment experience to our cardholders using the mobile device of their choice. 
So with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Martina for an update on our financial results and operational metrics. Martina?"
6477196,369244781,1016345,"MasterCard Incorporated, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Mastercard Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Ajay, and good morning, everyone. So let me begin by giving you some highlights on the second quarter, starting with Page 3, where you see the difference between non-GAAP reported and currency-neutral growth rates for this quarter. So these figure",1422,"Thanks, Ajay, and good morning, everyone. So let me begin by giving you some highlights on the second quarter, starting with Page 3, where you see the difference between non-GAAP reported and currency-neutral growth rates for this quarter. So these figures exclude the impact of the special items taken in both this quarter and the previous quarter related to the judgment issued on Sainsbury's and the settlement we made with Tesco, the 2 largest merchants involved in the U.K. merchant litigation. I'd like to point out a few items using the currency-neutral growth rate. 
As Ajay said, net revenue growth was 14% for the quarter, coming in a bit higher than our expectations. Operating expenses grew 13%, primarily due to continued investments to support our strategic initiatives as well as higher legal costs, of which the majority are not likely to recur. We saw a higher tax rate than the year ago -- in the year-ago quarter due to the non-recurrence of a discrete U.S. foreign tax credit from which we benefited in the second quarter of 2015. 
And with all that, EPS was $0.96, up 14% year-over-year. Share repurchases contributed about $0.03 per share. And as of July 21, we have $2.7 billion remaining under our current authorization. And lastly, cash flow from operations was $1.1 billion, and we ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and other liquid investments of about $6.4 billion. 
So let's turn to Page 4, where you can see the operational metrics for the second quarter. When comparing these numbers to the last quarter, just remember, the first quarter saw about a 1 ppt benefit from leap day, which explains most of the differences. Our worldwide gross dollar volume, or GDV, growth was 11% on a local currency basis, down 2 ppt from last quarter. 
Overall, our U.S. GDV grew 8%, made up of credit and debit growth of 7% and 8%, respectively. Total U.S. GDV had less than 1 ppt headwind from lower gas prices. 
Now outside of the U.S., volume growth was 13% on a local currency basis, and that's about down 2 ppt versus last quarter, with low to mid-teens growth in each region. 
And beginning on June 9, as a result of the new EU regulation, our volume numbers reflect the absence of domestic co-badge volume that we do not process, particularly in France. In the second quarter, we saw an impact of 1 ppt on worldwide volume growth and a 3 ppt impact to European volume growth. The impact will become more pronounced over the next year, and this has been contemplated in all of our forward guidance. 
Cross-border volume grew 10% on a local currency basis, slightly lower than the 12% we saw in the first quarter. 
Let me turn to Page 5. And here, you can see processed transactions grew 14% globally to $13.7 billion. That's a very similar increase from what we saw in the first quarter. And globally, the number of cards grew 7%, with 2.3 billion MasterCard and Maestro-branded cards issued. 
On Page 6. Here you see some highlights on a few of the detailed revenue line items. Unless otherwise stated, the growth numbers I call out both here and on the next slide are all on a currency-neutral basis. So as I said, net revenue growth was 14%, a bit stronger than we expected. We saw continued strong volume and transaction growth, plus a higher contribution from some of our services businesses. Rebates and incentives grew 23%, primarily due to higher volumes as well as some deal renewals. 
Looking strictly at the individual revenue line items. Domestic assessments grew 10%, while worldwide GDV grew by 11%. And the difference is primarily due to mix. Cross-border volume fees grew 14%, while cross-border volume grew 10%. The 4 ppt gap is due to a number of pricing actions, partially offset by a higher mix of intra-Europe activity. Transaction processing fees grew 21%, primarily driven by the 14% growth in processed transactions as well as some pricing. And finally, other revenue grew 25%, driven primarily by services such as advisers, APT and our safety and security product offerings. 
Moving now to Page 7. Here, you can see the total operating expenses after excluding special items increased 12% in the quarter or 13% on a currency-neutral basis. Our APT acquisition contributed about 1 ppt to these growth rates. In addition, 5 ppt was due to higher legal costs. As I already said, the majority of these aren't likely to recur. So the remaining 7 ppt was primarily due to higher personnel costs related to our continued investments in strategic areas such as digital, data analytics and geographic expansion. Also, our data processing expense growth is normally in line with transaction growth. However, this past quarter, the growth was higher due to the fee we now pay to NSP Cards for processing domestic Russian transactions. 
Let me turn to Slide 8. And here, we can discuss what we have seen in July through the 21, where most of our drivers are up from the second quarter. The numbers through July 21 are as follows. Starting with processed volume, we saw global growth of 11%, slightly lower than the 12% we saw in the second quarter. In the U.S., our process volume grew 8%, down 1 ppt from the second quarter, with slower growth in credit but higher growth in debit. GAAP had less than a 1 ppt negative impact on our July growth. That's very similar to the second quarter. And processed volume outside of the U.S. grew 15%, up a bit from the second quarter, primarily driven by Europe and Latin America. Globally, processed transactions growth was 17%, up 3 ppt from what we saw in the second quarter. Processed transaction growth outside the U.S. was up 1 ppt, with increases in Europe and Latin America. And the U.S. growth was up 6 ppt, driven by new opportunities of PIN routing. 
With respect to cross-border -- across border, our volumes actually grew 14% globally, and that's up 4 ppt from last quarter with faster growth in Europe. We also saw faster growth in Middle East and Africa, which was likely related to the timing of Ramadan. 
So now looking to the full year of 2016, there's really no change in our business outlook from what we discussed with you in our earnings back in April. Currently, we don't anticipate any significant impact from Brexit this year. However, foreign exchange headwinds will continue to be with us in 2016, although they continue to moderate from the recent past given current FX rates. 
Our underlying business fundamentals remain strong, and we will continue to run the company for growth, both on the top and bottom line as well as balancing our investments with astute expense management. 
As we look at full year 2016 and after factoring in our currency-neutral methodology, we continue to expect to be at the low end of our 3-year revenue growth range. When you model on an as-reported basis, you will need to adjust for the impact of all currencies. And at current rates, we estimate that, that would mean about a 2 ppt headwind to net revenue growth and the bottom line, which is less of a headwind than what we said on our April earnings call. 
Now let me call out a few other items that you should consider when modeling 2016. For rebates and incentives, we now expect to see growth of about the same as the 20% as-reported growth rate we saw in 2015 after factoring in the impact of the new American Airlines co-brand renewal. On expenses, we continue to expect total operating expense growth in the high single-digit range for our as-reported results, excluding special items. On a currency-neutral basis, we continue to expect low double-digit growth. Be mindful that we're ramping up our efforts on MasterPass, which impacts G&A and A&M, particularly in the third quarter. You should now assume a tax rate of slightly less than 29% for 2016. 
And finally, on the subject of share repurchases. Now while year-to-date, we have bought back about $1.8 billion, most of that occurred earlier in the year, as we were out of the market for most of the second quarter given the pending VocaLink transaction. As I said last week, once our trading window opens in early August, we expect to continue our repurchasing activity. 
So now let me turn the call back to Barbara to begin the Q&A session. Barbara?"

The second one is the most transactional question, and I can tell you that places like Turkey and other such locations, there's no doubt that the impact of some of this activity and terrorism does impact what's going on there. Our cross-border growth to Turkey is down significantly compared to last year. Cardholders from Germany, Russia, Sweden and the U.S. are not traveling there with the same level of frequency as they were, clearly. We’re also closely watching travel to other markets, France and so on. Interestingly, in the U.K., there's actually an increase of inbound cross-border expense. So it's kind of bouncing around but specifically in a couple of countries impacted by terrorism. There's no doubt that it causes some angst in cross-border travel. Having said that, remember what Martina said. Right now, our cross-border volumes for the first few weeks of this quarter, so only a few weeks, are up compared to where we were last quarter. And in fact, Europe is one of the contributors to that being up. So about Visa and PayPal. I've said this a few times to a number of you when I met you. Back in June of 2013, we had implemented a new approach to digital wallet operators that apply to all staged wallets. And by the way, not just PayPal. So I want you to understand that. With the intent of bringing consistency and transparency to the system, transactions should flow through with clear data flowing through, the brand of the bank and the network should be visible to the consumer and the merchant. There are many reasons for us to be thoughtful about that digital wallet operator principles. We're still exactly where we are with those principles, and I think what I'm really pleased to see through a constructive dialogue with Dan Schulman and his management team at PayPal, that PayPal is actually working to resolve some of those concerns we all have around the lack of transparency, around these stage wallets as well as ACH clearing. And that's what you saw in the announcement that he and Charlie made a few days ago. And if you heard Dan mention in his earnings call, they're in discussions with others in the payment space to work with similar concepts or somewhat different but in the same space. We have worked with PayPal for many years. We have good working relationship with them and a wide range of opportunities. I just told you we just renewed our credit co-brand portfolio with them, in fact, yesterday. And so that gives you a sense of the -- of the manner in which PayPal is trying to work with the industry. I think this is actually a good thing for PayPal and for the industry because at the end of the day, providing consumers the ability of having seamless simple ways of paying is good for all of us. Everything is better than having to use cash and that's where we're headed."

It's solvable. It's not the best thing to do, but it's solvable. What I'm referring to is that they recently in their policy regarding the opening up of the market for people like us to come in, they put in a couple of clauses around complying with their new national security and cybersecurity policy. The little challenges of the new national security and cybersecurity policy has not yet actually been passed into a form that is visible to us in a document where we can say, ""Okay, got it. Got it. Got it. Do this, do that. We're okay."" It's not in that form. So we're in a little bit of an in between territory, between understanding that they want to have a thoughtful national security and cybersecurity policy, which they're entitled to. But we don't understand the implications for us in terms of operating a network on the ground. So whether we operate with our own license or we operate with a JV with somebody else or we do some other creative thinking around this, will all depend on clarity of these kinds of elements that they put into the policy they've recently announced. That's what we're trying to sort out. Meanwhile, there's a lot of stuff to do for us in China. We're continuing work on issuance, continuing work on building out acceptance or we've been continuing some work on basic technology development, so that when we get clarity of this, and Martina and I are confident we understand what we are signing up for, then we can move forward relatively quickly from that space. So it's kind of one of those in-between spaces."

And as I think I've told you a couple of calls ago, maybe a few before that, this stuff will move around a little bit and bounce around as merchants move the different routing in their routing tables, depending on what's working for them. And it's not just about pricing. It's also about speed of approval. It's about many different things that they look at.

It's not quite at the level where our global pricing is. It's lower because as you know, in every geography and in the country, it depends in terms of whether we just were to be able to license so that we get the volume assessment. And whether or not we actually get to see the transaction from a processing point of view, all of you guys know in Europe we process about 40% of our transactions only. And lastly, in terms of what kind of services we're actually delivering to the client. When you look at the largest client, I have to believe that we have very similar pricing to Visa. It might be different in terms of when you look at the medium and then the smaller clients. Now having said that, what Javier and his team have done in a really great way is using the global capability of MasterCard, with all the products and services that we have around the globe, to be bringing that in a seamless fashion to our European clients. And that's what they really like to see, right. And this is what -- did not happen with our competitor given that they were 2 different companies. And given that we are generally the smaller company, I always have to say that we have to put more points on the board.

I think, you remember like I said VocaLink is not about competing with Visa Europe, by the way. VocaLink is about us wanting to be real players in every aspect of electronic payments and the way they are developing. And the reality is that today, across the world, 50% of payments, not just Visa, are ACH. But within that, what's really interesting is the opportunity to grow Fast ACH. And VocaLink is one of the few players that has not only an outstanding Fast ACH platform implemented in the U.K. but also implemented in other countries, and most of ACH tends to be local. VocaLink demonstrated an ability to take that Fast ACH platform and make it globally adaptable. And you can imagine the possibilities of that over the next decade. So I really want you to think about us during the VocaLink transaction. If it all works out, once we're through all the regulatory steps, our strategic intent is to play across all aspects of these payments rails for individual consumer to merchants payments, but also B2B, P2P and government payment flows.

And remember, after a year when you anniversary an acquisition, it comes into the base. After 2 years, the entire P&L comes into our base. So we're quite disciplined about tracking ourselves against it. Some of the acquisitions do better than what we thought we could do with them. Some of them don't do as well. That's just the reality of what we're trying to go through. But in the process, we’ve built out a decent capability in data analytics and information services. We've added to our capability in loyalty and rewards. We've added to our capability in technology and connectivity for e-commerce and gateways as well as the connected bank accounts around the world, even before the VocaLink acquisition. So that's kind of what we are trying to do. I honestly -- at any point of time in any quarter, I think Martina and her team are working on a number of possible acquisitions.

So it's tough for me to tell you that I have 2 next quarter or 3 in the fourth quarter. I'm not going to do all of that.

Second, we've got to work really hard between now and the next few months to get the VocaLink acquisition through all the processes of regulatory approval and get our company to be an excellent player in the ACH and Fast ACH game, first with the responsibility to the U.K. because we are going to be a large player there in terms of this, but also with the ability to see how we take it elsewhere. Our priorities remain in the area of loyalty and rewards, in the area of data analytics and information services, in the area of safety and security. To some degree, all this depends on us being able to see more transactions. To be able to see and handle and touch more transactions. Processing assets are very helpful in that space, so we tend to play through these as we go along.

And as you might remember, or during the last couple of years leading up to the changes that came in last December of 2015, we were hoping that, that would actually change the view of some of the merchants to be wanting to accept card payments because quite frankly, now card payments are heck a lot cheaper than what you have to do with cash, right? And so we are seeing fairly large-scale changes coming through with some very large merchants. So that's what we're seeing first. So for instance, a grocery store like ALDI, which is a very gruffly discount store, they don't even have shelves in their store. You grab actually goods out of the boxes that they just rip open. They're finally actually opening or have opened card payments. And there are a number of those large retailers who are now willing to do it. And we see it pretty much in every European country. Where we haven't seen yet as much movement is on the smaller merchants, and that's obviously where there's a lot of work that we still have to do. And we are hoping that, that will continue to allow us to change the secular trends in Europe, which outside of the U.K., right, in the U.K. a lot is already electronic side but in the rest of the Europe, in the continent, I always call it that this is still an emerging country for us. That will help us on the secular trend from cash and check to electronic forms of payments and will help our numbers over time."

I can tell you that I'm not clearly understanding enough about what exclusivity Visa signed with PayPal because we're not encountering any difficulty while talking to PayPal in that space. So I don't know exactly what the nature of that exclusivity is. You've got to ask PayPal or Visa because that's pretty clear that we've got enough good conversations going on not just now but for a little while. Obviously, they’re stressed between these conversations, right? I mean, our digital wallet operator rules when they went into place in 2013, were not replicated by others. As well, we made our position clear at that time that we wanted to clear -- to have a clear, transparent, fair methodology in this digital wallet development. It's been sometimes good, sometimes stressful, but constructive. And my view always has been that if PayPal wants or everybody else like that, a digital wallet operator wants to use our rails of credit and debit to be able to build their own model, then they can't just use our rails when it suits them and use another rail to go around us and the banks when it suits them. There's got to be a more constructive partnership. So yes, we have a constructive partnership on co-branded cards, yes, we do. We've had it earlier. We've renewed again literally yesterday. So that tells you that, that partnership has depth beyond one signature or one contract with somebody or the other. But also -- we've all been discussing the whole aspect of how this digital wallet operator system would work. Now if PayPal's methodology of operations from what I've learned from their announcements with Visa, if they reflect what our digital wallet operator policies put into place so, yes, then any fees you make from them will go away because the fee is not meant to be there if they're doing what's in the policy. But I can tell you that, that fee is de minimis. That's not -- we were not trying to use a fee to get them to change their policy. The fee was used to manage through all the difficulties that their policies were creating in terms of data and transaction management. So let's just be clear about what this is all about. This is not about forcing them to do anything, this is about our perspective of how the marketplace should develop, transparently and openly to merchants, to consumers, to banks, to PayPal and to all of us. That's what we're trying to build. So I think it's a constructive dialogue. I think PayPal is very much a part of that dialogue. Then this could all end up in a good way for the industry as a whole, for banks as well as for networks as well as for PayPal. So will there be changes in the dynamics of the economics for a bank versus the network versus for PayPal? Everything to do with digital changes those economics. But that doesn't mean that, that is just taking out other transactions and growing in volume as well. So I have sort of generally positive view about where this is going. I'm not -- by the way, I'm not saying there aren't hurdles along the way, there aren't roadblocks along the way. Remember, we've been talking to them for 2, 3 years. We don't yet have an announcement to tell you of the kind of transaction that Visa has. So everybody has their own ways of approaching transactions, and has their own competitive dynamic and their own way of thinking about where the strategy is going. That's actually okay in an open, competitive market. It's a good thing."

And then, I guess, more importantly as we look at the case with the merchants and the like, your prepared comments seem to indicate that you wanted to pursue an adjusted settlement, et cetera.

So the second question, honestly, litigation is complicated enough without trying to broaden things. When you already have an agreement between tons of banks, Visa, MasterCard, tons of people at the other end, it doesn't pay to start broadening things. Who knows how this will go. I can't predict because there's other players who all have to come to an agreement. But we'll see. We -- I think we made real progress and we had a -- actually a good deal on the ground which a previous judge had signed off on. But you know what, courts decide what they do and while we could be disappointed, we've got to abide by it. So we're going to find our way through that working with other folks. I don't think I can tell you which way that'll get resolved. I wouldn't even like to speculate on that. The part about PayPal, I want to make sure you guys don't get focused on some staged wallet fee because that's actually not what this is about. The fee is de minimis. This is not a large fee either for us or for PayPal, by the way. That's not what this is about. It's about a set of rules and policies around what the digital wallet operator rules are. That's what this is. And could PayPal comply with those rules without some master agreement to this? Yes, they could. But we already have an agreements with them on a number of things. And they're the only digital wallet operator out there who wants to work closer with banks and networks and merchants. My view of this is if we can collaborate together, if we can make this easier for a consumer in the process and for a merchant in the process, that's a good thing. We should be doing it."

This morning's earnings call and the slide deck that will be referenced on the call can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website, mastercard.com. Additionally, the release was attached to an 8-K that we filed with the SEC earlier this morning. A replay of this call will be posted on our website for 30 days.
Both the release and the slide deck include reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to their GAAP equivalents. We've also added a table at the end of both documents which provides additional information about the [Audio Gap] 8 of the EU's recent payments regulation on our GDV and purchase volume growth rates. Since we are no longer charging de minimis fees on co-badged domestic volume that doesn't use our network in markets such as France, this volume is no longer included in our reported volume statistics. We saw the partial impact of this in the second quarter and now have a full quarter of impact in Q3. The table adjust [ph] growth rates for the impact by eliminating the related co-badged volume in prior periods so that you can see the underlying run rate of our business. Our comments on the call today will be on the basis of these adjusted rates. 
Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I need to remind everyone that today's call may include some forward-looking statements about MasterCard's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance are summarized at the end of our press release as well as contained in our recent SEC filings.

Good morning, everybody. 
Our business continues to perform well. We are very pleased with our strong results this quarter. As you've seen, we delivered net revenue growth of 14% and an EPS growth of 19% after excluding last year's special items, which was related to the termination of our U.S. employee pension plan.
Our perspective of the global economy remains largely unchanged since last quarter. You've all seen the U.S. GDP growth report this morning. We continue to believe, like we said in the previous quarter, that the U.S. is on a steady growth path with consumer confidence, unemployment and wages holding firm, of course, unless something unforeseen occurs coming out of the upcoming election. But basically the U.S. is on a steady growth path. 
Many markets across Europe are showing a gradual recovery, led by Germany, as economic sentiment holds steady. Unemployment rates are continuing to decline. Although uncertainty from Brexit and [indiscernible] Europe remain a concern, I think it's going to take a few years to understand the full implication. Again, you saw the British GDP report, which got [indiscernible] holding steady. Interestingly, underlying U.K. consumer demand remained stable. And in fact, as a result of the weaker pound, inbound travel to the U.K. is picking up over this last quarter.
In the Asia, the picture is still mixed. In China, both exports and imports were down sharply, and you all know the concerns over inflated asset values. In Australia, however, business confidence is up, and India continues its relatively strong growth trajectory 
In Latin America, Brazil, even though it's expected to remain in a recession for the near future, seems to be bottoming out, and the political environment seems to be stabilizing, which should hopefully improve the economic conditions for the next 6 to 12 months. In Venezuela, the political and fiscal crisis is deepening. In Mexico, the economy continues to expand, but with increasing dependence on consumer spending growth. 
So in sum, the outlook from the economic side remains mixed. Even so, we're continuing to grow, we think, double-digit volume in transaction growth across most of our markets. We're continuing to win deals as we execute against our long-term strategy.  
So now let me provide you with a brief update about our planned acquisition of VocaLink. The first step is now complete. The European Commission has referred the transaction back to the U.K. regulator to perform the antitrust review. The second step, which will be led by the U.K. regulator, generally has 2 phases. We're hopeful to complete the review in the first preliminary phase, but it's always possible that this could go into a more detailed second phase. We continue to believe that we can complete this acquisition by about the middle of 2017. 
So before we go to our business highlights, let me just touch on a few regulatory and litigation items that you all asked us about from time to time. So starting with the United States. As you know, the merchant litigation is now back in the Brooklyn court. In the status conference held last week, the court heard arguments in the appointment of class counsel for merchants. Now as the court appoints that council, we expect the litigation to proceed, and we intend to resume the settlement negotiations. But given this complexity, we think this [indiscernible] will take some years to resolve. 
In the U.K., as many of you know, a proposed class action is filed in September on behalf of U.K. consumers seeking damages related to interchange fees. The court will set up a time line for the case soon. We've had good experience addressing similar claims in the United States, and we believe strongly that, in fact, far from being harmed by interchange, U.K. consumers have, in fact, benefited significantly.  
Finally, following legal submissions and an oral hearing this past summer, we continue to be in conversations with the European Commission to find a resolution to the 2015 case [indiscernible] interchange rates of [ph] interregional cross-border transaction and the central acquiring [ph] rules.  
So now moving on to some of our recent business activity. You heard a great deal of all of this from our [indiscernible] the recent investor day. You had an opportunity to see, firsthand, a number of the product and service innovations we are rolling out. So I'm going to stick to a few items this time. We continue to make solid progress in our U.S. consumer business, building on our recent momentum in debit. We're actually excited to highlight 2 new deals that deepen and strengthen our existing relationships with both U.S. Bank and Regions Bank, which have now been expanded to include preferred MasterCard routing for their PIN debit businesses. 
Outside of the U.S., we're actually pleased to have tripped [ph] a number of portfolios by continuing to leverage services as a key strategic differentiator. I'm going to give you a couple of examples in Europe. We're building on the long-term debit deal we announced last year in Italy with Poste Italiane. We're now expanding our partnership by converting a significant portion of their prepaid portfolio. This deal also includes a number of our services, such as advisers, to help drive their financial inclusion [ph] and innovation agendas. Another example with DenizBank, which is one of the market leaders in Turkey, to flip back [ph] credit business, which also leverages advisers.
Now the domestic opportunity in China. [indiscernible] about details into provision [ph] of the final PBOC regulations, particularly around the newly introduced security provisions and how these would impact our implementation of [indiscernible] switching while protecting our systems and our data. We hope this will be available over the next couple of months. We're continuing to speak with regulators to clarify our options on how best to enter the market. In the meanwhile, we're continuing to make progress in China by winning a number of new deals with banks, including HSBC, China Construction Bank, ICBC and Postal Savings Bank. As part of these deals, they will be issuing new single-branded cards targeted to the country's growing affluent customer segment and to drive cross-border spend.  
We [ph] highlighted several key renewals in our commercial business, including FLEETCOR and WEX, both of whom are driving B2B and cross-border spend in unique and innovative ways by leveraging virtual cards. We just added 2 new deals in Europe: one is Credit Suisse, which is focused on the small and medium enterprise segment where MasterCard is the exclusive card provider; the other with UBS, where we're looking forward to deepening our relationship within their corporate banking business.  
So now on to digital strategy. And over the last several quarters, including at the recent Investor Day, we've given you a number of our [indiscernible] on the significant progress we are making with MasterPass. And just to recall, we're taking 2 paddle parts. The first is our digital-by-default strategy, which enables issuers to auto-enroll card holders through their online banking app and helps to drive scale for us while keeping issuers at the center of their consumer relationships. We're quite pleased that more than 80 million accounts will be automatically enabled over the next few months. The second is to deliver a digital payment service that works across all devices, all channels, whether that's in app, online or in-store, and the idea there is to keep growing acceptance by being ubiquitous.
So today, I'll discuss a couple of use cases to give you an idea about some of the unique ways we're using MasterPass with our partners around the world. In South Africa, we're working with MTN and Vodafone, 2 telecom providers who, by the way, put together, have a market share of about 70%, to allow their customers to securely pay for airtime minutes from their mobile device using MasterPass. Prior to this, subscribers will either have to stand in long lines at a third-party service location or go to an ATM to transfer funds to the telecom provider and then wait for their accounts to be updated. Since its launch, more than 4.5 million users have registered for the service and airtime distribution costs, for the mobile network operators, have been reduced by as much as 15%.
Another example in Europe. We've partnered with Czech Railways, the largest rail operator in that country, to integrate MasterPass into their booking app to better compete with new entrants to the transit space and to modernize mobile ticketing. Again, prior to this, users would've had to enter their card details for each purchase. Since its launch in early 2015, users have grown significantly, and MasterPass now account for nearly 8% of all Czech Railways transactions. Both of these examples, I hope, demonstrate to you that through MasterPass, we're not just enabling digital payments, we actually try to create a better consumer experience.
From an acceptance standpoint, MasterPass continues to grow. It's now available in more than 300,000 merchants online and in apps as well as more than 6 million locations in 77 countries that allow contactless payments. We're continuing to add new merchants and -- for example, United Airlines in the U.S., Domino's Pizza and Trenitalia in Europe, KFC in Asia. In addition, last week, we signed the Memorandum of Understanding with the Ecobank group to roll out MasterPass QR in mobile person-to-person merchant service -- mobile person-to-merchant service across 33 African countries. This solution will be integrated with their mobile banking platform will enable users to safely pay for purchases directly from their bank account using a QR code. Again, millions of micro, small and medium enterprises across Africa will now be able to accept secure digital payments quickly and without the expense of a traditional POS server.
So our MasterPass partner-centric approach, as you heard Garry Lyons talk about at Investor Day, which is aimed at delivering a seamless consumer experience, benefits issuers, digital players and merchants. So earlier this week, we highlighted that issuers like Capital One, who are already leveraging our digital-by-default approach, are further integrating MasterPass into their world [ph] offering. Users of the Capital One Wallet can now shop online and in app and check out using that same embed tokenized log-in credentials at the hundreds of thousands of merchants around the world where MasterPass is accepted. Similarly, at Money20/20, we highlighted an important expansion of our digital partnerships. And starting sometime early next year, Samsung Pay, Android Pay and Microsoft Wallet will also enable the same online and in-app consumer experience that I just mentioned. And finally, clearly, merchants also benefit from this since they've already integrated MasterPass. There's no additional development work required. It gives them access to the millions of consumers who wanted [ph] to use these other wallet services or will in the future.
Meanwhile, we continue to support our partners to extend their reach globally, actually, recently, as Android Pay move into Poland; in fact, as Apple Pay expand into Japan and Russia, both currently exclusive with MasterCard. 
Finally, we highlighted our recent partnership with Green Dot and Uber as well as Stripe as listed Investor Day [ph] and are deleveraging [ph] the MasterCard Send platform to make a meaning [ph] and secure payment to drivers, delivery people and others. We just added Allstate who will leverage MasterCard Send to make claims payments to their customers via a debit card, providing nearly instant access to their funds. 
So with that, let me turn the call over to Martina for an update on our financial results and operational metrics. Martina?"
6477196,402994593,1065112,"MasterCard Incorporated, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2016",2016-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Mastercard Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Ajay, and good morning, everyone.

This, again, exclude the impact of a special item related to the termination of",1030,"Thanks, Ajay, and good morning, everyone. Starting with Page 3, you see there are minimal differences this quarter between non-GAAP reported and currency-neutral growth rates. This, again, exclude the impact of a special item related to the termination of the U.S.-designed [ph] pension plan taken last year. 
As you can see from our numbers, we have delivered another strong quarter. Here are a few highlights. Net revenue growth was 14%. Operating expenses grew 12% as we continue to invest in our strategic initiatives. EPS was up $1.08, up 19% year-over-year, driven primarily by our strong operating performance and a slightly lower tax rate. Also, share repurchases contributed $0.03 per share. As of October 25, we have $1.8 billion remaining as our current authorization. Lastly, cash flow from operations was $1.4 billion. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and other liquid investments of about $7 billion.
So let's turn to Page 4 where you can see the operational metrics for the third quarter. Just a reminder, as Barbara mentioned, the growth rates I'm quoting our adjusted for the impact of the new EU regulations. Our worldwide gross dollar volume, or GDV, growth was 11% on a local currency basis, down 2 ppt from the prior quarter. Overall, our U.S. GDV grew 5%, made up of credit and debit growth of 4% and 6%, respectively. As expected, this includes the impact of the USAA roll-off. Total U.S. GDV had less than one ppt headwind from lower gas prices. And outside of the U.S., volume growth was 14% on a local currency basis. This is down 1 ppt versus last quarter, due to slightly lower growth in each region. Gross dollar volume grew 12% on a local currency basis, about 2 ppt higher than the 10% we saw in the second quarter and driven primarily by commercial travel programs in Europe.  
Let me turn you to Page 5, and here, you see process transactions grew 18% globally to 14.5 billion, which is a 4 ppt increase from last quarter, driven primarily by increased PIN routing in the U.S. Globally, the number of cards grew 6% with 2.3 billion MasterCard- and Maestro-branded cards issued. 
Let's turn to Page 6 for highlights on a few of the revenue line items. Unless otherwise stated, the growth numbers I call out, both here and on the next slide, are on a currency-neutral basis. So net revenue growth was 14%. We saw strong volume and transaction growth, plus a higher contribution from some of our services businesses. Rebates and an incentive through 21% due to higher volume and new and renewed deals. 
Looking quickly on the individual revenue line items on a currency-neutral basis. Domestic assessment grew 10% essentially in line with worldwide GDV growth. Cross-border volume fees grew 15%, while cross-border volume grew 12%. The 3 ppt Gap is due to some pricing actions, partially offset by a higher mix of incher Europe activity. Transaction processing fees grew 19%, in line with process transaction growth. And finally, other revenue grew 23%, predominantly driven by advisers, safety and security and loyalty.
Moving to Page 7. You can see that excluding last year special items, total operating expenses decreased 12% in the quarter, of which more than 2 ppt is due to the impact of foreign exchange activity and balance sheet remeasurement. The remainder of the increase was primarily due to higher personnel costs as we continue to invest in digital services and geographic expansion, as well as higher data processing costs, in line with our transaction growth and Russian domestic processing costs to NSV cost.
Turning to Slide 8. Let's discuss what we see in October through the 21st. Most of our drivers are similar to Q3 except for the U.S. The numbers through October 21 are as follows: starting with process volume, we saw global growth of 10%, and that's equivalent to what we saw in the third quarter but double-digit growth in each region outside of the U.S. In the U.S, our process volume grew 3%, down more than 3 ppt from the first quarter but the same growth in credit programs but lower growth in debit programs, primarily due to the deconversions I mentioned earlier. Excluding that, our October growth was similar to the third quarter. GAAP does not have an impact on our October growth rates.
Process volume outside the U.S. grew 16%, and that's actually up 1 ppt from the third quarter, with higher growth in each region. Globally, practice transaction growth was 17%, down 1 ppt from what we saw in the third quarter. Processed transactions growth outside of the U.S. was similar to Q3 while the U.S. growth was down 3 ppt. And with respect to the cross-border, our volumes grew 13% globally at almost 1 ppt from the third quarter, with faster growth in Europe, driven by a combination of consumer and commercial usage.
Now looking at the full year 2016. There's really no change in our business outlook from what I have discussed at Investor Day back in September. We continue to expect revenue growth in the low double-digit on a currency-neutral basis. When you model on an as-reported basis, adjusting for the impact of all currencies, we now estimate that there would be about a 1 ppt headwind to net revenue growth and the bottom line.  This is less of a headwind than what we said in September given the continued moderation of exchange rates.
Let me call out a few other items that you should consider when modeling 2016. On expenses, we now expect total operating expense growth in the low double-digit range for our as-reported results, excluding special items.
On a currency-neutral basis, we continue to expect low double-digit growth as discussed. At Investor Day, we expect to see positive operating leverage for the year.
And you should now assume in 2016 tax rate towards the lower end of the 28% to 29% range that I talked about in September. As is our normal practice, we will defer any comments about our 2017 outlook until our year-end call in January.
Now let me turn the call back to Barbara to return to Q&A session."

I think this whole commercial business continues to be an area of pretty good growth, and we just heard me talk a little bit about [indiscernible] back some virtual cards and giving examples of UBS and Credit Suisse. But what we're basically seeing, in addition to the transaction side of this, is we're seeing adoption of some of our products, Smart Data, which is reporting reconciliation tool, as well as inControl of the virtual pass system. For commercial payments, it's kind of getting well embedded. I'm also starting to see some increasing interest beyond the typical Bancard users. Technology providers are best commercial payment solutions into their software and their platforms and payment aggregators and verticals such as construction insurance, you see these guys coming into play as well. So there's a series of things we are doing in the B2B space, in the VME space, in the SME space that are all connected to this effort to drive our commercial efforts. The Mastercard Send product that you just heard us talk about again, what this is, is a payment services facilitates for delivery of funds very quickly and very securely to consumers both domestically and internationally. If you take a single connection into this platform, you could be a business, you can be a merchant, you can be a government, a nonprofit issuer, some other center and you can send money to consumers whether bank or nonbank most importantly with the domestic or overseas as well.

And so the combination of this ability to move money to any bank account in the U.S. through Mastercard Send, whether these got a Visa debit card or a MasterCard debit card at the front end of the account, combined with HomeSend, which can connect to these billions of bank accounts across 70 markets using phone systems, that's what [indiscernible]."

So of course, that's a bit more of an acceleration than what we have talked before earlier this year.

Remember, we've been talking a number of times that when you go and do work in a number of Asian countries, African countries, Russia, Venezuela, et cetera, that -- those countries typically with lower yields. And it depends, which quarter, which part of the GDV is growing at which country in terms of how the mix is coming in. And in this quarter, we have a lot better mix coming in. So that's all in domestic yield. What was your second question?"

They are services that are very tightly connected back to the idea of an authentication clearing and settlement system that gives us that insight into a payment transaction. So all our services, be it loyalty and rewards, be it safety and security, be it the data analytics business or our managed services that we do with advisers, all of these connect back to that idea of being connected to the payment transaction and the moment of truth when that happens. So I think we do a relatively good job of tying the two things together when we speak in terms of the logic of why the service we provide with the incremental value add to the clearing authorization and settlement stream. In a number of days, competitive barriers are only as good as the investment we keep putting into them. To keep staying ahead in terms of more technology and innovation. I mean take safety and security. Anybody who would tell you that they figure it out in safety and security is probably something you should randomize from because there is no such right answer. There is a continuous effort of people trying to break in to everywhere systems. You read that all the time. So in only as good in safety and security and effort to keep putting into it to keep your clients having our products and capabilities that keep them, keeping the promise to their consumers. So we recently launched a series of products that artificial intelligence and machine learning in the safety and security space, we're going to keep doing that.

We have better when it comes to EMV, we're well into the latter part of the game. So different aspects of safety and security have got different levels of maturity in terms of what they're solving for and, therefore, require different levels of investment to keep them growing and competitive. I think on competitive edge is that we have been allocating capital to these areas and expenses for the last 7 years. And it's one of the reasons I kept that [indiscernible] I'd like to make sure that you take the expansion of margin off the table as a permanent effort of this company and instead, give you are really healthy margin but use the revenue growth of the company to invest back in creating competitive and frankly great differentiator for future revenue to where they are going."

We've seen that over the last 10 years but as Ajay said, that does not extend to many other countries. It's really for the top tourist destinations."

Very unlikely that there going to find them putting many different wallet [ph] up in the checkout page because the total space available on a mobile phone is relatively restricted. And therefore, there's going to be some kind of trend towards creating the right infrastructure of wallet acceptance over time. I think you'll find with the kind of things we're trying to do, we're trying to ensure that one of the brands of the checkout page is MasterPass because if you could put digital wallets as well as your user wallets to all using MasterPass as an acceptance brand, then that's a good thing. In our view, as I've said this many times, MasterPass is not a B2C effort, it's a B2B effort that I'm doing is not just building wallet because if banks could have their own wallet, if merchant could have their own wallet or they can take a wallet from us private label through open APIs, that doesn't matter. All can come through in a safe and secure way using tokens come through a MasterPass acceptance Wallin. And the idea is to build all our services capabilities but to open APIs already done that in a substantial way to go to MasterCarddeveloper.com or developer.mastercard.com and maybe what came first and what came later. I think developer.mastercard.com, you will find that it's relatively easy to do strike a deal with us to get the cryptogram to unlock the API, then connect to the PO capabilities either the merchant or an issuer. So I've seen MasterPass in the wallet [indiscernible] I've seen MasterPass as a digital strategy and as a future brand for our company. I see the MasterPass system as an acceptance system that enables safe, secure payments and enables open APIs to be connected to that for services. And that's the offering, which is very centric and enables issuers to own their consumer experience by making a digital by default and connecting into their online banking up and enables digital giants to create a seamless acceptance of system and enables merchants to not only repeat their acceptance capability time after time. Because [indiscernible] of MasterPass, they can accept the others and that's what we're trying to do."

This morning's earnings call and the slide deck that will be referenced on the call can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website, mastercard.com. Additionally, the release was attached to an 8-K that we filed with the SEC earlier this morning. A replay of this call will be posted on our website for 30 days.
Both the release and the slide deck include reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to their GAAP equivalents. We've also added a table at the end of both documents which provides additional information about the impact of Article 8 of the EU's recent payments regulation on our GDV and purchase volume growth rates. Since we are no longer charging de minimis fees on co-badged domestic volume that doesn't use our network in markets such as France, this volume is no longer included in our reported volume statistics. We saw the partial impact of this in the second quarter and now have a full quarter of impact in Q3. The table adjust growth rates for the impact by eliminating the related co-badged volume in prior periods so that you can see the underlying run rate of our business. Our comments on the call today will be on the basis of these adjusted rates. 
Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I need to remind everyone that today's call may include some forward-looking statements about Mastercard's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance are summarized at the end of our press release as well as contained in our recent SEC filings. 
Now with that, I'll turn the call over to Ajay."
6477196,402994593,1065661,"MasterCard Incorporated, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2016",2016-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Mastercard Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Barbara. And Barbara, thank you, once again, for your outstanding decade of work for us, and Warren, welcome to the company. Good morning, everybody. Our business continues to perform well.

Good morning, everybody. 
Our business continues to perform well. We are very pleased with our strong results this quarter. As you've seen, we delivered net revenue growth of 14% and an EPS growth of 19% after excluding last year's special items, which was related to the termination of our U.S. employee pension plan.
Our perspective of the global economy remains largely unchanged since last quarter. You've all seen the U.S. GDP growth report this morning. We continue to believe, like we said in the previous quarter, that the U.S. is on a steady growth path with consumer confidence, unemployment and wages holding firm, of course, unless something unforeseen occurs coming out of the upcoming election. But basically the U.S. is on a steady growth path. 
Many markets across Europe are showing a gradual recovery, led by Germany, as economic sentiment holds steady. Unemployment rates are continuing to decline. Although uncertainty from Brexit and [indiscernible] Europe remain a concern, I think it's going to take a few years to understand the full implication. Again, you saw the British GDP report, which got to see it holding steady. Interestingly, underlying U.K. consumer demand remained stable. And in fact, as a result of the weaker pound, inbound travel to the U.K. is picking up over this last quarter.
In the Asia, the picture is still mixed. In China, both exports and imports were down sharply, and you all know the concerns over inflated asset values. In Australia, however, business confidence is up, and India continues its relatively strong growth trajectory 
In Latin America, Brazil, even though it's expected to remain in a recession for the near future, seems to be bottoming out, and the political environment seems to be stabilizing, which should hopefully improve the economic conditions for the next 6 to 12 months. In Venezuela, the political and fiscal crisis is deepening. In Mexico, the economy continues to expand, but with increasing dependence on consumer spending growth. 
So in sum, the outlook from the economic side remains mixed. Even so, we're continuing to grow, we think, double-digit volume in transaction growth across most of our markets. We're continuing to win deals as we execute against our long-term strategy.  
So now let me provide you with a brief update about our planned acquisition of VocaLink. The first step is now complete. The European Commission has referred the transaction back to the U.K. regulator to perform the antitrust review. The second step, which will be led by the U.K. regulator, generally has 2 phases. We're hopeful to complete the review in the first preliminary phase, but it's always possible that this could go into a more detailed second phase. We continue to believe that we can complete this acquisition by about the middle of 2017. 
So before we go to our business highlights, let me just touch on a few regulatory and litigation items that you all asked us about from time to time. So starting with the United States. As you know, the merchant litigation is now back in the Brooklyn court. In the status conference held last week, the court heard arguments in the appointment of class counsel for merchants. Now as the court appoints that council, we expect the litigation to proceed, and we intend to resume the settlement negotiations. But given this complexity, we think this [indiscernible] will take some years to resolve. 
In the U.K., as many of you know, a proposed class action is filed in September on behalf of U.K. consumers seeking damages related to interchange fees. The court will set up a time line for the case soon. We've had good experience addressing similar claims in the United States, and we believe strongly that, in fact, far from being harmed by interchange, U.K. consumers have, in fact, benefited significantly.  
Finally, following legal submissions and an oral hearing this past summer, we continue to be in conversations with the European Commission to find a resolution to the 2015 case around our interchange rates of interregional cross-border transaction and the central acquiring rules.  
So now moving on to some of our recent business activity. You heard a great deal of all of this from our [indiscernible] the recent Investor Day. You had an opportunity to see, firsthand, a number of the product and service innovations we are rolling out. So I'm going to stick to a few items this time. We continue to make solid progress in our U.S. consumer business, building on our recent momentum in debit. We're actually excited to highlight 2 new deals that deepen and strengthen our existing relationships with both U.S. Bank and Regions Bank, which have now been expanded to include preferred MasterCard routing for their PIN debit businesses. 
Outside of the U.S., we're actually pleased to have tripped [ph] a number of portfolios by continuing to leverage services as a key strategic differentiator. I'm going to give you a couple of examples in Europe. We're building on the long-term debit deal we announced last year in Italy with Poste Italiane. We're now expanding our partnership by converting a significant portion of their prepaid portfolio. This deal also includes a number of our services, such as advisers, to help drive their financial inclusion and innovation agendas. Another example with DenizBank, which is one of the market leaders in Turkey, to flip their credit business, which also leverages advisers.
Now the domestic opportunity in China. We're awaiting a more detailed interpretation of the final PBOC regulations, particularly around the newly introduced security provisions and how these would impact our implementation of [indiscernible] switching while protecting our systems and our data. We hope this will be available over the next couple of months. We're continuing to speak with regulators to clarify our options on how best to enter the market. In the meanwhile, we're continuing to make progress in China by winning a number of new deals with banks, including HSBC, China Construction Bank, ICBC and Postal Savings Bank. As part of these deals, they will be issuing new single-branded cards targeted to the country's growing affluent customer segment and to drive cross-border spend.  
We highlighted several key renewals in our commercial business, including FLEETCOR and WEX, both of whom are driving B2B and cross-border spend in unique and innovative ways by leveraging virtual cards. We just added 2 new deals in Europe: one is Credit Suisse, which is focused on the small and medium enterprise segment where MasterCard is the exclusive card provider; the other with UBS, where we're looking forward to deepening our relationship within their corporate banking business.  
So now on to digital strategy. And over the last several quarters, including at the recent Investor Day, we've given you a number of updates on the significant progress we are making with MasterPass. And just to recall, we're taking 2 paddle parts. The first is our digital-by-default strategy, which enables issuers to auto-enroll card holders through their online banking app and helps to drive scale for us while keeping issuers at the center of their consumer relationships. We're quite pleased that more than 80 million accounts will be automatically enabled over the next few months. The second is to deliver a digital payment service that works across all devices, all channels, whether that's in app, online or in-store, and the idea there is to keep growing acceptance by being ubiquitous.
So today, I'll discuss a couple of use cases to give you an idea about some of the unique ways we're using MasterPass with our partners around the world. In South Africa, we're working with MTN and Vodafone, 2 telecom providers who, by the way, put together, have a market share of about 70%, to allow their customers to securely pay for airtime minutes from their mobile device using MasterPass. Prior to this, subscribers will either have to stand in long lines at a third-party service location or go to an ATM to transfer funds to the telecom provider and then wait for their accounts to be updated. Since its launch, more than 4.5 million users have registered for the service and airtime distribution costs, for the mobile network operators, have been reduced by as much as 15%.
Another example in Europe. We've partnered with Czech Railways, the largest rail operator in that country, to integrate MasterPass into their booking app to better compete with new entrants to the transit space and to modernize mobile ticketing. Again, prior to this, users would've had to enter their card details for each purchase. Since its launch in early 2015, users have grown significantly, and MasterPass now account for nearly 8% of all Czech Railways transactions. Both of these examples, I hope, demonstrate to you that through MasterPass, we're not just enabling digital payments, we actually try to create a better consumer experience.
From an acceptance standpoint, MasterPass continues to grow. It's now available in more than 300,000 merchants online and in apps as well as more than 6 million locations in 77 countries that allow contactless payments. We're continuing to add new merchants and -- for example, United Airlines in the U.S., Domino's Pizza and Trenitalia in Europe, KFC in Asia. In addition, last week, we signed the Memorandum of Understanding with the Ecobank group to roll out MasterPass QR in mobile person-to-person merchant service -- mobile person-to-merchant service across 33 African countries. This solution will be integrated with their mobile banking platform will enable users to safely pay for purchases directly from their bank account using a QR code. Again, millions of micro, small and medium enterprises across Africa will now be able to accept secure digital payments quickly and without the expense of a traditional POS server.
So our MasterPass partner-centric approach, as you heard Garry Lyons talk about at Investor Day, which is aimed at delivering a seamless consumer experience, benefits issuers, digital players and merchants. So earlier this week, we highlighted that issuers like Capital One, who are already leveraging our digital-by-default approach, are further integrating MasterPass into their wallet offering. Users of the Capital One Wallet can now shop online and in app and check out using that same embed tokenized log-in credentials at the hundreds of thousands of merchants around the world where MasterPass is accepted. Similarly, at Money20/20, we highlighted an important expansion of our digital partnerships. And starting sometime early next year, Samsung Pay, Android Pay and Microsoft Wallet will also enable the same online and in-app consumer experience that I just mentioned. And finally, clearly, merchants also benefit from this since they've already integrated MasterPass. There's no additional development work required. It gives them access to the millions of consumers who already use these other wallet services or will in the future.
Meanwhile, we continue to support our partners to extend their reach globally, actually, recently, as Android Pay move into Poland; in fact, as Apple Pay expand into Japan and Russia, both currently exclusive with MasterCard. 
Finally, we highlighted our recent partnership with Green Dot and Uber as well as Stripe as Lyft at Investor Day and how they leveraging the MasterCard Send platform to make a meaning and secure payment to drivers, delivery people and others. We just added Allstate who will leverage MasterCard Send to make claims payments to their customers via a debit card, providing nearly instant access to their funds. 
So with that, let me turn the call over to Martina for an update on our financial results and operational metrics. Martina?"
6477196,402994593,1065661,"MasterCard Incorporated, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2016",2016-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Mastercard Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Ajay, and good morning, everyone.

Starting with Page 3, you see there are minimal differences this quarter between non-GAAP reported and currency-neutral growth rates. This, again, exclude the impact of a special item related to the termination of the U.S.-designed pension plan taken last year. 
As you can see from our numbers, we have delivered another strong quarter. Here are a few highlights. Net revenue growth was 14%. Operating expenses grew 12% as we continue to invest in our strategic initiatives. EPS was up $1.08, up 19% year-over-year, driven primarily by our strong operating performance and a slightly lower tax rate. Also, share repurchases contributed $0.03 per share. As of October 25, we have $1.8 billion remaining as our current authorization. Lastly, cash flow from operations was $1.4 billion. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and other liquid investments of about $7 billion.
So let's turn to Page 4 where you can see the operational metrics for the third quarter. Just a reminder, as Barbara mentioned, the growth rates I'm quoting our adjusted for the impact of the new EU regulations. Our worldwide gross dollar volume, or GDV, growth was 11% on a local currency basis, down 2 ppt from the prior quarter. Overall, our U.S. GDV grew 5%, made up of credit and debit growth of 4% and 6%, respectively. As expected, this includes the impact of the USAA roll-off. Total U.S. GDV had less than one ppt headwind from lower gas prices. And outside of the U.S., volume growth was 14% on a local currency basis. This is down 1 ppt versus last quarter, due to slightly lower growth in each region. Gross dollar volume grew 12% on a local currency basis, about 2 ppt higher than the 10% we saw in the second quarter and driven primarily by commercial travel programs in Europe.  
Let me turn you to Page 5, and here, you see process transactions grew 18% globally to 14.5 billion, which is a 4 ppt increase from last quarter, driven primarily by increased PIN routing in the U.S. Globally, the number of cards grew 6% with 2.3 billion MasterCard- and Maestro-branded cards issued. 
Let's turn to Page 6 for highlights on a few of the revenue line items. Unless otherwise stated, the growth numbers I call out, both here and on the next slide, are on a currency-neutral basis. So net revenue growth was 14%. We saw strong volume and transaction growth, plus a higher contribution from some of our services businesses. Rebates and incentive grew 21% due to higher volume and new and renewed deals.  
Looking quickly at the individual revenue line items on a currency-neutral basis. Domestic assessments grew 10%, essentially in line with worldwide GDV growth. Cross-border volume fees grew 15% while cross-border volume grew 12%. The 3 ppt gap is due to some pricing actions, partially offset by a higher mix of intra-Europe activity. Transaction processing fees grew 19%, in line with process transaction growth. And finally, other revenue grew 23%, predominantly driven by advisers, safety and security and loyalty.
Moving to Page 7. You can see that excluding last year's special items, total operating expenses increased 12% in the quarter, of which more than 2 ppt is due to the impact of foreign exchange activity and balance sheet remeasurement. The remainder of the increase was primarily due to higher personnel costs as we continue to invest in digital, services and geographic expansion as well as higher data processing costs in line with our transaction growth and Russian domestic processing cost to NFC costs.
Turning to Slide 8. Let's discuss what we've seen in October through the 21st. Most of our drivers are similar to Q3 except for the U.S. The numbers through October 21 are as follows. Starting with process volume, we saw global growth of 10%, and that's equivalent to what we saw in the third quarter, but double-digit growth in each region outside of the U.S. In the U.S., our process volume grew 3%, down more than 3 ppt from the third quarter, but the same growth in credit programs but lower growth in debit programs, primarily due to the deconversions I mentioned earlier. Excluding that, our October growth was similar to the third quarter. GAAP does not have an impact on our October growth rates. Process volume outside the U.S. grew 16% and that's actually up 1 ppt from the third quarter with higher growth in each region. Globally, process transaction growth was 17%, down 1 ppt from what we saw in the third quarter. Process transaction growth outside the U.S. was similar to Q3 while the U.S. growth was down 3 ppt. And with respect to cross-border, our volumes grew 13% globally at almost 1 ppt from the third quarter with faster growth in Europe, driven by a combination of consumer and commercial usage.
Now looking at the full year 2016. There's really no change in our business outlook from what I have discussed at Investor Day back in September. We continue to expect revenue growth in the low double-digit on a currency-neutral basis. When you model on an as-reported basis, adjusting for the impact of all currencies, we now estimate that there would be about a 1 ppt headwind to net revenue growth and the bottom line. This is less of a headwind than what we said in September, given the continued moderation of exchange rates.
Let me call out a few other items that you should consider when modeling 2016. On expenses, we now expect total operating expense growth in the low double-digit range for our as-reported results, excluding special items. On a currency-neutral basis, we continue to expect low double-digit growth. As discussed at Investor Day, we expect to see positive operating leverage for the year. And you should now assume a 2016 tax rate towards the lower end of the 28% to 29% range that I talked about in September. As is our normal practice, we will defer any comments about our 2017 outlook until our year-end call in January.
Now let me turn the call back to Barbara to begin the Q&A session. Barbara?"

I think this whole commercial business continues to be an area of pretty good growth, and you just heard me talk a little bit about FLEETCOR and WEX and virtual cards and I give you the examples of UBS and Credit Suisse. But what we're basically seeing, in addition to the transaction side of this, is it's seeing an adoption of some of our products, Smart Data, which is a reporting and reconciliation tool as well as inControl, which is a virtual card system. For commercial payments, it's kind of getting well embedded. I'm also starting to see some increasing interest beyond the typical bank card users. Technology providers embed commercial payment solutions into their software and their platforms and payment aggregators and verticals, such as construction, insurance. You see these guys coming into play as well. So there's a series of things we are doing in the B2B space, in the T&E space, in the SME space that are all connected to this effort to drive our commercial efforts. The MasterCard Send product that you just heard us talk about again, what this is, is a payment service that facilitates the delivery of funds very quickly and very securely to consumers both domestically and internationally. If you take a single connection into this platform, you could be a business, you could be a merchant, you could be a government, a nonprofit issuer, some other sender and you can send money to consumers, whether they bank or un-bank, most importantly, whether they're domestic or overseas as well. And that's kind of what we are trying to do here, because in the overseas market, we combine with a JV that we have launched sometime ago called HomeSend, not to be confused with MasterCard Send. That's just a total MasterCard confusion. I don't want you to get confused. And HomeSend is a unique asset for cross-border payments that kind of expand on each billions of bank accounts across more than 70 markets through their phone numbers and systems. And so the combination of this ability to move money to any bank account in the U.S. through MasterCard Send, whether it's got a Visa debit card or a MasterCard debit card at the front end of the account, combined with HomeSend, which can connect to these billions of bank accounts across 70 markets using phone systems, that's what [indiscernible]."

But our services are not services generically. They are services that very tightly connect back to the idea of an authentication clearing and settlement system that gives us the insight into a payment transaction. So all our services, be it loyalty and rewards, be it safety and security, be it the data analytics business or our managed services that we do with advisers, all of these connect back to that idea of being connected to the payment transactions and the moment of truth when that happens. So I think we do a relatively good job of tying the 2 things together when we speak in terms of the logic of why it's service we provide would be incremental value add to the clearing authorization and settlement stream. In a number of ways, competitive barriers are only as good as the investment you keep putting into them to keep staying ahead in terms of more technology and innovation. I mean, take safety and security. Anybody who would tell you that they figured it out, the safety and security, is probably somebody you should run a mile from, because there is no such right answer. There is a continuous effort of people trying to break in to everyone's systems. You read that all the time. So you're only as good in safety and security as the effort you keep putting into it to keep your clients having products and capabilities that keep them keeping their promise to their consumers. So we recently launched a series of products that use artificial intelligence and machine learning in the safety and security space. We're going to keep doing that. We've been -- we would be -- I will tell you, we're in the first innings of a baseball game on that kind of space. We're a little better when it comes to tokenization. We're well into the middle of the game. We are better when it comes to EMV. We're well into the latter part of the game. So different aspects of safety and security have got different levels of maturity in terms of what they're solving for and therefore require different levels of investment to keep them growing and competitive. And I think our competitive edge is that we have been allocating capital to these areas and expenses for the last 7 years, and it's one of the reasons why I kept telling you I'd like to make sure that you take the expansion of margin off the table as a permanent effort of this company and, instead, give you a really healthy margin but use the revenue growth of the company to invest back in creating competitive and, frankly, great differentiator for future revenue for where they're going."

First of all, there is no such thing as a services division, okay? There are many different services that we are actually providing. And here, I called out 3 but we have a ton other ones, right? So I don't want you to just bundle this together. We bundle it together because it's an easier way of contrasting it to our core business, right? So in terms of what I said on the margin is that when you add all the services with their many different margin profiles right back to what Ajay has been actually explaining on the safety and security side together, if you were to add that together, the margin, as a whole, at this point in time is 40%. And what I also said is that -- and by the way, this is not on a fully loaded basis, right? So things like corporate costs, et cetera, are not in there. What I also said that, over time, as we are scaling these services, that we would believe that the margin would increase, okay? And just to remind you, there was this one chart in ICM where I actually showed which services are at a higher-margin level versus which services are lower-margin level. And the safety and security side was actually really at the higher level, and then we kind of worked our way down. Advisers was the next one down. The [indiscernible] was the next one down and processing was actually on the lowest side. So all of those services we're working to scale and with scale, you will be getting some better margin on these businesses."

And some things, they can do themselves. Some of them, they need experts to come help themselves. We have that kind of sales structure built, and it's constantly changing as well to keep pace with where the state is going. So it's a mix of many things that are going into services. I just feel that so long as we can keep it tightly connected to our authorizing and clearing and settlement business, we're actually building yet another leg of the stool for our company for the next couple of decades to come."

So we showed up on the back of the card, and then you have to remind -- remember in the PIN debit market, the merchants are actually then aligning the routing. They're choosing the routing over which network to route. So there's a second thing that you have to think about in terms of, yes, you can buckle on the back of the card. But then do you actually get to see the transaction? And we have a very analytical methodology in terms of trying to see how many transactions we want to see, and that actually influences the pricing that we put out in the market everyday. And so you will see our PIN share going up and down. So you saw it in the third quarter going up. This the new agreements coming in. You saw in our third -- three weeks in October and it's coming a little bit down. That's why you're seeing a little bit less processed transaction. So you should expect it goes up and down."

Their level of sophistication that goes into the decision making of the routing of the PIN debit transaction is way beyond the price. The price is interesting, and it's kind of stable space. But they do enormously sophisticated thinking on the time taken for approval, on the number of turndowns, on all kinds of aspects. And you can move up and down the routing table 5x a day in some of these merchants, depending on what's going on. And so it's a little difficult to predict where that goes, but it's lower-yield business. So the overall impact on the revenue stream of the company tends to be kind of a buffer and all, let's say, shock absorbed, but it's an interesting learning for all of us."

When we talk to you, we're talking about base expenses as well. The acquisitions we are doing, because it's the kind of industry we're in, don't exactly come fully loaded with revenue and unloaded in expense. They tend to come with capabilities that bring expenses and revenues that we need to build over a period of years by putting them together with what we sell. Typically, the lag in that, the timing lag of that creates a higher growth-driven expenses than on revenues for the first few years of owning that property. That's part of what we're talking about when we talk about putting investment capital and the expense dollars to work. The acquisition that all in areas are strategic growth opportunity for us. A number of them are in the services space that Martina was loosely talking about a little while ago, and that's kind of what we're putting our capital to work at. But a lot of our expenses, aside from the acquisitions, tend to go into the digital space because that's where a lot of opportunity will get laid out over the next decade.

Right now, there's no doubt that in the U.K., tourism's up, one. Two, there is a great deal of re-interest in acquiring assets of the United Kingdom. Because if you are sitting outside of the U.K., the values of assets from the U.K. have not only gone down by the change in the currency, they've also gone down by the extreme reaction that the market had to the fears around Brexit. That has also created a level of interest in people traveling and to look at assets in the U.K. Again, I don't know if that will persist because the latest U.K. GDP report actually shows the Brexit response to be terrible. I think it will take time to come. It won't happen this quarter in terms of real GDP change.

MasterPass Europe, my view is that on a small mobile screen, it's unlikely that merchants on their checkout page for browser, on [indiscernible] browser right now, which is still the large portion of digital covers and probably will be a very large portion for the next 4 or 5 years. Very unlikely that they're going to find them putting many different wallet options in the checkout page because the total space available on a mobile phone is relatively restricted, and therefore, there's going to be some kind of trend towards creating the right infrastructure of wallet acceptance over time. And by -- I think you will find that the kind of things we're trying to do, we're trying to ensure that one of the brands in the checkout page is MasterPass because if you could put your digital wallets as well as your user wallets to all using MasterPass as an acceptance brand, then that's a good thing. In our view, and I said this many times, MasterPass is not a B2C effort. It's a B2B effort. What I'm doing is not just building wallet. Because if banks would have their own wallet, a merchant could have their own wallet or they could take a wallet from a private label through open APIs, that doesn't matter. All can come through in a safe, secure way using tokens come through a MasterPass acceptance mark. And the idea is to build all our services capabilities onto open APIs. We've already done that in a substantial way. If you go to mastercard.developer.com -- or developer.mastercard.com -- I think I'm mixing up the what came first and what came later. But I think developer.mastercard.com, you will find that it's relatively easy, if you do strike a deal with us, to get the cryptogram to unlock the API to then connect to the [indiscernible] capabilities, either the merchant or an issuer. So I've seen MasterPass not as a wallet. I've said this for a long time. I see MasterPass as a digital strategy and as a future brand for our company. I see the MasterPass system as an acceptance system that enables safe, secure payments and enables open APIs to be connected to that for services. And that's the offering, which is very partner-centric and enables issuers to own their consumer experience by making a digital by default and connecting into their online banking app. It enables digital giants to create a seamless acceptance system, and it enables merchants to not have to repeat their acceptance capability time after time. Because once they're on MasterPass, they can accept the others. That's what we're trying to do."

This morning's earnings call and the slide deck that will be referenced on the call can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website, mastercard.com. Additionally, the release was attached to an 8-K that we filed with the SEC earlier this morning. A replay of this call will be posted on our website for 30 days.
Both the release and the slide deck include reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to their GAAP equivalents. We've also added a table at the end of both documents which provides additional information about the impact of Article 8 of the EU's recent payments regulation on our GDV and purchase volume growth rates. Since we are no longer charging de minimis fees on co-badged domestic volume that doesn't use our network in markets such as France, this volume is no longer included in our reported volume statistics. We saw the partial impact of this in the second quarter and now have a full quarter of impact in Q3. The table adjust growth rates for the impact by eliminating the related co-badged volume in prior periods so that you can see the underlying run rate of our business. Our comments on the call today will be on the basis of these adjusted rates. 
Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I need to remind everyone that today's call may include some forward-looking statements about Mastercard's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today.

Now with that, I'll turn the call over to Ajay."
6477196,402994593,1065670,"MasterCard Incorporated, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2016",2016-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Mastercard Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Barbara. And Barbara, thank you, once again, for your outstanding decade of work for us, and Warren, welcome to the company. Good morning, everybody. Our business continues to perform well. We are very pleased with our strong results this qua",1935,"Thank you, Barbara. And Barbara, thank you, once again, for your outstanding decade of work for us, and Warren, welcome to the company. Good morning, everybody. 
Our business continues to perform well. We are very pleased with our strong results this quarter. As you've seen, we delivered net revenue growth of 14% and an EPS growth of 19% after excluding last year's special items, which was related to the termination of our U.S. employee pension plan.
Our perspective of the global economy remains largely unchanged since last quarter. You've all seen the U.S. GDP growth report this morning. We continue to believe, like we said in the previous quarter, that the U.S. is on a steady growth path with consumer confidence, unemployment and wages holding firm, of course, unless something unforeseen occurs coming out of the upcoming election. But basically the U.S. is on a steady growth path. 
Many markets across Europe are showing a gradual recovery, led by Germany, as economic sentiment holds steady. Unemployment rates are continuing to decline. Although uncertainty from Brexit and [indiscernible] Europe remain a concern, I think it's going to take a few years to understand the full implication. Again, you saw the British GDP report, which got to see it holding steady. Interestingly, underlying U.K. consumer demand remained stable. And in fact, as a result of the weaker pound, inbound travel to the U.K. is picking up over this last quarter.
In the Asia, the picture is still mixed. In China, both exports and imports were down sharply, and you all know the concerns over inflated asset values. In Australia, however, business confidence is up, and India continues its relatively strong growth trajectory 
In Latin America, Brazil, even though it's expected to remain in a recession for the near future, seems to be bottoming out, and the political environment seems to be stabilizing, which should hopefully improve the economic conditions for the next 6 to 12 months. In Venezuela, the political and fiscal crisis is deepening. In Mexico, the economy continues to expand, but with increasing dependence on consumer spending growth. 
So in sum, the outlook from the economic side remains mixed. Even so, we're continuing to grow, we think, double-digit volume in transaction growth across most of our markets. We're continuing to win deals as we execute against our long-term strategy.  
So now let me provide you with a brief update about our planned acquisition of VocaLink. The first step is now complete. The European Commission has referred the transaction back to the U.K. regulator to perform the antitrust review. The second step, which will be led by the U.K. regulator, generally has 2 phases. We're hopeful to complete the review in the first preliminary phase, but it's always possible that this could go into a more detailed second phase. We continue to believe that we can complete this acquisition by about the middle of 2017. 
So before we go to our business highlights, let me just touch on a few regulatory and litigation items that you all asked us about from time to time. So starting with the United States. As you know, the merchant litigation is now back in the Brooklyn court. In the status conference held last week, the court heard arguments in the appointment of class counsel for merchants. Now as the court appoints that council, we expect the litigation to proceed, and we intend to resume the settlement negotiations. But given this complexity, we think this [indiscernible] will take some years to resolve. 
In the U.K., as many of you know, a proposed class action is filed in September on behalf of U.K. consumers seeking damages related to interchange fees. The court will set up a time line for the case soon. We've had good experience addressing similar claims in the United States, and we believe strongly that, in fact, far from being harmed by interchange, U.K. consumers have, in fact, benefited significantly.  
Finally, following legal submissions and an oral hearing this past summer, we continue to be in conversations with the European Commission to find a resolution to the 2015 case around our interchange rates of interregional cross-border transaction and the central acquiring rules.  
So now moving on to some of our recent business activity. You heard a great deal of all of this from our [indiscernible] the recent Investor Day. You had an opportunity to see, firsthand, a number of the product and service innovations we are rolling out. So I'm going to stick to a few items this time. We continue to make solid progress in our U.S. consumer business, building on our recent momentum in debit. We're actually excited to highlight 2 new deals that deepen and strengthen our existing relationships with both U.S. Bank and Regions Bank, which have now been expanded to include preferred MasterCard routing for their PIN debit businesses. 
Outside of the U.S., we're actually pleased to have tripped [ph] a number of portfolios by continuing to leverage services as a key strategic differentiator. I'm going to give you a couple of examples in Europe. We're building on the long-term debit deal we announced last year in Italy with Poste Italiane. We're now expanding our partnership by converting a significant portion of their prepaid portfolio. This deal also includes a number of our services, such as advisers, to help drive their financial inclusion and innovation agendas. Another example with DenizBank, which is one of the market leaders in Turkey, to flip their credit business, which also leverages advisers.
Now the domestic opportunity in China. We're awaiting a more detailed interpretation of the final PBOC regulations, particularly around the newly introduced security provisions and how these would impact our implementation of [indiscernible] switching while protecting our systems and our data. We hope this will be available over the next couple of months. We're continuing to speak with regulators to clarify our options on how best to enter the market. In the meanwhile, we're continuing to make progress in China by winning a number of new deals with banks, including HSBC, China Construction Bank, ICBC and Postal Savings Bank. As part of these deals, they will be issuing new single-branded cards targeted to the country's growing affluent customer segment and to drive cross-border spend.  
We highlighted several key renewals in our commercial business, including FLEETCOR and WEX, both of whom are driving B2B and cross-border spend in unique and innovative ways by leveraging virtual cards. We just added 2 new deals in Europe: one is Credit Suisse, which is focused on the small and medium enterprise segment where MasterCard is the exclusive card provider; the other with UBS, where we're looking forward to deepening our relationship within their corporate banking business.  
So now on to digital strategy. And over the last several quarters, including at the recent Investor Day, we've given you a number of updates on the significant progress we are making with MasterPass. And just to recall, we're taking 2 paddle parts. The first is our digital-by-default strategy, which enables issuers to auto-enroll card holders through their online banking app and helps to drive scale for us while keeping issuers at the center of their consumer relationships. We're quite pleased that more than 80 million accounts will be automatically enabled over the next few months. The second is to deliver a digital payment service that works across all devices, all channels, whether that's in app, online or in-store, and the idea there is to keep growing acceptance by being ubiquitous.
So today, I'll discuss a couple of use cases to give you an idea about some of the unique ways we're using MasterPass with our partners around the world. In South Africa, we're working with MTN and Vodafone, 2 telecom providers who, by the way, put together, have a market share of about 70%, to allow their customers to securely pay for airtime minutes from their mobile device using MasterPass. Prior to this, subscribers will either have to stand in long lines at a third-party service location or go to an ATM to transfer funds to the telecom provider and then wait for their accounts to be updated. Since its launch, more than 4.5 million users have registered for the service and airtime distribution costs, for the mobile network operators, have been reduced by as much as 15%.
Another example in Europe. We've partnered with Czech Railways, the largest rail operator in that country, to integrate MasterPass into their booking app to better compete with new entrants to the transit space and to modernize mobile ticketing. Again, prior to this, users would've had to enter their card details for each purchase. Since its launch in early 2015, users have grown significantly, and MasterPass now account for nearly 8% of all Czech Railways transactions. Both of these examples, I hope, demonstrate to you that through MasterPass, we're not just enabling digital payments, we actually try to create a better consumer experience.
From an acceptance standpoint, MasterPass continues to grow. It's now available in more than 300,000 merchants online and in apps as well as more than 6 million locations in 77 countries that allow contactless payments. We're continuing to add new merchants and -- for example, United Airlines in the U.S., Domino's Pizza and Trenitalia in Europe, KFC in Asia. In addition, last week, we signed the Memorandum of Understanding with the Ecobank group to roll out MasterPass QR in mobile person-to-person merchant service -- mobile person-to-merchant service across 33 African countries. This solution will be integrated with their mobile banking platform will enable users to safely pay for purchases directly from their bank account using a QR code. Again, millions of micro, small and medium enterprises across Africa will now be able to accept secure digital payments quickly and without the expense of a traditional POS server.
So our MasterPass partner-centric approach, as you heard Garry Lyons talk about at Investor Day, which is aimed at delivering a seamless consumer experience, benefits issuers, digital players and merchants. So earlier this week, we highlighted that issuers like Capital One, who are already leveraging our digital-by-default approach, are further integrating MasterPass into their wallet offering. Users of the Capital One Wallet can now shop online and in app and check out using that same embed tokenized log-in credentials at the hundreds of thousands of merchants around the world where MasterPass is accepted. Similarly, at Money20/20, we highlighted an important expansion of our digital partnerships. And starting sometime early next year, Samsung Pay, Android Pay and Microsoft Wallet will also enable the same online and in-app consumer experience that I just mentioned. And finally, clearly, merchants also benefit from this since they've already integrated MasterPass. There's no additional development work required. It gives them access to the millions of consumers who already use these other wallet services or will in the future.
Meanwhile, we continue to support our partners to extend their reach globally, actually, recently, as Android Pay move into Poland; in fact, as Apple Pay expand into Japan and Russia, both currently exclusive with MasterCard. 
Finally, we highlighted our recent partnership with Green Dot and Uber as well as Stripe as Lyft at Investor Day and how they leveraging the MasterCard Send platform to make a meaning and secure payment to drivers, delivery people and others. We just added Allstate who will leverage MasterCard Send to make claims payments to their customers via a debit card, providing nearly instant access to their funds. 
So with that, let me turn the call over to Martina for an update on our financial results and operational metrics. Martina?"
6477196,402994593,1065670,"MasterCard Incorporated, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2016",2016-10-28,"Earnings Calls","Mastercard Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Ajay, and good morning, everyone.

Starting with Page 3, you see there are minimal differences this quarter between non-GAAP reported and currency-neutral growth rates. This, again, exclude the impact of a special item related to the termination of the U.S.-designed pension plan taken last year. 
As you can see from our numbers, we have delivered another strong quarter. Here are a few highlights. Net revenue growth was 14%. Operating expenses grew 12% as we continue to invest in our strategic initiatives. EPS was up $1.08, up 19% year-over-year, driven primarily by our strong operating performance and a slightly lower tax rate. Also, share repurchases contributed $0.03 per share. As of October 25, we have $1.8 billion remaining as our current authorization. Lastly, cash flow from operations was $1.4 billion. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and other liquid investments of about $7 billion.
So let's turn to Page 4 where you can see the operational metrics for the third quarter. Just a reminder, as Barbara mentioned, the growth rates I'm quoting our adjusted for the impact of the new EU regulations. Our worldwide gross dollar volume, or GDV, growth was 11% on a local currency basis, down 2 ppt from the prior quarter. Overall, our U.S. GDV grew 5%, made up of credit and debit growth of 4% and 6%, respectively. As expected, this includes the impact of the USAA roll-off. Total U.S. GDV had less than one ppt headwind from lower gas prices. And outside of the U.S., volume growth was 14% on a local currency basis. This is down 1 ppt versus last quarter, due to slightly lower growth in each region. Gross dollar volume grew 12% on a local currency basis, about 2 ppt higher than the 10% we saw in the second quarter and driven primarily by commercial travel programs in Europe.  
Let me turn you to Page 5, and here, you see process transactions grew 18% globally to 14.5 billion, which is a 4 ppt increase from last quarter, driven primarily by increased PIN routing in the U.S. Globally, the number of cards grew 6% with 2.3 billion MasterCard- and Maestro-branded cards issued. 
Let's turn to Page 6 for highlights on a few of the revenue line items. Unless otherwise stated, the growth numbers I call out, both here and on the next slide, are on a currency-neutral basis. So net revenue growth was 14%. We saw strong volume and transaction growth, plus a higher contribution from some of our services businesses. Rebates and incentive grew 21% due to higher volume and new and renewed deals.  
Looking quickly at the individual revenue line items on a currency-neutral basis. Domestic assessments grew 10%, essentially in line with worldwide GDV growth. Cross-border volume fees grew 15% while cross-border volume grew 12%. The 3 ppt gap is due to some pricing actions, partially offset by a higher mix of intra-Europe activity. Transaction processing fees grew 19%, in line with process transaction growth. And finally, other revenue grew 23%, predominantly driven by advisers, safety and security and loyalty.
Moving to Page 7. You can see that excluding last year's special items, total operating expenses increased 12% in the quarter, of which more than 2 ppt is due to the impact of foreign exchange activity and balance sheet remeasurement. The remainder of the increase was primarily due to higher personnel costs as we continue to invest in digital, services and geographic expansion as well as higher data processing costs in line with our transaction growth and Russian domestic processing cost to NFC costs.
Turning to Slide 8. Let's discuss what we've seen in October through the 21st. Most of our drivers are similar to Q3 except for the U.S. The numbers through October 21 are as follows. Starting with process volume, we saw global growth of 10%, and that's equivalent to what we saw in the third quarter, but double-digit growth in each region outside of the U.S. In the U.S., our process volume grew 3%, down more than 3 ppt from the third quarter, but the same growth in credit programs but lower growth in debit programs, primarily due to the deconversions I mentioned earlier. Excluding that, our October growth was similar to the third quarter. GAAP does not have an impact on our October growth rates. Process volume outside the U.S. grew 16% and that's actually up 1 ppt from the third quarter with higher growth in each region. Globally, process transaction growth was 17%, down 1 ppt from what we saw in the third quarter. Process transaction growth outside the U.S. was similar to Q3 while the U.S. growth was down 3 ppt. And with respect to cross-border, our volumes grew 13% globally at almost 1 ppt from the third quarter with faster growth in Europe, driven by a combination of consumer and commercial usage.
Now looking at the full year 2016. There's really no change in our business outlook from what I have discussed at Investor Day back in September. We continue to expect revenue growth in the low double-digit on a currency-neutral basis. When you model on an as-reported basis, adjusting for the impact of all currencies, we now estimate that there would be about a 1 ppt headwind to net revenue growth and the bottom line. This is less of a headwind than what we said in September, given the continued moderation of exchange rates.
Let me call out a few other items that you should consider when modeling 2016. On expenses, we now expect total operating expense growth in the low double-digit range for our as-reported results, excluding special items. On a currency-neutral basis, we continue to expect low double-digit growth. As discussed at Investor Day, we expect to see positive operating leverage for the year. And you should now assume a 2016 tax rate towards the lower end of the 28% to 29% range that I talked about in September. As is our normal practice, we will defer any comments about our 2017 outlook until our year-end call in January.
Now let me turn the call back to Barbara to begin the Q&A session. Barbara?"

I think this whole commercial business continues to be an area of pretty good growth, and you just heard me talk a little bit about FLEETCOR and WEX and virtual cards and I give you the examples of UBS and Credit Suisse. But what we're basically seeing, in addition to the transaction side of this, is it's seeing an adoption of some of our products, Smart Data, which is a reporting and reconciliation tool as well as inControl, which is a virtual card system. For commercial payments, it's kind of getting well embedded. I'm also starting to see some increasing interest beyond the typical bank card users. Technology providers embed commercial payment solutions into their software and their platforms and payment aggregators and verticals, such as construction, insurance. You see these guys coming into play as well. So there's a series of things we are doing in the B2B space, in the T&E space, in the SME space that are all connected to this effort to drive our commercial efforts. The MasterCard Send product that you just heard us talk about again, what this is, is a payment service that facilitates the delivery of funds very quickly and very securely to consumers both domestically and internationally. If you take a single connection into this platform, you could be a business, you could be a merchant, you could be a government, a nonprofit issuer, some other sender and you can send money to consumers, whether they bank or un-bank, most importantly, whether they're domestic or overseas as well. And that's kind of what we are trying to do here, because in the overseas market, we combine with a JV that we have launched sometime ago called HomeSend, not to be confused with MasterCard Send. That's just a total MasterCard confusion. I don't want you to get confused. And HomeSend is a unique asset for cross-border payments that kind of expand on each billions of bank accounts across more than 70 markets through their phone numbers and systems. And so the combination of this ability to move money to any bank account in the U.S. through MasterCard Send, whether it's got a Visa debit card or a MasterCard debit card at the front end of the account, combined with HomeSend, which can connect to these billions of bank accounts across 70 markets using phone systems, that's what [indiscernible]."

I would rather focus on the opportunity that exist in this industry to grow versus so much more there is to do. Remember, 85% of the world retail transactions are still in cash and check. And that's -- I think our focus is giving us the benefit of thinking that through in a way that's allowing us to build assets and capabilities to aim for the bigger pie and keep at it over a period of quarters. There'll be quarters when we do better. I'm sure there'll be quarters when somebody else does better, and I'm fine with that. I'm more focused on where we're executing for the next few years."

So of course, that's a bit more of an acceleration than what we have talked before earlier this year.

So I've signed agreement with one customer for 10 years and another agreement with another customer for 20 years. And so we did talk in 2015 that we have to step up the incentives. The accounting was a little bit different. So in the early part of the year, we are actually amortizing more of those incentives. You see that second year. So the 2016 number is going to be with us in 2017 and et cetera. You see the same kind of step-up. In addition to that, when you look at our results this year, you do see some better revenue rates coming in on the gross side. You will see some more contract being dragged with that.

But our services are not services generically. They are services that very tightly connect back to the idea of an authentication clearing and settlement system that gives us the insight into a payment transaction. So all our services, be it loyalty and rewards, be it safety and security, be it the data analytics business or our managed services that we do with advisers, all of these connect back to that idea of being connected to the payment transactions and the moment of truth when that happens. So I think we do a relatively good job of tying the 2 things together when we speak in terms of the logic of why it's service we provide would be incremental value add to the clearing authorization and settlement stream. In a number of ways, competitive barriers are only as good as the investment you keep putting into them to keep staying ahead in terms of more technology and innovation. I mean, take safety and security. Anybody who would tell you that they figured it out, the safety and security, is probably somebody you should run a mile from, because there is no such right answer. There is a continuous effort of people trying to break in to everyone's systems. You read that all the time. So you're only as good in safety and security as the effort you keep putting into it to keep your clients having products and capabilities that keep them keeping their promise to their consumers. So we recently launched a series of products that use artificial intelligence and machine learning in the safety and security space. We're going to keep doing that. We've been -- we would be -- I will tell you, we're in the first innings of a baseball game on that kind of space. We're a little better when it comes to tokenization. We're well into the middle of the game. We are better when it comes to EMV. We're well into the latter part of the game. So different aspects of safety and security have got different levels of maturity in terms of what they're solving for and therefore require different levels of investment to keep them growing and competitive. And I think our competitive edge is that we have been allocating capital to these areas and expenses for the last 7 years, and it's one of the reasons why I kept telling you I'd like to make sure that you take the expansion of margin off the table as a permanent effort of this company and, instead, give you a really healthy margin but use the revenue growth of the company to invest back in creating competitive and, frankly, great differentiator for future revenue for where they're going."

So I don't want you to just bundle this together. We bundle it together because it's an easier way of contrasting it to our core business, right? So in terms of what I said on the margin is that when you add all the services with their many different margin profiles right back to what Ajay has been actually explaining on the safety and security side together, if you were to add that together, the margin, as a whole, at this point in time is 40%. And what I also said is that -- and by the way, this is not on a fully loaded basis, right? So things like corporate costs, et cetera, are not in there. What I also said that, over time, as we are scaling these services, that we would believe that the margin would increase, okay? And just to remind you, there was this one chart in ICM where I actually showed which services are at a higher-margin level versus which services are lower-margin level. And the safety and security side was actually really at the higher level, and then we kind of worked our way down. Advisers was the next one down. The [indiscernible] was the next one down and processing was actually on the lowest side.

But then do you actually get to see the transaction? And we have a very analytical methodology in terms of trying to see how many transactions we want to see, and that actually influences the pricing that we put out in the market everyday. And so you will see our PIN share going up and down. So you saw it in the third quarter going up. This the new agreements coming in.

So what we did from a adviser point of view, from a data analytics point of view, from a loyalty and from a safety and security investment point of view, some of the investments that Ajay was talking earlier about was very important for us to do. Some of the numbers are masked in terms of when you look at the foreign exchange hedging activity that came in 2015, which actually was a benefit there for us, and in 2016, it was a drag. So when you actually take that out, our operating expense growth is relatively similar. We would continue to expect that we will have to invest. And yes, I am not going to go into 2017. But as you can see, for 2016, we really have not changed our forecast at all in terms of how we think we are rounding out this year, which is the low double-digit growth number that we gave on a currency neutral basis."

The discipline that Martina has in our company around acquisition is that at the end of 2 years, the acquisition becomes part of our base. When we talk to you, we're talking about base expenses as well. The acquisitions we are doing, because it's the kind of industry we're in, don't exactly come fully loaded with revenue and unloaded in expense. They tend to come with capabilities that bring expenses and revenues that we need to build over a period of years by putting them together with what we sell. Typically, the lag in that, the timing lag of that creates a higher growth-driven expenses than on revenues for the first few years of owning that property. That's part of what we're talking about when we talk about putting investment capital and the expense dollars to work. The acquisition that all in areas are strategic growth opportunity for us. A number of them are in the services space that Martina was loosely talking about a little while ago, and that's kind of what we're putting our capital to work at. But a lot of our expenses, aside from the acquisitions, tend to go into the digital space because that's where a lot of opportunity will get laid out over the next decade. Revenues, not as much as staking out capabilities right now."

Right now, there's no doubt that in the U.K., tourism's up, one. Two, there is a great deal of re-interest in acquiring assets of the United Kingdom. Because if you are sitting outside of the U.K., the values of assets from the U.K. have not only gone down by the change in the currency, they've also gone down by the extreme reaction that the market had to the fears around Brexit. That has also created a level of interest in people traveling and to look at assets in the U.K. Again, I don't know if that will persist because the latest U.K. GDP report actually shows the Brexit response to be terrible. I think it will take time to come. It won't happen this quarter in terms of real GDP change.

MasterPass Europe, my view is that on a small mobile screen, it's unlikely that merchants on their checkout page for browser, on [indiscernible] browser right now, which is still the large portion of digital covers and probably will be a very large portion for the next 4 or 5 years. Very unlikely that they're going to find them putting many different wallet options in the checkout page because the total space available on a mobile phone is relatively restricted, and therefore, there's going to be some kind of trend towards creating the right infrastructure of wallet acceptance over time. And by -- I think you will find that the kind of things we're trying to do, we're trying to ensure that one of the brands in the checkout page is MasterPass because if you could put your digital wallets as well as your user wallets to all using MasterPass as an acceptance brand, then that's a good thing. In our view, and I said this many times, MasterPass is not a B2C effort. It's a B2B effort. What I'm doing is not just building wallet. Because if banks would have their own wallet, a merchant could have their own wallet or they could take a wallet from a private label through open APIs, that doesn't matter. All can come through in a safe, secure way using tokens come through a MasterPass acceptance mark. And the idea is to build all our services capabilities onto open APIs. We've already done that in a substantial way. If you go to mastercard.developer.com -- or developer.mastercard.com -- I think I'm mixing up the what came first and what came later. But I think developer.mastercard.com, you will find that it's relatively easy, if you do strike a deal with us, to get the cryptogram to unlock the API to then connect to the [indiscernible] capabilities, either the merchant or an issuer. So I've seen MasterPass not as a wallet. I've said this for a long time. I see MasterPass as a digital strategy and as a future brand for our company. I see the MasterPass system as an acceptance system that enables safe, secure payments and enables open APIs to be connected to that for services. And that's the offering, which is very partner-centric and enables issuers to own their consumer experience by making a digital by default and connecting into their online banking app. It enables digital giants to create a seamless acceptance system, and it enables merchants to not have to repeat their acceptance capability time after time. Because once they're on MasterPass, they can accept the others. That's what we're trying to do."

This morning's earnings call and the slide deck that will be referenced on the call can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website, mastercard.com. Additionally, the release was attached to an 8-K that we filed with the SEC earlier this morning. A replay of this call will be posted on our website for 30 days.
Both the release and the slide deck include reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to their GAAP equivalents. We've also added a table at the end of both documents which provides additional information about the impact of Article 8 of the EU's recent payments regulation on our GDV and purchase volume growth rates. Since we are no longer charging de minimis fees on co-badged domestic volume that doesn't use our network in markets such as France, this volume is no longer included in our reported volume statistics. We saw the partial impact of this in the second quarter and now have a full quarter of impact in Q3. The table adjusts growth rates for the impact by eliminating the related co-badged volume in prior periods so that you can see the underlying run rate of our business. Our comments on the call today will be on the basis of these adjusted rates. 
Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I need to remind everyone that today's call may include some forward-looking statements about Mastercard's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance are summarized at the end of our press release as well as contained in our recent SEC filings.

Good morning, everybody. 
Our business continues to perform well. We are very pleased with our strong results this quarter. As you've seen, we delivered net revenue growth of 14% and an EPS growth of 19% after excluding last year's special items, which was related to the termination of our U.S. employee pension plan.
Our perspective of the global economy remains largely unchanged since last quarter. You've all seen the U.S. GDP growth report this morning. We continue to believe, like we said in the previous quarter, that the U.S. is on a steady growth path with consumer confidence, unemployment and wages holding firm, of course, unless something unforeseen occurs coming out of the upcoming election. But basically the U.S. is on a steady growth path. 
Many markets across Europe are showing a gradual recovery, led by Germany, as economic sentiment holds steady. Unemployment rates are continuing to decline. Although uncertainty from Brexit and that's a back on Europe remain a concern, I think it's going to take a few years to understand the full implication. Again, you saw the British GDP report, which got to see it holding steady. Interestingly, underlying U.K. consumer demand remained stable. And in fact, as a result of the weaker pound, inbound travel to the U.K. is picking up over this last quarter.
In the Asia, the picture is still mixed. In China, both exports and imports were down sharply, and you all know the concerns over inflated asset values. In Australia, however, business confidence is up, and India continues its relatively strong growth trajectory.
In Latin America, Brazil, even though it's expected to remain in a recession for the near future, seems to be bottoming out, and the political environment seems to be stabilizing, which should hopefully improve the economic conditions for the next 6 to 12 months. In Venezuela, the political and fiscal crisis is deepening. In Mexico, the economy continues to expand, but with increasing dependence on consumer spending growth. 
So in sum, the outlook from the economic side remains mixed. Even so, we're continuing to grow, we think, double-digit volume in transaction growth across most of our markets. We're continuing to win deals as we execute against our long-term strategy.  
So now let me provide you with a brief update about our planned acquisition of VocaLink. The first step is now complete. The European Commission has referred the transaction back to the U.K. regulator to perform the antitrust review. The second step, which will be led by the U.K. regulator, generally has 2 phases. We're hopeful to complete the review in the first preliminary phase, but it's always possible that this could go into a more detailed second phase. We continue to believe that we can complete this acquisition by about the middle of 2017. 
So before we go to our business highlights, let me just touch on a few regulatory and litigation items that you all asked us about from time to time. So starting with the United States. As you know, the merchant litigation is now back in the Brooklyn court. In the status conference held last week, the court heard arguments in the appointment of class counsel for merchants. Now as the court appoints that council, we expect the litigation to proceed, and we intend to resume the settlement negotiations. But given this complexity, we think this thoughts[indiscernible] will take some years to resolve. 
In the U.K., as many of you know, a proposed class action is filed in September on behalf of U.K. consumers seeking damages related to interchange fees. The court will set up a time line for the case soon. We've had good experience addressing similar claims in the United States, and we believe strongly that, in fact, far from being harmed by interchange, U.K. consumers have, in fact, benefited significantly.  
Finally, following legal submissions and an oral hearing this past summer, we continue to be in conversations with the European Commission to find a resolution to the 2015 case around our interchange rates of interregional cross-border transactions and the central acquiring rules.  
So now moving on to some of our recent business activity. You heard a great deal of all of this from our asset[indiscernible] the recent Investor Day. You had an opportunity to see, firsthand, a number of the product and service innovations we are rolling out. So I'm going to stick to a few items this time. We continue to make solid progress in our U.S. consumer business, building on our recent momentum in debit. We're actually excited to highlight 2 new deals that deepen and strengthen our existing relationships with both U.S. Bank and Regions Bank, which have now been expanded to include preferred MasterCard routing for their PIN debit businesses. 
Outside of the U.S., we're actually pleased to have tripped a number of portfolios by continuing to leverage services as a key strategic differentiator. I'm going to give you a couple of examples in Europe. We're building on the long-term debit deal we announced last year in Italy with Poste Italiane. We're now expanding our partnership by converting a significant portion of their prepaid portfolio. This deal also includes a number of our services, such as advisers, to help drive their financial inclusion and innovation agendas. Another example with DenizBank, which is one of the market leaders in Turkey, to flip their credit business, which also leverages advisers.
Now the domestic opportunity in China. We're awaiting a more detailed interpretation of the final PBOC regulations, particularly around the newly introduced security provisions and how these would impact our implementation of also[indiscernible] switching while protecting our systems and our data. We hope this will be available over the next couple of months. We're continuing to speak with regulators to clarify our options on how best to enter the market. In the meanwhile, we're continuing to make progress in China by winning a number of new deals with banks, including HSBC, China Construction Bank, ICBC and Postal Savings Bank. As part of these deals, they will be issuing new single-branded cards targeted to the country's growing affluent customer segment and to drive cross-border spend.  
We highlighted several key renewals in our commercial business, including FLEETCOR and WEX, both of whom are driving B2B and cross-border spend in unique and innovative ways by leveraging virtual cards. We just added 2 new deals in Europe: one is Credit Suisse, which is focused on the small and medium enterprise segment where MasterCard is the exclusive card provider; the other with UBS, where we're looking forward to deepening our relationship within their corporate banking business.  
So now on to digital strategy. And over the last several quarters, including at the recent Investor Day, we've given you a number of updates on the significant progress we are making with MasterPass. And just to recall, we're taking 2 paddle parts. The first is our digital-by-default strategy, which enables issuers to auto-enroll card holders through their online banking app and helps to drive scale for us while keeping issuers at the center of their consumer relationships. We're quite pleased that more than 80 million accounts will be automatically enabled over the next few months. The second is to deliver a digital payment service that works across all devices, all channels, whether that's in app, online or in-store, and the idea there is to keep growing acceptance by being ubiquitous.
So today, I'll discuss a couple of use cases to give you an idea about some of the unique ways we're using MasterPass with our partners around the world. In South Africa, we're working with MTN and Vodafone, 2 telecom providers who, by the way, put together, have a market share of about 70%, to allow their customers to securely pay for airtime minutes from their mobile device using MasterPass. Prior to this, subscribers will either have to stand in long lines at a third-party service location or go to an ATM to transfer funds to the telecom provider and then wait for their accounts to be updated. Since its launch, more than 4.5 million users have registered for the service and airtime distribution costs, for the mobile network operators, have been reduced by as much as 15%.
Another example in Europe. We've partnered with Czech Railways, the largest rail operator in that country, to integrate MasterPass into their booking app to better compete with new entrants to the transit space and to modernize mobile ticketing. Again, prior to this, users would've had to enter their card details for each purchase. Since its launch in early 2015, users have grown significantly, and MasterPass now account for nearly 8% of all Czech Railways transactions. Both of these examples, I hope, demonstrate to you that through MasterPass, we're not just enabling digital payments, we actually try to create a better consumer experience.
From an acceptance standpoint, MasterPass continues to grow. It's now available in more than 300,000 merchants online and in apps as well as more than 6 million locations in 77 countries that allow contactless payments. We're continuing to add new merchants and -- for example, United Airlines in the U.S., Domino's Pizza and Trenitalia in Europe, KFC in Asia. In addition, last week, we signed the Memorandum of Understanding with the Ecobank group to roll out MasterPass QR in mobile person-to-person merchant service -- mobile person-to-merchant service across 33 African countries. This solution will be integrated with their mobile banking platform will enable users to safely pay for purchases directly from their bank account using a QR code. Again, millions of micro, small and medium enterprises across Africa will now be able to accept secure digital payments quickly and without the expense of a traditional POS server.
So our MasterPass partner-centric approach, as you heard Garry Lyons talk about at Investor Day, which is aimed at delivering a seamless consumer experience, benefits issuers, digital players and merchants. So earlier this week, we highlighted that issuers like Capital One, who are already leveraging our digital-by-default approach, are further integrating MasterPass into their wallet offering. Users of the Capital One Wallet can now shop online and in app and check out using that same embed tokenized log-in credentials at the hundreds of thousands of merchants around the world where MasterPass is accepted. Similarly, at Money20/20, we highlighted an important expansion of our digital partnerships. And starting sometime early next year, Samsung Pay, Android Pay and Microsoft Wallet will also enable the same online and in-app consumer experience that I just mentioned. And finally, clearly, merchants also benefit from this since they've already integrated MasterPass. There's no additional development work required. It gives them access to the millions of consumers who already use these other wallet services or will in the future.
Meanwhile, we continue to support our partners to extend their reach globally, actually, recently, as Android Pay move into Poland; in fact, as Apple Pay expand into Japan and Russia, both currently exclusive with MasterCard. 
Finally, we highlighted our recent partnership with Green Dot and Uber as well as Stripe as Lyft at Investor Day and how they leveraging the MasterCard Send platform to make a meaning and secure payment to drivers, delivery people and others. We just added Allstate who will leverage MasterCard Send to make claims payments to their customers via a debit card, providing nearly instant access to their funds. 
So with that, let me turn the call over to Martina for an update on our financial results and operational metrics. Martina?"

Starting with Page 3, you see there are minimal differences this quarter between non-GAAP reported and currency-neutral growth rates.

Starting with Page 3, you see there are minimal differences this quarter between non-GAAP reported and currency-neutral growth rates. This, again, exclude the impact of a special item related to the termination of the U.S.-designed pension plan taken last year. 
As you can see from our numbers, we have delivered another strong quarter. Here are a few highlights. Net revenue growth was 14%. Operating expenses grew 12% as we continue to invest in our strategic initiatives. EPS was up $1.08, up 19% year-over-year, driven primarily by our strong operating performance and a slightly lower tax rate. Also, share repurchases contributed $0.03 per share. As of October 25, we have $1.8 billion remaining as our current authorization. Lastly, cash flow from operations was $1.4 billion. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and other liquid investments of about $7 billion.
So let's turn to Page 4 where you can see the operational metrics for the third quarter. Just a reminder, as Barbara mentioned, the growth rates I'm quoting our adjusted for the impact of the new EU regulations. Our worldwide gross dollar volume, or GDV, growth was 11% on a local currency basis, down 2 ppt from the prior quarter. Overall, our U.S. GDV grew 5%, made up of credit and debit growth of 4% and 6%, respectively. As expected, this includes the impact of the USAA roll-off. Total U.S. GDV had less than one ppt headwind from lower gas prices. And outside of the U.S., volume growth was 14% on a local currency basis. This is down 1 ppt versus last quarter, due to slightly lower growth in each region. Gross dollar volume grew 12% on a local currency basis, about 2 ppt higher than the 10% we saw in the second quarter and driven primarily by commercial travel programs in Europe.  
Let me turn you to Page 5, and here, you see process transactions grew 18% globally to 14.5 billion, which is a 4 ppt increase from last quarter, driven primarily by increased PIN routing in the U.S. Globally, the number of cards grew 6% with 2.3 billion MasterCard- and Maestro-branded cards issued. 
Let's turn to Page 6 for highlights on a few of the revenue line items. Unless otherwise stated, the growth numbers I call out, both here and on the next slide, are on a currency-neutral basis. So net revenue growth was 14%. We saw strong volume and transaction growth, plus a higher contribution from some of our services businesses. Rebates and incentive grew 21% due to higher volume and new and renewed deals.  
Looking quickly at the individual revenue line items on a currency-neutral basis. Domestic assessments grew 10%, essentially in line with worldwide GDV growth. Cross-border volume fees grew 15% while cross-border volume grew 12%. The 3 ppt gap is due to some pricing actions, partially offset by a higher mix of intra-Europe activity. Transaction processing fees grew 19%, in line with process transaction growth. And finally, other revenue grew 23%, predominantly driven by advisers, safety and security and loyalty.
Moving to Page 7. You can see that excluding last year's special items, total operating expenses increased 12% in the quarter, of which more than 2 ppt is due to the impact of foreign exchange activity and balance sheet remeasurement. The remainder of the increase was primarily due to higher personnel costs as we continue to invest in digital, services and geographic expansion as well as higher data processing costs in line with our transaction growth and Russian domestic processing cost to NFC costs.
Turning to Slide 8. Let's discuss what we've seen in October through the 21st. Most of our drivers are similar to Q3 except for the U.S. The numbers through October 21 are as follows. Starting with process volume, we saw global growth of 10%, and that's equivalent to what we saw in the third quarter, but double-digit growth in each region outside of the U.S. In the U.S., our process volume grew 3%, down more than 3 ppt from the third quarter, but the same growth in credit programs but lower growth in debit programs, primarily due to the deconversions I mentioned earlier. Excluding that, our October growth was similar to the third quarter. GAAP does not have an impact on our October growth rates. Process volume outside the U.S. grew 16% and that's actually up 1 ppt from the third quarter with higher growth in each region. Globally, process transaction growth was 17%, down 1 ppt from what we saw in the third quarter. Process transaction growth outside the U.S. was similar to Q3 while the U.S. growth was down 3 ppt. And with respect to cross-border, our volumes grew 13% globally at almost 1 ppt from the third quarter with faster growth in Europe, driven by a combination of consumer and commercial usage.
Now looking at the full year 2016. There's really no change in our business outlook from what I have discussed at Investor Day back in September. We continue to expect revenue growth in the low double-digit on a currency-neutral basis. When you model on an as-reported basis, adjusting for the impact of all currencies, we now estimate that there would be about a 1 ppt headwind to net revenue growth and the bottom line. This is less of a headwind than what we said in September, given the continued moderation of exchange rates.
Let me call out a few other items that you should consider when modeling 2016. On expenses, we now expect total operating expense growth in the low double-digit range for our as-reported results, excluding special items. On a currency-neutral basis, we continue to expect low double-digit growth. As discussed at Investor Day, we expect to see positive operating leverage for the year. And you should now assume a 2016 tax rate towards the lower end of the 28% to 29% range that I talked about in September. As is our normal practice, we will defer any comments about our 2017 outlook until our year-end call in January.
Now let me turn the call back to Barbara to begin the Q&A session. Barbara?"

I think this whole commercial business continues to be an area of pretty good growth, and you just heard me talk a little bit about FLEETCOR and WEX and virtual cards and I give you the examples of UBS and Credit Suisse. But what we're basically seeing, in addition to the transaction side of this, is it's seeing an adoption of some of our products, Smart Data, which is a reporting and reconciliation tool as well as inControl, which is a virtual card system. For commercial payments, it's kind of getting well embedded. I'm also starting to see some increasing interest beyond the typical bank card users. Technology providers embed commercial payment solutions into their software and their platforms and payment aggregators and verticals, such as construction, insurance. You see these guys coming into play as well. So there's a series of things we are doing in the B2B space, in the T&E space, in the SME space that are all connected to this effort to drive our commercial efforts. The MasterCard Send product that you just heard us talk about again, what this is, is a payment service that facilitates the delivery of funds very quickly and very securely to consumers both domestically and internationally. If you take a single connection into this platform, you could be a business, you could be a merchant, you could be a government, a nonprofit issuer, some other sender and you can send money to consumers, whether they bank or un-bank, most importantly, whether they're domestic or overseas as well. And that's kind of what we are trying to do here, because in the overseas market, we combine with a JV that we have launched sometime ago called HomeSend, not to be confused with MasterCard Send. That's just a total MasterCard confusion. I don't want you to get confused. And HomeSend is a unique asset for cross-border payments that kind of expand on each billions of bank accounts across more than 70 markets through their phone numbers and systems. And so the combination of this ability to move money to any bank account in the U.S. through MasterCard Send, whether it's got a Visa debit card or a MasterCard debit card at the front end of the account, combined with HomeSend, which can connect to these billions of bank accounts across 70 markets using phone systems, that's what there up."

I would rather focus on the opportunity that exist in this industry to grow versus so much more there is to do. Remember, 85% of the world retail transactions are still in cash and check. And that's -- I think our focus is giving us the benefit of thinking that through in a way that's allowing us to build assets and capabilities to aim for the bigger pie and keep at it over a period of quarters. There'll be quarters when we do better. I'm sure there'll be quarters when somebody else does better, and I'm fine with that. I'm more focused on where we're executing for the next few years."

But yes, you will see a slowdown in the fourth quarter, and you have to consider 2 factors. One, we have the USAA roll-off, and that will be pretty much complete by the end of the year from what we understand. So of course, that's a bit more of an acceleration than what we have talked before earlier this year. And secondly, on the rebates and incentive side, it's normal for us in the fourth quarter, just before year-end, to sign a whole bunch of new agreements and renewing agreements.

One thing is for sure, ACH will become even more relevant in the PSD2 environment, and you know that we've talked about that when we spoke to you about the reason that we were keen on getting into the ACH space, particularly into the fast ACH space. So there are other elements of PSD2. There's elements to do with strong customer authentication for Italy for online transactions that -- depending on how it actually gets rolled out, it could actually create either a hindrance to the simplicity of an e-commerce checkout, or if it's done very smartly, it could actually make it smooth and safer.

But our services are not services generically. They are services that very tightly connect back to the idea of an authentication clearing and settlement system that gives us the insight into a payment transaction. So all our services, be it loyalty and rewards, be it safety and security, be it the data analytics business or our managed services that we do with advisers, all of these connect back to that idea of being connected to the payment transactions and the moment of truth when that happens. So I think we do a relatively good job of tying the 2 things together when we speak in terms of the logic of why it's service we provide would be incremental value add to the clearing authorization and settlement stream. In a number of ways, competitive barriers are only as good as the investment you keep putting into them to keep staying ahead in terms of more technology and innovation. I mean, take safety and security. Anybody who would tell you that they figured it out, the safety and security, is probably somebody you should run a mile from, because there is no such right answer. There is a continuous effort of people trying to break in to everyone's systems. You read that all the time. So you're only as good in safety and security as the effort you keep putting into it to keep your clients having products and capabilities that keep them keeping their promise to their consumers. So we recently launched a series of products that use artificial intelligence and machine learning in the safety and security space. We're going to keep doing that. We've been -- we would be -- I will tell you, we're in the first innings of a baseball game on that kind of space. We're a little better when it comes to tokenization. We're well into the middle of the game. We are better when it comes to EMV. We're well into the latter part of the game. So different aspects of safety and security have got different levels of maturity in terms of what they're solving for and therefore require different levels of investment to keep them growing and competitive. And I think our competitive edge is that we have been allocating capital to these areas and expenses for the last 7 years, and it's one of the reasons why I kept telling you I'd like to make sure that you take the expansion of margin off the table as a permanent effort of this company and, instead, give you a really healthy margin but use the revenue growth of the company to invest back in creating competitive and, frankly, great differentiator for future revenue for where they're going."

So I don't want you to just bundle this together. We bundle it together because it's an easier way of contrasting it to our core business, right? So in terms of what I said on the margin is that when you add all the services with their many different margin profiles right back to what Ajay has been actually explaining on the safety and security side together, if you were to add that together, the margin, as a whole, at this point in time is 40%. And what I also said is that -- and by the way, this is not on a fully loaded basis, right? So things like corporate costs, et cetera, are not in there. What I also said that, over time, as we are scaling these services, that we would believe that the margin would increase, okay? And just to remind you, there was this one chart in ICM where I actually showed which services are at a higher-margin level versus which services are lower-margin level. And the safety and security side was actually really at the higher level, and then we kind of worked our way down. Advisers was the next one down. The loyalty was the next one down and processing was actually on the lowest side. So all of those services we're working to scale and with scale, you will be getting some better margin on these businesses."

But then do you actually get to see the transaction? And we have a very analytical methodology in terms of trying to see how many transactions we want to see, and that actually influences the pricing that we put out in the market everyday. And so you will see our PIN share going up and down. So you saw it in the third quarter going up. This the new agreements coming in.

But they do enormously sophisticated thinking on the time taken for approval, on the number of turndowns, on all kinds of aspects. And you can move up and down the routing table 5x a day in some of these merchants, depending on what's going on. And so it's a little difficult to predict where that goes, but it's lower-yield business. So the overall impact on the revenue stream of the company tends to be kind of a buffer and all, let's say, shock absorbed, but it's an interesting learning for all of us."

They tend to come with capabilities that bring expenses and revenues that we need to build over a period of years by putting them together with what we sell. Typically, the lag in that, the timing lag of that creates a higher growth-driven expenses than on revenues for the first few years of owning that property. That's part of what we're talking about when we talk about putting investment capital and the expense dollars to work. The acquisition that all in areas are strategic growth opportunity for us. A number of them are in the services space that Martina was loosely talking about a little while ago, and that's kind of what we're putting our capital to work at.

Right now, there's no doubt that in the U.K., tourism's up, one. Two, there is a great deal of re-interest in acquiring assets of the United Kingdom. Because if you are sitting outside of the U.K., the values of assets from the U.K. have not only gone down by the change in the currency, they've also gone down by the extreme reaction that the market had to the fears around Brexit. That has also created a level of interest in people traveling and to look at assets in the U.K. Again, I don't know if that will persist because the latest U.K. GDP report actually shows the Brexit response to be terrible. I think it will take time to come. It won't happen this quarter in terms of real GDP change.

MasterPass Europe, my view is that on a small mobile screen, it's unlikely that merchants on their checkout page for browser, I'm talking browser right now, which is still the large portion of digital covers and probably will be a very large portion for the next 4 or 5 years. Very unlikely that they're going to find them putting many different wallet options in the checkout page because the total space available on a mobile phone is relatively restricted, and therefore, there's going to be some kind of trend towards creating the right infrastructure of wallet acceptance over time. And by -- I think you will find with the kind of things we're trying to do, we're trying to ensure that one of the brands in the checkout page is MasterPass because if you could put your digital wallets as well as your user wallets to all using MasterPass as an acceptance brand, then that's a good thing. In our view, and I said this many times, MasterPass is not a B2C effort. It's a B2B effort. What I'm doing is not just building wallets. Because if banks would have their own wallet, a merchant could have their own wallet or they could take a wallet from a private label through open APIs, that doesn't matter. All can come through in a safe, secure way using tokens come through a MasterPass acceptance mark. And the idea is to build all our services capabilities onto open APIs. We've already done that in a substantial way. If you go to mastercard.developer.com -- or developer.mastercard.com -- I think I'm mixing up the what came first and what came later. But I think developer.mastercard.com, you will find that it's relatively easy, if you do strike a deal with us, to get the cryptogram to unlock the API to then connect it up to your capabilities, either the merchant or an issuer. So I've seen MasterPass not as a wallet. I've said this for a long time. I see MasterPass as a digital strategy and as a future brand for our company. I see the MasterPass system as an acceptance system that enables safe, secure payments and enables open APIs to be connected to that for services. And that's the offering, which is very partner-centric and enables issuers to own their consumer experience by making a digital by default and connecting into their online banking app. It enables digital giants to create a seamless acceptance system, and it enables merchants to not have to repeat their acceptance capability time after time. Because once they're on MasterPass, they can accept the others. That's what we're trying to do."

This morning's earnings call and the slide deck that will be referenced on the call can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website, mastercard.com. Additionally, the release was attached to an 8-K that we filed with the SEC earlier this morning. A replay of this call will be posted on our website for 30 days.
Both the release and the slide deck include reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to their GAAP equivalents. We've also added a table at the end of both documents which provides additional information about the impact of Article 8 of the EU's recent payments regulation on our GDV and purchase volume growth rates. Since we are no longer charging de minimis fees on co-badged domestic volume that doesn't use our network in markets such as France, this volume is no longer included in our reported volume statistics. We saw the partial impact of this in the second quarter and now have a full quarter of impact in Q3. The table adjusts growth rates for the impact by eliminating the related co-badged volume in prior periods so that you can see the underlying run rate of our business. Our comments on the call today will be on the basis of these adjusted rates. 
Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I need to remind everyone that today's call may include some forward-looking statements about Mastercard's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance are summarized at the end of our press release as well as contained in our recent SEC filings. 
Now with that, I'll turn the call over to Ajay."

And Barbara, thank you, once again, for your outstanding decade of work for us, and Warren, welcome to the company. Good morning, everybody. Our business continues to perform well.

Good morning, everybody. 
Our business continues to perform well. We are very pleased with our strong results this quarter. As you've seen, we delivered net revenue growth of 14% and an EPS growth of 19% after excluding last year's special items, which was related to the termination of our U.S. employee pension plan.
Our perspective of the global economy remains largely unchanged since last quarter. You've all seen the U.S. GDP growth report this morning. We continue to believe, like we said in the previous quarter, that the U.S. is on a steady growth path with consumer confidence, unemployment and wages holding firm, of course, unless something unforeseen occurs coming out of the upcoming election. But basically the U.S. is on a steady growth path. 
Many markets across Europe are showing a gradual recovery, led by Germany, as economic sentiment holds steady. Unemployment rates are continuing to decline. Although uncertainty from Brexit and that's a back on Europe remain a concern, I think it's going to take a few years to understand the full implication. Again, you saw the British GDP report, which got to see it holding steady. Interestingly, underlying U.K. consumer demand remained stable. And in fact, as a result of the weaker pound, inbound travel to the U.K. is picking up over this last quarter.
In the Asia, the picture is still mixed. In China, both exports and imports were down sharply, and you all know the concerns over inflated asset values. In Australia, however, business confidence is up, and India continues its relatively strong growth trajectory.
In Latin America, Brazil, even though it's expected to remain in a recession for the near future, seems to be bottoming out, and the political environment seems to be stabilizing, which should hopefully improve the economic conditions for the next 6 to 12 months. In Venezuela, the political and fiscal crisis is deepening. In Mexico, the economy continues to expand, but with increasing dependence on consumer spending growth. 
So in sum, the outlook from the economic side remains mixed. Even so, we're continuing to grow, we think, double-digit volume in transaction growth across most of our markets. We're continuing to win deals as we execute against our long-term strategy.  
So now let me provide you with a brief update about our planned acquisition of VocaLink. The first step is now complete. The European Commission has referred the transaction back to the U.K. regulator to perform the antitrust review. The second step, which will be led by the U.K. regulator, generally has 2 phases. We're hopeful to complete the review in the first preliminary phase, but it's always possible that this could go into a more detailed second phase. We continue to believe that we can complete this acquisition by about the middle of 2017. 
So before we go to our business highlights, let me just touch on a few regulatory and litigation items that you all asked us about from time to time. So starting with the United States. As you know, the merchant litigation is now back in the Brooklyn court. In the status conference held last week, the court heard arguments in the appointment of class counsel for merchants. Now as the court appoints that council, we expect the litigation to proceed, and we intend to resume the settlement negotiations. But given this complexity, we think this thoughts[indiscernible] will take some years to resolve. 
In the U.K., as many of you know, a proposed class action is filed in September on behalf of U.K. consumers seeking damages related to interchange fees. The court will set up a time line for the case soon. We've had good experience addressing similar claims in the United States, and we believe strongly that, in fact, far from being harmed by interchange, U.K. consumers have, in fact, benefited significantly.  
Finally, following legal submissions and an oral hearing this past summer, we continue to be in conversations with the European Commission to find a resolution to the 2015 case around our interchange rates of interregional cross-border transactions and the central acquiring rules.  
So now moving on to some of our recent business activity. You heard a great deal of all of this from our asset[indiscernible] the recent Investor Day. You had an opportunity to see, firsthand, a number of the product and service innovations we are rolling out. So I'm going to stick to a few items this time. We continue to make solid progress in our U.S. consumer business, building on our recent momentum in debit. We're actually excited to highlight 2 new deals that deepen and strengthen our existing relationships with both U.S. Bank and Regions Bank, which have now been expanded to include preferred MasterCard routing for their PIN debit businesses. 
Outside of the U.S., we're actually pleased to have tripped a number of portfolios by continuing to leverage services as a key strategic differentiator. I'm going to give you a couple of examples in Europe. We're building on the long-term debit deal we announced last year in Italy with Poste Italiane. We're now expanding our partnership by converting a significant portion of their prepaid portfolio. This deal also includes a number of our services, such as advisers, to help drive their financial inclusion and innovation agendas. Another example with DenizBank, which is one of the market leaders in Turkey, to flip their credit business, which also leverages advisers.
Now the domestic opportunity in China. We're awaiting a more detailed interpretation of the final PBOC regulations, particularly around the newly introduced security provisions and how these would impact our implementation of also[indiscernible] switching while protecting our systems and our data. We hope this will be available over the next couple of months. We're continuing to speak with regulators to clarify our options on how best to enter the market. In the meanwhile, we're continuing to make progress in China by winning a number of new deals with banks, including HSBC, China Construction Bank, ICBC and Postal Savings Bank. As part of these deals, they will be issuing new single-branded cards targeted to the country's growing affluent customer segment and to drive cross-border spend.  
We highlighted several key renewals in our commercial business, including FLEETCOR and WEX, both of whom are driving B2B and cross-border spend in unique and innovative ways by leveraging virtual cards. We just added 2 new deals in Europe: one is Credit Suisse, which is focused on the small and medium enterprise segment where MasterCard is the exclusive card provider; the other with UBS, where we're looking forward to deepening our relationship within their corporate banking business.  
So now on to digital strategy. And over the last several quarters, including at the recent Investor Day, we've given you a number of updates on the significant progress we are making with MasterPass. And just to recall, we're taking 2 paddle parts. The first is our digital-by-default strategy, which enables issuers to auto-enroll card holders through their online banking app and helps to drive scale for us while keeping issuers at the center of their consumer relationships. We're quite pleased that more than 80 million accounts will be automatically enabled over the next few months. The second is to deliver a digital payment service that works across all devices, all channels, whether that's in app, online or in-store, and the idea there is to keep growing acceptance by being ubiquitous.
So today, I'll discuss a couple of use cases to give you an idea about some of the unique ways we're using MasterPass with our partners around the world. In South Africa, we're working with MTN and Vodafone, 2 telecom providers who, by the way, put together, have a market share of about 70%, to allow their customers to securely pay for airtime minutes from their mobile device using MasterPass. Prior to this, subscribers will either have to stand in long lines at a third-party service location or go to an ATM to transfer funds to the telecom provider and then wait for their accounts to be updated. Since its launch, more than 4.5 million users have registered for the service and airtime distribution costs, for the mobile network operators, have been reduced by as much as 15%.
Another example in Europe. We've partnered with Czech Railways, the largest rail operator in that country, to integrate MasterPass into their booking app to better compete with new entrants to the transit space and to modernize mobile ticketing. Again, prior to this, users would've had to enter their card details for each purchase. Since its launch in early 2015, users have grown significantly, and MasterPass now account for nearly 8% of all Czech Railways transactions. Both of these examples, I hope, demonstrate to you that through MasterPass, we're not just enabling digital payments, we actually try to create a better consumer experience.
From an acceptance standpoint, MasterPass continues to grow. It's now available in more than 300,000 merchants online and in apps as well as more than 6 million locations in 77 countries that allow contactless payments. We're continuing to add new merchants and -- for example, United Airlines in the U.S., Domino's Pizza and Trenitalia in Europe, KFC in Asia. In addition, last week, we signed the Memorandum of Understanding with the Ecobank group to roll out MasterPass QR in mobile person-to-person merchant service -- mobile person-to-merchant service across 33 African countries. This solution will be integrated with their mobile banking platform will enable users to safely pay for purchases directly from their bank account using a QR code. Again, millions of micro, small and medium enterprises across Africa will now be able to accept secure digital payments quickly and without the expense of a traditional POS server.
So our MasterPass partner-centric approach, as you heard Garry Lyons talk about at Investor Day, which is aimed at delivering a seamless consumer experience, benefits issuers, digital players and merchants. So earlier this week, we highlighted that issuers like Capital One, who are already leveraging our digital-by-default approach, are further integrating MasterPass into their wallet offering. Users of the Capital One Wallet can now shop online and in app and check out using that same embed tokenized log-in credentials at the hundreds of thousands of merchants around the world where MasterPass is accepted. Similarly, at Money20/20, we highlighted an important expansion of our digital partnerships. And starting sometime early next year, Samsung Pay, Android Pay and Microsoft Wallet will also enable the same online and in-app consumer experience that I just mentioned. And finally, clearly, merchants also benefit from this since they've already integrated MasterPass. There's no additional development work required. It gives them access to the millions of consumers who already use these other wallet services or will in the future.
Meanwhile, we continue to support our partners to extend their reach globally, actually, recently, as Android Pay move into Poland; in fact, as Apple Pay expand into Japan and Russia, both currently exclusive with MasterCard. 
Finally, we highlighted our recent partnership with Green Dot and Uber as well as Stripe as Lyft at Investor Day and how they leveraging the MasterCard Send platform to make a meaning and secure payment to drivers, delivery people and others. We just added Allstate who will leverage MasterCard Send to make claims payments to their customers via a debit card, providing nearly instant access to their funds. 
So with that, let me turn the call over to Martina for an update on our financial results and operational metrics. Martina?"

Starting with Page 3, you see there are minimal differences this quarter between non-GAAP reported and currency-neutral growth rates. This, again, exclude the impact of a special item related to the termination of the U.S.-designed pension plan taken last year. 
As you can see from our numbers, we have delivered another strong quarter. Here are a few highlights. Net revenue growth was 14%. Operating expenses grew 12% as we continue to invest in our strategic initiatives. EPS was up $1.08, up 19% year-over-year, driven primarily by our strong operating performance and a slightly lower tax rate. Also, share repurchases contributed $0.03 per share. As of October 25, we have $1.8 billion remaining as our current authorization. Lastly, cash flow from operations was $1.4 billion. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and other liquid investments of about $7 billion.
So let's turn to Page 4 where you can see the operational metrics for the third quarter. Just a reminder, as Barbara mentioned, the growth rates I'm quoting our adjusted for the impact of the new EU regulations. Our worldwide gross dollar volume, or GDV, growth was 11% on a local currency basis, down 2 ppt from the prior quarter. Overall, our U.S. GDV grew 5%, made up of credit and debit growth of 4% and 6%, respectively. As expected, this includes the impact of the USAA roll-off. Total U.S. GDV had less than one ppt headwind from lower gas prices. And outside of the U.S., volume growth was 14% on a local currency basis. This is down 1 ppt versus last quarter, due to slightly lower growth in each region. Gross dollar volume grew 12% on a local currency basis, about 2 ppt higher than the 10% we saw in the second quarter and driven primarily by commercial travel programs in Europe.  
Let me turn you to Page 5, and here, you see process transactions grew 18% globally to 14.5 billion, which is a 4 ppt increase from last quarter, driven primarily by increased PIN routing in the U.S. Globally, the number of cards grew 6% with 2.3 billion MasterCard- and Maestro-branded cards issued. 
Let's turn to Page 6 for highlights on a few of the revenue line items. Unless otherwise stated, the growth numbers I call out, both here and on the next slide, are on a currency-neutral basis. So net revenue growth was 14%. We saw strong volume and transaction growth, plus a higher contribution from some of our services businesses. Rebates and incentive grew 21% due to higher volume and new and renewed deals.  
Looking quickly at the individual revenue line items on a currency-neutral basis. Domestic assessments grew 10%, essentially in line with worldwide GDV growth. Cross-border volume fees grew 15% while cross-border volume grew 12%. The 3 ppt gap is due to some pricing actions, partially offset by a higher mix of intra-Europe activity. Transaction processing fees grew 19%, in line with process transaction growth. And finally, other revenue grew 23%, predominantly driven by advisers, safety and security and loyalty.
Moving to Page 7. You can see that excluding last year's special items, total operating expenses increased 12% in the quarter, of which more than 2 ppt is due to the impact of foreign exchange activity and balance sheet remeasurement. The remainder of the increase was primarily due to higher personnel costs as we continue to invest in digital, services and geographic expansion as well as higher data processing costs in line with our transaction growth and Russian domestic processing cost to NFC costs.
Turning to Slide 8. Let's discuss what we've seen in October through the 21st. Most of our drivers are similar to Q3 except for the U.S. The numbers through October 21 are as follows. Starting with process volume, we saw global growth of 10%, and that's equivalent to what we saw in the third quarter, but double-digit growth in each region outside of the U.S. In the U.S., our process volume grew 3%, down more than 3 ppt from the third quarter, but the same growth in credit programs but lower growth in debit programs, primarily due to the deconversions I mentioned earlier. Excluding that, our October growth was similar to the third quarter. GAAP does not have an impact on our October growth rates. Process volume outside the U.S. grew 16% and that's actually up 1 ppt from the third quarter with higher growth in each region. Globally, process transaction growth was 17%, down 1 ppt from what we saw in the third quarter. Process transaction growth outside the U.S. was similar to Q3 while the U.S. growth was down 3 ppt. And with respect to cross-border, our volumes grew 13% globally at almost 1 ppt from the third quarter with faster growth in Europe, driven by a combination of consumer and commercial usage.
Now looking at the full year 2016. There's really no change in our business outlook from what I have discussed at Investor Day back in September. We continue to expect revenue growth in the low double-digit on a currency-neutral basis. When you model on an as-reported basis, adjusting for the impact of all currencies, we now estimate that there would be about a 1 ppt headwind to net revenue growth and the bottom line. This is less of a headwind than what we said in September, given the continued moderation of exchange rates.
Let me call out a few other items that you should consider when modeling 2016. On expenses, we now expect total operating expense growth in the low double-digit range for our as-reported results, excluding special items. On a currency-neutral basis, we continue to expect low double-digit growth. As discussed at Investor Day, we expect to see positive operating leverage for the year. And you should now assume a 2016 tax rate towards the lower end of the 28% to 29% range that I talked about in September. As is our normal practice, we will defer any comments about our 2017 outlook until our year-end call in January.
Now let me turn the call back to Barbara to begin the Q&A session. Barbara?"

I think this whole commercial business continues to be an area of pretty good growth, and you just heard me talk a little bit about FLEETCOR and WEX and virtual cards and I give you the examples of UBS and Credit Suisse. But what we're basically seeing, in addition to the transaction side of this, is it's seeing an adoption of some of our products, Smart Data, which is a reporting and reconciliation tool as well as inControl, which is a virtual card system. For commercial payments, it's kind of getting well embedded. I'm also starting to see some increasing interest beyond the typical bank card users. Technology providers embed commercial payment solutions into their software and their platforms and payment aggregators and verticals, such as construction, insurance. You see these guys coming into play as well. So there's a series of things we are doing in the B2B space, in the T&E space, in the SME space that are all connected to this effort to drive our commercial efforts. The MasterCard Send product that you just heard us talk about again, what this is, is a payment service that facilitates the delivery of funds very quickly and very securely to consumers both domestically and internationally. If you take a single connection into this platform, you could be a business, you could be a merchant, you could be a government, a nonprofit issuer, some other sender and you can send money to consumers, whether they bank or un-bank, most importantly, whether they're domestic or overseas as well. And that's kind of what we are trying to do here, because in the overseas market, we combine with a JV that we have launched sometime ago called HomeSend, not to be confused with MasterCard Send. That's just a total MasterCard confusion. I don't want you to get confused.

But our services are not services generically. They are services that very tightly connect back to the idea of an authentication clearing and settlement system that gives us the insight into a payment transaction. So all our services, be it loyalty and rewards, be it safety and security, be it the data analytics business or our managed services that we do with advisers, all of these connect back to that idea of being connected to the payment transactions and the moment of truth when that happens. So I think we do a relatively good job of tying the 2 things together when we speak in terms of the logic of why it's service we provide would be incremental value add to the clearing authorization and settlement stream. In a number of ways, competitive barriers are only as good as the investment you keep putting into them to keep staying ahead in terms of more technology and innovation. I mean, take safety and security. Anybody who would tell you that they figured it out, the safety and security, is probably somebody you should run a mile from, because there is no such right answer. There is a continuous effort of people trying to break in to everyone's systems. You read that all the time. So you're only as good in safety and security as the effort you keep putting into it to keep your clients having products and capabilities that keep them keeping their promise to their consumers. So we recently launched a series of products that use artificial intelligence and machine learning in the safety and security space. We're going to keep doing that. We've been -- we would be -- I will tell you, we're in the first innings of a baseball game on that kind of space. We're a little better when it comes to tokenization. We're well into the middle of the game. We are better when it comes to EMV. We're well into the latter part of the game. So different aspects of safety and security have got different levels of maturity in terms of what they're solving for and therefore require different levels of investment to keep them growing and competitive. And I think our competitive edge is that we have been allocating capital to these areas and expenses for the last 7 years, and it's one of the reasons why I kept telling you I'd like to make sure that you take the expansion of margin off the table as a permanent effort of this company and, instead, give you a really healthy margin but use the revenue growth of the company to invest back in creating competitive and, frankly, great differentiator for future revenue for where they're going."

First of all, there is no such thing as a services division, okay? There are many different services that we are actually providing. And here, I called out 3 but we have a ton other ones, right? So I don't want you to just bundle this together. We bundle it together because it's an easier way of contrasting it to our core business, right? So in terms of what I said on the margin is that when you add all the services with their many different margin profiles right back to what Ajay has been actually explaining on the safety and security side together, if you were to add that together, the margin, as a whole, at this point in time is 40%. And what I also said is that -- and by the way, this is not on a fully loaded basis, right? So things like corporate costs, et cetera, are not in there. What I also said that, over time, as we are scaling these services, that we would believe that the margin would increase, okay? And just to remind you, there was this one chart in ICM where I actually showed which services are at a higher-margin level versus which services are lower-margin level. And the safety and security side was actually really at the higher level, and then we kind of worked our way down. Advisers was the next one down. The loyalty was the next one down and processing was actually on the lowest side. So all of those services we're working to scale and with scale, you will be getting some better margin on these businesses."

And some things, they can do themselves. Some of them, they need experts to come help themselves. We have that kind of sales structure built, and it's constantly changing as well to keep pace with where the state is going. So it's a mix of many things that are going into services. I just feel that so long as we can keep it tightly connected to our authorizing and clearing and settlement business, we're actually building yet another leg of the stool for our company for the next couple of decades to come."

So we showed up on the back of the card, and then you have to remind -- remember in the PIN debit market, the merchants are actually then aligning the routing. They're choosing the routing over which network to route. So there's a second thing that you have to think about in terms of, yes, you can buckle on the back of the card. But then do you actually get to see the transaction? And we have a very analytical methodology in terms of trying to see how many transactions we want to see, and that actually influences the pricing that we put out in the market everyday. And so you will see our PIN share going up and down. So you saw it in the third quarter going up. This the new agreements coming in. You saw in our third -- three weeks in October and it's coming a little bit down. That's why you're seeing a little bit less processed transaction. So you should expect it goes up and down."

Their level of sophistication that goes into the decision making of the routing of the PIN debit transaction is way beyond the price. The price is interesting, and it's kind of stable space. But they do enormously sophisticated thinking on the time taken for approval, on the number of turndowns, on all kinds of aspects. And you can move up and down the routing table 5x a day in some of these merchants, depending on what's going on. And so it's a little difficult to predict where that goes, but it's lower-yield business. So the overall impact on the revenue stream of the company tends to be kind of a buffer and all, let's say, shock absorbed, but it's an interesting learning for all of us."

When we talk to you, we're talking about base expenses as well. The acquisitions we are doing, because it's the kind of industry we're in, don't exactly come fully loaded with revenue and unloaded in expense. They tend to come with capabilities that bring expenses and revenues that we need to build over a period of years by putting them together with what we sell. Typically, the lag in that, the timing lag of that creates a higher growth-driven expenses than on revenues for the first few years of owning that property. That's part of what we're talking about when we talk about putting investment capital and the expense dollars to work. The acquisition that all in areas are strategic growth opportunity for us. A number of them are in the services space that Martina was loosely talking about a little while ago, and that's kind of what we're putting our capital to work at. But a lot of our expenses, aside from the acquisitions, tend to go into the digital space because that's where a lot of opportunity will get laid out over the next decade.

But I do know that you kind of assume that tourist traffic or even business traffic will necessarily follow the pattern of a currency moving around. Right now, there's no doubt that in the U.K., tourism's up, one. Two, there is a great deal of re-interest in acquiring assets of the United Kingdom. Because if you are sitting outside of the U.K., the values of assets from the U.K. have not only gone down by the change in the currency, they've also gone down by the extreme reaction that the market had to the fears around Brexit. That has also created a level of interest in people traveling and to look at assets in the U.K. Again, I don't know if that will persist because the latest U.K. GDP report actually shows the Brexit response to be terrible. I think it will take time to come. It won't happen this quarter in terms of real GDP change.

MasterPass Europe, my view is that on a small mobile screen, it's unlikely that merchants on their checkout page for browser, I'm talking browser right now, which is still the large portion of digital covers and probably will be a very large portion for the next 4 or 5 years. Very unlikely that they're going to find them putting many different wallet options in the checkout page because the total space available on a mobile phone is relatively restricted, and therefore, there's going to be some kind of trend towards creating the right infrastructure of wallet acceptance over time. And by -- I think you will find with the kind of things we're trying to do, we're trying to ensure that one of the brands in the checkout page is MasterPass because if you could put your digital wallets as well as your user wallets to all using MasterPass as an acceptance brand, then that's a good thing. In our view, and I said this many times, MasterPass is not a B2C effort. It's a B2B effort. What I'm doing is not just building wallets. Because if banks would have their own wallet, a merchant could have their own wallet or they could take a wallet from a private label through open APIs, that doesn't matter. All can come through in a safe, secure way using tokens come through a MasterPass acceptance mark. And the idea is to build all our services capabilities onto open APIs. We've already done that in a substantial way. If you go to mastercard.developer.com -- or developer.mastercard.com -- I think I'm mixing up the what came first and what came later. But I think developer.mastercard.com, you will find that it's relatively easy, if you do strike a deal with us, to get the cryptogram to unlock the API to then connect it up to your capabilities, either the merchant or an issuer. So I've seen MasterPass not as a wallet. I've said this for a long time. I see MasterPass as a digital strategy and as a future brand for our company. I see the MasterPass system as an acceptance system that enables safe, secure payments and enables open APIs to be connected to that for services. And that's the offering, which is very partner-centric and enables issuers to own their consumer experience by making a digital by default and connecting into their online banking app. It enables digital giants to create a seamless acceptance system, and it enables merchants to not have to repeat their acceptance capability time after time. Because once they're on MasterPass, they can accept the others. That's what we're trying to do."

This morning's earnings release and the slide deck that will be referenced on this call can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at mastercard.com. The documents have also been attached to an 8-K that we filed with the SEC earlier this morning. A replay of this call will be posted on our website for 1 month.
Before we get started, I'd like to point out a change we have made around reporting the impact of currency on our business. As Martina mentioned on our last earnings call, we realized it has become more difficult for many of you to model our business as FX rates continue to move around. Therefore, beginning this quarter, instead of reporting FX-adjusted growth rates, which only reflected the translational impact of 2 functional currencies, the euro and the Brazilian real, we are now reporting currency-neutral growth rates, which include both the impact from translating functional currencies into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes as well as the underlying impact of local currencies being converted into their functional currency. 
Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I need to remind everyone that today's call may include some forward-looking statements about MasterCard's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance are summarized at the end of our press release as well as contained in our recent SEC filings.

So now let's take a look at the global economy. I think it's largely unchanged from what we discussed last quarter, with the U.S. economy remaining solid with inflation and wages growing at a similar pace and the unemployment rate kind of holding steady at 5%. We just saw the unemployment rate numbers coming out this morning as well. However, as we know from the Fed comments yesterday, uncertainty remains about when they might take action as well as the potential impact from the global economy. 
So with the rest of the world, the economic outlook continues to be mixed. In Europe, both consumer confidence and economic sentiment declined slightly this quarter. However, recent stimulus measures by the European Central Bank and steady improvement in the unemployment rate, I think, should continue to drive growth across the region, particularly in the U.K. and Germany. 
Asia is still challenged by the continued slowdown in China. Consumer confidence remains cloudy, with the exception being India, where both consumer and business sentiment remain high. 
In Latin America, Brazil is still in the worst recession in the country's history. And of course, economic conditions in Venezuela are deteriorating further. But Mexico is stable and seems to be driven by solid consumer spending and declining inflation. 
So none of this surprises us, but it does seem that we're likely to remain in a period of economic uncertainty. And so that said, we've continued to work hard to ensure that our business maintains its strong growth trajectory and we're seeing double-digit volume and transaction growth across most of our markets. In addition, we're benefiting from the successful integration of our recent acquisitions and continuing to grow our services business. As I told Barbara yesterday, at this time, steady as she goes is what our focus is. 
So now let's move on to some of our recent business activity. During the quarter, we signed a number of new deals and renewals supporting the expansion of our business around the world. I want to give you a few examples. In Europe, we extended our contract in Nordea, which is the largest bank in the Nordics, for their consumer credit and their commercial card portfolios. And we added the rollout of MasterPass and inControl with them. Same in Europe, we also renewed and extended our contract with DSGV, the largest banking group in Martina's home country of Germany, for their credit business. We also included the rollout of MasterPass. Further, we added a new debit portfolio with UniCredit, a leading European financial group based in Italy. In Asia, we just recently renewed and expanded our contracts with both Mitsubishi UFJ NICOS, which is one of the largest issuers in the region, for their consumer and their commercial credit business; and with Maybank, the largest bank in Malaysia, for their credit and debit business. 
And finally, I want to talk a little bit of an example of working with a number of our merchant partners. And I'm going to give you a specific example. This one is of McDonald's. We've talked in previous calls of a partnership with them in the Middle East, now in South Africa as well. The McDonald's are leveraging MasterPass to simplify the ordering process as well as utilizing contactless functionality at their restaurants. Of course, the idea is to improve the drive-through and the dining experience. 
But our McDonald's partnership actually has now gone beyond the core business. They're also a customer of Applied Predictive Technologies, or APT, the cloud-based data and analytics company that we acquired last May. McDonald's used APT's software to analyze a variety of strategic initiatives, including new food and menu items, determining which items should be on the menu and other business priorities. And this is one of the many examples of value we can provide to our merchant partners when you combine products that we have with the data analytics that we're capable of analyzing with them. 
So next, I'd like to give you an update on how we're advancing our strategy in the digital payment space. And I'm going to start with MasterPass. So remember, we're in a marathon here, and we're making great progress with our digital-by-default strategy. That's about enabling issuers to auto-enroll cardholders onto the MasterPass platform without any additional effort having to be made by the consumer. We're looking forward to announcing some bank partners who will be leveraging this ability in the near future. And as we continue to drive new acceptance for MasterPass as well, we're closing in on signing up about 270,000 merchants, representing more than $160 billion in addressable volume. 
Earlier this month, Vodafone Egypt migrated nearly 2 million Vodafone cash wallets from their closed-loop system to our mobile payment gateway platform. That enables us to process all of their transactions. This migration builds on our goal of creating an interoperable network across the Egyptian mobile payment ecosystem that I've spoken to in earlier call and helps to drive our strategy of financial inclusion and, of course, accelerate the conversion of cash. 
And then moving on to MasterCard Digital Enablement Service or MDES. We continue to make significant progress around making digital transaction more secure via encryption and tokenization. In Asia, we are pleased to now have more than 30 issuers signed up for the MDES service. We've also launched the first NFC-based wallet in Latin America with Citi/Banamex in Mexico, utilizing our cloud-based payment technology. And by the way, this wallet, the Citi/Banamex one, was created by developers from our C-SAM acquisition, which actually gave us access to a very talented pool of engineers, who are enabling us to build out capabilities for issuers and merchants exactly like the example of Citi/Banamex. 
And finally, we continue to support our digital partners by helping Android Pay launch in the U.K. and both Samsung Pay and Apple Pay are expanding to Singapore. We're also pleased to be partnering with Facebook as they leverage MDES to test tokenization by enabling pilot participants to interact with sellers and advertisers directly on the platform to complete their purchases, all without ever having to leave the Facebook app. 
So moving on to safety and security. You know there's a lot of effort from us and others going into the space. And as a result of successful biometric trials in the Netherlands and the U.S., that we announced last August, we're actually launching MasterCard Identity Check, fondly referred to as Selfie Pay, in the U.S., Canada and parts of Europe this summer, with more countries to be announced soon. Much of the initial interest in Identity Check has come -- had been attached to the consumer side of these businesses. But interestingly, we were actually currently working with BMO Financial Group, that's the Bank of Montreal in Canada, to roll out the first corporate credit card program using Selfie Pay in both the U.S. and Canada. 
In addition, we recently launched IQ series. That's a suite of products which uses real-time intelligence to empower issuers to make more informed fraud management decisions as well as, most importantly, potentially decrease the growing problem of false declines. Industry studies are showing that 1 out of every 6 cardholders have experienced at least 1 decline because of suspected fraud in the past year. That, by the way, adds up to false declines of $118 billion a year or several times the actual amount of true card fraud. 
Next, we worked with our issuers to deliver additional benefits to our cardholders and helped protect them even more from fraud. As of 2 weeks ago, all MasterCard consumer and small business cardholders are now covered by the industry's first global around-the-world 0 liability promise, ensuring they're not responsible for any unauthorized charges. 
And while on the topic of safety and security, let's spend a minute on the status of EMV in the U.S. We now have about 67% of our consumer credit cards and 24% for our consumer debit cards with chips in them. Roughly 1.2 million U.S. merchant locations are now accepting these cards. And while that's good progress that we're seeing across the industry and also in our own numbers, I mean, everybody recognizes that checkout times at the terminal may appear longer when using a chip card. And to help address that concern, we announced M/Chip Fast, which is to help speed EMV transactions. You leverage the capabilities of our existing contactless technology, which as you know, has been deployed in various transits and other applications around the world. Using that, cardholders will experience magstripe transaction speed, but with the added security of EMV and chip. At the same time, we're going to make this happen in collaboration with the industry, including other networks, to look at how to bring a consistent approach to the market and best support the EMV checkout experience. 
And the point of all these examples is that people shop on all sorts of devices and through multiple channels. And they expect technology to simplify that process while keeping the transaction safe and secure. And I give you all these examples to demonstrate and reinforce our commitment to protecting every transaction. Doesn't matter whether it took place in the physical world or the digital world. We are committed to doing this.
So for the last several minutes talking to you on how we've grown our business through a series of organic investments. And it's important to recognize we've also been growing our business by integrating the various acquisitions we made over the past few years, trying to expand our presence across the payment value chain. So let me give you a couple of examples across information services and processing. 
So let's start by information services, that business within advisers. I mentioned APT earlier when I talked about McDonald's. One of the great things about that subscription-based business model is that it generates a recurring revenue stream with an average contract length of about 3 years. And since the acquisition, we've integrated the sales and product organizations of APT with advisers to drive some pretty good benefits. Let me give you an example. 
Since their acquisition, 30 organizations have subscribed to the APT platform in long-term contracts. And in addition to McDonald's that I talked about, I'll give you a few more: Asahi Breweries in Japan; Sunoco in the U.S.; and in the U.K., KFC. We've also signed more than 15 new deals incremental to APT's earlier business-as-usual efforts, in other words, using MasterCard's client relationships and coverage, including, by the way, one of the largest airlines in Europe, one of the largest retailers in Brazil, 2 of the largest financial institutions in Asia and several in the U.S. What's exciting about all these deals is that they include expanding relationships with long-time APT clients, who now also license newly created product modules, leveraging insights derived from MasterCard data. 
Then finally we launched APT Engage, which is a suite of products which leverages aggregated and anonymized MasterCard payment transaction data combined with APT's proprietary analytics, to help issuers and merchants better understand customer spending behavior, which products have higher loyalty as well as planning for new retail locations. That's about information services.
On to processing. The idea there being to extend our capabilities beyond switching, getting beyond authorizing, clearing and settlement. So in our Payment Transaction Services business, we signed a deal with BNP Paribas in Poland to provide issuer processing services, which, by the way, has also enabled us to become one of the major third-party processors in the country. Here in the U.S., our year-old partnership with Green Dot to process all of their debit and prepaid cards has resulted in the successful migration of now approximately 50 million account files with another 50 million to arc over the balance of 2016. And lastly, in the same business, we enabled several transit operators in Turkey to begin using NFC capability by processing contactless cards and thereby, allowing us to increase our share of domestic processed transactions. 
Staying with processing, on the Prepaid Management Services side, we've just implemented a card program with British Airways to facilitate compensation payments to BA passengers for delayed or canceled flights or lost luggage. We've also launched the first dual-purpose travel insurance and multicurrency prepaid travel product with Flight Centre, which is one of the world's largest travel agencies. 
And lastly, as a result of integrating our acquired assets into our Payment Gateway Services business, we're now able to offer products globally, which include integrated fraud and risk management solutions to both merchants and to acquirers. We're already seeing several new wins, including 4 new deals with key acquirers and resellers in Australia, India, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, who can now offer these capabilities to their merchant base and in turn, that kind of helps us expand our footprint in these markets. We've also worked to ensure that our payment gateway provides acceptance of the latest digital payment methods. We now support both Apple Pay and Android Pay in addition to MasterPass. 
We all recognize these acquisitions require a certain amount of time, investment and resources to integrate. We've worked very hard to ensure this happens seamlessly and efficiently. We're now clearly seeing the benefits that come from them, both in our dialogue and in our engagement with our customers. 
So with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Martina for an update on our financial results and operational metrics. Martina?"
6477196,329405740,2206962,"MasterCard Incorporated, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Mastercard Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Ajay, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by giving you some highlights on the first quarter, starting with Page 3, where you see the difference between as-reported and currency-neutral growth rates for this quarter. As Barbara explained at t",1522,"Thanks, Ajay, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by giving you some highlights on the first quarter, starting with Page 3, where you see the difference between as-reported and currency-neutral growth rates for this quarter. As Barbara explained at the start of this call, we have now changed how we report the impact of currency. So instead of reporting FX-adjusted growth rates, which only reflected the translational impact of the euro and the Brazilian real functional currencies, we are now reporting currency-neutral growth rates, which exclude all impacts of foreign exchange rates. This is both the impact from translating functional currencies into U.S. dollar for reporting purposes as well as the underlying impact of local currencies being converted into their functional currency. We hope that this change will make it easier for you to understand the underlying performance of our business. And all of my comments going forward will pertain to our new currency-neutral growth rates.
Net revenue growth was 14%. While operating expenses grew significantly, this was mostly due to the difference between FX hedging and balance sheet remeasurement gains that we had in the year-ago quarter versus foreign exchange losses on our hedging contracts in this quarter. I will talk more about this when we get into the detail of operating expenses. 
As expected, net income was also impacted by a higher tax rate than in the year-ago quarter due to the nonrecurrence of a discrete U.S. foreign tax credit from which we benefited in the first quarter of 2015. EPS was $0.86, up 1% year-over-year. But as Ajay said, it was impacted by $0.08 due to the discrete tax item that I just mentioned and the Venezuela balance sheet remeasurement gain in the year-ago quarter. When you exclude these 2 items, EPS grew 12%. 
Share repurchases contributed $0.03 per share. And as of April 21, we have $2.9 billion remaining under our current authorization. And lastly, cash flow from operations was $1 billion, and we ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalent and other liquid investments of about $6.2 billion.
So let me turn to Page 4 and here, you can see the operational metrics for the first quarter. Included in these numbers is a positive lift of about 1% due to leap day on all of our metrics. Our worldwide gross dollar volume, or GDV growth, was 13%. On a local currency basis, that's about up 1 ppt from last quarter. Overall, our U.S. GDV grew 10%, made up of credit and debit growth of 11% and 8%, respectively. Total U.S. GDV had a continued 1 ppt headwind from lower gas prices. 
Outside of the U.S., volume growth was 15% on a local currency basis, also up about 1 ppt versus last quarter, with mid- to high teens growth in each region, except Canada, which was impacted by the lapping of our Costco win. Cross-border volume grew 12% on a local currency basis, and that's similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter.
Turning to Page 5. Processed transactions grew 14% globally to $12.6 billion, a 2 ppt increase from what we saw in the fourth quarter, with higher growth in all regions except Canada, again due to the lapping of our Costco win. Globally, the number of cards grew 7% with 2.3 billion MasterCard and Maestro-branded cards issued. 
Let me turn to Page 6 for highlights on a few of the revenue line items. Net revenue growth was 10% as reported or 14% on a currency-neutral basis, given currency headwinds. We saw strong volume and transaction growth, particularly in the U.S. and Europe, and some of which was due to the impact of leap year. Rebates and incentives was slightly higher than what we expected due to deal renewals. 
Looking quickly at the individual line -- revenue line items on a constant -- on a currency-neutral basis. Domestic assessments grew 13%, in line with worldwide GDV growth. Cross-border volume fees grew 14%, while cross-border volume grew 12%. The 2 ppt gap is due to a number of pricing actions, partially offset by a higher mix of intra-Europe activity. Transaction processing fees grew 18%, primarily driven by the 14% growth in processed transactions as well as some pricing. And finally, other revenues grew 22%, driven primarily by our APT acquisition and our safety and security product offerings.
Moving on to Page 7. Here, you can see that total operating expenses increased 25% in the quarter or 29% on a currency-neutral basis. Most of this increase is due to FX movements recorded in our G&A line. I mentioned on our last earnings call that we recorded a large amount of FX gains in the year-ago quarter, mostly due to onetime gains related to Venezuela. The absence of those gains, plus the unrealized losses we recorded this quarter on our FX hedging activity due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to year-end 2015, resulted in an almost $130 million increase to expenses. Excluding this and a 4 ppt impact from acquisitions we did not have in the year-ago quarter, G&A grew 11% as a result of our continuing investment in areas such as digital, data analytics and safety and security. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense is primarily due to the amortization of intangibles related to our acquisitions.
So now I'm going to turn to Slide 8. Let's discuss what we had seen in April through the 21st. While many of our business drivers are similar to the first quarter, direct comparisons to the first quarter are a bit difficult since it had the benefit of both leap day and Easter. 
The numbers through April 21 are as follows: Starting with processed volume, we saw global growth of 13%, the same as in the first quarter. In the U.S., our process volume grew 10%, down roughly 1 ppt from the first quarter, with slower growth in both credit and debit. Gas had less than 1 ppt negative impact on our April growth, down slightly from the first quarter impact. Process volume outside the U.S. grew 16%, up 1 ppt from the last quarter, with higher growth in most regions and primarily driven by Europe and APMEA. Global process transaction growth was 14%, the same as we saw in the first quarter. Process transaction growth outside the U.S. was up a bit, with increases in APMEA and LAC, while the U.S. growth was down almost 2 ppt due to slower growth in credit and debit. With respect to cross-border, our volumes grew at 11% globally, down 1 ppt from last quarter with slower growth in Europe, primarily due to the timing of Easter.
Let me start out with a quick comment about our long-term performance objectives for 2016 to '18, which excluded the impact from our 2 major functional currencies, the euro and the Brazilian real as well as excluded any new M&A activities. Since we are now making the change to recognize the impact of all foreign exchange on our business, we reviewed these objectives and determined that no change is required from what we issued previously because we had baked in very little local FX impact over the 3-year period. Therefore, our 2016 to '18 objectives remain as follows, but are now on a currency-neutral basis: net revenue CAGR of low double digits; operating margin of at least 50%; and an EPS CAGR in the mid-teens and measured off a 2015 pro forma EPS figure of $3.12.
Now moving specifically to this year, there's really no change in our outlook for the business from what we discussed with you on our earnings call back in January. The U.S. and European economies are showing some sign of improvement, but the rest of the world remains challenged. In addition, FX headwinds will continue to be with us into 2016, although likely not as significant as 2015 given current FX rates. And our underlying business fundamentals remain strong. We will continue to run the company for growth, both on the top and on the bottom line as well as balancing our investments with astute expense management. 
As we look at full year 2016 and after factoring in our new currency-neutral methodology, we continue to expect to be at the low end of our 3-year revenue growth range. When you model on an as-reported basis, you will need to adjust for the impact of all currencies. And at the current rates, we estimate that it would mean about a 3 ppt headwind on net revenue growth and about a 4 ppt headwind to the bottom line. 
And let me call out a few other items that you should consider when modeling 2016. So for rebates and incentives, we continue to expect to see growth in the high teens, slightly lower than the 20% as-reported growth rate we saw in 2015. On expenses, we still expect total operating expense growth in the high single-digit range on an as-reported basis. And finally, you should assume a tax rate of slightly less than 30% for 2016. 
Now let me turn the call back to Barbara to begin the Q&A session. Barbara?"

You heard on their call, they've got some timing change and some construct changes in that. I think the construct changes actually make it simpler for the banks to evaluate what they're getting and what they're not. And so that's actually a good thing for everybody. And the timing change will just have an impact on how these deals progress over time. So we're kind of -- we're working our way through it and we're working hard in Europe. And M&A, I'm presuming you're asking about broad ideas in M&A. And broad ideas in M&A aren't any different from what I've told you in the past, which is kind of some deals have come across. We see deals every quarter. We end up probably seeing sometimes as much as 15 to 20 deals. We end up doing 1 or 2 if we're lucky in the course of a period of time. A couple of years ago, we did more than that. Just depends. It depends on what we need for product per geography or expansion of capabilities. But we're actively looking all the time."

We're trying to build out capabilities in the areas we've identified over the last few years in our strategic plans in our Investor Days. Basically, that's in processing, so we get to see more transactions, and we get beyond the clearing, authorizing and settlement space of the existing card kind of business. So that's why you saw us doing -- and you saw in my opening remarks the commentary on the different processing entities and how they fit into what we are doing. It could be in the data cache kind of space, which is the payment gateway area. It could be with things like Provus and Trevica. Those are all in the regular transaction processing spaces. Or it could be in any space that allows us to get to see more transactions. When 6, 7 years ago, we used to see under 40% of our transactions, we now see close to 50%. That enables us to do a better job with our core products, but even more importantly, with our information services and advisers and safety and security products, which is where we're putting some emphasis. So that's the second area beyond processing. Anything that gives us capabilities, strengths, geography, product knowledge or skill sets in data analytics, in safety and security, in information services, in loyalty and rewards, hence, the acquisitions in Australia that we have done, that's all about those spaces. And we haven't wavered off that. And you'll read speculation every once in a while, and speculation is speculation till we can announce anything to you. So don't take it to the bank."

And in truth, I think nobody actually knows. And I think and I said many times, it's going to take a few years for this to settle. That's why even companies like ours, in mobile, you've seen us place effort, energy, money, bets in everything from whether the transaction data is on the handset or it's in the cloud, whether we're working with mobile network operators or hardware manufacturers or distributors of that stuff. This whole mobile space, whether -- is such an evolving space, that I don't think anybody knows the answers. And I think that's what's going on even with the retailers. I think they're trying to find a way to offer a product and a wallet that their consumer can be connected to for loyalty and not just let a digital player own that space, also not just let the banks own that space. The banks, by the way, are doing the same thing. They're trying to make sure they offer products that get the consumer loyal to them and not just let the digital player own that space or the merchant own that space. And of course, the digital player is doing the same thing. So we're all doing a dance right now and I don't think anybody knows the real answer. But I do believe in 2 or 3 underlying factors. The first one is, we, as a network, we believe that a focus on the person who owns the consumer relationship, in this case, the bank or the merchant as it may be, that they are the ones who should be developing the loyalty with that consumer. People like us that are -- we're a B2B2C company. We operate through them and, therefore, our role is to facilitate that and do it in a way that drives our business with them and enables our value-added services to be used. So we're very focused on going through them, whether it be through a Walmart or through a Citibank or through a different bank. The second rule that I think applies universally is that more consumer choice in tenders and payments is better than less. And I think that's just to reduce the friction. There's one large merchant in the United States who doesn't think that way. But otherwise, every other merchant around the world is keen to basically offer more tender choice to their consumer rather than less. And I think that's going to be even more important in the mobile world, to reduce friction, and those kinds of rules apply. And so my view of this, Jason, don't conclude too much yet, but be prepared to see many efforts going on in different places. I think the days of one model when only one big mobile network or one, I'd say, one big mobile wallet or one big e-commerce wallet existed, those days are going away. There's going to be a lot of competition in that space with multiple tenders, with choice for consumers. And it's going to be interesting to watch where this settles."

But the results of that acceptance expanding in terms of impacting our volume in a way that I can give you tangible numbers, just give it a few more months.

And I would be loathe to tell you that the EU regulations are going to have no impact. I think it's a pretty serious industry move, and it will have an impact for a period of time on the way the consumer behaves, the merchant behaves and the way we construct our business there. The second part about Visa and its Visa Europe stuff, as I said, to the first question when I got asked in the beginning, it's still early. It's just been announced by them that they're changing the terms of the manner in which the exact deal's priced as well as the timing. I think over the next 2 or 3 months, we'll see what that does in terms of how issuers are thinking. My general sense is it'll make it easier for an issuer to know exactly what they're going to get paid from the exercise of the put, and that'll make it a little easier for them to comprehend what they're getting and what they're leaving behind if they make a decision, which, in a sense, is a good thing. That's transparency. And the second part of it is, it's going to be 3 months or so later. So it's just going to make it a little longer out on gestation periods.

So Dan, I can't just mix them all together because there are just a number of facets in there. But what we are doing, and this is what we said is, given that we have done a number of acquisitions, folding them together with our assets, we have made, and you remember maybe the restructuring charge that we took 15 months ago or so, we have actually made some really good progress to be increasing the margin of these businesses over time."

Okay. So thank you all for your questions. I want to leave you with a couple of closing thoughts. I think the first part is, I think our business is performing well. You see that reflected in our strong volume and transaction growth, and that's despite the somewhat uneven global economy. We're growing revenues from our core businesses, but also from our services, as we just had a discussion of, both organically and through the ongoing successful integration of our acquisitions for the last few years. We're pleased with our progress across MasterPass, across the MasterCard Digital Enablement System and our partnerships with many of the digital players. But as I said in the answer to Jason, that's -- there's a lot of things that will evolve there, and this is a marathon, not a sprint. We continue to build on our momentum in safety and security. We're committed to making sure that is what consumers get, no matter which channel or which instrument or device they choose to use to shop on. And we remain very focused on creating a better experience for both cardholders and merchants across all these channels.

This morning's earnings release and the slide deck that will be referenced on this call can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at mastercard.com. The documents have also been attached to an 8-K that we filed with the SEC earlier this morning. A replay of this call will be posted on our website for 1 month.
Before we get started, I'd like to point out a change we have made around reporting the impact of currency on our business. As Martina mentioned on our last earnings call, we realized it has become more difficult for many of you to model our business as FX rates continue to move around. Therefore, beginning this quarter, instead of reporting FX-adjusted growth rates, which only reflected the translational impact of 2 functional currencies, the euro and the Brazilian real, we are now reporting currency-neutral growth rates, which include both the impact from translating functional currencies into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes as well as the underlying impact of local currencies being converted into their functional currency. 
Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I need to remind everyone that today's call may include some forward-looking statements about MasterCard's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance are summarized at the end of our press release as well as contained in our recent SEC filings.
And now with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ajay."
6477196,329405740,2206965,"MasterCard Incorporated, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Mastercard Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Barbara. Good morning, everybody. We're very pleased to deliver solid results this quarter and despite what I think everybody would agree is an ongoing mixed global economic environment. On a currency-neutral basis, we reported net revenue grow",2321,"Thank you, Barbara. Good morning, everybody. We're very pleased to deliver solid results this quarter and despite what I think everybody would agree is an ongoing mixed global economic environment. On a currency-neutral basis, we reported net revenue growth of 14% and an EPS growth of 1%. But when you remove the impact of the nonrecurring discrete tax credit and the balance sheet remeasurement related to Venezuela in last year's first quarter, our EPS growth is 12%. 
So now let's take a look at the global economy. I think it's largely unchanged from what we discussed last quarter, with the U.S. economy remaining solid with inflation and wages growing at a similar pace and the unemployment rate kind of holding steady at 5%. We just saw the unemployment rate numbers coming out this morning as well. However, as we know from the Fed comments yesterday, uncertainty remains about when they might take action as well as the potential impact from the global economy. 
So with the rest of the world, the economic outlook continues to be mixed. In Europe, both consumer confidence and economic sentiment declined slightly this quarter. However, recent stimulus measures by the European Central Bank and steady improvement in the unemployment rate, I think, should continue to drive growth across the region, particularly in the U.K. and Germany. 
Asia is still challenged by the continued slowdown in China. Consumer confidence remains cloudy, with the exception being India, where both consumer and business sentiment remain high. 
In Latin America, Brazil is still in the worst recession in the country's history. And of course, economic conditions in Venezuela are deteriorating further. But Mexico is stable and seems to be driven by solid consumer spending and declining inflation. 
So none of this surprises us, but it does seem that we're likely to remain in a period of economic uncertainty. And so that said, we've continued to work hard to ensure that our business maintains its strong growth trajectory and we're seeing double-digit volume and transaction growth across most of our markets. In addition, we're benefiting from the successful integration of our recent acquisitions and continuing to grow our services business. As I told Barbara yesterday, at this time, steady as she goes is what our focus is. 
So now let's move on to some of our recent business activity. During the quarter, we signed a number of new deals and renewals supporting the expansion of our business around the world. I want to give you a few examples. In Europe, we extended our contract in Nordea, which is the largest bank in the Nordics, for their consumer credit and their commercial card portfolios. And we added the rollout of MasterPass and inControl with them. Same in Europe, we also renewed and extended our contract with DSGV, the largest banking group in Martina's home country of Germany, for their credit business. We also included the rollout of MasterPass. Further, we added a new debit portfolio with UniCredit, a leading European financial group based in Italy. In Asia, we just recently renewed and expanded our contracts with both Mitsubishi UFJ NICOS, which is one of the largest issuers in the region, for their consumer and their commercial credit business; and with Maybank, the largest bank in Malaysia, for their credit and debit business. 
And finally, I want to talk a little bit of an example of working with a number of our merchant partners. And I'm going to give you a specific example. This one is of McDonald's. We've talked in previous calls of a partnership with them in the Middle East, now in South Africa as well. The McDonald's are leveraging MasterPass to simplify the ordering process as well as utilizing contactless functionality at their restaurants. Of course, the idea is to improve the drive-through and the dining experience. 
But our McDonald's partnership actually has now gone beyond the core business. They're also a customer of Applied Predictive Technologies, or APT, the cloud-based data and analytics company that we acquired last May. McDonald's used APT's software to analyze a variety of strategic initiatives, including new food and menu items, determining which items should be on the menu and other business priorities. And this is one of the many examples of value we can provide to our merchant partners when you combine products that we have with the data analytics that we're capable of analyzing with them. 
So next, I'd like to give you an update on how we're advancing our strategy in the digital payment space. And I'm going to start with MasterPass. So remember, we're in a marathon here, and we're making great progress with our digital-by-default strategy. That's about enabling issuers to auto-enroll cardholders onto the MasterPass platform without any additional effort having to be made by the consumer. We're looking forward to announcing some bank partners who will be leveraging this ability in the near future. And as we continue to drive new acceptance for MasterPass as well, we're closing in on signing up about 270,000 merchants, representing more than $160 billion in addressable volume. 
Earlier this month, Vodafone Egypt migrated nearly 2 million Vodafone cash wallets from their closed-loop system to our mobile payment gateway platform. That enables us to process all of their transactions. This migration builds on our goal of creating an interoperable network across the Egyptian mobile payment ecosystem that I've spoken to in earlier call and helps to drive our strategy of financial inclusion and, of course, accelerate the conversion of cash. 
And then moving on to MasterCard Digital Enablement Service or MDES. We continue to make significant progress around making digital transaction more secure via encryption and tokenization. In Asia, we are pleased to now have more than 30 issuers signed up for the MDES service. We've also launched the first NFC-based wallet in Latin America with Citi/Banamex in Mexico, utilizing our cloud-based payment technology. And by the way, this wallet, the Citi/Banamex one, was created by developers from our C-SAM acquisition, which actually gave us access to a very talented pool of engineers, who are enabling us to build out capabilities for issuers and merchants exactly like the example of Citi/Banamex. 
And finally, we continue to support our digital partners by helping Android Pay launch in the U.K. and both Samsung Pay and Apple Pay are expanding to Singapore. We're also pleased to be partnering with Facebook as they leverage MDES to test tokenization by enabling pilot participants to interact with sellers and advertisers directly on the platform to complete their purchases, all without ever having to leave the Facebook app. 
So moving on to safety and security. You know there's a lot of effort from us and others going into the space. And as a result of successful biometric trials in the Netherlands and the U.S., that we announced last August, we're actually launching MasterCard Identity Check, fondly referred to as Selfie Pay, in the U.S., Canada and parts of Europe this summer, with more countries to be announced soon. Much of the initial interest in Identity Check has come -- had been attached to the consumer side of these businesses. But interestingly, we were actually currently working with BMO Financial Group, that's the Bank of Montreal in Canada, to roll out the first corporate credit card program using Selfie Pay in both the U.S. and Canada. 
In addition, we recently launched IQ series. That's a suite of products which uses real-time intelligence to empower issuers to make more informed fraud management decisions as well as, most importantly, potentially decrease the growing problem of false declines. Industry studies are showing that 1 out of every 6 cardholders have experienced at least 1 decline because of suspected fraud in the past year. That, by the way, adds up to false declines of $118 billion a year or several times the actual amount of true card fraud. 
Next, we worked with our issuers to deliver additional benefits to our cardholders and helped protect them even more from fraud. As of 2 weeks ago, all MasterCard consumer and small business cardholders are now covered by the industry's first global around-the-world 0 liability promise, ensuring they're not responsible for any unauthorized charges. 
And while on the topic of safety and security, let's spend a minute on the status of EMV in the U.S. We now have about 67% of our consumer credit cards and 24% for our consumer debit cards with chips in them. Roughly 1.2 million U.S. merchant locations are now accepting these cards. And while that's good progress that we're seeing across the industry and also in our own numbers, I mean, everybody recognizes that checkout times at the terminal may appear longer when using a chip card. And to help address that concern, we announced M/Chip Fast, which is to help speed EMV transactions. You leverage the capabilities of our existing contactless technology, which as you know, has been deployed in various transits and other applications around the world. Using that, cardholders will experience magstripe transaction speed, but with the added security of EMV and chip. At the same time, we're going to make this happen in collaboration with the industry, including other networks, to look at how to bring a consistent approach to the market and best support the EMV checkout experience. 
And the point of all these examples is that people shop on all sorts of devices and through multiple channels. And they expect technology to simplify that process while keeping the transaction safe and secure. And I give you all these examples to demonstrate and reinforce our commitment to protecting every transaction. Doesn't matter whether it took place in the physical world or the digital world. We are committed to doing this.
So for the last several minutes talking to you on how we've grown our business through a series of organic investments. And it's important to recognize we've also been growing our business by integrating the various acquisitions we made over the past few years, trying to expand our presence across the payment value chain. So let me give you a couple of examples across information services and processing. 
So let's start by information services, that business within advisers. I mentioned APT earlier when I talked about McDonald's. One of the great things about that subscription-based business model is that it generates a recurring revenue stream with an average contract length of about 3 years. And since the acquisition, we've integrated the sales and product organizations of APT with advisers to drive some pretty good benefits. Let me give you an example. 
Since their acquisition, 30 organizations have subscribed to the APT platform in long-term contracts. And in addition to McDonald's that I talked about, I'll give you a few more: Asahi Breweries in Japan; Sunoco in the U.S.; and in the U.K., KFC. We've also signed more than 15 new deals incremental to APT's earlier business-as-usual efforts, in other words, using MasterCard's client relationships and coverage, including, by the way, one of the largest airlines in Europe, one of the largest retailers in Brazil, 2 of the largest financial institutions in Asia and several in the U.S. What's exciting about all these deals is that they include expanding relationships with long-time APT clients, who now also license newly created product modules, leveraging insights derived from MasterCard data. 
Then finally we launched APT Engage, which is a suite of products which leverages aggregated and anonymized MasterCard payment transaction data combined with APT's proprietary analytics, to help issuers and merchants better understand customer spending behavior, which products have higher loyalty as well as planning for new retail locations. That's about information services.
On to processing. The idea there being to extend our capabilities beyond switching, getting beyond authorizing, clearing and settlement. So in our Payment Transaction Services business, we signed a deal with BNP Paribas in Poland to provide issuer processing services, which, by the way, has also enabled us to become one of the major third-party processors in the country. Here in the U.S., our year-old partnership with Green Dot to process all of their debit and prepaid cards has resulted in the successful migration of now approximately 50 million account files with another 50 million to arc over the balance of 2016. And lastly, in the same business, we enabled several transit operators in Turkey to begin using NFC capability by processing contactless cards and thereby, allowing us to increase our share of domestic processed transactions. 
Staying with processing, on the Prepaid Management Services side, we've just implemented a card program with British Airways to facilitate compensation payments to BA passengers for delayed or canceled flights or lost luggage. We've also launched the first dual-purpose travel insurance and multicurrency prepaid travel product with Flight Centre, which is one of the world's largest travel agencies. 
And lastly, as a result of integrating our acquired assets into our Payment Gateway Services business, we're now able to offer products globally, which include integrated fraud and risk management solutions to both merchants and to acquirers. We're already seeing several new wins, including 4 new deals with key acquirers and resellers in Australia, India, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, who can now offer these capabilities to their merchant base and in turn, that kind of helps us expand our footprint in these markets. We've also worked to ensure that our payment gateway provides acceptance of the latest digital payment methods. We now support both Apple Pay and Android Pay in addition to MasterPass. 
We all recognize these acquisitions require a certain amount of time, investment and resources to integrate. We've worked very hard to ensure this happens seamlessly and efficiently. We're now clearly seeing the benefits that come from them, both in our dialogue and in our engagement with our customers. 
So with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Martina for an update on our financial results and operational metrics. Martina?"
6477196,329405740,2206965,"MasterCard Incorporated, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Mastercard Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Ajay, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by giving you some highlights on the first quarter, starting with Page 3, where you see the difference between as-reported and currency-neutral growth rates for this quarter. As Barbara explained at t",1522,"Thanks, Ajay, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by giving you some highlights on the first quarter, starting with Page 3, where you see the difference between as-reported and currency-neutral growth rates for this quarter. As Barbara explained at the start of this call, we have now changed how we report the impact of currency. So instead of reporting FX-adjusted growth rates, which only reflected the translational impact of the euro and the Brazilian real functional currencies, we are now reporting currency-neutral growth rates, which exclude all impacts of foreign exchange rates. This is both the impact from translating functional currencies into U.S. dollar for reporting purposes as well as the underlying impact of local currencies being converted into their functional currency. We hope that this change will make it easier for you to understand the underlying performance of our business. And all of my comments going forward will pertain to our new currency-neutral growth rates.
Net revenue growth was 14%. While operating expenses grew significantly, this was mostly due to the difference between FX hedging and balance sheet remeasurement gains that we had in the year-ago quarter versus foreign exchange losses on our hedging contracts in this quarter. I will talk more about this when we get into the detail of operating expenses. 
As expected, net income was also impacted by a higher tax rate than in the year-ago quarter due to the nonrecurrence of a discrete U.S. foreign tax credit from which we benefited in the first quarter of 2015. EPS was $0.86, up 1% year-over-year. But as Ajay said, it was impacted by $0.08 due to the discrete tax item that I just mentioned and the Venezuela balance sheet remeasurement gain in the year-ago quarter. When you exclude these 2 items, EPS grew 12%. 
Share repurchases contributed $0.03 per share. And as of April 21, we have $2.9 billion remaining under our current authorization. And lastly, cash flow from operations was $1 billion, and we ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalent and other liquid investments of about $6.2 billion.
So let me turn to Page 4 and here, you can see the operational metrics for the first quarter. Included in these numbers is a positive lift of about 1% due to leap day on all of our metrics. Our worldwide gross dollar volume, or GDV growth, was 13%. On a local currency basis, that's about up 1 ppt from last quarter. Overall, our U.S. GDV grew 10%, made up of credit and debit growth of 11% and 8%, respectively. Total U.S. GDV had a continued 1 ppt headwind from lower gas prices. 
Outside of the U.S., volume growth was 15% on a local currency basis, also up about 1 ppt versus last quarter, with mid- to high teens growth in each region, except Canada, which was impacted by the lapping of our Costco win. Cross-border volume grew 12% on a local currency basis, and that's similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter.
Turning to Page 5. Processed transactions grew 14% globally to $12.6 billion, a 2 ppt increase from what we saw in the fourth quarter, with higher growth in all regions except Canada, again due to the lapping of our Costco win. Globally, the number of cards grew 7% with 2.3 billion MasterCard and Maestro-branded cards issued. 
Let me turn to Page 6 for highlights on a few of the revenue line items. Net revenue growth was 10% as reported or 14% on a currency-neutral basis, given currency headwinds. We saw strong volume and transaction growth, particularly in the U.S. and Europe, and some of which was due to the impact of leap year. Rebates and incentives was slightly higher than what we expected due to deal renewals. 
Looking quickly at the individual line -- revenue line items on a constant -- on a currency-neutral basis. Domestic assessments grew 13%, in line with worldwide GDV growth. Cross-border volume fees grew 14%, while cross-border volume grew 12%. The 2 ppt gap is due to a number of pricing actions, partially offset by a higher mix of intra-Europe activity. Transaction processing fees grew 18%, primarily driven by the 14% growth in processed transactions as well as some pricing. And finally, other revenues grew 22%, driven primarily by our APT acquisition and our safety and security product offerings.
Moving on to Page 7. Here, you can see that total operating expenses increased 25% in the quarter or 29% on a currency-neutral basis. Most of this increase is due to FX movements recorded in our G&A line. I mentioned on our last earnings call that we recorded a large amount of FX gains in the year-ago quarter, mostly due to onetime gains related to Venezuela. The absence of those gains, plus the unrealized losses we recorded this quarter on our FX hedging activity due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to year-end 2015, resulted in an almost $130 million increase to expenses. Excluding this and a 4 ppt impact from acquisitions we did not have in the year-ago quarter, G&A grew 11% as a result of our continuing investment in areas such as digital, data analytics and safety and security. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense is primarily due to the amortization of intangibles related to our acquisitions.
So now I'm going to turn to Slide 8. Let's discuss what we had seen in April through the 21st. While many of our business drivers are similar to the first quarter, direct comparisons to the first quarter are a bit difficult since it had the benefit of both leap day and Easter. 
The numbers through April 21 are as follows: Starting with processed volume, we saw global growth of 13%, the same as in the first quarter. In the U.S., our process volume grew 10%, down roughly 1 ppt from the first quarter, with slower growth in both credit and debit. Gas had less than 1 ppt negative impact on our April growth, down slightly from the first quarter impact. Process volume outside the U.S. grew 16%, up 1 ppt from the last quarter, with higher growth in most regions and primarily driven by Europe and APMEA. Global process transaction growth was 14%, the same as we saw in the first quarter. Process transaction growth outside the U.S. was up a bit, with increases in APMEA and LAC, while the U.S. growth was down almost 2 ppt due to slower growth in credit and debit. With respect to cross-border, our volumes grew at 11% globally, down 1 ppt from last quarter with slower growth in Europe, primarily due to the timing of Easter.
Let me start out with a quick comment about our long-term performance objectives for 2016 to '18, which excluded the impact from our 2 major functional currencies, the euro and the Brazilian real as well as excluded any new M&A activities. Since we are now making the change to recognize the impact of all foreign exchange on our business, we reviewed these objectives and determined that no change is required from what we issued previously because we had baked in very little local FX impact over the 3-year period. Therefore, our 2016 to '18 objectives remain as follows, but are now on a currency-neutral basis: net revenue CAGR of low double digits; operating margin of at least 50%; and an EPS CAGR in the mid-teens and measured off a 2015 pro forma EPS figure of $3.12.
Now moving specifically to this year, there's really no change in our outlook for the business from what we discussed with you on our earnings call back in January. The U.S. and European economies are showing some sign of improvement, but the rest of the world remains challenged. In addition, FX headwinds will continue to be with us into 2016, although likely not as significant as 2015 given current FX rates. And our underlying business fundamentals remain strong. We will continue to run the company for growth, both on the top and on the bottom line as well as balancing our investments with astute expense management. 
As we look at full year 2016 and after factoring in our new currency-neutral methodology, we continue to expect to be at the low end of our 3-year revenue growth range. When you model on an as-reported basis, you will need to adjust for the impact of all currencies. And at the current rates, we estimate that it would mean about a 3 ppt headwind on net revenue growth and about a 4 ppt headwind to the bottom line. 
And let me call out a few other items that you should consider when modeling 2016. So for rebates and incentives, we continue to expect to see growth in the high teens, slightly lower than the 20% as-reported growth rate we saw in 2015. On expenses, we still expect total operating expense growth in the high single-digit range on an as-reported basis. And finally, you should assume a tax rate of slightly less than 30% for 2016. 
Now let me turn the call back to Barbara to begin the Q&A session. Barbara?"

In terms of operating leverage, what we have said when we looked at our business, and we do that actually every year, that we feel very comfortable with an operating margin in excess of 50%. Remember, we are really running the business for revenue growth, so for top line growth, which means that we are having to make a number of investments in -- on the OpEx side in order to generate the bottom line growth. So we are holding that as a metric.

We're trying to build out capabilities in the areas we've identified over the last few years in our strategic plans in our Investor Days. Basically, that's in processing, so we get to see more transactions, and we get beyond the clearing, authorizing and settlement space of the existing card kind of business. So that's why you saw us doing -- and you saw in my opening remarks the commentary on the different processing entities and how they fit into what we are doing. It could be in the data cache kind of space, which is the payment gateway area. It could be with things like Provus and Trevica. Those are all in the regular transaction processing spaces. Or it could be in any space that allows us to get to see more transactions. When 6, 7 years ago, we used to see under 40% of our transactions, we now see close to 50%. That enables us to do a better job with our core products, but even more importantly, with our information services and advisers and safety and security products, which is where we're putting some emphasis. So that's the second area beyond processing. Anything that gives us capabilities, strengths, geography, product knowledge or skill sets in data analytics, in safety and security, in information services, in loyalty and rewards, hence, the acquisitions in Australia that we have done, that's all about those spaces. And we haven't wavered off that. And you'll read speculation every once in a while, and speculation is speculation till we can announce anything to you. So don't take it to the bank."

And in truth, I think nobody actually knows. And I think and I said many times, it's going to take a few years for this to settle. That's why even companies like ours, in mobile, you've seen us place effort, energy, money, bets in everything from whether the transaction data is on the handset or it's in the cloud, whether we're working with mobile network operators or hardware manufacturers or distributors of that stuff. This whole mobile space, whether -- is such an evolving space, that I don't think anybody knows the answers. And I think that's what's going on even with the retailers. I think they're trying to find a way to offer a product and a wallet that their consumer can be connected to for loyalty and not just let a digital player own that space, also not just let the banks own that space. The banks, by the way, are doing the same thing. They're trying to make sure they offer products that get the consumer loyal to them and not just let the digital player own that space or the merchant own that space. And of course, the digital player is doing the same thing. So we're all doing a dance right now and I don't think anybody knows the real answer. But I do believe in 2 or 3 underlying factors. The first one is, we, as a network, we believe that a focus on the person who owns the consumer relationship, in this case, the bank or the merchant as it may be, that they are the ones who should be developing the loyalty with that consumer. People like us that are -- we're a B2B2C company. We operate through them and, therefore, our role is to facilitate that and do it in a way that drives our business with them and enables our value-added services to be used. So we're very focused on going through them, whether it be through a Walmart or through a Citibank or through a different bank. The second rule that I think applies universally is that more consumer choice in tenders and payments is better than less. And I think that's just to reduce the friction. There's one large merchant in the United States who doesn't think that way. But otherwise, every other merchant around the world is keen to basically offer more tender choice to their consumer rather than less. And I think that's going to be even more important in the mobile world, to reduce friction, and those kinds of rules apply. And so my view of this, Jason, don't conclude too much yet, but be prepared to see many efforts going on in different places. I think the days of one model when only one big mobile network or one, I'd say, one big mobile wallet or one big e-commerce wallet existed, those days are going away. There's going to be a lot of competition in that space with multiple tenders, with choice for consumers. And it's going to be interesting to watch where this settles."

My general sense is it'll make it easier for an issuer to know exactly what they're going to get paid from the exercise of the put, and that'll make it a little easier for them to comprehend what they're getting and what they're leaving behind if they make a decision, which, in a sense, is a good thing. That's transparency. And the second part of it is, it's going to be 3 months or so later. So it's just going to make it a little longer out on gestation periods. Meanwhile, we're all working away like busy beavers."

But the purpose for us is not just to be making money on that processing piece. The primary purpose is that we're doing this in countries where we typically don't switch the transaction. So that means it's a different means for us to be actually seeing the transaction, and then what we do with the transaction is utilizing it for additional services. So as soon as we see a transaction, we can, for instance, put our safety and security products in it. We can do data analytics in it.

So Dan, I can't just mix them all together because there are just a number of facets in there. But what we are doing, and this is what we said is, given that we have done a number of acquisitions, folding them together with our assets, we have made, and you remember maybe the restructuring charge that we took 15 months ago or so, we have actually made some really good progress to be increasing the margin of these businesses over time."

Okay. So thank you all for your questions. I want to leave you with a couple of closing thoughts. I think the first part is, I think our business is performing well.

We're growing revenues from our core businesses, but also from our services, as we just had a discussion of, both organically and through the ongoing successful integration of our acquisitions for the last few years. We're pleased with our progress across MasterPass, across the MasterCard Digital Enablement System and our partnerships with many of the digital players. But as I said in the answer to Jason, that's -- there's a lot of things that will evolve there, and this is a marathon, not a sprint. We continue to build on our momentum in safety and security. We're committed to making sure that is what consumers get, no matter which channel or which instrument or device they choose to use to shop on. And we remain very focused on creating a better experience for both cardholders and merchants across all these channels.

Our business continues to perform well. We're very pleased with our strong results this quarter. As you could see from the release, on a currency-neutral basis and excluding the special items related to litigation, we reported both net revenue and EPS growth of 14%. Martina is going to get into the financial details, so I'm going to talk a little bit about the global economy first. And frankly, other than the Brexit vote, very little has changed since the last quarter. The United States economy is still holding steady. Consumer confidence up slightly, stable job growth, low inflation. And frankly, prior to the Brexit vote, many parts of Europe were showing steady signs of improvement in both consumer confidence and unemployment. And while it's still too early to predict the full impact of Brexit, we will obviously watch that situation very carefully. 
The outlook for Asia remains cautious. We've got a prolonged slowdown in China, weaker-than-expected recovery in Australia. India continues to be a bright spot, both consumer and business sentiment there remain strong.
In Latin America, Brazil is still in a deep recession but interestingly, a modest increase in business confidence is beginning to show signs that the economy may be reaching a bottom. 
In Venezuela, economic conditions continue to deteriorate, but Mexico is in a steady growth path. It's been driven by solid consumer spending and low unemployment. And so as a result, it's likely we're going to remain in a period of economic and political uncertainty at least in the near term. Having said all of this, our business continues to grow. Our fundamentals remain strong. We are seeing double-digit volume and transaction growth across most of our markets, and we continue to win deals by differentiating ourselves with services. 
Now I wasn't on the call last week that Martina and Tim had on VocaLink, so let me just quickly share my views about the planned acquisition of VocaLink. The deal is an important component of our strategy to participate in all forms of electronic payments and to enhance our services for the benefit of our customers and our partners. And VocaLink itself is very interesting to us for a couple of reasons. First, when you look at all payment flows in the world's top 50 countries, and this is not just retail payments, ACH represents about 50% of that total. And the potential of Fast ACH is growing, especially given that it is being promoted by a number of regulatory bodies in Europe, the United States and in other parts of the world. 
Second, we believe that VocaLink is the best asset in this space from both a technology standpoint as well as having a very talented group of people who are respected across the industry. Beyond the opportunities available in that primary U.K. market, they have been successful in operating and licensing their Fast ACH technology in other markets: in Sweden, in Singapore and Thailand. They're also the primary supplier of Fast ACH technology to the clearing house in the United States. 
And finally, the ability to see both card and ACH transactions would enable us to offer an even broader range of data analytics and other services through our partners. Our card network has been powering our growth in both consumer and commercial payment for many years. And with this acquisition, we will now have a new set of capabilities to capture additional opportunities in B2B, in P2P and government payment flows regardless of what payment rail they use. So that's VocaLink. 
Let me move on to a brief update on China. In June, the People's Bank of China released the final regulation to foreign card networks to operate domestically in China. We are currently working through the requirements. We need a much better understanding around their national security and cybersecurity standards before we determine how best to proceed. We've got to weigh whether we can apply for license alone or with a business partner. It's all connected to this deeper understanding. Meanwhile, what we are doing is we're continuing to work on building out our technology on the ground as well as working with our Chinese customers on new issuance and broadening acceptance. 
So moving on from there, a couple of recent developments on the legal front. In the United States, the Brooklyn District Court's 2013 approval of the U.S. merchant class action settlement, as you know, was overturned by the Court of Appeals in late June. And obviously, we're disappointed by that decision. Charlie and Visa revealed it in some detail on their earnings call last week. So I won't rehash the same details. The case will be sent back to a District Court. There we expect the first order of business will be to appoint counsel to the injunctive release class. MasterCard will then work with all parties to see if they can find ways to reform the settlement in line with the Court of Appeals decision. And as you'd expect, our forecast on that work will be on rule changes and the scope of the release, which were the issues in the Court of Appeals decision, not the money damages. 
On the money damages, note that our financial exposure remains capped at 12% of any settlement or judgment under the agreements we entered into with the bank defendant and with Visa in 2011. 
Additionally, in July, a U.K. court issued a decision in one of the U.K. merchant suits seeking interchange damages. That court awarded Sainsbury's a portion of the damages that they'd been seeking. And that amount, along with anticipated legal fees and costs, was taken as a charge in the second quarter. That's the special item you see in our results. Although we don't believe the retailer suffered any damages, we're gratified by several aspects of the court's decision. Just one example, the court recognized that an appropriate level of domestic interchange is substantially higher than the 20 and 30 basis points imposed by the European interchange fee regulation that went into effect last December. 
So now let's move on to some of our recent business activity. And during the quarter, as been normal, we find a number of new deals and renewals supporting the expansion of our business around the world. I'm going to run through a few examples. We continue to make progress in our U.S. consumer business. Recent highlights include the renewal of our partnership with Huntington National Bank across their debit, credit and commercial businesses, expanded acquisitions of new consumer credit accounts with several of the largest banks in the market. In addition, we had important wins in the co-brand space, including American Airlines, the Citi and Barclaycard, with both JV assured [ph] as well as Intercontinental Hotels, Bed Bath & Beyond and some others. 
We also renewed, just announced it yesterday actually, our consumer credit co-brand with PayPal, an important complement of our overall relationship with them, which as you heard from Dan Schulman on his call, we're all actively seeking to expand.
We continue to drive our commercial business forward. One of the most important verticals for us is travel. And now in addition to our relationship with eNett and Travelport that we've talked of in previous calls, we just signed a new global deal with Amadeus, a leading travel technology company. Today, travel agencies make more than $300 billion in the annual payments to airlines, hotels and other travel providers, largely via bank transfers and checks. What this agreement does is it combines Amadeus' new B2B wallet and virtual payment technology with MasterCard's commercial card capabilities. We will provide travel agencies and travel providers with a fast, secure and automated way to pay and get paid. 
We continue to perform well outside of the U.S. In Canada, we signed 2 new issuer deals, renewed 4 issuer and co-brand deals, including: NBNA, which is a division now of the Toronto Dominion Bank; and President's Choice Financial, which is part of Loblaw, one of the largest retailers in Canada, which, by the way, included exclusive issuance. 
In Europe, we are pleased to sign an expanded agreement with Yapi Kredi, one of the market leaders in Turkey, for a larger portion of their credit portfolio. Prior to this deal, most of their credit business was with a competitor. 
In addition to the deals I mentioned previously, we're continuing our momentum in the co-brand space globally. We are very excited. We renewed our partnership with Walmart in Canada and also signed a new agreement with them in China. 
We have partnered with Access Bank in India as well as Miles & More, one of the largest global frequent flyer and rewards programs, to launch India's first multicurrency, co-branded, prepaid card that supports up to 17 currencies to facilitate both domestic and international card usage. 
Finally, you've heard us say many times how we've been successful with using services as a key strategic differentiator for winning deals. As one example of this, we're happy to have renewed a long-term debit agreement with Bendigo and Adelaide Bank, one of Australia's largest retail banks, includes commercial cards and a flip of the majority of their consumer credit business. That deal includes a full complement of our services, consisting of advisers, loyalty solutions and our suite of safety and security products. We signed a deal with CartaSi, one of the largest card issuers in Italy, to begin issuing debit cards as well as to use advisers' consulting services. You'll hear a lot more from us about how we're differentiating with services at our upcoming Investor Day in September. 
So moving on to our digital strategy. You know we've long said this is a marathon, not a sprint. But we've made some significant progress this past quarter and there's more to come. So about 2 weeks ago, we announced some important industry milestone when we became the first network to deliver a digital payment service across all devices, all channels. With MasterPass, consumers can now decide how and where they prefer to shop, whether that's in app, online or in store using a bank-branded offering from the issuer of their choice, knowing that their payment information is protected by our technology. 
We've also previously talked about our digital by default strategy, which enables issuers to auto-enroll cardholders on to the MasterPass service through their online banking app without any additional effort by the consumer. We're very pleased that more than 18 million accounts will be automatically enabled by the end of this year. 18 million, as the services began to roll out globally, starting with Europe and Asia and later this year in the United States, the Bank of America with Citibank and Capital One. 
Further, issuers can use MasterPass to differentiate their own wallet offering by using our open APIs to integrate other services from us, such as purchase alerts or paying with points or services that they have developed themselves. 
And lastly, in terms of geography, including the recent expansions to Greece, Switzerland, Colombia and Ukraine, we are now live in 33 markets. 
From an acceptance standpoint, MasterPass is currently available at hundreds of thousands of merchants online and in-app. We are pleased to have recently added IKEA. We'll soon be adding Saks, Lord and Taylor and The Cheesecake Factory as more examples. With the introduction of NFC capability, consumers will now be able to use MasterPass at the more than 5 million merchant locations in 77 countries that accept contactless payments today. Contactless will first be available to Android device owners in the United States later this month, with a global expansion to follow shortly thereafter. 
Last topic is tokenization technology, the MasterCard Digital Enablement service, or MDES. We continue to make solid progress and are making transactions more secure for MasterPass, which by the way, is already enabled for contactless transactions with online and in-app to follow but also for our digital partners. 
Most recently, we helped Android Pay expand to Singapore as well as Apple Pay to move into Canada, Hong Kong, Switzerland and France. In addition, we're also pleased to be partnering with Microsoft on the launch of their cloud-based mobile wallet solution for Windows 10 compatible devices. All these examples illustrate our continued commitment to deliver secure consumer payment experience to our cardholders using the mobile device of their choice. 
So with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Martina for an update on our financial results and operational metrics. Martina?"
6477196,369244781,2206980,"MasterCard Incorporated, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Mastercard Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Ajay, and good morning, everyone. So let me begin by giving you some highlights on the second quarter, starting with Page 3, where you see the difference between non-GAAP reported and currency-neutral growth rates for this quarter. So these figure",1422,"Thanks, Ajay, and good morning, everyone. So let me begin by giving you some highlights on the second quarter, starting with Page 3, where you see the difference between non-GAAP reported and currency-neutral growth rates for this quarter. So these figures exclude the impact of the special items taken in both this quarter and the previous quarter related to the judgment issued on Sainsbury's and the settlement we made with Tesco, the 2 largest merchants involved in the U.K. merchant litigation. I'd like to point out a few items using the currency-neutral growth rate. 
As Ajay said, net revenue growth was 14% for the quarter, coming in a bit higher than our expectations. Operating expenses grew 13%, primarily due to continued investments to support our strategic initiatives as well as higher legal costs, of which the majority are not likely to recur. We saw a higher tax rate than the year ago -- in the year-ago quarter due to the non-recurrence of a discrete U.S. foreign tax credit from which we benefited in the second quarter of 2015. 
And with all that, EPS was $0.96, up 14% year-over-year. Share repurchases contributed about $0.03 per share. And as of July 21, we have $2.7 billion remaining under our current authorization. And lastly, cash flow from operations was $1.1 billion, and we ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and other liquid investments of about $6.4 billion. 
So let's turn to Page 4, where you can see the operational metrics for the second quarter. When comparing these numbers to the last quarter, just remember, the first quarter saw about a 1 ppt benefit from leap day, which explains most of the differences. Our worldwide gross dollar volume, or GDV, growth was 11% on a local currency basis, down 2 ppt from last quarter. 
Overall, our U.S. GDV grew 8%, made up of credit and debit growth of 7% and 8%, respectively. Total U.S. GDV had less than 1 ppt headwind from lower gas prices. 
Now outside of the U.S., volume growth was 13% on a local currency basis, and that's about down 2 ppt versus last quarter, with low to mid-teens growth in each region. 
And beginning on June 9, as a result of the new EU regulation, our volume numbers reflect the absence of domestic co-badge volume that we do not process, particularly in France. In the second quarter, we saw an impact of 1 ppt on worldwide volume growth and a 3 ppt impact to European volume growth. The impact will become more pronounced over the next year, and this has been contemplated in all of our forward guidance. 
Cross-border volume grew 10% on a local currency basis, slightly lower than the 12% we saw in the first quarter. 
Let me turn to Page 5. And here, you can see processed transactions grew 14% globally to $13.7 billion. That's a very similar increase from what we saw in the first quarter. And globally, the number of cards grew 7%, with 2.3 billion MasterCard and Maestro-branded cards issued. 
On Page 6. Here you see some highlights on a few of the detailed revenue line items. Unless otherwise stated, the growth numbers I call out both here and on the next slide are all on a currency-neutral basis. So as I said, net revenue growth was 14%, a bit stronger than we expected. We saw continued strong volume and transaction growth, plus a higher contribution from some of our services businesses. Rebates and incentives grew 23%, primarily due to higher volumes as well as some deal renewals. 
Looking strictly at the individual revenue line items. Domestic assessments grew 10%, while worldwide GDV grew by 11%. And the difference is primarily due to mix. Cross-border volume fees grew 14%, while cross-border volume grew 10%. The 4 ppt gap is due to a number of pricing actions, partially offset by a higher mix of intra-Europe activity. Transaction processing fees grew 21%, primarily driven by the 14% growth in processed transactions as well as some pricing. And finally, other revenue grew 25%, driven primarily by services such as advisers, APT and our safety and security product offerings. 
Moving now to Page 7. Here, you can see the total operating expenses after excluding special items increased 12% in the quarter or 13% on a currency-neutral basis. Our APT acquisition contributed about 1 ppt to these growth rates. In addition, 5 ppt was due to higher legal costs. As I already said, the majority of these aren't likely to recur. So the remaining 7 ppt was primarily due to higher personnel costs related to our continued investments in strategic areas such as digital, data analytics and geographic expansion. Also, our data processing expense growth is normally in line with transaction growth. However, this past quarter, the growth was higher due to the fee we now pay to NSP Cards for processing domestic Russian transactions. 
Let me turn to Slide 8. And here, we can discuss what we have seen in July through the 21, where most of our drivers are up from the second quarter. The numbers through July 21 are as follows. Starting with processed volume, we saw global growth of 11%, slightly lower than the 12% we saw in the second quarter. In the U.S., our process volume grew 8%, down 1 ppt from the second quarter, with slower growth in credit but higher growth in debit. GAAP had less than a 1 ppt negative impact on our July growth. That's very similar to the second quarter. And processed volume outside of the U.S. grew 15%, up a bit from the second quarter, primarily driven by Europe and Latin America. Globally, processed transactions growth was 17%, up 3 ppt from what we saw in the second quarter. Processed transaction growth outside the U.S. was up 1 ppt, with increases in Europe and Latin America. And the U.S. growth was up 6 ppt, driven by new opportunities of PIN routing. 
With respect to cross-border -- across border, our volumes actually grew 14% globally, and that's up 4 ppt from last quarter with faster growth in Europe. We also saw faster growth in Middle East and Africa, which was likely related to the timing of Ramadan. 
So now looking to the full year of 2016, there's really no change in our business outlook from what we discussed with you in our earnings back in April. Currently, we don't anticipate any significant impact from Brexit this year. However, foreign exchange headwinds will continue to be with us in 2016, although they continue to moderate from the recent past given current FX rates. 
Our underlying business fundamentals remain strong, and we will continue to run the company for growth, both on the top and bottom line as well as balancing our investments with astute expense management. 
As we look at full year 2016 and after factoring in our currency-neutral methodology, we continue to expect to be at the low end of our 3-year revenue growth range. When you model on an as-reported basis, you will need to adjust for the impact of all currencies. And at current rates, we estimate that, that would mean about a 2 ppt headwind to net revenue growth and the bottom line, which is less of a headwind than what we said on our April earnings call. 
Now let me call out a few other items that you should consider when modeling 2016. For rebates and incentives, we now expect to see growth of about the same as the 20% as-reported growth rate we saw in 2015 after factoring in the impact of the new American Airlines co-brand renewal. On expenses, we continue to expect total operating expense growth in the high single-digit range for our as-reported results, excluding special items. On a currency-neutral basis, we continue to expect low double-digit growth. Be mindful that we're ramping up our efforts on MasterPass, which impacts G&A and A&M, particularly in the third quarter. You should now assume a tax rate of slightly less than 29% for 2016. 
And finally, on the subject of share repurchases. Now while year-to-date, we have bought back about $1.8 billion, most of that occurred earlier in the year, as we were out of the market for most of the second quarter given the pending VocaLink transaction. As I said last week, once our trading window opens in early August, we expect to continue our repurchasing activity. 
So now let me turn the call back to Barbara to begin the Q&A session. Barbara?"

The second one is the most transactional question, and I can tell you that places like Turkey and other such locations, there's no doubt that the impact of some of this activity and terrorism does impact what's going on there. Our cross-border growth to Turkey is down significantly compared to last year. Cardholders from Germany, Russia, Sweden and the U.S. are not traveling there with the same level of frequency as they were, clearly. We're also closely watching travel to other markets, France and so on. Interestingly, in the U.K., there's actually an increase of inbound cross-border expense. So it's kind of bouncing around but specifically in a couple of countries impacted by terrorism. There's no doubt that it causes some angst in cross-border travel. Having said that, remember what Martina said. Right now, our cross-border volumes for the first few weeks of this quarter, so only a few weeks, are up compared to where we were last quarter. And in fact, Europe is one of the contributors to that being up. So about Visa and PayPal. I've said this a few times to a number of you when I met you. Back in June of 2013, we had implemented a new approach to digital wallet operators that apply to all staged wallets. And by the way, not just PayPal. So I want you to understand that. With the intent of bringing consistency and transparency to the system, transactions should flow through with clear data flowing through, the brand of the bank and the network should be visible to the consumer and the merchant. There are many reasons for us to be thoughtful about that digital wallet operator principles. We're still exactly where we are with those principles, and I think what I'm really pleased to see through a constructive dialogue with Dan Schulman and his management team at PayPal, that PayPal is actually working to resolve some of those concerns we all have around the lack of transparency, around these stage wallets as well as ACH clearing. And that's what you saw in the announcement that he and Charlie made a few days ago. And if you heard Dan mention in his earnings call, they're in discussions with others in the payment space to work with similar concepts or somewhat different but in the same space. We have worked with PayPal for many years. We have good working relationship with them and a wide range of opportunities. I just told you we just renewed our credit co-brand portfolio with them, in fact, yesterday. And so that gives you a sense of the -- of the manner in which PayPal is trying to work with the industry. I think this is actually a good thing for PayPal and for the industry because at the end of the day, providing consumers the ability of having seamless simple ways of paying is good for all of us. Everything is better than having to use cash and that's where we're headed."

It's solvable. It's not the best thing to do, but it's solvable. What I'm referring to is that they recently in their policy regarding the opening up of the market for people like us to come in, they put in a couple of clauses around complying with their new national security and cybersecurity policy. The little challenges of the new national security and cybersecurity policy has not yet actually been passed into a form that is visible to us in a document where we can say, ""Okay, got it. Got it. Got it. Do this, do that. We're okay."" It's not in that form. So we're in a little bit of an in between territory, between understanding that they want to have a thoughtful national security and cybersecurity policy, which they're entitled to. But we don't understand the implications for us in terms of operating a network on the ground. So whether we operate with our own license or we operate with a JV with somebody else or we do some other creative thinking around this, will all depend on clarity of these kinds of elements that they put into the policy they've recently announced. That's what we're trying to sort out. Meanwhile, there's a lot of stuff to do for us in China. We're continuing work on issuance, continuing work on building out acceptance or we've been continuing some work on basic technology development, so that when we get clarity of this, and Martina and I are confident we understand what we are signing up for, then we can move forward relatively quickly from that space. So it's kind of one of those in-between spaces."

In fact, that's not at all what we are talking about. This has all to do with PIN routing and working on PIN transactions. And as I think I've told you a couple of calls ago, maybe a few before that, this stuff will move around a little bit and bounce around as merchants move the different routing in their routing tables, depending on what's working for them. And it's not just about pricing. It's also about speed of approval. It's about many different things that they look at.

What I've been telling folks is it's actually not that different if you get down to the bank level, you're actually closer to apples-to-apples on a pricing basis.

It's not quite at the level where our global pricing is. It's lower because as you know, in every geography and in the country, it depends in terms of whether we just were to be able to license so that we get the volume assessment. And whether or not we actually get to see the transaction from a processing point of view, all of you guys know in Europe we process about 40% of our transactions only. And lastly, in terms of what kind of services we're actually delivering to the client. When you look at the largest client, I have to believe that we have very similar pricing to Visa. It might be different in terms of when you look at the medium and then the smaller clients. Now having said that, what Javier and his team have done in a really great way is using the global capability of MasterCard, with all the products and services that we have around the globe, to be bringing that in a seamless fashion to our European clients.

I think, you remember like I said VocaLink is not about competing with Visa Europe, by the way. VocaLink is about us wanting to be real players in every aspect of electronic payments and the way they are developing. And the reality is that today, across the world, 50% of payments, not just Visa, are ACH. But within that, what's really interesting is the opportunity to grow Fast ACH. And VocaLink is one of the few players that has not only an outstanding Fast ACH platform implemented in the U.K. but also implemented in other countries, and most of ACH tends to be local. VocaLink demonstrated an ability to take that Fast ACH platform and make it globally adaptable. And you can imagine the possibilities of that over the next decade. So I really want you to think about us during the VocaLink transaction. If it all works out, once we're through all the regulatory steps, our strategic intent is to play across all aspects of these payments rails for individual consumer to merchants payments, but also B2B, P2P and government payment flows. And that's how we see our footprint going over the years."

We've been digesting the other ones in the past, and it's actually helped us build out a lot of capabilities. It's not a coincidence that our other revenue line is growing at the rate it's been growing for quite a few quarters. It's not a coincidence. And remember, after a year when you anniversary an acquisition, it comes into the base. After 2 years, the entire P&L comes into our base. So we're quite disciplined about tracking ourselves against it. Some of the acquisitions do better than what we thought we could do with them. Some of them don't do as well. That's just the reality of what we're trying to go through. But in the process, we've built out a decent capability in data analytics and information services. We've added to our capability in loyalty and rewards. We've added to our capability in technology and connectivity for e-commerce and gateways as well as the connected bank accounts around the world, even before the VocaLink acquisition. So that's kind of what we are trying to do. I honestly -- at any point of time in any quarter, I think Martina and her team are working on a number of possible acquisitions. What tends to happen is 2%, 5%, 6% of them show up at any level of second level [indiscernible]. By the time we are done, one out of many gets done. So it's tough for me to tell you that I have 2 next quarter or 3 in the fourth quarter. I'm not going to do all of that. I am just focused on, first of all, getting the ones we're already doing to keep doing well. Second, we've got to work really hard between now and the next few months to get the VocaLink acquisition through all the processes of regulatory approval and get our company to be an excellent player in the ACH and Fast ACH game, first with the responsibility to the U.K. because we are going to be a large player there in terms of this, but also with the ability to see how we take it elsewhere. Our priorities remain in the area of loyalty and rewards, in the area of data analytics and information services, in the area of safety and security. To some degree, all this depends on us being able to see more transactions. To be able to see and handle and touch more transactions. Processing assets are very helpful in that space, so we tend to play through these as we go along. And I -- honestly, I think Martina's done great working with me because she's looking at a few deals all the time. This is probably not a great sartorial comment but that's true."

And as you might remember, or during the last couple of years leading up to the changes that came in last December of 2015, we were hoping that, that would actually change the view of some of the merchants to be wanting to accept card payments because quite frankly, now card payments are heck a lot cheaper than what you have to do with cash, right? And so we are seeing fairly large-scale changes coming through with some very large merchants. So that's what we're seeing first. So for instance, a grocery store like ALDI, which is a very gruffly discount store, they don't even have shelves in their store. You grab actually goods out of the boxes that they just rip open. They're finally actually opening or have opened card payments. And there are a number of those large retailers who are now willing to do it. And we see it pretty much in every European country. Where we haven't seen yet as much movement is on the smaller merchants, and that's obviously where there's a lot of work that we still have to do. And we are hoping that, that will continue to allow us to change the secular trends in Europe, which outside of the U.K., right, in the U.K. a lot is already electronic side but in the rest of the Europe, in the continent, I always call it that this is still an emerging country for us. That will help us on the secular trend from cash and check to electronic forms of payments and will help our numbers over time."

I can tell you that I'm not clearly understanding enough about what exclusivity Visa signed with PayPal because we're not encountering any difficulty while talking to PayPal in that space. So I don't know exactly what the nature of that exclusivity is. You've got to ask PayPal or Visa because that's pretty clear that we've got enough good conversations going on not just now but for a little while. Obviously, they're stressed between these conversations, right? I mean, our digital wallet operator rules when they went into place in 2013, were not replicated by others. As well, we made our position clear at that time that we wanted to clear -- to have a clear, transparent, fair methodology in this digital wallet development. It's been sometimes good, sometimes stressful, but constructive. And my view always has been that if PayPal wants or everybody else like that, a digital wallet operator wants to use our rails of credit and debit to be able to build their own model, then they can't just use our rails when it suits them and use another rail to go around us and the banks when it suits them. There's got to be a more constructive partnership. So yes, we have a constructive partnership on co-branded cards, yes, we do. We've had it earlier. We've renewed again literally yesterday. So that tells you that, that partnership has depth beyond one signature or one contract with somebody or the other. But also -- we've all been discussing the whole aspect of how this digital wallet operator system would work. Now if PayPal's methodology of operations from what I've learned from their announcements with Visa, if they reflect what our digital wallet operator policies put into place so, yes, then any fees you make from them will go away because the fee is not meant to be there if they're doing what's in the policy. But I can tell you that, that fee is de minimis. That's not -- we were not trying to use a fee to get them to change their policy. The fee was used to manage through all the difficulties that their policies were creating in terms of data and transaction management. So let's just be clear about what this is all about. This is not about forcing them to do anything, this is about our perspective of how the marketplace should develop, transparently and openly to merchants, to consumers, to banks, to PayPal and to all of us. That's what we're trying to build. So I think it's a constructive dialogue. I think PayPal is very much a part of that dialogue. Then this could all end up in a good way for the industry as a whole, for banks as well as for networks as well as for PayPal. So will there be changes in the dynamics of the economics for a bank versus the network versus for PayPal? Everything to do with digital changes those economics. But that doesn't mean that, that is just taking out other transactions and growing in volume as well. So I have sort of generally positive view about where this is going. I'm not -- by the way, I'm not saying there aren't hurdles along the way, there aren't roadblocks along the way. Remember, we've been talking to them for 2, 3 years. We don't yet have an announcement to tell you of the kind of transaction that Visa has. So everybody has their own ways of approaching transactions, and has their own competitive dynamic and their own way of thinking about where the strategy is going. That's actually okay in an open, competitive market. It's a good thing."

Our business continues to perform well. We're very pleased with our strong results this quarter. As you could see from the release, on a currency-neutral basis and excluding the special items related to litigation, we reported both net revenue and EPS growth of 14%. Martina is going to get into the financial details, so I'm going to talk a little bit about the global economy first. And frankly, other than the Brexit vote, very little has changed since the last quarter. The United States economy is still holding steady. Consumer confidence up slightly, stable job growth, low inflation. And frankly, prior to the Brexit vote, many parts of Europe were showing steady signs of improvement in both consumer confidence and unemployment. And while it's still too early to predict the full impact of Brexit, we will obviously watch that situation very carefully. 
The outlook for Asia remains cautious. We've got a prolonged slowdown in China, weaker-than-expected recovery in Australia. India continues to be a bright spot, both consumer and business sentiment there remain strong.
In Latin America, Brazil is still in a deep recession but interestingly, a modest increase in business confidence is beginning to show signs that the economy may be reaching a bottom. 
In Venezuela, economic conditions continue to deteriorate, but Mexico is in a steady growth path. It's been driven by solid consumer spending and low unemployment. And so as a result, it's likely we're going to remain in a period of economic and political uncertainty at least in the near term. Having said all of this, our business continues to grow. Our fundamentals remain strong. We are seeing double-digit volume and transaction growth across most of our markets, and we continue to win deals by differentiating ourselves with services. 
Now I wasn't on the call last week that Martina and Tim had on VocaLink, so let me just quickly share my views about the planned acquisition of VocaLink. The deal is an important component of our strategy to participate in all forms of electronic payments and to enhance our services for the benefit of our customers and our partners. And VocaLink itself is very interesting to us for a couple of reasons. First, when you look at all payment flows in the world's top 50 countries, and this is not just retail payments, ACH represents about 50% of that total. And the potential of Fast ACH is growing, especially given that it is being promoted by a number of regulatory bodies in Europe, the United States and in other parts of the world. 
Second, we believe that VocaLink is the best asset in this space from both a technology standpoint as well as having a very talented group of people who are respected across the industry. Beyond the opportunities available in that primary U.K. market, they have been successful in operating and licensing their Fast ACH technology in other markets: in Sweden, in Singapore and Thailand. They're also the primary supplier of Fast ACH technology to the clearing house in the United States. 
And finally, the ability to see both card and ACH transactions would enable us to offer an even broader range of data analytics and other services through our partners. Our card network has been powering our growth in both consumer and commercial payment for many years. And with this acquisition, we will now have a new set of capabilities to capture additional opportunities in B2B, in P2P and government payment flows regardless of what payment rail they use. So that's VocaLink. 
Let me move on to a brief update on China. In June, the People's Bank of China released the final regulation to foreign card networks to operate domestically in China. We are currently working through the requirements. We need a much better understanding around their national security and cybersecurity standards before we determine how best to proceed. We've got to weigh whether we can apply for license alone or with a business partner. It's all connected to this deeper understanding. Meanwhile, what we are doing is we're continuing to work on building out our technology on the ground as well as working with our Chinese customers on new issuance and broadening acceptance. 
So moving on from there, a couple of recent developments on the legal front. In the United States, the Brooklyn District Court's 2013 approval of the U.S. merchant class action settlement, as you know, was overturned by the Court of Appeals in late June. And obviously, we're disappointed by that decision. Charlie and Visa revealed it in some detail on their earnings call last week. So I won't rehash the same details. The case will be sent back to a District Court. There we expect the first order of business will be to appoint counsel to the injunctive release class. MasterCard will then work with all parties to see if they can find ways to reform the settlement in line with the Court of Appeals decision. And as you'd expect, our forecast on that work will be on rule changes and the scope of the release, which were the issues in the Court of Appeals decision, not the money damages. 
On the money damages, note that our financial exposure remains capped at 12% of any settlement or judgment under the agreements we entered into with the bank defendant and with Visa in 2011. 
Additionally, in July, a U.K. court issued a decision in one of the U.K. merchant suits seeking interchange damages. That court awarded Sainsbury's a portion of the damages that they'd been seeking. And that amount, along with anticipated legal fees and costs, was taken as a charge in the second quarter. That's the special item you see in our results. Although we don't believe the retailer suffered any damages, we're gratified by several aspects of the court's decision. Just one example, the court recognized that an appropriate level of domestic interchange is substantially higher than the 20 and 30 basis points imposed by the European interchange fee regulation that went into effect last December. 
So now let's move on to some of our recent business activity. And during the quarter, as been normal, we find a number of new deals and renewals supporting the expansion of our business around the world. I'm going to run through a few examples. We continue to make progress in our U.S. consumer business. Recent highlights include the renewal of our partnership with Huntington National Bank across their debit, credit and commercial businesses, expanded acquisitions of new consumer credit accounts with several of the largest banks in the market. In addition, we had important wins in the co-brand space, including American Airlines, the Citi and Barclaycard, with both JV assured [ph] as well as Intercontinental Hotels, Bed Bath & Beyond and some others. 
We also renewed, just announced it yesterday actually, our consumer credit co-brand with PayPal, an important complement of our overall relationship with them, which as you heard from Dan Schulman on his call, we're all actively seeking to expand.
We continue to drive our commercial business forward. One of the most important verticals for us is travel. And now in addition to our relationship with eNett and Travelport that we've talked of in previous calls, we just signed a new global deal with Amadeus, a leading travel technology company. Today, travel agencies make more than $300 billion in the annual payments to airlines, hotels and other travel providers, largely via bank transfers and checks. What this agreement does is it combines Amadeus' new B2B wallet and virtual payment technology with MasterCard's commercial card capabilities. We will provide travel agencies and travel providers with a fast, secure and automated way to pay and get paid. 
We continue to perform well outside of the U.S. In Canada, we signed 2 new issuer deals, renewed 4 issuer and co-brand deals, including: NBNA, which is a division now of the Toronto Dominion Bank; and President's Choice Financial, which is part of Loblaw, one of the largest retailers in Canada, which, by the way, included exclusive issuance. 
In Europe, we are pleased to sign an expanded agreement with Yapi Kredi, one of the market leaders in Turkey, for a larger portion of their credit portfolio. Prior to this deal, most of their credit business was with a competitor. 
In addition to the deals I mentioned previously, we're continuing our momentum in the co-brand space globally. We are very excited. We renewed our partnership with Walmart in Canada and also signed a new agreement with them in China. 
We have partnered with Access Bank in India as well as Miles & More, one of the largest global frequent flyer and rewards programs, to launch India's first multicurrency, co-branded, prepaid card that supports up to 17 currencies to facilitate both domestic and international card usage. 
Finally, you've heard us say many times how we've been successful with using services as a key strategic differentiator for winning deals. As one example of this, we're happy to have renewed a long-term debit agreement with Bendigo and Adelaide Bank, one of Australia's largest retail banks, includes commercial cards and a flip of the majority of their consumer credit business. That deal includes a full complement of our services, consisting of advisers, loyalty solutions and our suite of safety and security products. We signed a deal with CartaSi, one of the largest card issuers in Italy, to begin issuing debit cards as well as to use advisers' consulting services. You'll hear a lot more from us about how we're differentiating with services at our upcoming Investor Day in September. 
So moving on to our digital strategy. You know we've long said this is a marathon, not a sprint. But we've made some significant progress this past quarter and there's more to come. So about 2 weeks ago, we announced some important industry milestone when we became the first network to deliver a digital payment service across all devices, all channels. With MasterPass, consumers can now decide how and where they prefer to shop, whether that's in app, online or in store using a bank-branded offering from the issuer of their choice, knowing that their payment information is protected by our technology. 
We've also previously talked about our digital by default strategy, which enables issuers to auto-enroll cardholders on to the MasterPass service through their online banking app without any additional effort by the consumer. We're very pleased that more than 18 million accounts will be automatically enabled by the end of this year. 18 million, as the services began to roll out globally, starting with Europe and Asia and later this year in the United States, the Bank of America with Citibank and Capital One. 
Further, issuers can use MasterPass to differentiate their own wallet offering by using our open APIs to integrate other services from us, such as purchase alerts or paying with points or services that they have developed themselves. 
And lastly, in terms of geography, including the recent expansions to Greece, Switzerland, Colombia and Ukraine, we are now live in 33 markets. 
From an acceptance standpoint, MasterPass is currently available at hundreds of thousands of merchants online and in-app. We are pleased to have recently added IKEA. We'll soon be adding Saks, Lord and Taylor and The Cheesecake Factory as more examples. With the introduction of NFC capability, consumers will now be able to use MasterPass at the more than 5 million merchant locations in 77 countries that accept contactless payments today. Contactless will first be available to Android device owners in the United States later this month, with a global expansion to follow shortly thereafter. 
Last topic is tokenization technology, the MasterCard Digital Enablement service, or MDES. We continue to make solid progress and are making transactions more secure for MasterPass, which by the way, is already enabled for contactless transactions with online and in-app to follow but also for our digital partners. 
Most recently, we helped Android Pay expand to Singapore as well as Apple Pay to move into Canada, Hong Kong, Switzerland and France. In addition, we're also pleased to be partnering with Microsoft on the launch of their cloud-based mobile wallet solution for Windows 10 compatible devices. All these examples illustrate our continued commitment to deliver secure consumer payment experience to our cardholders using the mobile device of their choice. 
So with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Martina for an update on our financial results and operational metrics. Martina?"
6477196,369244781,2206984,"MasterCard Incorporated, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Mastercard Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Ajay, and good morning, everyone. So let me begin by giving you some highlights on the second quarter, starting with Page 3, where you see the difference between non-GAAP reported and currency-neutral growth rates for this quarter. So these figure",1422,"Thanks, Ajay, and good morning, everyone. So let me begin by giving you some highlights on the second quarter, starting with Page 3, where you see the difference between non-GAAP reported and currency-neutral growth rates for this quarter. So these figures exclude the impact of the special items taken in both this quarter and the previous quarter related to the judgment issued on Sainsbury's and the settlement we made with Tesco, the 2 largest merchants involved in the U.K. merchant litigation. I'd like to point out a few items using the currency-neutral growth rate. 
As Ajay said, net revenue growth was 14% for the quarter, coming in a bit higher than our expectations. Operating expenses grew 13%, primarily due to continued investments to support our strategic initiatives as well as higher legal costs, of which the majority are not likely to recur. We saw a higher tax rate than the year ago -- in the year-ago quarter due to the non-recurrence of a discrete U.S. foreign tax credit from which we benefited in the second quarter of 2015. 
And with all that, EPS was $0.96, up 14% year-over-year. Share repurchases contributed about $0.03 per share. And as of July 21, we have $2.7 billion remaining under our current authorization. And lastly, cash flow from operations was $1.1 billion, and we ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and other liquid investments of about $6.4 billion. 
So let's turn to Page 4, where you can see the operational metrics for the second quarter. When comparing these numbers to the last quarter, just remember, the first quarter saw about a 1 ppt benefit from leap day, which explains most of the differences. Our worldwide gross dollar volume, or GDV, growth was 11% on a local currency basis, down 2 ppt from last quarter. 
Overall, our U.S. GDV grew 8%, made up of credit and debit growth of 7% and 8%, respectively. Total U.S. GDV had less than 1 ppt headwind from lower gas prices. 
Now outside of the U.S., volume growth was 13% on a local currency basis, and that's about down 2 ppt versus last quarter, with low to mid-teens growth in each region. 
And beginning on June 9, as a result of the new EU regulation, our volume numbers reflect the absence of domestic co-badge volume that we do not process, particularly in France. In the second quarter, we saw an impact of 1 ppt on worldwide volume growth and a 3 ppt impact to European volume growth. The impact will become more pronounced over the next year, and this has been contemplated in all of our forward guidance. 
Cross-border volume grew 10% on a local currency basis, slightly lower than the 12% we saw in the first quarter. 
Let me turn to Page 5. And here, you can see processed transactions grew 14% globally to $13.7 billion. That's a very similar increase from what we saw in the first quarter. And globally, the number of cards grew 7%, with 2.3 billion MasterCard and Maestro-branded cards issued. 
On Page 6. Here you see some highlights on a few of the detailed revenue line items. Unless otherwise stated, the growth numbers I call out both here and on the next slide are all on a currency-neutral basis. So as I said, net revenue growth was 14%, a bit stronger than we expected. We saw continued strong volume and transaction growth, plus a higher contribution from some of our services businesses. Rebates and incentives grew 23%, primarily due to higher volumes as well as some deal renewals. 
Looking strictly at the individual revenue line items. Domestic assessments grew 10%, while worldwide GDV grew by 11%. And the difference is primarily due to mix. Cross-border volume fees grew 14%, while cross-border volume grew 10%. The 4 ppt gap is due to a number of pricing actions, partially offset by a higher mix of intra-Europe activity. Transaction processing fees grew 21%, primarily driven by the 14% growth in processed transactions as well as some pricing. And finally, other revenue grew 25%, driven primarily by services such as advisers, APT and our safety and security product offerings. 
Moving now to Page 7. Here, you can see the total operating expenses after excluding special items increased 12% in the quarter or 13% on a currency-neutral basis. Our APT acquisition contributed about 1 ppt to these growth rates. In addition, 5 ppt was due to higher legal costs. As I already said, the majority of these aren't likely to recur. So the remaining 7 ppt was primarily due to higher personnel costs related to our continued investments in strategic areas such as digital, data analytics and geographic expansion. Also, our data processing expense growth is normally in line with transaction growth. However, this past quarter, the growth was higher due to the fee we now pay to NSP Cards for processing domestic Russian transactions. 
Let me turn to Slide 8. And here, we can discuss what we have seen in July through the 21, where most of our drivers are up from the second quarter. The numbers through July 21 are as follows. Starting with processed volume, we saw global growth of 11%, slightly lower than the 12% we saw in the second quarter. In the U.S., our process volume grew 8%, down 1 ppt from the second quarter, with slower growth in credit but higher growth in debit. GAAP had less than a 1 ppt negative impact on our July growth. That's very similar to the second quarter. And processed volume outside of the U.S. grew 15%, up a bit from the second quarter, primarily driven by Europe and Latin America. Globally, processed transactions growth was 17%, up 3 ppt from what we saw in the second quarter. Processed transaction growth outside the U.S. was up 1 ppt, with increases in Europe and Latin America. And the U.S. growth was up 6 ppt, driven by new opportunities of PIN routing. 
With respect to cross-border -- across border, our volumes actually grew 14% globally, and that's up 4 ppt from last quarter with faster growth in Europe. We also saw faster growth in Middle East and Africa, which was likely related to the timing of Ramadan. 
So now looking to the full year of 2016, there's really no change in our business outlook from what we discussed with you in our earnings back in April. Currently, we don't anticipate any significant impact from Brexit this year. However, foreign exchange headwinds will continue to be with us in 2016, although they continue to moderate from the recent past given current FX rates. 
Our underlying business fundamentals remain strong, and we will continue to run the company for growth, both on the top and bottom line as well as balancing our investments with astute expense management. 
As we look at full year 2016 and after factoring in our currency-neutral methodology, we continue to expect to be at the low end of our 3-year revenue growth range. When you model on an as-reported basis, you will need to adjust for the impact of all currencies. And at current rates, we estimate that, that would mean about a 2 ppt headwind to net revenue growth and the bottom line, which is less of a headwind than what we said on our April earnings call. 
Now let me call out a few other items that you should consider when modeling 2016. For rebates and incentives, we now expect to see growth of about the same as the 20% as-reported growth rate we saw in 2015 after factoring in the impact of the new American Airlines co-brand renewal. On expenses, we continue to expect total operating expense growth in the high single-digit range for our as-reported results, excluding special items. On a currency-neutral basis, we continue to expect low double-digit growth. Be mindful that we're ramping up our efforts on MasterPass, which impacts G&A and A&M, particularly in the third quarter. You should now assume a tax rate of slightly less than 29% for 2016. 
And finally, on the subject of share repurchases. Now while year-to-date, we have bought back about $1.8 billion, most of that occurred earlier in the year, as we were out of the market for most of the second quarter given the pending VocaLink transaction. As I said last week, once our trading window opens in early August, we expect to continue our repurchasing activity. 
So now let me turn the call back to Barbara to begin the Q&A session. Barbara?"

The second one is the most transactional question, and I can tell you that places like Turkey and other such locations, there's no doubt that the impact of some of this activity and terrorism does impact what's going on there. Our cross-border growth to Turkey is down significantly compared to last year. Cardholders from Germany, Russia, Sweden and the U.S. are not traveling there with the same level of frequency as they were, clearly. We're also closely watching travel to other markets, France and so on. Interestingly, in the U.K., there's actually an increase of inbound cross-border expense. So it's kind of bouncing around but specifically in a couple of countries impacted by terrorism. There's no doubt that it causes some angst in cross-border travel. Having said that, remember what Martina said. Right now, our cross-border volumes for the first few weeks of this quarter, so only a few weeks, are up compared to where we were last quarter. And in fact, Europe is one of the contributors to that being up. So about Visa and PayPal. I've said this a few times to a number of you when I met you. Back in June of 2013, we had implemented a new approach to digital wallet operators that apply to all staged wallets. And by the way, not just PayPal. So I want you to understand that. With the intent of bringing consistency and transparency to the system, transactions should flow through with clear data flowing through, the brand of the bank and the network should be visible to the consumer and the merchant. There are many reasons for us to be thoughtful about that digital wallet operator principles. We're still exactly where we are with those principles, and I think what I'm really pleased to see through a constructive dialogue with Dan Schulman and his management team at PayPal, that PayPal is actually working to resolve some of those concerns we all have around the lack of transparency, around these stage wallets as well as ACH clearing. And that's what you saw in the announcement that he and Charlie made a few days ago. And if you heard Dan mention in his earnings call, they're in discussions with others in the payment space to work with similar concepts or somewhat different but in the same space. We have worked with PayPal for many years. We have good working relationship with them and a wide range of opportunities. I just told you we just renewed our credit co-brand portfolio with them, in fact, yesterday. And so that gives you a sense of the -- of the manner in which PayPal is trying to work with the industry. I think this is actually a good thing for PayPal and for the industry because at the end of the day, providing consumers the ability of having seamless simple ways of paying is good for all of us. Everything is better than having to use cash and that's where we're headed."

The little challenges of the new national security and cybersecurity policy has not yet actually been passed into a form that is visible to us in a document where we can say, ""Okay, got it. Got it. Got it. Do this, do that. We're okay."" It's not in that form. So we're in a little bit of an in between territory, between understanding that they want to have a thoughtful national security and cybersecurity policy, which they're entitled to. But we don't understand the implications for us in terms of operating a network on the ground. So whether we operate with our own license or we operate with a JV with somebody else or we do some other creative thinking around this, will all depend on clarity of these kinds of elements that they put into the policy they've recently announced. That's what we're trying to sort out. Meanwhile, there's a lot of stuff to do for us in China. We're continuing work on issuance, continuing work on building out acceptance or we've been continuing some work on basic technology development, so that when we get clarity of this, and Martina and I are confident we understand what we are signing up for, then we can move forward relatively quickly from that space.

And as I think I've told you a couple of calls ago, maybe a few before that, this stuff will move around a little bit and bounce around as merchants move the different routing in their routing tables, depending on what's working for them. And it's not just about pricing. It's also about speed of approval. It's about many different things that they look at. Most of the bigger merchants have a very sophisticated and quite thoughtful way of deciding their routing tables. And we keep working with them.

What I've been telling folks is it's actually not that different if you get down to the bank level, you're actually closer to apples-to-apples on a pricing basis. But maybe just give us some of your thoughts on that current dynamic and how it might change with Visa Europe now being part of Visa.

It's not quite at the level where our global pricing is. It's lower because as you know, in every geography and in the country, it depends in terms of whether we just were to be able to license so that we get the volume assessment. And whether or not we actually get to see the transaction from a processing point of view, all of you guys know in Europe we process about 40% of our transactions only. And lastly, in terms of what kind of services we're actually delivering to the client. When you look at the largest client, I have to believe that we have very similar pricing to Visa. It might be different in terms of when you look at the medium and then the smaller clients. Now having said that, what Javier and his team have done in a really great way is using the global capability of MasterCard, with all the products and services that we have around the globe, to be bringing that in a seamless fashion to our European clients. And that's what they really like to see, right. And this is what -- did not happen with our competitor given that they were 2 different companies. And given that we are generally the smaller company, I always have to say that we have to put more points on the board. That means we have to rise higher in order to make sure that the customer gets that differentiated product and service that they're seeking in order to basically address their pain points and have fantastic products for their consumers.

I think, you remember like I said VocaLink is not about competing with Visa Europe, by the way. VocaLink is about us wanting to be real players in every aspect of electronic payments and the way they are developing. And the reality is that today, across the world, 50% of payments, not just Visa, are ACH. But within that, what's really interesting is the opportunity to grow Fast ACH. And VocaLink is one of the few players that has not only an outstanding Fast ACH platform implemented in the U.K. but also implemented in other countries, and most of ACH tends to be local. VocaLink demonstrated an ability to take that Fast ACH platform and make it globally adaptable. And you can imagine the possibilities of that over the next decade. So I really want you to think about us during the VocaLink transaction. If it all works out, once we're through all the regulatory steps, our strategic intent is to play across all aspects of these payments rails for individual consumer to merchants payments, but also B2B, P2P and government payment flows.

It's not a coincidence that our other revenue line is growing at the rate it's been growing for quite a few quarters. It's not a coincidence. And remember, after a year when you anniversary an acquisition, it comes into the base. After 2 years, the entire P&L comes into our base. So we're quite disciplined about tracking ourselves against it. Some of the acquisitions do better than what we thought we could do with them. Some of them don't do as well. That's just the reality of what we're trying to go through. But in the process, we've built out a decent capability in data analytics and information services. We've added to our capability in loyalty and rewards. We've added to our capability in technology and connectivity for e-commerce and gateways as well as the connected bank accounts around the world, even before the VocaLink acquisition. So that's kind of what we are trying to do. I honestly -- at any point of time in any quarter, I think Martina and her team are working on a number of possible acquisitions. What tends to happen is 2%, 5%, 6% of them show up at any level of second level [indiscernible]. By the time we are done, one out of many gets done. So it's tough for me to tell you that I have 2 next quarter or 3 in the fourth quarter. I'm not going to do all of that. I am just focused on, first of all, getting the ones we're already doing to keep doing well. Second, we've got to work really hard between now and the next few months to get the VocaLink acquisition through all the processes of regulatory approval and get our company to be an excellent player in the ACH and Fast ACH game, first with the responsibility to the U.K. because we are going to be a large player there in terms of this, but also with the ability to see how we take it elsewhere. Our priorities remain in the area of loyalty and rewards, in the area of data analytics and information services, in the area of safety and security. To some degree, all this depends on us being able to see more transactions. To be able to see and handle and touch more transactions. Processing assets are very helpful in that space, so we tend to play through these as we go along. And I -- honestly, I think Martina's done great working with me because she's looking at a few deals all the time. This is probably not a great sartorial comment but that's true."

And as you might remember, or during the last couple of years leading up to the changes that came in last December of 2015, we were hoping that, that would actually change the view of some of the merchants to be wanting to accept card payments because quite frankly, now card payments are heck a lot cheaper than what you have to do with cash, right? And so we are seeing fairly large-scale changes coming through with some very large merchants. So that's what we're seeing first. So for instance, a grocery store like ALDI, which is a very gruffly discount store, they don't even have shelves in their store. You grab actually goods out of the boxes that they just rip open. They're finally actually opening or have opened card payments. And there are a number of those large retailers who are now willing to do it. And we see it pretty much in every European country. Where we haven't seen yet as much movement is on the smaller merchants, and that's obviously where there's a lot of work that we still have to do. And we are hoping that, that will continue to allow us to change the secular trends in Europe, which outside of the U.K., right, in the U.K. a lot is already electronic side but in the rest of the Europe, in the continent, I always call it that this is still an emerging country for us.

And then secondly, does the tone of the discussions that are taking place around you lead you to think that it's not just you guys and Visa, but perhaps your issuing bank partners that may get on board with promoting PayPal? And then finally, along those lines, can you help us think through what exclusivity element of the Visa agreement with PayPal would mean for MasterCard's issuing banks?"

I can tell you that I'm not clearly understanding enough about what exclusivity Visa signed with PayPal because we're not encountering any difficulty while talking to PayPal in that space. So I don't know exactly what the nature of",618,"So the last one first. I can tell you that I'm not clearly understanding enough about what exclusivity Visa signed with PayPal because we're not encountering any difficulty while talking to PayPal in that space. So I don't know exactly what the nature of that exclusivity is. You've got to ask PayPal or Visa because that's pretty clear that we've got enough good conversations going on not just now but for a little while. Obviously, they're stressed between these conversations, right? I mean, our digital wallet operator rules when they went into place in 2013, were not replicated by others. As well, we made our position clear at that time that we wanted to clear -- to have a clear, transparent, fair methodology in this digital wallet development. It's been sometimes good, sometimes stressful, but constructive. And my view always has been that if PayPal wants or everybody else like that, a digital wallet operator wants to use our rails of credit and debit to be able to build their own model, then they can't just use our rails when it suits them and use another rail to go around us and the banks when it suits them. There's got to be a more constructive partnership. So yes, we have a constructive partnership on co-branded cards, yes, we do. We've had it earlier. We've renewed again literally yesterday. So that tells you that, that partnership has depth beyond one signature or one contract with somebody or the other. But also -- we've all been discussing the whole aspect of how this digital wallet operator system would work. Now if PayPal's methodology of operations from what I've learned from their announcements with Visa, if they reflect what our digital wallet operator policies put into place so, yes, then any fees you make from them will go away because the fee is not meant to be there if they're doing what's in the policy. But I can tell you that, that fee is de minimis. That's not -- we were not trying to use a fee to get them to change their policy. The fee was used to manage through all the difficulties that their policies were creating in terms of data and transaction management. So let's just be clear about what this is all about. This is not about forcing them to do anything, this is about our perspective of how the marketplace should develop, transparently and openly to merchants, to consumers, to banks, to PayPal and to all of us. That's what we're trying to build. So I think it's a constructive dialogue. I think PayPal is very much a part of that dialogue. Then this could all end up in a good way for the industry as a whole, for banks as well as for networks as well as for PayPal. So will there be changes in the dynamics of the economics for a bank versus the network versus for PayPal? Everything to do with digital changes those economics. But that doesn't mean that, that is just taking out other transactions and growing in volume as well. So I have sort of generally positive view about where this is going. I'm not -- by the way, I'm not saying there aren't hurdles along the way, there aren't roadblocks along the way. Remember, we've been talking to them for 2, 3 years. We don't yet have an announcement to tell you of the kind of transaction that Visa has. So everybody has their own ways of approaching transactions, and has their own competitive dynamic and their own way of thinking about where the strategy is going. That's actually okay in an open, competitive market. It's a good thing."

Or can they just start passing through the transaction data and hence, avoid the staged wallet fee? And then, I guess, more importantly as we look at the case with the merchants and the like, your prepared comments seem to indicate that you wanted to pursue an adjusted settlement, et cetera. I'm just wondering if there would be perhaps any benefit to MasterCard to open up the discussions with those groups more widely. So perhaps we could address some of the issues that may be evolving out of EMV, et cetera. Or if you would prefer to keep those 2 cases separate, if you will."

So the second question, honestly, litigation is complicated enough without trying to broaden things. When you already have an agreement between tons of banks, Visa, MasterCard, tons of people at the other end, it doesn't pay to start broadening things. Who knows how this will go. I can't predict because there's other players who all have to come to an agreement. But we'll see. We -- I think we made real progress and we had a -- actually a good deal on the ground which a previous judge had signed off on. But you know what, courts decide what they do and while we could be disappointed, we've got to abide by it. So we're going to find our way through that working with other folks. I don't think I can tell you which way that'll get resolved. I wouldn't even like to speculate on that. The part about PayPal, I want to make sure you guys don't get focused on some staged wallet fee because that's actually not what this is about. The fee is de minimis. This is not a large fee either for us or for PayPal, by the way. That's not what this is about. It's about a set of rules and policies around what the digital wallet operator rules are. That's what this is. And could PayPal comply with those rules without some master agreement to this? Yes, they could. But we already have an agreements with them on a number of things. And they're the only digital wallet operator out there who wants to work closer with banks and networks and merchants. My view of this is if we can collaborate together, if we can make this easier for a consumer in the process and for a merchant in the process, that's a good thing. We should be doing it."

The documents have also been attached to an 8-K that we filed with the SEC earlier this morning. A replay of this call will be posted on our website for 1 month.
Before we get started, I'd like to point out a change we have made around reporting the impact of currency on our business. As Martina mentioned on our last earnings call, we realized it has become more difficult for many of you to model our business as FX rates continue to move around. Therefore, beginning this quarter, instead of reporting FX-adjusted growth rates, which only reflected the translational impact of 2 functional currencies, the euro and the Brazilian real, we are now reporting currency-neutral growth rates, which include both the impact from translating functional currencies into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes as well as the underlying impact of local currencies being converted into their functional currency. 
Finally, as set forth in more detail in today's earnings release, I need to remind everyone that today's call may include some forward-looking statements about MasterCard's future performance. Actual performance could differ materially from what is suggested by our comments today. Information about the factors that could affect future performance are summarized at the end of our press release as well as contained in our recent SEC filings.
And now with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ajay."
6477196,329405740,2207035,"MasterCard Incorporated, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Mastercard Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Barbara. Good morning, everybody. We're very pleased to deliver solid results this quarter and despite what I think everybody would agree is an ongoing mixed global economic environment. On a currency-neutral basis, we reported net revenue grow",2321,"Thank you, Barbara. Good morning, everybody. We're very pleased to deliver solid results this quarter and despite what I think everybody would agree is an ongoing mixed global economic environment. On a currency-neutral basis, we reported net revenue growth of 14% and an EPS growth of 1%. But when you remove the impact of the nonrecurring discrete tax credit and the balance sheet remeasurement related to Venezuela in last year's first quarter, our EPS growth is 12%. 
So now let's take a look at the global economy. I think it's largely unchanged from what we discussed last quarter, with the U.S. economy remaining solid with inflation and wages growing at a similar pace and the unemployment rate kind of holding steady at 5%. We just saw the unemployment rate numbers coming out this morning as well. However, as we know from the Fed comments yesterday, uncertainty remains about when they might take action as well as the potential impact from the global economy. 
So with the rest of the world, the economic outlook continues to be mixed. In Europe, both consumer confidence and economic sentiment declined slightly this quarter. However, recent stimulus measures by the European Central Bank and steady improvement in the unemployment rate, I think, should continue to drive growth across the region, particularly in the U.K. and Germany. 
Asia is still challenged by the continued slowdown in China. Consumer confidence remains cloudy, with the exception being India, where both consumer and business sentiment remain high. 
In Latin America, Brazil is still in the worst recession in the country's history. And of course, economic conditions in Venezuela are deteriorating further. But Mexico is stable and seems to be driven by solid consumer spending and declining inflation. 
So none of this surprises us, but it does seem that we're likely to remain in a period of economic uncertainty. And so that said, we've continued to work hard to ensure that our business maintains its strong growth trajectory and we're seeing double-digit volume and transaction growth across most of our markets. In addition, we're benefiting from the successful integration of our recent acquisitions and continuing to grow our services business. As I told Barbara yesterday, at this time, steady as she goes is what our focus is. 
So now let's move on to some of our recent business activity. During the quarter, we signed a number of new deals and renewals supporting the expansion of our business around the world. I want to give you a few examples. In Europe, we extended our contract in Nordea, which is the largest bank in the Nordics, for their consumer credit and their commercial card portfolios. And we added the rollout of MasterPass and inControl with them. Same in Europe, we also renewed and extended our contract with DSGV, the largest banking group in Martina's home country of Germany, for their credit business. We also included the rollout of MasterPass. Further, we added a new debit portfolio with UniCredit, a leading European financial group based in Italy. In Asia, we just recently renewed and expanded our contracts with both Mitsubishi UFJ NICOS, which is one of the largest issuers in the region, for their consumer and their commercial credit business; and with Maybank, the largest bank in Malaysia, for their credit and debit business. 
And finally, I want to talk a little bit of an example of working with a number of our merchant partners. And I'm going to give you a specific example. This one is of McDonald's. We've talked in previous calls of a partnership with them in the Middle East, now in South Africa as well. The McDonald's are leveraging MasterPass to simplify the ordering process as well as utilizing contactless functionality at their restaurants. Of course, the idea is to improve the drive-through and the dining experience. 
But our McDonald's partnership actually has now gone beyond the core business. They're also a customer of Applied Predictive Technologies, or APT, the cloud-based data and analytics company that we acquired last May. McDonald's used APT's software to analyze a variety of strategic initiatives, including new food and menu items, determining which items should be on the menu and other business priorities. And this is one of the many examples of value we can provide to our merchant partners when you combine products that we have with the data analytics that we're capable of analyzing with them. 
So next, I'd like to give you an update on how we're advancing our strategy in the digital payment space. And I'm going to start with MasterPass. So remember, we're in a marathon here, and we're making great progress with our digital-by-default strategy. That's about enabling issuers to auto-enroll cardholders onto the MasterPass platform without any additional effort having to be made by the consumer. We're looking forward to announcing some bank partners who will be leveraging this ability in the near future. And as we continue to drive new acceptance for MasterPass as well, we're closing in on signing up about 270,000 merchants, representing more than $160 billion in addressable volume. 
Earlier this month, Vodafone Egypt migrated nearly 2 million Vodafone cash wallets from their closed-loop system to our mobile payment gateway platform. That enables us to process all of their transactions. This migration builds on our goal of creating an interoperable network across the Egyptian mobile payment ecosystem that I've spoken to in earlier call and helps to drive our strategy of financial inclusion and, of course, accelerate the conversion of cash. 
And then moving on to MasterCard Digital Enablement Service or MDES. We continue to make significant progress around making digital transaction more secure via encryption and tokenization. In Asia, we are pleased to now have more than 30 issuers signed up for the MDES service. We've also launched the first NFC-based wallet in Latin America with Citi/Banamex in Mexico, utilizing our cloud-based payment technology. And by the way, this wallet, the Citi/Banamex one, was created by developers from our C-SAM acquisition, which actually gave us access to a very talented pool of engineers, who are enabling us to build out capabilities for issuers and merchants exactly like the example of Citi/Banamex. 
And finally, we continue to support our digital partners by helping Android Pay launch in the U.K. and both Samsung Pay and Apple Pay are expanding to Singapore. We're also pleased to be partnering with Facebook as they leverage MDES to test tokenization by enabling pilot participants to interact with sellers and advertisers directly on the platform to complete their purchases, all without ever having to leave the Facebook app. 
So moving on to safety and security. You know there's a lot of effort from us and others going into the space. And as a result of successful biometric trials in the Netherlands and the U.S., that we announced last August, we're actually launching MasterCard Identity Check, fondly referred to as Selfie Pay, in the U.S., Canada and parts of Europe this summer, with more countries to be announced soon. Much of the initial interest in Identity Check has come -- had been attached to the consumer side of these businesses. But interestingly, we were actually currently working with BMO Financial Group, that's the Bank of Montreal in Canada, to roll out the first corporate credit card program using Selfie Pay in both the U.S. and Canada. 
In addition, we recently launched IQ series. That's a suite of products which uses real-time intelligence to empower issuers to make more informed fraud management decisions as well as, most importantly, potentially decrease the growing problem of false declines. Industry studies are showing that 1 out of every 6 cardholders have experienced at least 1 decline because of suspected fraud in the past year. That, by the way, adds up to false declines of $118 billion a year or several times the actual amount of true card fraud. 
Next, we worked with our issuers to deliver additional benefits to our cardholders and helped protect them even more from fraud. As of 2 weeks ago, all MasterCard consumer and small business cardholders are now covered by the industry's first global around-the-world 0 liability promise, ensuring they're not responsible for any unauthorized charges. 
And while on the topic of safety and security, let's spend a minute on the status of EMV in the U.S. We now have about 67% of our consumer credit cards and 24% for our consumer debit cards with chips in them. Roughly 1.2 million U.S. merchant locations are now accepting these cards. And while that's good progress that we're seeing across the industry and also in our own numbers, I mean, everybody recognizes that checkout times at the terminal may appear longer when using a chip card. And to help address that concern, we announced M/Chip Fast, which is to help speed EMV transactions. You leverage the capabilities of our existing contactless technology, which as you know, has been deployed in various transits and other applications around the world. Using that, cardholders will experience magstripe transaction speed, but with the added security of EMV and chip. At the same time, we're going to make this happen in collaboration with the industry, including other networks, to look at how to bring a consistent approach to the market and best support the EMV checkout experience. 
And the point of all these examples is that people shop on all sorts of devices and through multiple channels. And they expect technology to simplify that process while keeping the transaction safe and secure. And I give you all these examples to demonstrate and reinforce our commitment to protecting every transaction. Doesn't matter whether it took place in the physical world or the digital world. We are committed to doing this.
So for the last several minutes talking to you on how we've grown our business through a series of organic investments. And it's important to recognize we've also been growing our business by integrating the various acquisitions we made over the past few years, trying to expand our presence across the payment value chain. So let me give you a couple of examples across information services and processing. 
So let's start by information services, that business within advisers. I mentioned APT earlier when I talked about McDonald's. One of the great things about that subscription-based business model is that it generates a recurring revenue stream with an average contract length of about 3 years. And since the acquisition, we've integrated the sales and product organizations of APT with advisers to drive some pretty good benefits. Let me give you an example. 
Since their acquisition, 30 organizations have subscribed to the APT platform in long-term contracts. And in addition to McDonald's that I talked about, I'll give you a few more: Asahi Breweries in Japan; Sunoco in the U.S.; and in the U.K., KFC. We've also signed more than 15 new deals incremental to APT's earlier business-as-usual efforts, in other words, using MasterCard's client relationships and coverage, including, by the way, one of the largest airlines in Europe, one of the largest retailers in Brazil, 2 of the largest financial institutions in Asia and several in the U.S. What's exciting about all these deals is that they include expanding relationships with long-time APT clients, who now also license newly created product modules, leveraging insights derived from MasterCard data. 
Then finally we launched APT Engage, which is a suite of products which leverages aggregated and anonymized MasterCard payment transaction data combined with APT's proprietary analytics, to help issuers and merchants better understand customer spending behavior, which products have higher loyalty as well as planning for new retail locations. That's about information services.
On to processing. The idea there being to extend our capabilities beyond switching, getting beyond authorizing, clearing and settlement. So in our Payment Transaction Services business, we signed a deal with BNP Paribas in Poland to provide issuer processing services, which, by the way, has also enabled us to become one of the major third-party processors in the country. Here in the U.S., our year-old partnership with Green Dot to process all of their debit and prepaid cards has resulted in the successful migration of now approximately 50 million account files with another 50 million to arc over the balance of 2016. And lastly, in the same business, we enabled several transit operators in Turkey to begin using NFC capability by processing contactless cards and thereby, allowing us to increase our share of domestic processed transactions. 
Staying with processing, on the Prepaid Management Services side, we've just implemented a card program with British Airways to facilitate compensation payments to BA passengers for delayed or canceled flights or lost luggage. We've also launched the first dual-purpose travel insurance and multicurrency prepaid travel product with Flight Centre, which is one of the world's largest travel agencies. 
And lastly, as a result of integrating our acquired assets into our Payment Gateway Services business, we're now able to offer products globally, which include integrated fraud and risk management solutions to both merchants and to acquirers. We're already seeing several new wins, including 4 new deals with key acquirers and resellers in Australia, India, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, who can now offer these capabilities to their merchant base and in turn, that kind of helps us expand our footprint in these markets. We've also worked to ensure that our payment gateway provides acceptance of the latest digital payment methods. We now support both Apple Pay and Android Pay in addition to MasterPass. 
We all recognize these acquisitions require a certain amount of time, investment and resources to integrate. We've worked very hard to ensure this happens seamlessly and efficiently. We're now clearly seeing the benefits that come from them, both in our dialogue and in our engagement with our customers. 
So with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Martina for an update on our financial results and operational metrics. Martina?"
6477196,329405740,2207035,"MasterCard Incorporated, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Mastercard Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Ajay, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by giving you some highlights on the first quarter, starting with Page 3, where you see the difference between as-reported and currency-neutral growth rates for this quarter. As Barbara explained at t",1522,"Thanks, Ajay, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin by giving you some highlights on the first quarter, starting with Page 3, where you see the difference between as-reported and currency-neutral growth rates for this quarter. As Barbara explained at the start of this call, we have now changed how we report the impact of currency. So instead of reporting FX-adjusted growth rates, which only reflected the translational impact of the euro and the Brazilian real functional currencies, we are now reporting currency-neutral growth rates, which exclude all impacts of foreign exchange rates. This is both the impact from translating functional currencies into U.S. dollar for reporting purposes as well as the underlying impact of local currencies being converted into their functional currency. We hope that this change will make it easier for you to understand the underlying performance of our business. And all of my comments going forward will pertain to our new currency-neutral growth rates.
Net revenue growth was 14%. While operating expenses grew significantly, this was mostly due to the difference between FX hedging and balance sheet remeasurement gains that we had in the year-ago quarter versus foreign exchange losses on our hedging contracts in this quarter. I will talk more about this when we get into the detail of operating expenses. 
As expected, net income was also impacted by a higher tax rate than in the year-ago quarter due to the nonrecurrence of a discrete U.S. foreign tax credit from which we benefited in the first quarter of 2015. EPS was $0.86, up 1% year-over-year. But as Ajay said, it was impacted by $0.08 due to the discrete tax item that I just mentioned and the Venezuela balance sheet remeasurement gain in the year-ago quarter. When you exclude these 2 items, EPS grew 12%. 
Share repurchases contributed $0.03 per share. And as of April 21, we have $2.9 billion remaining under our current authorization. And lastly, cash flow from operations was $1 billion, and we ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalent and other liquid investments of about $6.2 billion.
So let me turn to Page 4 and here, you can see the operational metrics for the first quarter. Included in these numbers is a positive lift of about 1% due to leap day on all of our metrics. Our worldwide gross dollar volume, or GDV growth, was 13%. On a local currency basis, that's about up 1 ppt from last quarter. Overall, our U.S. GDV grew 10%, made up of credit and debit growth of 11% and 8%, respectively. Total U.S. GDV had a continued 1 ppt headwind from lower gas prices. 
Outside of the U.S., volume growth was 15% on a local currency basis, also up about 1 ppt versus last quarter, with mid- to high teens growth in each region, except Canada, which was impacted by the lapping of our Costco win. Cross-border volume grew 12% on a local currency basis, and that's similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter.
Turning to Page 5. Processed transactions grew 14% globally to $12.6 billion, a 2 ppt increase from what we saw in the fourth quarter, with higher growth in all regions except Canada, again due to the lapping of our Costco win. Globally, the number of cards grew 7% with 2.3 billion MasterCard and Maestro-branded cards issued. 
Let me turn to Page 6 for highlights on a few of the revenue line items. Net revenue growth was 10% as reported or 14% on a currency-neutral basis, given currency headwinds. We saw strong volume and transaction growth, particularly in the U.S. and Europe, and some of which was due to the impact of leap year. Rebates and incentives was slightly higher than what we expected due to deal renewals. 
Looking quickly at the individual line -- revenue line items on a constant -- on a currency-neutral basis. Domestic assessments grew 13%, in line with worldwide GDV growth. Cross-border volume fees grew 14%, while cross-border volume grew 12%. The 2 ppt gap is due to a number of pricing actions, partially offset by a higher mix of intra-Europe activity. Transaction processing fees grew 18%, primarily driven by the 14% growth in processed transactions as well as some pricing. And finally, other revenues grew 22%, driven primarily by our APT acquisition and our safety and security product offerings.
Moving on to Page 7. Here, you can see that total operating expenses increased 25% in the quarter or 29% on a currency-neutral basis. Most of this increase is due to FX movements recorded in our G&A line. I mentioned on our last earnings call that we recorded a large amount of FX gains in the year-ago quarter, mostly due to onetime gains related to Venezuela. The absence of those gains, plus the unrealized losses we recorded this quarter on our FX hedging activity due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to year-end 2015, resulted in an almost $130 million increase to expenses. Excluding this and a 4 ppt impact from acquisitions we did not have in the year-ago quarter, G&A grew 11% as a result of our continuing investment in areas such as digital, data analytics and safety and security. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense is primarily due to the amortization of intangibles related to our acquisitions.
So now I'm going to turn to Slide 8. Let's discuss what we had seen in April through the 21st. While many of our business drivers are similar to the first quarter, direct comparisons to the first quarter are a bit difficult since it had the benefit of both leap day and Easter. 
The numbers through April 21 are as follows: Starting with processed volume, we saw global growth of 13%, the same as in the first quarter. In the U.S., our process volume grew 10%, down roughly 1 ppt from the first quarter, with slower growth in both credit and debit. Gas had less than 1 ppt negative impact on our April growth, down slightly from the first quarter impact. Process volume outside the U.S. grew 16%, up 1 ppt from the last quarter, with higher growth in most regions and primarily driven by Europe and APMEA. Global process transaction growth was 14%, the same as we saw in the first quarter. Process transaction growth outside the U.S. was up a bit, with increases in APMEA and LAC, while the U.S. growth was down almost 2 ppt due to slower growth in credit and debit. With respect to cross-border, our volumes grew at 11% globally, down 1 ppt from last quarter with slower growth in Europe, primarily due to the timing of Easter.
Let me start out with a quick comment about our long-term performance objectives for 2016 to '18, which excluded the impact from our 2 major functional currencies, the euro and the Brazilian real as well as excluded any new M&A activities. Since we are now making the change to recognize the impact of all foreign exchange on our business, we reviewed these objectives and determined that no change is required from what we issued previously because we had baked in very little local FX impact over the 3-year period. Therefore, our 2016 to '18 objectives remain as follows, but are now on a currency-neutral basis: net revenue CAGR of low double digits; operating margin of at least 50%; and an EPS CAGR in the mid-teens and measured off a 2015 pro forma EPS figure of $3.12.
Now moving specifically to this year, there's really no change in our outlook for the business from what we discussed with you on our earnings call back in January. The U.S. and European economies are showing some sign of improvement, but the rest of the world remains challenged. In addition, FX headwinds will continue to be with us into 2016, although likely not as significant as 2015 given current FX rates. And our underlying business fundamentals remain strong. We will continue to run the company for growth, both on the top and on the bottom line as well as balancing our investments with astute expense management. 
As we look at full year 2016 and after factoring in our new currency-neutral methodology, we continue to expect to be at the low end of our 3-year revenue growth range. When you model on an as-reported basis, you will need to adjust for the impact of all currencies. And at the current rates, we estimate that it would mean about a 3 ppt headwind on net revenue growth and about a 4 ppt headwind to the bottom line. 
And let me call out a few other items that you should consider when modeling 2016. So for rebates and incentives, we continue to expect to see growth in the high teens, slightly lower than the 20% as-reported growth rate we saw in 2015. On expenses, we still expect total operating expense growth in the high single-digit range on an as-reported basis. And finally, you should assume a tax rate of slightly less than 30% for 2016. 
Now let me turn the call back to Barbara to begin the Q&A session. Barbara?"

So hopefully, by knowing the first quarter, you are able to chart out the next 3 quarters for the year, given that we're giving guidance for the high single-digit number. In terms of operating leverage, what we have said when we looked at our business, and we do that actually every year, that we feel very comfortable with an operating margin in excess of 50%. Remember, we are really running the business for revenue growth, so for top line growth, which means that we are having to make a number of investments in -- on the OpEx side in order to generate the bottom line growth. So we are holding that as a metric. And at this point in time, the heavy-duty investments that are happening is in the digital arena, is in the data analytics arena, as well as in the safety and security arena."

So that's why you saw us doing -- and you saw in my opening remarks the commentary on the different processing entities and how they fit into what we are doing. It could be in the data cache kind of space, which is the payment gateway area. It could be with things like Provus and Trevica. Those are all in the regular transaction processing spaces. Or it could be in any space that allows us to get to see more transactions. When 6, 7 years ago, we used to see under 40% of our transactions, we now see close to 50%. That enables us to do a better job with our core products, but even more importantly, with our information services and advisers and safety and security products, which is where we're putting some emphasis. So that's the second area beyond processing. Anything that gives us capabilities, strengths, geography, product knowledge or skill sets in data analytics, in safety and security, in information services, in loyalty and rewards, hence, the acquisitions in Australia that we have done, that's all about those spaces. And we haven't wavered off that. And you'll read speculation every once in a while, and speculation is speculation till we can announce anything to you. So don't take it to the bank."

I guess just from understanding going forward, there are some sort of a shift that's occurred and have a little volume intra-Europe versus other areas. And is pricing big enough and sustainable enough that we should really forecast the revenue growth rate to outperform the volume growth rate cross-border going forward just given that's a pretty big tailwind?"

The markets that are suffering in terms of our recognizing cross-border business from them are no different from what you would think. Brazil is slower. Nigeria is slower. Canada is a little slower. That's kind of what you would have expected. And China, for example, actually is slower into the U.S. but not into other markets. The Chinese cross-border travel seems to be up in Japan and in Australia, a little slower into the United States. So all that is inside the numbers that you see you, and that's kind of how you should think about cross-border. We work very hard on cross-border because it's an important part of our business.

Because on the surface, this does seem like a different approach from the merchants as opposed to the MCX approach because it'll offer the consumers opportunity to use all tender types, including the traditional networks rather than being hyper focused on reducing acceptance cost and trying to force the use of private label and decouple debit payment types. What's your perspective? Do you see a natural change in how the merchants are thinking about mobile wallets?"

And in truth, I think nobody actually knows. And I think and I said many times, it's going to take a few years for this to settle. That's why even companies like ours, in mobile, you've seen us place effort, energy, money, bets in everything from whether the transaction data is on the handset or it's in the cloud, whether we're working with mobile network operators or hardware manufacturers or distributors of that stuff. This whole mobile space, whether -- is such an evolving space, that I don't think anybody knows the answers. And I think that's what's going on even with the retailers. I think they're trying to find a way to offer a product and a wallet that their consumer can be connected to for loyalty and not just let a digital player own that space, also not just let the banks own that space. The banks, by the way, are doing the same thing. They're trying to make sure they offer products that get the consumer loyal to them and not just let the digital player own that space or the merchant own that space. And of course, the digital player is doing the same thing. So we're all doing a dance right now and I don't think anybody knows the real answer. But I do believe in 2 or 3 underlying factors. The first one is, we, as a network, we believe that a focus on the person who owns the consumer relationship, in this case, the bank or the merchant as it may be, that they are the ones who should be developing the loyalty with that consumer. People like us that are -- we're a B2B2C company. We operate through them and, therefore, our role is to facilitate that and do it in a way that drives our business with them and enables our value-added services to be used. So we're very focused on going through them, whether it be through a Walmart or through a Citibank or through a different bank. The second rule that I think applies universally is that more consumer choice in tenders and payments is better than less. And I think that's just to reduce the friction. There's one large merchant in the United States who doesn't think that way. But otherwise, every other merchant around the world is keen to basically offer more tender choice to their consumer rather than less. And I think that's going to be even more important in the mobile world, to reduce friction, and those kinds of rules apply. And so my view of this, Jason, don't conclude too much yet, but be prepared to see many efforts going on in different places. I think the days of one model when only one big mobile network or one, I'd say, one big mobile wallet or one big e-commerce wallet existed, those days are going away. There's going to be a lot of competition in that space with multiple tenders, with choice for consumers. And it's going to be interesting to watch where this settles."

I think over the next 2 or 3 months, we'll see what that does in terms of how issuers are thinking. My general sense is it'll make it easier for an issuer to know exactly what they're going to get paid from the exercise of the put, and that'll make it a little easier for them to comprehend what they're getting and what they're leaving behind if they make a decision, which, in a sense, is a good thing.

First of all, what we said that our services business roundabout are approaching about 25% of our total revenues. And yes, we did say that the margin is around 40% at this point in time. There is a whole mix of different businesses in there. So what I just said about the processing business, typically, that is a much lower-margin type of business. When you look at some of the information services businesses, it's a higher margin. And when you look at yet the safety and security business, it's an even higher margin. So Dan, I can't just mix them all together because there are just a number of facets in there. But what we are doing, and this is what we said is, given that we have done a number of acquisitions, folding them together with our assets, we have made, and you remember maybe the restructuring charge that we took 15 months ago or so, we have actually made some really good progress to be increasing the margin of these businesses over time."

Martina made the point that, yes, the margin is now 40%, but scale does bring a higher margin just as, by the way, scale in our core business has been improving our margins over time. So I don't consider these to be inherently lower-margin businesses, if that's what you're trying to get certainty on. In the mix, there are some that will be inherently lower. There's some that'll be inherently higher. Just like in our current core business, there are different yields and different margins even in our current core business between the different kinds of payments involved and the different kind of things that we do involve there. So it's all about our mix."

But I, honestly, I consider the whole commercial business to be a continuing area of growth. And I'm sure so do my peers, because it's not just about us or our peers. It's the marketplace. This commercial business has a nice opportunity for all of us. We signed a deal with Barclays in the U.K. recently. We've expanded our global agreement with Citibank to include their commercial card portfolios in Asia, in Europe but also in the United States. And we're kind of seeing continuing strong adoption of smartdata, which is our reporting and reconciliation tool. We are seeing continuing adoption of InControl for commercial payments. That's virtual cards. And most interestingly, we're starting to see increasing interest beyond the typical bankcard issuers. You're looking at technology providers, who embed their commercial payment solution into their software and platform. We're working with them. We're working with payment aggregators in insurance and health care. It's kind of a -- it's an interesting space. We're in the early stages of a long run in commercial, but we feel good about where we're going. And we continually see good growth in there, not just in the U.S., by the way. This is this commentary, as you heard me talk about, has a number of overseas geographies that are picking up business volume and effort as well."

So it is all folded in. What we really have to do is we have to separate the switching business into an isolated unit. It's not a legal separation. It's a functional separation. It reports separately from our European President, Javier Perez. It has to have, obviously, enough of a substance in there so that these -- that the unit can go to market as well as that it can do its middle-office and back-office functions. And so you should expect that while it is a smaller unit, that it will be very well seated with the right kind of people. And it will have some impact on our operating expenses.

In our G&A line of 11% includes the impact of the Russian processing, which is now coming through our expense line, which by the way, is just what it is. We got to manage it. And it's part of what we're growing with. There's no point in my pulling that out separately for you and saying, ""Ex that, I would've been even better."" The way we manage this, like you manage acquisitions, once it's ours, it's ours. And we've got to find a way to cut expenses elsewhere while investing in the right things. And you will see us do that on Europe. You've seen us do that on Russia. You will see us do it with all these acquisitions and with the strategic investments. That's kind of what we're trying to do: Manage our expenses in all aspects of our lines. 
Okay. So thank you all for your questions. I want to leave you with a couple of closing thoughts. I think the first part is, I think our business is performing well. You see that reflected in our strong volume and transaction growth, and that's despite the somewhat uneven global economy. We're growing revenues from our core businesses, but also from our services, as we just had a discussion of, both organically and through the ongoing successful integration of our acquisitions for the last few years. We're pleased with our progress across MasterPass, across the MasterCard Digital Enablement System and our partnerships with many of the digital players. But as I said in the answer to Jason, that's -- there's a lot of things that will evolve there, and this is a marathon, not a sprint. We continue to build on our momentum in safety and security. We're committed to making sure that is what consumers get, no matter which channel or which instrument or device they choose to use to shop on. And we remain very focused on creating a better experience for both cardholders and merchants across all these channels. 
So thank you for your continuing support of the company, and thank you for joining us today."
