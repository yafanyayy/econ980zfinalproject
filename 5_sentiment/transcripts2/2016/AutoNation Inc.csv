Today, we reported adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $0.96, a 6% decrease on a -- as compared to EPS from continuing operations of $1.02 for the same period in the prior year. For the full year, adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $3.98, up 14% over prior year.
Fourth quarter 2015 revenue totaled $5.3 billion compared to $5 billion in the year-ago period, an increase of 6% driven by stronger performance in all our business sectors. Total gross profit was $812 million compared to $784 million in the year-ago period, an increase of 4%. Operating income was $200 million compared to $227 million in the year-ago period, a decrease of 12%. In the fourth quarter, AutoNation's retail new vehicle unit sales increased 4% overall or 1% on a same-store basis.
The fourth quarter industry sales environment was more pushed than pull, resulting in significant new and used vehicle margin declines on a combined basis of $217 per vehicle retailed, which is 11% lower than the fourth quarter of 2014. During the quarter, we experienced particular weakness in premium luxury, which had a significant impact on our fourth quarter financial results. We have begun and will continue through the first quarter,  take the necessary steps to align our cost, inventory and pricing strategy to the current market.
Revenue for the full year was $20.9 billion, up 9% over prior year, total gross profit was $3.3 billion compared to $3 billion in the year-ago period, an increase of 9%. Operating income for the full year was $873 million, an increase of 6% over prior year. Our assumption for 2016 industry new vehicle unit sales is above $17 million for the year.

For the fourth quarter, we reported adjusted net income from continuing operations of $107 million or $0.96 per share versus net income of $117 million or $1.02 per share during the fourth quarter of 2014, a 6%",646,"Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. For the fourth quarter, we reported adjusted net income from continuing operations of $107 million or $0.96 per share versus net income of $117 million or $1.02 per share during the fourth quarter of 2014, a 6% decrease on a per share basis. Our fourth quarter 2015 results exclude a noncash impairment charge of $9.6 million after-tax or $0.09 per share related to the franchise rights asset of our Volkswagen stores. There were no adjustments to net income in the fourth quarter for the prior year.
Revenues during the quarter increased $292 million or 6% compared to the prior-year and gross profit improved $29 million or 4%. SG&A as a percentage of gross profit was 70% for the quarter, which represents a 210 basis point increase compared to the year-ago period due to the gross profit pressure in the fourth quarter, SG&A as a percentage of gross profit did not benefit from the normal seasonal strength in premium luxury vehicle sales.
As we continue to adjust our cost structure to be a current environment, our SG&A as a percentage of growth, is expected to remain under pressure.
The provision for income tax in the quarter was $61.3 million or 38.5%. Net new vehicle floorplan was the benefit of $15.1 million, which was relatively flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 as increased floor plan balances were largely offset by higher sales and increased floorplan assistance per unit.
Floor plan debt increased sequentially, approximately $523 million during the fourth quarter to $3.7 billion at quarter-end primarily due to increased inventory balances.
Non-vehicle interest expense increased to $26.5 million compared to $22.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. The $4.4 million increase in interest expense was driven by the issuance of our senior unsecured notes in September, which had higher rate than our revolving credit facility as well as higher average debt balances. The increased senior notes rate was partially offset by lower interest rate associated with our credit facility refinancing of issuance of our commercial paper program. At the end of December, we had $2.4 billion of non-vehicle debt, an increase of $162 million compared to September 30, 2015. Non-vehicle debt includes $600 million of outstanding commercial paper borrowings. At the end of December, we had no amounts drawn under our revolving credit facility. As a consequence, our non-vehicle debt mix was approximately 75% fixed and 25% floating. I'll also note that we have no material debt maturities until late 2017.
For the full year 2015, we repurchased 3.9 million shares or $235 million at an average price of $60.49 per share. As of January 26, AutoNation had approximately $296 million of board authorization remaining for share repurchase, and there were approximately 111 million shares outstanding. This does not include the dilutive impact of stock options.
Our leverage ratio increased the 2.3x at the end of Q4 compared to 2.2x at the end of Q3. The leverage ratio was 2.1x on a net debt basis, including used floor plan availability and our covenant limit is 3.75x.
Capital expenditures were $75.3 million for the quarter. Capital expenditures are on an accrual basis excluding operating lease buyouts and related asset sales. Our quarter end cash balance was $74 million, which combined with our additional borrowing capacity, resulted in total liquidity of $1.7 billion at the end of December. We continue to use our revolving credit facility as a liquidity backstop for borrowings under our commercial paper program. As I mentioned a moment ago, we had $600 million of outstanding commercial paper at quarter end, which in effect, reduces our available liquidity to $1.1 billion.
Looking forward, we are focused on aligning our cost structure to better adjust to current market conditions and continuing to prudently allocate capital.
Now let me turn it over to our Chief Operating Officer, Phil Berman."

My comments today will be on a same-store basis as compared to the prior-year unless noted otherwise. Gross profit for variable operations was $450 million, down 4%. variable growth was $3,350 on a per-vehicle retail basis, a decrease of $125 or 4%. New and used same-store unit volume was flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. New vehicle revenue for the quarter was $3 billion, an increase of $61 million or 2%. We retailed 82,900 units, an increase of 1%.
New vehicle gross profit was $2,018 on a per-vehicle retail basis, which was down 10% compared to the same period a year ago.
In the fourth quarter, we experienced a push rather than pull environment. We saw margin compression, particularly in Premium Luxury segment. This offset that seasonal sequential increase in PVRs we typically expect in the fourth quarter. Coupled with the margin pressure in the fourth quarter, we also began to see a slowdown in Texas due to collapsing energy prices, which are hurting the local economy.
In Texas, the new and used unit sales were down compared to the fourth quarter of 24, 2014. In Florida, we continue to experience growth across the state, new and used units were up for the quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. As Mike mentioned earlier, we are taking steps to align our costs, inventory and pricing strategy with the current market conditions.
Used vehicle retail revenue for the quarter was $1 billion, an increase of $22 million or 2% compared to the period a year ago. Used vehicle retail were down 2% year-over-year at $52,000. Used unit gross profit was $1,436 on a per-vehicle retail basis, a decrease of $246 or 15%. As of year-end, approximately 6% of our and what are was not available to sale due to open recalls. The held inventory represents less than 2% of our new vehicle inventory and approximately 16% of our used vehicle inventory. As we've stated in the third quarter, we saw an impact in sales due to policy. We continue to implement systems and processes in support of our efforts to ensure no vehicle with an open recall this retailed. We continue to lead long-term safety benefit for our customers to far outweigh any short-term impact our results and further support the AutoNation brand promise.
Customer financial services gross profit was $1,556 on a per-vehicle retail basis, an increase of $109 or 8%. Total gross profit for customer financial services was $210 million, it was up $14 million or 7% compared to the period a year ago.
In the quarter, customer care revenue was $751 million, an increase of $28 million or 4%. Customer care gross profit was $326 million, an increase of $24 million or 8%. Customer pay gross was $129 million, up 9%; warranty gross was $66 million, up 7%; collision gross was $31 million, up 11%.
Finally, I'd like to welcome the Honda associates at AutoNation family, and thank all of our over 26,000 associates for the hard work and dedication.

So we've taken steps to begin to bring our inventories in line. Obviously, there's a lot of lead time on our orders, but we'll see some progress in the first quarter, but it will probably take the second quarter. But even if we do that, it's the industry overproduces and keeps inventory at a high level, that means the overall environment is still very difficult and very competitive even though we may have our house in order within this. It certainly puts us in a better position, but it's not a full answer. So that remains to be seen. I think if you go back to the period of 2000 through 2006, the industry plateaued at an average of 17 million units a year. But clearly, overproduced and had high inventories, which put tremendous pressure on manufacturers, resale values and retailers for growth. So I really hope we don't repeat that history and that we go a new way this time."

I think domestics are well-positioned to exceed in 2016. All the -- almost all the excess inventories in cars, not in trucks, to the extent that you have strength in trucks and can produce more trucks, you want to thrive in 2016. I think Sergio's decision to switch over factories from car production to truck production shows you the sense that the consumer has that they are totally committed to cheap gas and to trucks, it's really become a strategic question, not a tactical question. So wherever you will stand on trucks is your position of strength in the marketplace. So that's very different than 2000 in a domestic -- from a starting point, the domestics are in a very good position. I would've hoped during this period of growth, the industry could've gotten some of its benchmarks more accurate, so that when we have a GAAP conversation versus an industry conversation, it could be more meaningful. Here, I point to the obsolete industry calendar that moves days around willy-nilly and a -- it was originally done because the sales report is in a digital age, whether the months end, they should close the month digitally. I also have a long-standing issue with the days supply calculation in that fleet sales were counted in retail selling rate, which is a major distortion. So pointing to industry figures to try to figure out what's going on is not always helpful and making a comparison then to GAAP figures get particularly difficult. So those issues are not resolved. They still sit there. But I think, the principal point, the industry is in a much better shape today than it was in 2000, both from a structural point of view and that we're at the beginning of this plateau and there's still time to adjust. There's a particular overhang in premium luxury, which will take some time to work through."

I expressed my plateau point of view on CNBC the first week of January and then got on the plane and went to the Detroit motor show. I would say, the overall discussion agreed that our 60 years of rapid growth are over, but the industry is plateauing at a very high, very acceptable level and no one is really saying, ""this thing is going to blowby $18 million to $18.5 million or something within the industry."" I know there's some others out there that have a point if you that that's going to happen. If that were to happen, I can tell you this, it would take significant price action that would be pulling forward future business from my point of view. Now unfortunately, every executive is very confident and optimistic about their position in the marketplace and they have plans for growth in 2016. So if you add up everyone's individual plan, you have this classic situation that everyone's going to take share, but that means set the plants to run to go out and achieve that. So while they're being conservative and disciplined in saying, ""the total market is probably mid-'17, plus or minus 100,000 units, we'll take that right away,"" we're going to take a bigger piece of the pie. So I think that's then going to be incumbent upon retailers to really push back where appropriate and say, ""that's more than this marketplace is going to take, particularly on the car side,"" to the extent that you can increase production on trucks, that's fine. But it's going to be substitution for cars, it's not incremental business. I think that's a solid plan. I think if retailers push back on very aggressive production plans and by the way, we're being given very aggressive stairstep targets also, which again, indicate that individually, they're planning for significant growth. So the ball is kicked, debate is underway and I'm hoping the industry can manage it successfully because the challenge for the industry, I feel, over the next several years is we can have multiple years above '17 with the pent-up demand that's out there. But in a plateau new vehicle market, can we grow earnings and the quality of earnings? Or are we going to have a share fight that results in ruin these incentives for the manufacturers and for retailers? I think that's sort of aligned we're trying to walk down at the moment."

So it's very interesting, our fourth quarter performance where by manufacturers increasing incentives by $250 a car; us, increasing our discount by $220 a car, that had an immediate impact in our used car values. And then we had to discount, anything that was relatively new versus the new vehicle in the showroom floor. So it's a double impact. It impacted our new vehicle gross margin, it impacted our used vehicle gross margin. So that's the biggest issue and that's my greatest concern about overproduction. And you can say, Mike, what you care for manufacturers increased their incentives significantly, we'll just sell more cars. Well, it pulls the rug out from underneath the value of my used car inventory. And also to your point, it really disappoints your existing owner base, your most loyal customers because you depreciated ultimately the value of the trade in. So it's really a lose-lose, it's a lose in the short-term and lose long-term. And I really don't want to see incentives beyond the manufacturer level. They're about 10% of suggested retail price at the moment. So we're approaching double digits and I really hope we don't go beyond that. Now to your point of mix, this mix adjustment, cars versus trucks, has been going on. So it's not a shock. It's been -- we've gone from 45% trucks a few years ago to 60% trucks in the month of December. It's been a journey. There's been adjustments along the way. So I think that's more big in the cake at the moment than a new development. It's more where our incentives going? Where our inventories production going?

So that's not an issue, it's a significant impact on name. Now just to discuss the issue for a moment, I think the auto industry really had some credibility issues, it has to face up to everything from horrific recalls we've had with significant loss of life to credibility issues around the Volkswagen situation. So we sit there and say, what can we do on our part to make it better? Well preowned, this is a significant issue, on any given day, 15% of our inventory had open recalls. Now let me be clear, these are not wrong tire pressure, sticker isn't on the core or some other little minor item, it doesn't have an owners manual. That's on new cars when they're first released, you get the sticker issue or the owners manual issue, you have 1 page missing. These are significant safety recall. And we feel that time has passed that it's appropriate to take a vehicle and trade with a significant safety recall and turned around the next day and sell it to a consumer. So we're the only one that's done it. We think it's a brand attribute. We will work to make it a brand attribute in 2016 and we feel in the long-term, it will be a tremendous advantage to us. In the meantime, it is very disruptive to our used car business because we see no way to get it below 15%. There's new recalls arriving every day and we have to increase inventory to get to the same point and, I think, we're in the front line availability. And at the same time, we have to then work very hard to get the vehicles repaired as constantly as possible. So it remains a disruptive issue. I would say, if I look at our declines [indiscernible] gross for the fourth quarter on used vehicle, I would put the majority of it to higher incentives from the manufacturers and higher new vehicle discounts from us. But recall disruption remains part of it, and probably will continue for the first half of the year until -- while we get it all sorted out."

And as I said, we've gone from trending towards 15% of the business with third parties. In a couple of more years, it would have been 20%, now it's going in the other direction and that gives us more resources to go into our brand. We now generate fully 25% of our business from AutoNation sites, which is a spectacular success. The customers like the ability to be able to transact on the site.

But you can check with me a year from now on that when we get the final plan on how we're going to tackle documentation."

So on in 2015, the band was strong enough that we could walk away from third-party lead providers and have the traffic come to our sites and then other piece of the puzzle was to invest in our digital capability once they came to our sites, they were happy with the experience. So there, we're declaring victory. And as far as exactly where we are on that $100 million, I think we're probably through that. But we'll continue to have investments in '16. We already said in the marketing side, we'll adjust our spend this year versus last year, so that's part of it. And on digital, we'll probably run at the same level as '15 without an increase."

So we see no slowdown in the amount of cars being recalled, it's just moving away from the ignition switches and initial Dakota airbag to a more of a broad spectrum of units and manufacturers. VW, correct, there is no fix that's been called out right now, but that represents a very small percentage of our business, less than 1%. So there will be no real impact to us on that input.

Obviously, the domestic business with trucks is as strong as you can imagine and Asian is challenged because fuel economy, which is their strength is not valued by the marketplace at the moment and we have a surprising challenge with premium luxury here in the fourth quarter. We're diversified by business type, we went through all that and we're diversify geographically. Yes, we have a storm in Texas at the moment that will take some time to blow through, but in total, it's an adaptable model and we will do that once again. So thank you for your patience today.

Today, we reported adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $0.96, a 6% decrease on a -- as compared to EPS from continuing operations of $1.02 for the same period in the prior year. For the full year, adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $3.98, up 14% over prior year.
Fourth quarter 2015 revenue totaled $5.3 billion compared to $5 billion in the year-ago period, an increase of 6%, driven by stronger performance in all our business sectors. Total gross profit was $812 million compared to $784 million in the year-ago period, an increase of 4%. Operating income was $200 million compared to $227 million in the year-ago period, a decrease of 12%. In the fourth quarter, AutoNation's retail new vehicle unit sales increased 4% overall or 1% on a same-store basis.
The fourth quarter industry sales environment was more push than pull, resulting in significant new and used vehicle margin declines on a combined basis of $217 per vehicle retailed, which is 11% lower than the fourth quarter of 2014. During the quarter, we experienced particular weakness in Premium Luxury, which had a significant impact on our fourth quarter financial results. We have begun and will continue through the first quarter to take the necessary steps to align our cost, inventory and pricing strategy to the current market.
Revenue for the full year was $20.9 billion, up 9% over prior year. Total gross profit was $3.3 billion compared to $3 billion in the year-ago period, an increase of 9%. Operating income for the full year was $873 million, an increase of 6% over prior year. Our [indiscernible] assumption for 2016 industry new vehicle unit sales is above $17 million for the year.

For the fourth quarter, we reported adjusted net income from continuing operations of $107 million or $0.96 per share versus net income of $117 million or $1.02 per share during the fourth quarter of 2014, a 6%",648,"Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. For the fourth quarter, we reported adjusted net income from continuing operations of $107 million or $0.96 per share versus net income of $117 million or $1.02 per share during the fourth quarter of 2014, a 6% decrease on a per share basis. Our fourth quarter 2015 results exclude a noncash impairment charge of $9.6 million after-tax or $0.09 per share related to the franchise rights asset of our Volkswagen stores. There were no adjustments to net income in the fourth quarter of the prior year.
Revenues during the quarter increased $292 million or 6% compared to the prior year, and gross profit improved $29 million or 4%. SG&A as a percentage of gross profit was 70% for the quarter, which represents a 210 basis point increase compared to the year-ago period. Due to the gross profit pressure in the fourth quarter, SG&A as a percentage of gross profit did not benefit from the normal seasonal strength in premium luxury vehicle sales. As we continue to adjust our cost structure to the current environment, our SG&A as a percentage of growth is expected to remain under pressure.
The provision for income tax in the quarter was $61.3 million or 38.5%. Net new vehicle floorplan was a benefit of $15.1 million, which was relatively flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 as increased floorplan balances were largely offset by higher sales and increased floorplan assistance per unit. Floorplan debt increased sequentially approximately $523 million during the fourth quarter to $3.7 billion at quarter end, primarily due to increased inventory balances.
Non-vehicle interest expense increased to $26.5 million compared to $22.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. The $4.4 million increase in interest expense was driven by the issuance of our senior unsecured notes in September, which have higher rates than our revolving credit facility as well as higher average debt balances. The increased senior notes rate was partially offset by lower interest rates associated with our credit facility refinancing and the issuance of our commercial paper program. At the end of December, we had $2.4 billion of non-vehicle debt, an increase of $162 million compared to September 30, 2015. Non-vehicle debt includes $600 million of outstanding commercial paper borrowings. 
At the end of December, we had no amounts drawn under our revolving credit facility. As a consequence, our non-vehicle debt fixed to floating mix was approximately 75% fixed and 25% floating. I'll also note that we have no material debt maturities until late 2017.
For the full year 2015, we repurchased 3.9 million shares for $235 million at an average price of $60.49 per share. As of January 26, AutoNation had approximately $296 million of board authorization remaining for share repurchase, and there are approximately 111 million shares outstanding. This does not include the dilutive impact of stock options.
Our leverage ratio increased to 2.3x at the end of Q4 compared to 2.2x at the end of Q3. The leverage ratio was 2.1x on a net debt basis, including used floorplan availability, and our covenant limit is 3.75x.
Capital expenditures were $75.3 million for the quarter. Capital expenditures are on an accrual basis, excluding operating lease buyouts and related asset sales. 
Our quarter end cash balance was $74 million, which, combined with our additional borrowing capacity, resulted in total liquidity of $1.7 billion at the end of December. We continue to use our revolving credit facility as a liquidity backstop for borrowings under our commercial paper program. As I mentioned a moment ago, we have $600 million of outstanding commercial paper at quarter end, which, in effect, reduces our available liquidity to $1.1 billion.
Looking forward, we are focused on aligning our cost structure to better adjust to current market conditions and continuing to prudently allocate capital.
Now let me turn it over to our Chief Operating Officer, Bill Berman."

Gross profit for variable operations was $450 million, down 4%. Variable gross was $3,350 on a per vehicle retail basis, a decrease of $125 or 4%. New and used same-store unit volume was flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. New vehicle revenue for the quarter was $3 billion, an increase of $61 million or 2%. We retailed 82,900 units, an increase of 1%. New vehicle gross profit was $2,018 on a per vehicle retail basis, which was down 10% compared to the same period a year ago.
In the fourth quarter, we experienced a push rather than a pull environment. We saw margin compression, particularly in Premium Luxury segment. This offset the seasonal sequential increase in PVRs we typically expect in the fourth quarter. Coupled with the margin pressure in the fourth quarter, we also began to see a slowdown in Texas due to the collapsing energy prices, which are hurting the local economy.
In Texas, the new and used unit sales were down compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. In Florida, we continue to experience growth across the state. New and used units were up for the quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. As Mike mentioned earlier, we are taking steps to align our cost, inventory and pricing strategy with the current market conditions.
Used vehicle retail revenue for the quarter was $1 billion, an increase of $22 million or 2% compared to the period a year ago. Used vehicles retail were down 2% year-over-year at $52,000. Used unit gross profit was $1,436 on a per vehicle retail basis, a decrease of $246 or 15%. As of year-end, approximately 6% of our inventory was not available for sale due to open recalls. The held inventory represents less than 2% of our new vehicle inventory and approximately 16% of our used vehicle inventory. 
As we've stated in the third quarter, we did see an impact on our used vehicle sales due to a recall policy. We continue to implement systems and processes in support of our efforts to ensure no vehicle with an open recall is retailed. We continue to lead in the long-term safety benefit, where our customers far outweigh any short-term impact to our results and further support the AutoNation brand promise.
Customer financial services gross profit was $1,556 on a per vehicle retail basis, an increase of $109 or 8%. Total gross profit for customer financial services was $210 million. It was up $14 million or 7% compared to the period a year ago.
In the quarter, customer care revenue was $751 million, an increase of $28 million or 4%. Customer care gross profit was $326 million, an increase of $24 million or 8%. Customer pay gross was $129 million, up 9%. Warranty gross was $66 million, up 7%. Collision gross was $31 million, up 11%.
Finally, I'd like to welcome the Honda associates at AutoNation family and thank all of our over 26,000 associates for their hard work and dedication.

So we've taken steps to begin to bring our inventories in line. Obviously, there's a lot of lead time on our orders. Then we'll see some progress in the first quarter, but it'll probably take the second quarter. But even if we do that, if the industry overproduces and keeps inventory at a high level, that means the overall environment is still very difficult and very competitive even though we may have our house in order within this. It certainly puts us in a better position, but it's not a full answer. So that remains to be seen. I think if you go back to the period of 2000 through 2006, the industry plateaued at an average of 17 million units a year, but clearly, overproduced and had high inventories, which put tremendous pressure on manufacturers' resale values and retailers' front-end gross.

I think the domestics are very well positioned to exceed in 2016. All the -- almost all the excess inventory is in cars, not in trucks.

All the -- almost all the excess inventory is in cars, not in trucks. So the extent that you have strength in trucks and can produce more trucks, you're going to thrive in 2016. I think Sergio's decision to switch over a factory from car production to truck production shows you the sense that the consumer has, that they are totally committed to cheap gas and to trucks. It's really become a strategic question, not a tactical question. So wherever you will stand on trucks is your position of strength in the marketplace. So that's very different than 2000 in a domestic -- from a starting point, the domestics are in a very good position. I would've hoped during this period of growth the industry could've gotten some of its benchmarks more accurate so that when we have a GAAP [ph] conversation versus an industry conversation, it could be more meaningful. Here, I point to the obsolete industry calendar that moves days around willy-nilly in a -- it was originally done because we used to mail sales reports in. We're in a digital age. They should -- when the month ends, they should close the month digitally. I also have a long-standing issue with the days supply calculation in that fleet sales are counted in retail selling rates, which is a major distortion. So pointing to industry figures to try to figure out what's going on is not always helpful, and making a comparison then to GAAP figures get particularly difficult. So those issues are not resolved. They still sit there. But I think on to your principal point, the industry is in much better shape today than it was in 2000, both from a structural point of view and that we're at the beginning of this plateau and there's still time to adjust. There's a particular overhang in Premium Luxury, which will take some time to work through."

Or as we look at '16 and if your stock doesn't recover meaningfully from here, I mean, does this just make your stock much more attractive relative to the acquisitions and we just see you buying back more of your own stock as opposed to making acquisitions?"

I expressed my plateau point of view on CNBC the first week of January and then got on a plane and went to the Detroit motor show. I would say, the overall discussion agreed that 6 years of rapid growth are over, that the industry is plateauing at a very high, very acceptable level. And no one is really saying, ""This thing is going to blow by $18 million to $18.5 million or something within the industry."" I know there's some others out there that have a point of view that that's going to happen. If that were to happen, I can tell you this, it would take significant price action that would be pulling forward future business from my point of view. Now unfortunately, every executive is very confident and optimistic about their position in the marketplace, and they have plans for growth in 2016. So if you add up everyone's individual plan, you have this classic situation that everyone's going to take share. But that means they've set the plants to run to go out and achieve that. So while they're being conservative and disciplined in saying, ""The total market is probably mid-17, plus or minus 100,000 units, we'll take that right away,"" we're going to take a bigger piece of the pie. So I think that's then going to be incumbent upon retailers to really push back where appropriate and say, ""That's more than we -- that's more than this marketplace is going to take, particularly on the car side."" To the extent you can increase production on trucks, that's fine. But it's got to be substitution for cars. It's not incremental business. I think that's a solid plan. I think if retailers push back on a very aggressive production plan -- and by the way, we're being given very aggressive stair-step targets also, which, again, indicate that individually, they're planning for significant growth. So the ball is kicked. Debate is underway. And hopefully, the industry can manage it successfully because it's going to -- the challenge for the industry I see over the next several years is we can have multiple years above '17 with the pent-up demand that's out there. But in a plateau new vehicle market, can we grow earnings and the quality of earnings? Or are we going to have a share fight that results in ruinous incentives for the manufacturers and for retailers? I think that's sort of the line we're trying to walk down at the moment."

That's the big-picture issue. So it's very interesting, our fourth quarter performance, whereby manufacturers increasing incentives by $250 a car; us, increasing our discount by $220 a car. That had an immediate impact on our used car values. And then, we had to discount anything that was relatively new versus the new vehicle in the showroom floor. So it's a double impact. It impacted our new vehicle gross margin and impacted our used vehicle gross margin. So that's the biggest issue, and that's my greatest concern about overproduction. And you could say, ""Mike, what do you care if the manufacturers increased their incentives significantly? You'll just sell more new cars."" Well, it pulls the rug out from underneath the value of my used car inventory. And also to your point, it really disappoints your existing owner base, your most loyal customers, because you've depreciated ultimately the value of their trade-in. So it's really a lose-lose. It's a lose in the short term and a lose in the long term. And I really would not want to see incentives go beyond on the manufacturer level. They're about 10% of suggested retail price at the moment. So we're approaching double digits, and I really hope we don't go beyond that. Now to your point of mix, this mix adjustment, cars versus trucks, has been going on. It's -- so it's not a shock. It's been -- we've gone from 45% trucks a few years ago to 60% trucks in the month of December. It's been a journey. There's been adjustments along the way.

You didn't really have a whole lot you anticipated that were new in terms of long-term cost implications. What are you learning as you go through this?"

So that's not an issue. It's a significant impact on preowned. Now just to discuss the issue for a moment, I think the auto industry really had some credibility issues it has to face up to, everything from some of these horrific recalls we've had with significant loss of life to credibility issues around the Volkswagen situation. So we sit there and say, ""What can we do on our part to make it better?? Well on preowned, this is a significant issue. On any given day, 15% of our inventory had open recalls. Now let me be clear, these are not the wrong tire pressure, sticker isn't on the car or some other little minor item, it doesn't have an owners manual. That's on new cars when they're first released. You get the sticker issue. Or the owner's manual issue, you have 1 page missing. These are significant safety recall. And we feel that time has passed, that it's appropriate to take a vehicle in trade with a significant safety recall and turn around the next day and sell it to a consumer. So we're the only one that's done it. We think it's a brand attribute. We will work to make it a brand attribute in 2016. And we feel in the long term, it will be a tremendous advantage to us. In the meantime, it is very disruptive to our used car business because we see no way to get it below 15%. There's new recalls arriving every day, and we have to increase inventory to get to the same point. And we -- I think we're in the frontline availability. And at the same time, we have to then work very hard to get the vehicles repaired as promptly as possible. So it remains a disruptive issue. I would say if I looked at our declining front-end gross for the fourth quarter on used vehicle, I would put the majority of it to higher incentives from the manufacturers and higher new vehicle discounts from us. But recall disruption remains part of it and probably will continue for the first half of the year until -- while we get it all sorted out."

You didn't hear much discussion about it because it's a complete success. We made the pivot last year away from third-party lead providers who required a substantial additional discount in order to get the business and were expensive to do business with. The third-party lead providers who we stayed with are now about 8% of our business overall. We have a wonderful new partnership, where we're allowed to bring our brand into their sites, which we -- and that is a condition of doing business with us. And so that is a huge step forward. And as I said, we've gone from trending towards 15% of the business with third parties. In a couple of more years, it would have been 20%. Now it's going in the other direction, and that gives us more resources to go into our brand. We now generate fully 25% of our business from AutoNation site, which is a spectacular success. The customers like the ability to be able to transact on the site. We still have capabilities that we're adding step-by-step that continue to roll out. I think the most difficult piece remains the documentation that may push into 2017. There's different pieces of it that we can get done, but we need some regulatory change to get it completely done. So that's probably rolling into 2017. Everything else we talked about, we expect to have operational in 2016. There is a cost to just continue with this level of digital intensity. I have no issue with that. But I don't see -- I think I said this already in the fourth quarter. As far as investment in digital, we've probably hit peak. We'll run at that in 2016 and after that, be able to go down to more of a maintenance level. But you can check with me a year from now on that when we get the final plan on how we're going to tackle documentation."

For the full year, adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $3.98, up 14% over prior year.
Fourth quarter 2015 revenue totaled $5.3 billion compared to $5 billion in the year-ago period, an increase of 6%, driven by stronger performance in all our business sectors. Total gross profit was $812 million compared to $784 million in the year-ago period, an increase of 4%. Operating income was $200 million compared to $227 million in the year-ago period, a decrease of 12%. In the fourth quarter, AutoNation's retail new vehicle unit sales increased 4% overall or 1% on a same-store basis.
The fourth quarter industry sales environment was more push than pull, resulting in significant new and used vehicle margin declines on a combined basis of $217 per vehicle retailed, which is 11% lower than the fourth quarter of 2014. During the quarter, we experienced particular weakness in Premium Luxury, which had a significant impact on our fourth quarter financial results. We have begun and will continue through the first quarter to take the necessary steps to align our cost, inventory and pricing strategy to the current market.
Revenue for the full year was $20.9 billion, up 9% over prior year. Total gross profit was $3.3 billion compared to $3 billion in the year-ago period, an increase of 9%. Operating income for the full year was $873 million, an increase of 6% over prior year. Our [indiscernible] assumption for 2016 industry new vehicle unit sales is above $17 million for the year.

For the fourth quarter, we reported adjusted net income from continuing operations of $107 million or $0.96 per share versus net income of $117 million or $1.02 per share during the fourth quarter of 2014, a 6% decrease on a per share basis. Our fourth quarter 2015 results exclude a noncash impairment charge of $9.6 million after-tax or $0.09 per share related to the franchise rights asset of our Volkswagen stores. There were no adjustments to net income in the fourth quarter of the prior year.
Revenues during the quarter increased $292 million or 6% compared to the prior year, and gross profit improved $29 million or 4%. SG&A as a percentage of gross profit was 70% for the quarter, which represents a 210 basis point increase compared to the year-ago period. Due to the gross profit pressure in the fourth quarter, SG&A as a percentage of gross profit did not benefit from the normal seasonal strength in premium luxury vehicle sales. As we continue to adjust our cost structure to the current environment, our SG&A as a percentage of growth is expected to remain under pressure.
The provision for income tax in the quarter was $61.3 million or 38.5%. Net new vehicle floorplan was a benefit of $15.1 million, which was relatively flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 as increased floorplan balances were largely offset by higher sales and increased floorplan assistance per unit. Floorplan debt increased sequentially approximately $523 million during the fourth quarter to $3.7 billion at quarter end, primarily due to increased inventory balances.
Non-vehicle interest expense increased to $26.5 million compared to $22.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. The $4.4 million increase in interest expense was driven by the issuance of our senior unsecured notes in September, which have higher rates than our revolving credit facility as well as higher average debt balances. The increased senior notes rate was partially offset by lower interest rates associated with our credit facility refinancing and the issuance of our commercial paper program. At the end of December, we had $2.4 billion of non-vehicle debt, an increase of $162 million compared to September 30, 2015. Non-vehicle debt includes $600 million of outstanding commercial paper borrowings. 
At the end of December, we had no amounts drawn under our revolving credit facility. As a consequence, our non-vehicle debt fixed to floating mix was approximately 75% fixed and 25% floating. I'll also note that we have no material debt maturities until late 2017.
For the full year 2015, we repurchased 3.9 million shares for $235 million at an average price of $60.49 per share. As of January 26, AutoNation had approximately $296 million of board authorization remaining for share repurchase, and there are approximately 111 million shares outstanding. This does not include the dilutive impact of stock options.
Our leverage ratio increased to 2.3x at the end of Q4 compared to 2.2x at the end of Q3. The leverage ratio was 2.1x on a net debt basis, including used floorplan availability, and our covenant limit is 3.75x.
Capital expenditures were $75.3 million for the quarter. Capital expenditures are on an accrual basis, excluding operating lease buyouts and related asset sales. 
Our quarter end cash balance was $74 million, which, combined with our additional borrowing capacity, resulted in total liquidity of $1.7 billion at the end of December. We continue to use our revolving credit facility as a liquidity backstop for borrowings under our commercial paper program. As I mentioned a moment ago, we have $600 million of outstanding commercial paper at quarter end, which, in effect, reduces our available liquidity to $1.1 billion.
Looking forward, we are focused on aligning our cost structure to better adjust to current market conditions and continuing to prudently allocate capital.

Gross profit for variable operations was $450 million, down 4%. Variable gross was $3,350 on a per vehicle retail basis, a decrease of $125 or 4%. New and used same-store unit volume was flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. New vehicle revenue for the quarter was $3 billion, an increase of $61 million or 2%. We retailed 82,900 units, an increase of 1%. New vehicle gross profit was $2,018 on a per vehicle retail basis, which was down 10% compared to the same period a year ago.
In the fourth quarter, we experienced a push rather than a pull environment. We saw margin compression, particularly in Premium Luxury segment. This offset the seasonal sequential increase in PVRs we typically expect in the fourth quarter. Coupled with the margin pressure in the fourth quarter, we also began to see a slowdown in Texas due to the collapsing energy prices, which are hurting the local economy.
In Texas, the new and used unit sales were down compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. In Florida, we continue to experience growth across the state. New and used units were up for the quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. As Mike mentioned earlier, we are taking steps to align our cost, inventory and pricing strategy with the current market conditions.
Used vehicle retail revenue for the quarter was $1 billion, an increase of $22 million or 2% compared to the period a year ago. Used vehicles retail were down 2% year-over-year at $52,000. Used unit gross profit was $1,436 on a per vehicle retail basis, a decrease of $246 or 15%. As of year-end, approximately 6% of our inventory was not available for sale due to open recalls. The held inventory represents less than 2% of our new vehicle inventory and approximately 16% of our used vehicle inventory. 
As we stated in the third quarter, we did see an impact on our used vehicle sales due to our recall policy. We continue to implement systems and processes in support of our efforts to ensure no vehicle with an open recall is retailed. We continue to lead in the long-term safety benefit, where our customers far outweigh any short-term impact to our results and further support the AutoNation brand promise.
Customer financial services gross profit was $1,556 on a per vehicle retail basis, an increase of $109 or 8%. Total gross profit for customer financial services was $210 million. It was up $14 million or 7% compared to the period a year ago.
In the quarter, customer care revenue was $751 million, an increase of $28 million or 4%. Customer care gross profit was $326 million, an increase of $24 million or 8%. Customer pay gross was $129 million, up 9%. Warranty gross was $66 million, up 7%. Collision gross was $31 million, up 11%.

And just coincidentally, it appears that in November is when you closed this very large acquisition. Did that have anything to do with it or is it something else?"

So we've taken steps to begin to bring our inventories in line. Obviously, there's a lot of lead time on our orders. So we'll see some progress in the first quarter, but it'll probably take the second quarter. But even if we do that, if the industry overproduces and keeps inventory at a high level, that means the overall environment is still very difficult and very competitive even though we may have our house in order within this. It certainly puts us in a better position, but it's not a full answer. So that remains to be seen. I think if you go back to the period of 2000 through 2006, the industry plateaued at an average of 17 million units a year, but clearly overproduced and had high inventories, which put tremendous pressure on manufacturers' resale values and retailers' front-end gross. So I really hope we don't repeat that history and that we go a new way this time."

All the -- almost all the excess inventory is in cars, not in trucks. So the extent that you have strength in trucks and can produce more trucks, you're going to thrive in 2016. I think Sergio's decision to switch over factories from car production to truck production shows you the sense that the consumer has, that they are totally committed to cheap gas and to trucks. It's really become a strategic question, not a tactical question. So wherever you will stand on trucks is your position of strength in the marketplace. So that's very different than 2000 in a domestic -- from a starting point, the domestics are in a very good position. I would've hoped during this period of growth the industry could've gotten some of its benchmarks more accurate so that when we have a GAAP conversation versus an industry conversation, it could be more meaningful. Here, I point to the obsolete industry calendar that moves days around willy-nilly in a -- it was originally done because we used to mail sales reports in. We're in a digital age. They should -- when the month ends, they should close the month digitally. I also have a long-standing issue with the days supply calculation in that fleet sales are counted in retail selling rates, which is a major distortion. So pointing to industry figures to try to figure out what's going on is not always helpful, and making a comparison then to GAAP figures gets particularly difficult. So those issues are not resolved. They still sit there. But I think, John, to your principal point, the industry is in much better shape today than it was in 2000, both from a structural point of view and that we're at the beginning of this plateau and there's still time to adjust.

I expressed my plateau point of view on CNBC the first week of January and then got on a plane and went to the Detroit motor show. I would say the overall discussion agreed that 6 years of rapid growth are over, that the industry is plateauing at a very high, very acceptable level. And no one is really saying, ""This thing is going to blow by 18 million to 18.5 million"" or something within the industry. I know there's some others out there that have a point of view that that's going to happen. If that were to happen, I can tell you this, it would take significant price action that would be pulling forward future business from my point of view. Now unfortunately, every executive is very confident and optimistic about their position in the marketplace, and they have plans for growth in 2016. So if you add up everyone's individual plan, you have this classic situation that everyone's going to take share. But that means they've set the plants to run to go out and achieve that. So while they're being conservative and disciplined in saying, ""The total market is probably mid-17, plus or minus 100,000 units, we'll take that right away,"" we're going to take a bigger piece of the pie. So I think that's then going to be incumbent upon retailers to really push back where appropriate and say, ""That's more than we -- that's more than this marketplace is going to take, particularly on the car side."" To the extent you can increase production on trucks, that's fine. But it's got to be substitution for cars. It's not incremental business. I think that's a solid plan. I think if retailers push back on a very aggressive production plan -- and by the way, we're being given very aggressive stair-step targets also, which, again, indicate that individually, they're planning for significant growth. So the ball is kicked. Debate is underway. And hopefully, the industry can manage it successfully because it's going to -- the challenge for the industry I see over the next several years is we can have multiple years above 17 million with the pent-up demand that's out there. But in a plateau new vehicle market, can we grow earnings and the quality of earnings? Or are we going to have a share fight that results in ruinous incentives for the manufacturers and for retailers? I think that's sort of the line we're trying to walk down at the moment."

It impacted our new vehicle gross margin and impacted our used vehicle gross margin. So that's the biggest issue, and that's my greatest concern about overproduction. And you could say, ""Mike, what do you care if the manufacturers increased their incentives significantly? You'll just sell more new cars."" Well, it pulls the rug out from underneath the value of my used car inventory. And also to your point, it really disappoints your existing owner base, your most loyal customers, because you've depreciated ultimately the value of their trade-in. So it's really a lose-lose. It's a lose in the short term and a lose in the long term. And I really would not want to see incentives go beyond on the manufacturer level. They're about 10% of suggested retail price at the moment. So we're approaching double digits, and I really hope we don't go beyond that. Now to your point of mix, this mix adjustment, cars versus trucks, has been going on. It's -- so it's not a shock.

I was wondering if you saw any evidence of that flowing through to the market. Or do you think that this is something that could have some impact on credit availability or the F&I business?"

So that's not an issue. It's a significant impact on preowned. Now just to discuss the issue for a moment, I think the auto industry really had some credibility issues it has to face up to, everything from some of these horrific recalls we've had with significant loss of life to credibility issues around the Volkswagen situation. So we sit there and say, ""What can we do on our part to make it better?? Well on preowned, this is a significant issue. On any given day, 15% of our inventory has open recalls. Now let me be clear, these are not the wrong tire pressure, sticker isn't on the car or some other little minor item, it doesn't have an owner's manual. That's on new cars when they're first released. You get the sticker issue. Or the owner's manual issue, you have 1 page missing. These are significant safety recalls. And we feel the time has passed that it's appropriate to take a vehicle in trade with a significant safety recall and turn around the next day and sell it to a consumer. So we're the only one that's done it. We think it's a brand attribute. We will work to make it a brand attribute in 2016. And we feel in the long term, it will be a tremendous advantage to us. In the meantime, it is very disruptive to our used car business because we see no way to get it below 15%. There's new recalls arriving every day, and we have to increase inventory to get to the same point. And we -- it takes away your frontline availability, and at the same time, we have to then work very hard to get the vehicles repaired as promptly as possible. So it remains a disruptive issue. I would say if I looked at our declining front-end gross for the fourth quarter on used vehicle, I would put the majority of it to higher incentives from the manufacturers and higher new vehicle discounts from us. But recall disruption remains part of it and probably will continue for the first half of the year until -- while we get it all sorted out."

You didn't hear much discussion about it because it's a complete success. We made the pivot last year away from third-party lead providers who required a substantial additional discount in order to get the business and were expensive to do business with. The third-party lead providers who we stayed with are now about 8% of our business overall. We have a wonderful new partnership where we're allowed to bring our brand into their sites, which we -- and that is a condition of doing business with us. And so that is a huge step forward. And as I said, we've gone from trending towards 15% of the business with third parties. In a couple of more years, it would have been 20%. Now it's going in the other direction, and that gives us more resources to go into our brand. We now generate fully 25% of our business from AutoNation site, which is a spectacular success. The customers like the ability to be able to transact on the site. We still have capabilities that we're adding step-by-step that continue to roll out. I think the most difficult piece remains the documentation that may push into 2017. There's different pieces of it that we can get done, but we need some regulatory change to get it completely done. So that's probably rolling into 2017. Everything else we talked about, we expect to have operational in 2016. There is a cost to just continue with this level of digital intensity. I have no issue with that. But I don't see -- I think I said this already in the fourth quarter. As far as investment in digital, we've probably hit peak. We'll run at that in 2016 and after that, be able to go down to more of a maintenance level. But you can check with me a year from now on that when we get the final plan on how we're going to tackle documentation."

Today, we reported adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $0.96, a 6% decrease on a -- as compared to EPS from continuing operations of $1.02 for the same period in the prior year. For the full year, adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $3.98, up 14% over prior year.
Fourth quarter 2015 revenue totaled $5.3 billion compared to $5 billion in the year ago period, an increase of 6%, driven by stronger performance in all our business sectors. Total gross profit was $812 million compared to $784 million in the year ago period, an increase of 4%. Operating income was $200 million compared to $227 million in the year ago period, a decrease of 12%. In the fourth quarter, AutoNation's retail new vehicle unit sales increased 4% overall or 1% on a same-store basis.
The fourth quarter industry sales environment was more push than pull, resulting in significant new and used vehicle margin declines on a combined basis of $217 per vehicle retailed, which is 11% lower than the fourth quarter of 2014. During the quarter, we experienced particular weakness in Premium Luxury, which had a significant impact on our fourth quarter financial results. We have begun and will continue through the first quarter to take the necessary steps to align our cost, inventory and pricing strategy to the current market.
Revenue for the full year was $20.9 billion, up 9% over prior year. Total gross profit was $3.3 billion compared to $3 billion in the year ago period, an increase of 9%. Operating income for the full year was $873 million, an increase of 6% over prior year. Our planning assumption for 2016 industry new vehicle unit sales is above $17 million for the year.

For the fourth quarter, we reported adjusted net income from continuing operations of $107 million or $0.96 per share versus net income of $117 million or $1.02 per share during the fourth quarter of 2014, a 6%",649,"Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. For the fourth quarter, we reported adjusted net income from continuing operations of $107 million or $0.96 per share versus net income of $117 million or $1.02 per share during the fourth quarter of 2014, a 6% decrease on a per share basis. Our fourth quarter 2015 results exclude a noncash impairment charge of $9.6 million after-tax or $0.09 per share related to the franchise rights asset of our Volkswagen stores. There were no adjustments to net income in the fourth quarter of the prior year.
Revenues during the quarter increased $292 million or 6% compared to the prior year, and gross profit improved $29 million or 4%. SG&A as a percentage of gross profit was 70% for the quarter, which represents a 210 basis point increase compared to the year ago period. Due to the gross profit pressure in the fourth quarter, SG&A as a percentage of gross profit did not benefit from the normal seasonal strength in premium luxury vehicle sales. As we continue to adjust our cost structure to the current environment, our SG&A as a percentage of growth is expected to remain under pressure.
The provision for income tax in the quarter was $61.3 million or 38.5%. Net new vehicle floorplan was a benefit of $15.1 million, which was relatively flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 as increased floorplan balances were largely offset by higher sales and increased floorplan assistance per unit. Floorplan debt increased sequentially approximately $523 million during the fourth quarter to $3.7 billion at quarter end, primarily due to increased inventory balances.
Non-vehicle interest expense increased to $26.5 million compared to $22.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. The $4.4 million increase in interest expense was driven by the issuance of our senior unsecured notes in September, which have higher rates than our revolving credit facility as well as higher average debt balances. The increased senior notes rate was partially offset by lower interest rates associated with our credit facility refinancing and the issuance of our commercial paper program. At the end of December, we had $2.4 billion of non-vehicle debt, an increase of $162 million compared to September 30, 2015. Non-vehicle debt includes $600 million of outstanding commercial paper borrowings. 
At the end of December, we had no amounts drawn under our revolving credit facility. As a consequence, our non-vehicle debt fixed to floating mix was approximately 75% fixed and 25% floating. I'll also note that we have no material debt maturities until late 2017.
For the full year 2015, we repurchased 3.9 million shares for $235 million at an average price of $60.49 per share. As of January 26, AutoNation had approximately $296 million of board authorization remaining for share repurchase, and there are approximately 111 million shares outstanding. This does not include the dilutive impact of stock options.
Our leverage ratio increased to 2.3x at the end of Q4 compared to 2.2x at the end of Q3. The leverage ratio was 2.1x on a net debt basis, including used floorplan availability, and our covenant limit is 3.75x.
Capital expenditures were $75.3 million for the quarter. Capital expenditures are on an accrual basis, excluding operating lease buyouts and related asset sales. 
Our quarter end cash balance was $74 million, which, combined with our additional borrowing capacity, resulted in total liquidity of $1.7 billion at the end of December. We continue to use our revolving credit facility as a liquidity backstop for borrowings under our commercial paper program. As I mentioned a moment ago, we have $600 million of outstanding commercial paper at quarter end, which, in effect, reduces our available liquidity to $1.1 billion.
Looking forward, we are focused on aligning our cost structure to better adjust to current market conditions and continuing to prudently allocate capital.
Now let me turn you over to our Chief Operating Officer, Bill Berman."

Gross profit for variable operations was $450 million, down 4%. Variable gross was $3,350 on a per vehicle retail basis, a decrease of $125 or 4%. New and used same-store unit volume was flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. New vehicle revenue for the quarter was $3 billion, an increase of $61 million or 2%. We retailed 82,900 units, an increase of 1%. New vehicle gross profit was $2,018 on a per vehicle retail basis, which was down 10% compared to the same period a year ago.
In the fourth quarter, we experienced a push rather than a pull environment. We saw margin compression, particularly in Premium Luxury segment. This offset the seasonal sequential increase in PVRs we typically expect in the fourth quarter. Coupled with the margin pressure in the fourth quarter, we also began to see a slowdown in Texas due to the collapsing energy prices, which are hurting the local economy.
In Texas, the new and used unit sales were down compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. In Florida, we continue to experience growth across the state. New and used units were up for the quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. As Mike mentioned earlier, we are taking steps to align our cost, inventory and pricing strategy with the current market conditions.
Used vehicle retail revenue for the quarter was $1 billion, an increase of $22 million or 2% compared to the period a year ago. Used vehicles retail were down 2% year-over-year at $52,000. Used unit gross profit was $1,436 on a per vehicle retail basis, a decrease of $246 or 15%. As of year-end, approximately 6% of our inventory was not available for sale due to open recalls. The held inventory represents less than 2% of our new vehicle inventory and approximately 16% of our used vehicle inventory. 
As we stated in the third quarter, we did see an impact on our used vehicle sales due to our recall policy. We continue to implement systems and processes in support of our efforts to ensure no vehicle with an open recall is retailed. We continue to lead in the long-term safety benefit, where our customers far outweigh any short-term impact to our results and further support the AutoNation brand promise.
Customer financial services gross profit was $1,556 on a per vehicle retail basis, an increase of $109 or 8%. Total gross profit for customer financial services was $210 million. It was up $14 million or 7% compared to the period a year ago.
In the quarter, customer care revenue was $751 million, an increase of $28 million or 4%. Customer care gross profit was $326 million, an increase of $24 million or 8%. Customer pay gross was $129 million, up 9%. Warranty gross was $66 million, up 7%. Collision gross was $31 million, up 11%.
Finally, I'd like to welcome the Renton Honda associates at AutoNation family and thank all of our over 26,000 associates for their hard work and dedication.

In the first quarter of 2016, we are on track to complete the previously announced acquisition of the 12-store Allen Samuels Auto Group in Texas, which generates approximately $800 million in annual revenue. As of today, our store portfolio numbers 342 franchises and 254 stores in 15 states representing 35 manufacturer brands. These numbers will grow to 373 franchises and 266 stores upon completion of the Allen Samuels acquisition.
Looking forward, we will continue to actively pursue acquisitions and new store opportunities with a focus on enhancing brand representation within our existing markets and markets that can be supported by our existing management infrastructure.

So we've taken steps to begin to bring our inventories in line. Obviously, there's a lot of lead time on our orders. So we'll see some progress in the first quarter, but it'll probably take the second quarter. But even if we do that, if the industry overproduces and keeps inventory at a high level, that means the overall environment is still very difficult and very competitive even though we may have our house in order within this. It certainly puts us in a better position, but it's not a full answer. So that remains to be seen. I think if you go back to the period of 2000 through 2006, the industry plateaued at an average of 17 million units a year, but clearly overproduced and had high inventories, which put tremendous pressure on manufacturers' resale values and retailers' front-end gross. So I really hope we don't repeat that history and that we go a new way this time."

All the -- almost all the excess inventory is in cars, not in trucks. So the extent that you have strength in trucks and can produce more trucks, you're going to thrive in 2016. I think Sergio's decision to switch over factories from car production to truck production shows you the sense that the consumer has, that they are totally committed to cheap gas and to trucks. It's really become a strategic question, not a tactical question. So wherever you will stand on trucks is your position of strength in the marketplace. So that's very different than 2000 in a domestic -- from a starting point, the domestics are in a very good position. I would've hoped during this period of growth the industry could've gotten some of its benchmarks more accurate so that when we have a GAAP conversation versus an industry conversation, it could be more meaningful. Here, I point to the obsolete industry calendar that moves days around willy-nilly in a -- it was originally done because we used to mail sales reports in. We're in a digital age. They should -- when the month ends, they should close the month digitally. I also have a long-standing issue with the days supply calculation in that fleet sales are counted in retail selling rates, which is a major distortion. So pointing to industry figures to try to figure out what's going on is not always helpful, and making a comparison then to GAAP figures gets particularly difficult. So those issues are not resolved. They still sit there. But I think, John, to your principal point, the industry is in much better shape today than it was in 2000, both from a structural point of view and that we're at the beginning of this plateau and there's still time to adjust. There's a particular overhang in Premium Luxury, which will take some time to work through."

I expressed my plateau point of view on CNBC the first week of January and then got on a plane and went to the Detroit motor show. I would say the overall discussion agreed that 6 years of rapid growth are over, that the industry is plateauing at a very high, very acceptable level. And no one is really saying, ""This thing is going to blow by 18 million to 18.5 million"" or something within the industry. I know there's some others out there that have a point of view that that's going to happen. If that were to happen, I can tell you this, it would take significant price action that would be pulling forward future business from my point of view. Now unfortunately, every executive is very confident and optimistic about their position in the marketplace, and they have plans for growth in 2016. So if you add up everyone's individual plan, you have this classic situation that everyone's going to take share. But that means they've set the plants to run to go out and achieve that. So while they're being conservative and disciplined in saying, ""The total market is probably mid-17, plus or minus 100,000 units, we'll take that right away,"" we're going to take a bigger piece of the pie. So I think that's then going to be incumbent upon retailers to really push back where appropriate and say, ""That's more than we -- that's more than this marketplace is going to take, particularly on the car side."" To the extent you can increase production on trucks, that's fine. But it's got to be substitution for cars. It's not incremental business. I think that's a solid plan. I think if retailers push back on a very aggressive production plan -- and by the way, we're being given very aggressive stair-step targets also, which, again, indicate that individually, they're planning for significant growth. So the ball is kicked. Debate is underway. And hopefully, the industry can manage it successfully because it's going to -- the challenge for the industry I see over the next several years is we can have multiple years above 17 million with the pent-up demand that's out there. But in a plateau new vehicle market, can we grow earnings and the quality of earnings? Or are we going to have a share fight that results in ruinous incentives for the manufacturers and for retailers? I think that's sort of the line we're trying to walk down at the moment."

That's the big-picture issue. So it's very interesting, our fourth quarter performance, whereby manufacturers increasing incentives by $250 a car; us, increasing our discount by $220 a car. That had an immediate impact on our used car values. And then, we had to discount anything that was relatively new versus the new vehicle in the showroom floor. So it's a double impact. It impacted our new vehicle gross margin and impacted our used vehicle gross margin. So that's the biggest issue, and that's my greatest concern about overproduction. And you could say, ""Mike, what do you care if the manufacturers increased their incentives significantly? You'll just sell more new cars."" Well, it pulls the rug out from underneath the value of my used car inventory. And also to your point, it really disappoints your existing owner base, your most loyal customers, because you've depreciated ultimately the value of their trade-in. So it's really a lose-lose. It's a lose in the short term and a lose in the long term. And I really would not want to see incentives go beyond on the manufacturer level. They're about 10% of suggested retail price at the moment. So we're approaching double digits, and I really hope we don't go beyond that. Now to your point of mix, this mix adjustment, cars versus trucks, has been going on. It's -- so it's not a shock. It's been -- we've gone from 45% trucks a few years ago to 60% trucks in the month of December. It's been a journey. There's been adjustments along the way. So I think that's more baked in the cake at the moment than a new development. So it's more where are incentives going? Where are inventories production going? And what will that mean to resale value is my #1 concern."

So that's not an issue. It's a significant impact on preowned. Now just to discuss the issue for a moment, I think the auto industry really had some credibility issues it has to face up to, everything from some of these horrific recalls we've had with significant loss of life to credibility issues around the Volkswagen situation. So we sit there and say, ""What can we do on our part to make it better?? Well on preowned, this is a significant issue. On any given day, 15% of our inventory has open recalls. Now let me be clear, these are not the wrong tire pressure, sticker isn't on the car or some other little minor item, it doesn't have an owner's manual. That's on new cars when they're first released. You get the sticker issue. Or the owner's manual issue, you have 1 page missing. These are significant safety recalls. And we feel the time has passed that it's appropriate to take a vehicle in trade with a significant safety recall and turn around the next day and sell it to a consumer. So we're the only one that's done it. We think it's a brand attribute. We will work to make it a brand attribute in 2016. And we feel in the long term, it will be a tremendous advantage to us. In the meantime, it is very disruptive to our used car business because we see no way to get it below 15%. There's new recalls arriving every day, and we have to increase inventory to get to the same point. And we -- it takes away your frontline availability, and at the same time, we have to then work very hard to get the vehicles repaired as promptly as possible. So it remains a disruptive issue. I would say if I looked at our declining front-end gross for the fourth quarter on used vehicle, I would put the majority of it to higher incentives from the manufacturers and higher new vehicle discounts from us. But recall disruption remains part of it and probably will continue for the first half of the year until -- while we get it all sorted out."

You didn't hear much discussion about it because it's a complete success. We made the pivot last year away from third-party lead providers who required a substantial additional discount in order to get the business and were expensive to do business with.

We have a wonderful new partnership where we're allowed to bring our brand into their sites, which we -- and that is a condition of doing business with us. And so that is a huge step forward. And as I said, we've gone from trending towards 15% of the business with third parties. In a couple of more years, it would have been 20%. Now it's going in the other direction, and that gives us more resources to go into our brand. We now generate fully 25% of our business from AutoNation site, which is a spectacular success. The customers like the ability to be able to transact on the site. We still have capabilities that we're adding step-by-step that continue to roll out. I think the most difficult piece remains the documentation that may push into 2017. There's different pieces of it that we can get done, but we need some regulatory change to get it completely done. So that's probably rolling into 2017. Everything else we talked about, we expect to have operational in 2016. There is a cost to just continue with this level of digital intensity. I have no issue with that. But I don't see -- I think I said this already in the fourth quarter. As far as investment in digital, we've probably hit peak.

Today, we reported adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $0.96, a 6% decrease on a -- as compared to EPS from continuing operations of $1.02 for the same period in the prior year. For the full year, adjusted EPS from continuing operations was $3.98, up 14% over prior year.
Fourth quarter 2015 revenue totaled $5.3 billion compared to $5 billion in the year ago period, an increase of 6%, driven by stronger performance in all our business sectors. Total gross profit was $812 million compared to $784 million in the year ago period, an increase of 4%. Operating income was $200 million compared to $227 million in the year ago period, a decrease of 12%. In the fourth quarter, AutoNation's retail new vehicle unit sales increased 4% overall or 1% on a same-store basis.
The fourth quarter industry sales environment was more push than pull, resulting in significant new and used vehicle margin declines on a combined basis of $217 per vehicle retailed, which is 11% lower than the fourth quarter of 2014. During the quarter, we experienced particular weakness in Premium Luxury, which had a significant impact on our fourth quarter financial results. We have begun and we'll continue through the first quarter to take the necessary steps to align our cost, inventory and pricing strategy to the current market.
Revenue for the full year was $20.9 billion, up 9% over prior year. Total gross profit was $3.3 billion compared to $3 billion in the year ago period, an increase of 9%. Operating income for the full year was $873 million, an increase of 6% over prior year. Our planning assumption for 2016 industry new vehicle unit sales is above $17 million for the year.
I now turn over to our Chief Financial Officer, Cheryl Miller."

For the fourth quarter, we reported adjusted net income from continuing operations of $107 million or $0.96 per share versus net income of $117 million or $1.02 per share during the fourth quarter of 2014, a 6%",649,"Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. For the fourth quarter, we reported adjusted net income from continuing operations of $107 million or $0.96 per share versus net income of $117 million or $1.02 per share during the fourth quarter of 2014, a 6% decrease on a per share basis. Our fourth quarter 2015 results exclude a noncash impairment charge of $9.6 million after-tax or $0.09 per share related to the franchise rights asset of our Volkswagen stores. There were no adjustments to net income in the fourth quarter of the prior year.
Revenues during the quarter increased $292 million or 6% compared to the prior year, and gross profit improved $29 million or 4%. SG&A as a percentage of gross profit was 70% for the quarter, which represents a 210 basis point increase compared to the year ago period. Due to the gross profit pressure in the fourth quarter, SG&A as a percentage of gross profit did not benefit from the normal seasonal strength in premium luxury vehicle sales. As we continue to adjust our cost structure to the current environment, our SG&A as a percentage of growth is expected to remain under pressure.
The provision for income tax in the quarter was $61.3 million or 38.5%. Net new vehicle floorplan was a benefit of $15.1 million, which was relatively flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 as increased floorplan balances were largely offset by higher sales and increased floorplan assistance per unit. Floorplan debt increased sequentially approximately $523 million during the fourth quarter to $3.7 billion at quarter end, primarily due to increased inventory balances.
Non-vehicle interest expense increased to $26.5 million compared to $22.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. The $4.4 million increase in interest expense was driven by the issuance of our senior unsecured notes in September, which have higher rates than our revolving credit facility as well as higher average debt balances. The increased senior notes rate was partially offset by lower interest rates associated with our credit facility refinancing and the issuance of our commercial paper program. At the end of December, we had $2.4 billion of non-vehicle debt, an increase of $162 million compared to September 30, 2015. Non-vehicle debt includes $600 million of outstanding commercial paper borrowings. 
At the end of December, we had no amounts drawn under our revolving credit facility. As a consequence, our non-vehicle debt fixed to floating mix was approximately 75% fixed and 25% floating. I'll also note that we have no material debt maturities until late 2017.
For the full year 2015, we repurchased 3.9 million shares for $235 million at an average price of $60.49 per share. As of January 26, AutoNation had approximately $296 million of board authorization remaining for share repurchase, and there are approximately 111 million shares outstanding. This does not include the dilutive impact of stock options.
Our leverage ratio increased to 2.3x at the end of Q4 compared to 2.2x at the end of Q3. The leverage ratio is 2.1x on a net debt basis, including used floorplan availability, and our covenant limit is 3.75x. Capital expenditures were $75.3 million for the quarter. Capital expenditures are on an accrual basis, excluding operating lease buyouts and related asset sales. 
Our quarter end cash balance was $74 million, which, combined with our additional borrowing capacity, resulted in total liquidity of $1.7 billion at the end of December. We continue to use our revolving credit facility as a liquidity backstop for borrowings under our commercial paper program. As I mentioned a moment ago, we have $600 million of outstanding commercial paper at quarter end, which, in effect, reduces our available liquidity to $1.1 billion. Looking forward, we are focused on aligning our cost structure to better adjust to current market conditions and continuing to prudently allocate capital.
Now let me turn you over to our Chief Operating Officer, Bill Berman."

Gross profit for variable operations was $450 million, down 4%. Variable gross was $3,350 on a per vehicle retail basis, a decrease of $125 or 4%. New and used same-store unit volume was flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. New vehicle revenue for the quarter was $3 billion, an increase of $61 million or 2%. We retailed 82,900 units, an increase of 1%. New vehicle gross profit was $2,018 on a per vehicle retail basis, which was down 10% compared to the same period a year ago.
In the fourth quarter, we experienced a push rather than a pull environment. We saw margin compression, particularly in Premium Luxury segment. This offset the seasonal sequential increase in PVRs we typically expect in the fourth quarter. Coupled with the margin pressure in the fourth quarter, we also began to see a slowdown in Texas due to collapsing energy prices, which are hurting the local economy.
In Texas, the new and used unit sales were down compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. In Florida, we continue to experience growth across the state. New and used units were up for the quarter compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. As Mike mentioned earlier, we are taking steps to align our cost, inventory and pricing strategy with the current market conditions.
Used vehicle retail revenue for the quarter was $1 billion, an increase of $22 million or 2% compared to the period a year ago. Used vehicles retail were down 2% year-over-year at $52,000. Used unit gross profit was $1,436 on a per vehicle retail basis, a decrease of $246 or 15%. As of year-end, approximately 6% of our inventory was not available for sale due to open recalls. The held inventory represents less than 2% of our new vehicle inventory and approximately 16% of our used vehicle inventory. 
As we stated in the third quarter, we did see an impact on our used vehicle sales due to our recall policy. We continue to implement systems and processes in support of our efforts to ensure no vehicle with an open recall is retailed. We continue to live in the long-term safety benefit for our customers far outweigh any short-term impact to our results and further support the AutoNation brand promise.
Customer financial services gross profit was $1,556 on a per vehicle retail basis, an increase of $109 or 8%. Total gross profit for customer financial services was $210 million, was up $14 million or 7% compared to the period a year ago.
In the quarter, customer care revenue was $751 million, an increase of $28 million or 4%. Customer care gross profit was $326 million, an increase of $24 million or 8%. Customer pay gross was $129 million, up 9%. Warranty gross was $66 million, up 7%. Collision gross was $31 million, up 11%.
Finally, I'd like to welcome the Renton Honda associates to the AutoNation family and thank all of our over 26,000 associates for their hard work and dedication.

In the first quarter of 2016, we are on track to complete the previously announced acquisition of the 12-store Allen Samuels Auto Group in Texas, which generates approximately $800 million in annual revenue. As of today, our store portfolio numbers 342 franchises and 254 stores in 15 states representing 35 manufacturer brands. These numbers will grow to 373 franchises and 266 stores upon completion of the Allen Samuels acquisition.
Looking forward, we will continue to actively pursue acquisitions and new store opportunities with a focus on enhancing brand representation within our existing markets and markets that can be supported by our existing management infrastructure.

second quarter. But even after we do that, if the industry overproduces and keeps inventory at a high level, that means the overall environment is still very difficult and very competitive even though we may have our house in order within this. It certainly puts us in a better position, but it's not a full answer. So that remains to be seen. I think if you go back to the period of 2000 through 2006, the industry plateaued at an average of 17 million units a year, but clearly overproduced and had high inventories, which put tremendous pressure on manufacturers' resale values and retailers' front-end gross. So I really hope we don't repeat that history and that we go a new way this time."

All the -- almost all the excess inventory is in cars, not in trucks. So the extent that you have strength in trucks and can produce more trucks, you want to thrive in 2016. I think Sergio's decision to switch over factories from car production to truck production shows you the sense that the consumer has, that they are totally committed to cheap gas and to trucks. It's really become a strategic question, not a tactical question. So wherever you will stand on trucks is your position of strength in the marketplace. So that's very different than 2000 in the domestics -- from a starting point, the domestics are in a very good position. I would have hoped during this period of growth the industry could have gotten some of its benchmarks more accurate so that when we have a GAAP conversation versus an industry conversation, it could be more meaningful. Here, I point to the obsolete industry calendar that moves days around willy-nilly in a -- it was originally done because we used to mail sales reports in. We're in a digital age. They should -- when the month ends, they should close the month digitally. I also have a long-standing issue with the day supply calculation in that fleet sales are counted in retail selling rate, which is a major distortion. So pointing to industry figures to try to figure out what's going on is not always helpful in making a comparison than to GAAP figures gets particularly difficult. So those issues are not resolved. They still sit there. But I think, John, to your principal point, the industry is in much better shape today than it was in 2000, both from a structural point of view and that we're at the beginning of this plateau and there's still time to adjust. There's a particular overhang in Premium Luxury, which will take some time to work through."

I expressed my plateau point of view on CNBC the first week of January and then got on a plane and went to the Detroit motor show. I would say the overall discussion agreed that 6 years of rapid growth are over, that the industry is plateauing at a very high, very acceptable level. And no one is really saying, this thing is going to blow by 18 million to 18.5 million or something within the industry. I know there's some others out there that have a point of view that that's going to happen. If that were to happen, I can tell you this. It would take significant price action that would be pulling forward future business from my point of view. Now unfortunately, every executive is very confident and optimistic about their position in the marketplace and they have plans for growth in 2016. So if you add up everyone's individual plan, you have this classic situation that everyone's going to take share, but that means they've set the plants to run to go out and achieve that. So while they're being conservative and disciplined in saying the total market is probably mid-17 plus or minus 100,000 units, we'll take that right away, we're going to take a bigger piece of the pie. So I think that's then going to be incumbent upon retailers to really push back where appropriate and say that's more than we -- that's more than this marketplace is going to take, particularly on the car side. To the extent you can increase production on trucks, that's fine, but it's got to be substitution for cars. It's not incremental business. I think that's a solid plan. I think if retailers push back on a very aggressive production plan -- and by the way, we're being given very aggressive stair-step targets also, which again indicate that individually they're planning for significant growth. So the ball is kicked, debate is underway, and hopefully the industry can manage it successfully because it's going to -- the challenge for the industry I see over the next several years is we can have multiple years above 17 with the pent-up demand that's out there. But in a plateau new vehicle market, can we grow earnings and the quality of earnings? Or are we going to have a share fight that results in ruinous incentives for the manufacturers and for retailers. I think that's sort of the line we're trying to walk down at the moment."

That's the big picture issue. So it's very interesting, our fourth quarter performance, whereby manufacturers increasing incentives by $250 a car, us increasing our discount by $220 a car. That had an immediate impact on our used car values. And then we had to discount anything that was relatively new versus the new vehicle on the showroom floor. So it's a double impact. It impacted our new vehicle gross margin. It impact our used vehicle gross margin. So that's the biggest issue, and that's my greatest concern about overproduction. And you could say, Mike, what do you care if the manufacturers increase their incentive significantly? You'll just sell more new cars. Well, it pulls the rug out from underneath the value of my used car inventory. And also to your point, it really disappoints your existing owner base, your most loyal customers, because you've depreciated ultimately the value of their trade-in. So it's really a lose-lose. It's a lose in the short term and it's a lose in the long term. And I really would not want to see incentives go beyond on the manufacturer level. They are about 10% of suggested retail price at the moment. So we're approaching double digits, and I really hope we don't go beyond that. Now to your point of mix, this mix adjustment, cars versus trucks, has been going on. It's -- so it's not a shock. It's been -- we've gone from 45% trucks a few years ago to 60% trucks in the month of December. It's been a journey. There's been adjustments along the way. So I think that's more baked in the cake at the moment than a new development. So it's more where are incentives going, where are inventories production going, and what will that mean to resale value is my #1 concern."

So that's not an issue. It's a significant impact on preowned. Now just to discuss the issue for a moment, I think the auto industry really has some credibility issues it has to face up to, everything from some of these horrific recalls we've had with significant loss of life to credibility issues around the Volkswagen situation. So we sit there and say, what can we do on our part to make it better? Well on preowned, it's a significant issue. On any given day, 15% of our inventory has open recalls. Now let me be clear, these are not that the wrong tire pressure sticker isn't on the car or some other little minor item, it doesn't have an owner's manual. That's all new cars when they're first released. You get the sticker issue or the owner's manual issue. It has one page missing. These are significant safety recall. And we feel the time has passed that it's appropriate to take a vehicle in trade with a significant safety recall and turn around the next day and sell it to consumer. So we're the only one that's done it. We think it's a brand attribute. We will work to make it a brand attribute in 2016. And we feel in the long term, it will be a tremendous advantage to us. In the meantime, it is very disruptive to our used car business because we see no way to get it below 15%. There's new recalls arriving every day, and we have to increase inventory to get to the same point. And we -- a same point of frontline availability, and at the same time, we have to then work very hard to get the vehicles repaired as promptly as possible. So it remains a disruptive issue. I would say if I looked at our decline in front-end gross for the fourth quarter on used vehicle, I would put the majority of it to higher incentives from the manufacturers and higher new vehicle discounts from us. But recall disruption remains part of it and probably will continue for the first half of the year until -- while we get it all sorted out."

So I’m saying in 2015, the brand was strong enough that we could walk away from third-party lead providers and have the traffic come to our sites. And then the other piece of the puzzle was to invest in our digital capability, that once they came to our site, they were happy with the experience. So there, we're declaring victory. And as far as exactly where we are on that $100 million, I think we're probably through that. But there'll continue to be investments in '16. We've already said on the marketing side we'll adjust our spend this year versus last year, so that's part of it. And on digital, we'll probably run at the same level as '15 without an increase."

VW, correct, there is no fix that's been called out right now, but that represents a very small percentage of our business, less than 1%.

Today, we reported earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.90, a 7% decrease as compared to EPS from continuing operations of $0.97 for the same period in the prior year. EPS from continuing operations were negatively impacted by $0.06 per share, which included unusual related expenses of $0.03 and a shift approximately of $0.03 per share in stock-based compensation expense into the first quarter due to a change from quarterly to annual stock option grants. First quarter 2016 revenue totaled $5.1 billion compared to $4.9 billion a year ago, an increase of 4%. In the first quarter AutoNation's retail new vehicle unit sales increased 1% and were down 5% on the same-store basis. 
We continue to see declines in our premium luxury business which represents roughly 20% of our new vehicle unit sales compared to an industry at 9%. The same-store basis, our Premium Luxury profits declined 13% year-over-year. Our energy markets, which represented approximately 25% of our new vehicle unit sales compared to 13% for the industry, also saw profit declines. On a same-store basis, energy markets were down 20% compared to the first quarter in the prior year. 
The safety of our customers is a top priority for AutoNation. We will not retail any vehicle with an open recall, approximately 15% of our used vehicle units are on hold, of which 60% have been on hold for more than 30 days. I will further note, over 60% of our used inventory on hold is related to Takata airbags. The Takata airbag issue was in its early innings on what will be an ongoing issue that the industry faces.

For the first quarter, we reported net income from continuing operations of $96 million or $0.90 per share versus net income of $112 million or $0.97 per share during the first quarter of 2015, a 7% decrease on a per share basis. Net income from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2016 was negatively impacted by $0.06 per share consisting of hail-related expenses of approximately $3.6 million after-tax or $0.03 on a per share basis, as well as a shift in stock-based compensation into the first quarter of approximately $3.2 million after-tax or $0.03 per share due to a change from quarterly to annual stock-option grant. There were no adjustment to net income in the year period. In the first quarter, revenue increased $175 million or 4% compared to the prior year and gross profit improved $26 million or 3%. SG&A as a percentage of gross profit was 71.3% for the quarter, which represent a 160 basis point increase compared to the year-ago period. Excluding the hail-related expenses and a shift in stock-based compensation previously noted, our SG&A as a percentage of gross profit would have been approximately 70%.  We are continuing to adjust our cost structure to the plateauing industry environment. The provision for income tax in the quarter was $60.7 million or 38.7%. Net new vehicle floor plan was a benefit of $11.4 million, a decrease of $2.8 million from the first quarter of 2015. The decrease was primarily due to increased work plan balances and higher interest rates, partially offset by higher floor plan assistance per unit. Floor plan debt increased sequentially approximately $312 million during the first quarter to $4 billion at quarter end, primarily due to higher inventory balances, increased borrowings on our used vehicle floor plan facilities and acquisition. 
Non-vehicle interest expense increased to $28.3 million compared to $21.4 million in the first quarter of 2015. The $6.9 million increase in interest expense was driven by the issuance of our senior unsecured notes in September 2015 which have higher rates than our revolving credit facility, as well as higher average debt balances. The increased senior notes rate was partially offset by the issuance of our commercial paper program. At the end of March we had $2.7 billion of non-vehicle debt, an increase of $324 million compared to December 31, 2015. Non-vehicle debt includes $926 million of outstanding commercial paper borrowings. At the end of March, we had no amounts drawn under our revolving credit facility. As a consequence, our non-vehicle debt fixed to floating mix was approximately 66% fixed and 34% floating. I'll also note that we have no material debt maturities until late 2017. 
From January 1, 2016 through April 21, 2016, we repurchased 7.9 million shares for $371 million at an average price of $47.20 per share. AutoNation has approximately $175 million of remaining board authorization for share repurchase. As of April 21, there were approximately 103 million shares outstanding. This does not include the dilutive impact of stock options. Our leverage ratio increased to 2.6x at the end of Q1 as compared to 2.3x at the end of Q4. The leverage ratio was 2.6x on a net debt basis, including used floor plan availability and our covenant limit is 3.75x. Capital expenditures were $46 million for the quarter. Capital expenditures are on an accrual basis excluding operating lease buyouts and related asset sales. Our quarter end cash balance was $48 million, which, combined with our additional borrowing capacity resulted in total liquidity of $878 million at the end of March. We continue to focus on aligning our cost structure for the plateauing industry selling environment and will continue to leverage our strong liquidity and cash flow to drive long-term shareholder value. 
Now, let me turn you over to our Chief Operating Officer, Bill Berman."

Before discussing our results, I'd like to comment on the new vehicle industry selling and environment. During the quarter, industry retail sales were relatively flat with double-digit increases and incentives in fleet sales which were both up 14% on a year-over-year basis. New vehicle sales leasing penetration was over 30% for the quarter. Industry inventories were elevated with retail day supply outstanding at approximately 80 days. As we indicated earlier this year, the new vehicle market is plateauing. 
Turning to our results, my comments today will be on a same-store basis as compared to the prior year unless noted otherwise. Gross profit for variable operations was $437 million [ph]. Down 7%. Variable gross was $3,424 on a per vehicle retail basis, a decrease of $21 or 1%. New and used same store unit volume were down 6% compared to the first quarter of 2015. New vehicle revenue for the quarter was $2.6 billion, a decrease of $121 million or 4%. We retailed 74,300 units, a decrease of 5%. New vehicle gross profit was $1,885 on a per vehicle retail basis down 8%. This was due to our larger exposure to Premium Luxury and our energy markets in Texas and Colorado. As Mike mentioned a moment ago, our Premium Luxury segment and our energy market represents roughly 20% and 25% respectively, of our new vehicle unit sales. For the quarter, used vehicle retail revenue was $1 billion, a decrease of $39 million or 4%. Used vehicle retail were 54,200, down 7%. Used vehicle gross profit was $1,625 on a per vehicle retail basis, a decrease of $126 or 7%. As of March 31, approximately 5% of our inventory was not available for sale due to open recalls. The held inventory represents approximately 1% of our new vehicle inventory and roughly 15% of our used vehicle inventory. We continue to see an impact on our used vehicle sales due to our recall policy. Despite the associated cost, we are proud to provide industry leadership, and we believe it's the right thing to do for our customers. 
Customer financial services gross profits had an all-time record at $1,649 on a per vehicle retail basis, an increase of $131 or 9%. Total gross profit for customer financial services of $212 million was up $5 million or 3% compared to the period a year ago. We continue to see opportunity in customer financial services as we drive store level execution and offer products that deliver customer value and loyalty. In the quarter, customer care revenue was $770 million, an increase of $34 million or 5%. We set an all-time record in customer care gross profit of $334 million, an increase of $17 million or 5%. Customer pay gross was $137 million, up 7% year-over-year, warranty gross was $66 million up 8%. Collision gross was $31 million up 6%. We continue to expect solid growth in customer care. Finally, I'd like to welcome the nearly 1,000 Allen Samuels associates to AutoNation family to AutoNation and all 26,000 associates for their hard work and dedication.

Always for the moment, I call them as I see them, put the facts on the table as plainly as possible. Then in AutoNation style and my style, I clearly indicate we're up to meeting the challenges and we're dealing with them, trying to give some idea what we're doing than and then say in the near term, I'm absolutely excited, convinced and confident about the company we built, the brand that we've built and the capabilities we have. And over the long-term, we're clearly going to perform. And if you want that to be more than words, just look at the share repurchase and the acquisition that we closed in Texas. So everybody wants to focus on the call, not on the challenges. But I think it is important to speak plainly. So the facts are the industry are in far better shape than it was in '08, '09 from an OEM supplier and a retail point of view. There is absolutely no comparison. So much productive capacity has been taken out. And so many structural costs, cost issues have been addressed, and we have this benefit of $2 gasoline that's shifted the mix towards trucks which is of some benefit to us but a tremendous benefit at the OEM and the supplier levels. So all that goes in the plus column. However, when everybody is overly optimistic like at the beginning of the year, and we are getting sales targets from manufacturers that are plus 5% to 10% and our production plan to support it, and we see all our competitors are getting the same targets, I clearly call that, that is overly optimistic and that's not going to happen this year. And if I look at the first quarter, we have to say, quite bluntly, that the industry retail sales were flat despite the fact that incentives increase 10% to 15%, leasing was pushed over 30%. You had all the availability at retail that you want, meaning that if incentives had not been increased, most likely, retail volume would have fallen. That is a material fact that needs to be put squarely on the table. Now the industry can clearly manage this challenge by trending an adoption on the production side, and that is not going to acquire anything like the pain and disruption that we have seen in '08 and '09 because the capacity has been taken out and somebody plans are running over time. However, if I don't speak up, frankly, and don't cancel our orders reflecting this change in the marketplace, then we are creating a problem in the future that is going to be much more difficult to deal with. And we should address it as early as possible, as comprehensively as possible in order that we can all have a quality of earnings that is not damaged by overproduction and over pushing. So I speak out. And we also have some AutoNation-specific challenges, so I'm calling out our energy markets and our Premium Luxury that is difficult for us to deal with at the moment. However, over the long-term, our position in energy markets has been a huge plus for the company and over the long term will continue to be a huge plus for the company, and the same thing for Premium Luxury as that's over dependent on the car market, the manufacturers are adapting, we're adapting and good days will come again. So I don't think putting the cards on the table bluntly is wrong, I do it. I clearly say that I'm confident and optimistic. You also see it in my actions. And so there, it is. I'm happy to answer any question around it."

So in principle, our decision not to retail vehicles with open recall has resonated very well for the brand with customers and surprisingly the support that we got from our associates. Saying very much even though it makes their life more complicated, the company is not putting them in a position of selling vehicles to consumers that have things like an exploding Takata airbag. So that's sense. Now I would say managing everything but the Takata airbag has gone very smoothly as expected and is pretty much sorted out and absent the Takata airbags, we'll be in very good operating shape. Now we can't ignore the mother of all recalls here, that Takata is a very difficult situation in that you have a safety device that in minor crashes is causing serious injury, if not, death, and there's tens of millions of vehicles involved. So on Takata, we're in the early innings. We will adapt as best we can to manage this situation. I would say as far as retailing, any vehicle with an open recall, that's out of the question. Where we have started to auction vehicles with a very clear disclosure, with stickers on the car that make it absolutely clear what's open as far as a recall, so they have gone to wholesale auctions and that will help us manage the overhang and is probably the missing piece of the puzzle to make this all work smoothly that we can stand on our brand principle vis-à-vis the consumer, but where there are no parts in sight, let someone else manage that vehicle to its completion as far as the recall."

So I think that's a safe statement. Now as far as where the consumer is at, I think there's the ability that the industry to have a plateaued retail business for quite some time within a modest range of plus or minus a few percent for quite some time. There's still average of 11.5, the availability of financing is still exceptional. We think we are at a high enough level that there's not just another level step up, how it feels to be.

So if I go back to last year when we announced our policy, we both had a concern from the consumer point of view, and we also saw, from a safety point of view that stop sales were going to become much more prevalent from the manufacturers when it's a genuine safety issue involved.

So I think it's not as strong out there as you might necessarily think, and we are at a high level, don't forget, we're at a high level for vehicle purchases. And is it realistic to continue those types of increases? I would also point out, I have concerns going into an elections, I have observed in the past when it's very controversial actions and it looks like we are on the road to have one of those this year, that consumers sometimes hesitate around the purchases, usually pick it up after the election but leading up to election, it can be a little bit soft. So I think economies had hesitation or rough patch. We'll have to see if it resumes its stride, that would be very supportive of legal sales to get that. So I think my sense that I called out at the beginning of the year and I clearly was the odd man out of the party at the Detroit auto show to say, everyone he I don't think things are just getting some along here was a crack all.

Today, we reported earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.90, a 7% decrease as compared to EPS from continuing operations of $0.97 for the same period in the prior year. EPS from continuing operations were negatively impacted by $0.06 per share, which included unusual hail-related expenses of $0.03 and a shift approximately of $0.03 per share in stock-based compensation expense into the first quarter due to a change from quarterly to annual stock option grants. First quarter 2016 revenue totaled $5.1 billion compared to $4.9 billion a year ago, an increase of 4%. In the first quarter, AutoNation's retail new vehicle unit sales increased 1% and were down 5% on a same-store basis. 
We continue to see declines in our Premium Luxury business, which represents roughly 20% of our new vehicle unit sales compared to an industry at 9%. The same-store basis, our Premium Luxury profits declined 13% year-over-year. Our energy markets, which represent approximately 25% of our new vehicle unit sales compared to 13% for the industry, also saw profit declines. On a same-store basis, energy markets were down 20% compared to the first quarter in the prior year. 
The safety of our customers is a top priority for AutoNation. We will not retail any vehicle with an open recall. Approximately 15% of our used vehicle units are on hold, of which 60% have been on hold for more than 30 days. I will further note, over 60% of our used inventory on hold is related to Takata airbags. The Takata airbag issue was in its early innings of what will be an ongoing issue that the industry faces. 
I'll now turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Cheryl Miller."

For the first quarter, we reported net income from continuing operations of $96 million or $0.90 per share versus net income of $112 million or $0.97 per share during the first quarter of 2015, a 7% decrease on a per share basis. Net income from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2016 was negatively impacted by $0.06 per share, consisting of hail-related expenses of approximately $3.6 million after-tax or $0.03 on a per share basis, as well as a shift in stock-based compensation into the first quarter of approximately $3.2 million after-tax or $0.03 per share due to a change from quarterly to annual stock option grants. There were no adjustment to net income in the year period. In the first quarter, revenue increased $175 million or 4% compared to the prior year and gross profit improved $26 million or 3%. SG&A as a percentage of gross profit was 71.3% for the quarter, which represent a 160 basis point increase compared to the year-ago period. Excluding the hail-related expenses and a shift in stock-based compensation previously noted, our SG&A as a percentage of gross profit would have been approximately 70%. We're continuing to adjust our cost structure to the plateauing industry environment. The provision for income tax in the quarter was $60.7 million or 38.7%. Net new vehicle floorplan was a benefit of $11.4 million, a decrease of $2.8 million from the first quarter of 2015. The decrease was primarily due to increased floorplan balances and higher interest rates, partially offset by higher floorplan assistance per unit. Floorplan debt increased sequentially approximately $312 million during the first quarter to $4 billion at quarter end, primarily due to higher inventory balances, increased borrowings on our used vehicle floorplan facilities and acquisitions. 
Non-vehicle interest expense increased to $28.3 million compared to $21.4 million in the first quarter of 2015. The $6.9 million increase in interest expense was driven by the issuance of our senior unsecured notes in September 2015, which have higher rates than our revolving credit facility, as well as higher average debt balances. The increased senior notes rate was partially offset by the issuance of our commercial paper program. At the end of March, we had $2.7 billion of non-vehicle debt, an increase of $324 million compared to December 31, 2015. Non-vehicle debt includes $926 million of outstanding commercial paper borrowings. At the end of March, we had no amounts drawn under our revolving credit facility. As a consequence, our non-vehicle debt fixed to floating mix was approximately 66% fixed and 34% floating. I'll also note that we have no material debt maturities until late 2017. 
From January 1, 2016 through April 21, 2016, we repurchased 7.9 million shares for $371 million at an average price of $47.20 per share. AutoNation has approximately $175 million of remaining board authorization for share repurchase. As of April 21, there were approximately 103 million shares outstanding. This does not include the dilutive impact of stock options. Our leverage ratio increased to 2.6x at the end of Q1 as compared to 2.3x at the end of Q4. The leverage ratio was 2.6x on a net debt basis, including used floorplan availability, and our covenant limit is 3.75x.
Capital expenditures were $46 million for the quarter. Capital expenditures are on an accrual basis, excluding operating lease buyouts and related asset sales. Our quarter-end cash balance was $48 million, which, combined with our additional borrowing capacity, resulted in total liquidity of $878 million at the end of March. We continue to focus on aligning our cost structure for the plateauing industry selling environment and will continue to leverage our strong liquidity and cash flow to drive long-term shareholder value. 
Now let me turn you over to our Chief Operating Officer, Bill Berman."

Before discussing our result, I'd like to comment on the new vehicle industry selling environment. During the quarter, industry retail sales were relatively flat with double-digit increases in incentives and fleet sales, which were both up 14% on a year-over-year basis. New vehicle sales leasing penetration was over 30% for the quarter. Industry inventories were elevated with retail day supply outstanding at approximately 80 days. As we indicated earlier this year, the new vehicle market is plateauing. 
Turning to our results. My comments today will be on a same-store basis as compared to the prior year unless noted otherwise. Gross profit for variable operations was $437 million, down 7%. Variable gross was $3,424 on a per vehicle retail basis, a decrease of $21 or 1%. New and used same-store unit volume were down 6% compared to the first quarter of 2015. New vehicle revenue for the quarter was $2.6 billion, a decrease of $121 million or 4%. We retailed 74,300 units, a decrease of 5%. New vehicle gross profit was $1,885 on a per vehicle retail basis, down 8%. This was due to our larger exposure to Premium Luxury and our energy markets in Texas and Colorado. As Mike mentioned a moment ago, our Premium Luxury segment and our energy markets represent roughly 20% and 25%, respectively, of our new vehicle unit sales. For the quarter, used vehicle retail revenue was $1 billion, a decrease of $39 million or 4%. Used vehicle retail were 54,200, down 7%. Used vehicle gross profit was $1,625 on a per vehicle retail basis, a decrease of $126 or 7%. As of March 31, approximately 5% of our inventory was not available for sale due to open recalls. The held inventory represents approximately 1% of our new vehicle inventory and roughly 15% of our used vehicle inventory. We continue to see an impact on our used vehicle sales due to our recall policy. Despite the associated cost, we are proud to provide industry leadership, and we believe it's the right thing to do for our customers. 
Customer financial services gross profits had an all-time record at $1,649 on a per vehicle retail basis, an increase of $131 or 9%. Total gross profit for customer financial services of $212 million was up $5 million or 3% compared to the period a year ago. We continue to see opportunity in customer financial services as we drive store-level execution and offer products that deliver customer value and loyalty. In the quarter, customer care revenue was $770 million, an increase of $34 million or 5%. We set an all-time record in customer care gross profit of $334 million, an increase of $17 million or 5%. Customer pay gross was $137 million, up 7% year-over-year. Warranty gross was $66 million, up 8%. Collision gross was $31 million, up 6%. We continue to expect solid growth in customer care.
Finally, I'd like to welcome the nearly 1,000 Allen Samuels associates to AutoNation and thank all 26,000 associates for their hard work and dedication. 
I'll now turn the call back to Mike Jackson, Chairman, CEO and President."

Always for the moment, I call them as I see them, put the facts on the table as plainly as possible. Then in AutoNation style and my style, I clearly indicate we're up to meeting the challenges and we're dealing with them and try to give some idea of what we're doing then and then say in the near term, I'm absolutely excited, convinced and confident about the company we built, the brand that we've built and the capabilities they have. And then over the long-term, we're clearly going to perform. And if you want that to be more than words, just look at the share repurchase and the acquisition that we closed in Texas. So everybody wants to focus on the call-out on the challenges. But I think it is important to speak plainly. So the facts are the industry is in far better shape than it was in '08, '09 from an OEM supplier and a retail point of view. There is absolutely no comparison. So much productive capacity has been taken out. And so many structural costs, cost issues have been addressed, and we have this benefit of $2 gasoline that's shifted the mix towards trucks, which is of some benefit to us but is of tremendous benefit at the OEM and the supplier levels. So all that goes in the plus column. However, when everybody is overly optimistic like at the beginning of the year, and we are getting sales targets from manufacturers that are plus 5% to 10% and our production plan to support it, and we see all our competitors are getting the same targets, I clearly call out that is overly optimistic and that's not going to happen this year. And if I look at the first quarter, we have to say, quite bluntly, that the industry retail sales were flat despite the fact that incentives increased 10% to 15%. Leasing was pushed over 30%. You had all the availability at retail that you want, meaning that if incentives had not been increased, most likely, retail volume would have fallen. That is a material fact that needs to be put squarely on the table. Now the industry can clearly manage this challenge by trending an adaption on the production side, and that is not going to require anything like the pain and disruption that we've seen in '08 and '09 because the capacity has been taken out and so many plans are running over time. However, if I don't speak up frankly and don't cancel our orders, reflecting this change in the marketplace, then we are creating a problem in the future that is going to be much more difficult to deal with. And we should address it as early as possible, as comprehensively as possible, in order that we can all have a quality of earnings that is not damaged by overproduction and over pushing. So I speak out. And we also have some AutoNation-specific challenges, so I'm calling out our energy markets and our Premium Luxury that is difficult for us to deal with at the moment. However, over the long term, our position in energy markets has been a huge plus for the company, and in the long term, will continue to be a huge plus for the company. And the same thing for Premium Luxury as that's overdependent on the car market. The manufacturers are adapting. We're adapting, and good days will come again. So I don't think putting the cards on the table bluntly is wrong, I do it. I clearly say that I'm confident and optimistic. You also see it in my actions. And so there it is, and I'm happy to answer any question around it."

So in principle, our decision not to retail vehicles with open recall has resonated very well for the brand with customers, and surprisingly, the support that we got from our associates, saying very much even though it makes their life more complicated, they're thrilled the company is not putting them in a position of selling vehicles to consumers that have things like an exploding Takata airbag. So that stands. Now I would say managing everything but the Takata airbag has gone very smoothly as expected and is pretty much sorted out. And absent the Takata airbags, we'll be in very good operating shape. Now we can't ignore the mother of all recalls here, the Takata, it's a very difficult situation in that you have a safety device that in minor crashes is causing serious injury, if not, death, and there's tens of millions of vehicles involved. So on Takata, we're in the early innings. We will adapt as best we can to manage this situation. I would say on -- as far as retailing, any vehicle with an open recall, that's out of the question. We have started to auction vehicles with a very clear disclosure, with stickers on the car that make it absolutely clear what's open as far as a recall, so they have gone to wholesale auctions and that will help us manage the overhang and is probably the missing piece of the puzzle to make this all work smoothly, that we can stand on our brand principle vis-à-vis the consumer. But where there are no parts in sight, let someone else manage that vehicle to its completion as far as the recall."

Nothing like '08, '09 and '10, nothing like that. But whether it's a bigger change over time or taking down plants for whatever reason you can come up with for a couple of weeks, especially car plants, I think you'll begin to see announcements like that. I think it's entirely a manageable situation at the moment to use a combination of production adjustments with incentives to bring things into line, and we see manufacturers have begun to do that. And they have pushed back from retailers, not just us, but others who are -- who have been reducing our orders significantly. So I think it's underway. I cannot tell you as of today though, that all the decisions have been made, that needs to be made, that gets us to a better place. That's all of us. By that, I mean the total industry. There's no question in my mind, as far as AutoNation is concerned, you will see AutoNation as a company in a much better place at the end of the second quarter, and we should be really in a good place by the end of the third quarter.

There is no question over the past year that there's been a bifurcation on recalls that's flowing into 2 categories, genuine safety concerns and more a technical compliance issue. And on the serious safety concerns, the manufacturer, when they issued those recalls, are issuing a stop sale, stop retail instruction to the dealer with the recall. If we take Takata, the industry now has 14 manufacturers that have issued some sort of stop sale instruction to dealers. So if I go back to last year when we announced our policy, we both had a concern from the consumer point of view, and we also saw, from a safety point of view, that stop sales were going to become much more prevalent from the manufacturers when it's a genuine safety issue involved. So that is clearly something that didn't exist 2, 3 years ago to the extent that it does today."

I would say the conversation has gone pretty well in that we have pretty much agreement in the industry that it's plateaued, step one. Step two, okay, it's taken a little while for them to come to terms what that means to their company and their plants. We have seen production schedules change. We have seen shifts go down. So I am not totally pessimistic that the industry will go blindly marching forward and pull too much business forward.

As you think about it from an SG&A perspective, I'd say one of the bright spots for us and an area that we really focus on when we began to saw -- to see the plateau in the fourth quarter of last year was on compensation. So we've made really good headways on compensation year-over-year. So that's an area that you definitely see that leverage in. Advertising has remained in good order as well. Certainly, when you have gross compression, it does impact, on a percentage basis, some of the store and overhead costs, but we've worked hard to offset that. So if you exclude the hail and the timing of the stock-based compensation, you have the 70% SG&A that remains around our target level. You'd like to see lower than that, but in this gross pressure environment, it's going to be a little more difficult. I would say digital continues to be a medium- to longer-term exercise so we have made great headway with respect to the third-party lead generators that we previously used. So we brought that below the 9% mark from 15%-plus historically. So continued to see great traction there. And it really helps us deliver on the brand promise. So as we talked about we don't do separate call-outs for the exact impact of digital, but I will tell you that all of the indicators continue to be very positive from those efforts."

If I take GDP growth the last 2 -- well, we don't have the first quarter yet but I'm not -- nobody is real bullish on it. There's certainly going to be, I expect, less than 2%, significantly less than 2% and the fourth quarter was tough. You certainly saw the Federal Reserve pull back on its plans to increase interest rates around its concerns on the economy. So I think it's not as strong out there as you might necessarily think, and we're at a high level. Don't forget, we're at a high level for vehicle purchases and is it really realistic to continue those types of increases. I would also point out, I have concerns going into an election year. I have observed in the past, when there's very controversial elections and it looks like we're on the road to have one of those this year, that consumers sometimes hesitate around big purchases, usually pick it up after the election. But leading up to election, it can be a little bit soft. So I think economy's had a hesitation or a rough patch. We'll have to see if it resumes its stride. That would be very supportive of vehicle sales to get that. So I think my sense that I called out at the beginning of the year and I clearly was the odd man out at the party at the Detroit Motor Show to say, hey, everybody, I don't think things are just going zoom along here was a correct call. And so we're adjusting. I hope the industry adjusts, and it's still an environment we can be very profitable."

Today, we reported earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.90, a 7% decrease as compared to EPS from continuing operations of $0.97 for the same period in the prior year. EPS from continuing operations were negatively impacted by $0.06 per share, which included unusual hail-related expenses of $0.03 and a shift approximately of $0.03 per share in stock-based compensation expense into the first quarter due to a change from quarterly to annual stock option grants. First quarter of 2016 revenue totaled $5.1 billion compared to $4.9 billion a year ago, an increase of 4%. In the first quarter, AutoNation's retail new vehicle unit sales increased 1% and were down 5% on a same-store basis. 
We continue to see declines in our Premium Luxury business, which represents roughly 20% of our new vehicle unit sales compared to an industry at 9%. On a same-store basis, our Premium Luxury profits declined 13% year-over-year. Our energy markets, which represented approximately 25% of our new vehicle unit sales compared to 13% for the industry, also saw profit declines. On a same-store basis, energy markets were down 20% compared to the first quarter in the prior year. 
The safety of our customers is a top priority for AutoNation. We will not retail any vehicle with an open recall. Approximately 15% of our used vehicle units are on hold, of which 60% have been on hold for more than 30 days. I will further note over 60% of our used inventory on hold is related to Takata airbags. The Takata airbag issue is in its early innings of what will be an ongoing issue that the industry faces. 
I'll now turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Cheryl Miller."

For the first quarter, we reported net income from continuing operations of $96 million or $0.90 per share versus net income of $112 million or $0.97 per share during the first quarter of 2015, a 7%",635,"Thank you, Mike, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. For the first quarter, we reported net income from continuing operations of $96 million or $0.90 per share versus net income of $112 million or $0.97 per share during the first quarter of 2015, a 7% decrease on a per share basis. Net income from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2016 was negatively impacted by $0.06 per share, consisting of hail-related expenses of approximately $3.6 million after-tax or $0.03 on a per share basis, as well as a shift in stock-based compensation into the first quarter of approximately $3.2 million after-tax or $0.03 per share due to a change from quarterly to annual stock option grants. There were no adjustments to net income in either period. In the first quarter, revenue increased $175 million or 4% compared to the prior year and gross profit improved $26 million or 3%. SG&A as a percentage of gross profit was 71.3% for the quarter, which represents a 160 basis point increase compared to the year-ago period. Excluding the hail-related expenses and a shift in stock-based compensation previously noted, our SG&A as a percentage of gross profit would have been approximately 70%. We're continuing to adjust our cost structure to the plateauing industry environment. The provision for income tax in the quarter was $60.7 million or 38.7%. Net new vehicle floorplan was a benefit of $11.4 million, a decrease of $2.8 million from the first quarter of 2015. The decrease was primarily due to increased floorplan balances and higher interest rates, partially offset by higher floorplan assistance per unit. Floorplan debt increased sequentially approximately $312 million during the first quarter to $4 billion at quarter end, primarily due to higher inventory balances, increased borrowings on our used vehicle floorplan facilities and acquisitions. 
Non-vehicle interest expense increased to $28.3 million compared to $21.4 million in the first quarter of 2015. The $6.9 million increase in interest expense was driven by the issuance of our senior unsecured notes in September 2015, which have higher rates than our revolving credit facility, as well as higher average debt balances. The increased senior notes rate was partially offset by the issuance of our commercial paper program. At the end of March, we had $2.7 billion of non-vehicle debt, an increase of $324 million compared to December 31, 2015. Non-vehicle debt includes $926 million of outstanding commercial paper borrowings. At the end of March, we had no amounts drawn under our revolving credit facility. As a consequence, our non-vehicle debt fixed to floating mix was approximately 66% fixed and 34% floating. I'll also note that we have no material debt maturities until late 2017. 
From January 1, 2016 through April 21, 2016, we repurchased 7.9 million shares for $371 million at an average price of $47.20 per share. AutoNation has approximately $175 million of remaining board authorization for share repurchase. As of April 21, there were approximately 103 million shares outstanding. This does not include the dilutive impact of stock options. Our leverage ratio increased to 2.6x at the end of Q1 as compared to 2.3x at the end of Q4. The leverage ratio was 2.6x on a net debt basis, including used floorplan availability, and our covenant limit is 3.75x.
Capital expenditures were $46 million for the quarter. Capital expenditures are on an accrual basis, excluding operating lease buyouts and related asset sales. Our quarter-end cash balance was $48 million, which, combined with our additional borrowing capacity, resulted in total liquidity of $878 million at the end of March. We continue to focus on aligning our cost structure for the plateauing industry selling environment and will continue to leverage our strong liquidity and cash flow to drive long-term shareholder value. 
Now let me turn you over to our Chief Operating Officer, Bill Berman."

Before discussing our results, I'd like to comment on the new vehicle industry selling environment.

Before discussing our results, I'd like to comment on the new vehicle industry selling environment. During the quarter, industry retail sales were relatively flat with double-digit increases in incentives and fleet sales, which were both up 14% on a year-over-year basis. New vehicle sales leasing penetration was over 30% for the quarter. Industry inventories were elevated with retail day supply outstanding at approximately 80 days. As we indicated earlier this year, the new vehicle market is plateauing. 
Turning to our results. My comments today will be on a same-store basis as compared to the prior year unless noted otherwise. Gross profit for variable operations was $437 million, down 7%. Variable gross was $3,424 on a per vehicle retail basis, a decrease of $21 or 1%. New and used same-store unit volume were down 6% compared to the first quarter of 2015. New vehicle revenue for the quarter was $2.6 billion, a decrease of $121 million or 4%. We retailed 74,300 units, a decrease of 5%. New vehicle gross profit was $1,885 on a per vehicle retail basis, down 8%. This was due to our larger exposure to Premium Luxury and our energy markets in Texas and Colorado. As Mike mentioned a moment ago, our Premium Luxury segment and our energy markets represent roughly 20% and 25%, respectively, of our new vehicle unit sales. For the quarter, used vehicle retail revenue was $1 billion, a decrease of $39 million or 4%. Used vehicle retail were 54,200, down 7%. Used vehicle gross profit was $1,625 on a per vehicle retail basis, a decrease of $126 or 7%. As of March 31, approximately 5% of our inventory was not available for sale due to open recalls. The held inventory represents approximately 1% of our new vehicle inventory and roughly 15% of our used vehicle inventory. We continued to see an impact on our used vehicle sales due to our recall policy. Despite the associated costs, we are proud to provide industry leadership, and we believe it's the right thing to do for our customers. 
Customer financial services gross profits had an all-time record at $1,649 on a per vehicle retail basis, an increase of $131 or 9%. Total gross profit for customer financial services of $212 million was up $5 million or 3% compared to the period a year ago. We continue to see opportunity in customer financial services as we drive store-level execution and offer products that deliver customer value and loyalty. In the quarter, customer care revenue was $770 million, an increase of $34 million or 5%. We set an all-time record in customer care gross profit of $334 million, an increase of $17 million or 5%. Customer pay gross was $137 million, up 7% year-over-year. Warranty gross was $66 million, up 8%. Collision gross was $31 million, up 6%. We continue to expect solid growth in customer care.
Finally, I'd like to welcome the nearly 1,000 Allen Samuels associates to AutoNation and thank all 26,000 associates for their hard work and dedication. 
I'll now turn the call back to Mike Jackson, Chairman, CEO and President."

Always for the moment, I call them as I see them, put the facts on the table as plainly as possible. Then in AutoNation style and my style, I clearly indicate we're up to meeting the challenges and we're dealing with them and try to give some idea of what we're doing that and then say in the near term, I'm absolutely excited, convinced and confident about the company we built, the brand that we've built and the capabilities they have. And then over the long-term, we're clearly going to perform. And if you want that to be more than words, just look at the share repurchase and the acquisition that we closed in Texas. So everybody wants to focus on the call-out on the challenges. But I think it is important to speak plainly. So the facts are the industry is in far better shape than it was in '08, '09 from an OEM supplier and a retail point of view. There is absolutely no comparison. So much productive capacity has been taken out. And so many structural costs, cost issues have been addressed, and we have this benefit of $2 gasoline that's shifted the mix towards trucks, which is of some benefit to us but is of tremendous benefit at the OEM and the supplier level. So all that goes in the plus column. However, when everybody is overly optimistic like at the beginning of the year, and we are getting sales targets from manufacturers that are plus 5% to 10% and our production plan to support it, and we see all our competitors are getting the same targets, I clearly called out that is overly optimistic and that's not going to happen this year. And if I look at the first quarter, we have to say, quite bluntly, that the industry retail sales were flat despite the fact that incentives increased 10% to 15%. Leasing was pushed over 30%. You had all the availability at retail that you want, meaning that if incentives had not been increased, most likely, retail volume would have fallen. That is a material fact that needs to be put squarely on the table. Now the industry can clearly manage this challenge by trimming an adaption on the production side, and that is not going to require anything like the pain and disruption that we've seen in '08 and '09 because the capacity has been taken out and so many plants are running over time. However, if I don't speak up frankly and don't cancel our orders, reflecting this change in the marketplace, then we are creating a problem in the future that is going to be much more difficult to deal with. And we should address it as early as possible, as comprehensively as possible, in order that we can all have a quality of earnings that is not damaged by overproduction and over pushing. So I speak out. And we also have some AutoNation-specific challenges, so I'm calling out our energy markets and our Premium Luxury that is difficult for us to deal with at the moment. However, over the long term, our position in energy markets has been a huge plus for the company, and in the long term, will continue to be a huge plus for the company. And the same thing for Premium Luxury as that's overdependent on the car market. The manufacturers are adapting. We're adapting, and good days will come again. So I don't think putting the cards on the table bluntly is wrong, I do it. I clearly say that I'm confident and optimistic. You also see it in my actions. And so there it is, and I'm happy to answer any question around it."

So in principle, our decision not to retail vehicles with open recall has resonated very well for the brand with customers, and surprisingly, the support that we got from our associates, saying very much even though it makes their life more complicated, they're thrilled the company is not putting them in a position of selling vehicles to consumers that have things like an exploding Takata airbag. So that stands. Now I would say managing everything but the Takata airbag has gone very smoothly as expected and is pretty much sorted out. And absent the Takata airbags, we'd be in very good operating shape. Now we can't ignore the mother of all recalls here, the Takata, it's a very difficult situation in that you have a safety device that in minor crashes is causing serious injury, if not, death, and there's tens of millions of vehicles involved. So on Takata, we're in the early innings. We will adapt as best we can to manage this situation. I would say on -- as far as retailing, any vehicle with an open recall, that's out of the question. We have started to auction vehicles with a very clear disclosure, with stickers on the car that make it absolutely clear what's open as far as a recall, so they have gone to wholesale auctions and that will help us manage the overhang and is probably the missing piece of the puzzle to make this all work smoothly, that we can stand on our brand principle vis-à-vis the consumer. But where there are no parts in sight, let someone else manage that vehicle to its completion as far as the recall."

Still, average age is 11.5. The availability of financing is still exceptional. I think we're just at a high enough level that there's just not another step-up is how it feels to me.

And they have pushed back from retailers, not just us, but others who are -- who have been reducing our orders significantly. So I think it's underway. I cannot tell you as of today though, that all the decisions have been made, that needs to be made, that gets us to a better place. That's all of us. By that, I mean the total industry. There's no question in my mind, as far as AutoNation is concerned, you will see AutoNation as a company in a much better place at the end of the second quarter, and we should be really in a good place by the end of the third quarter. That's our goal."

There is no question over the past year that there's been a bifurcation on recalls that are falling into 2 categories: genuine safety concerns and more a technical compliance issue. And on the serious safety concerns, the manufacturer, when they issued those recalls, are issuing a stop sale, stop retail instruction to the dealer with the recall. If we take Takata, the industry now has 14 manufacturers that have issued some sort of stop sale instruction to dealers. So if I go back to last year when we announced our policy, we both had a concern from the consumer point of view, and we also saw, from a safety point of view, that stop sales were going to become much more prevalent from the manufacturers when it's a genuine safety issue involved. So that is clearly something that didn't exist 2, 3 years ago to the extent that it does today."

I would say the conversation has gone pretty well in that we have pretty much agreement in the industry that it's plateaued, step one. Step two, okay, it's taking a little while for them to come to terms with what that means to their company and their plant. We have seen production schedules change. We have seen shifts go down. So I am not totally pessimistic that the industry will go blindly marching forward and pull too much business forward. And when they finally then come to capitulation, it's far uglier than it needs to be. But your point's well taken, I can't argue with it."

As you think about it from an SG&A perspective, I'd say one of the bright spots for us and an area that we really focused on when we began to saw -- to see the plateau in the fourth quarter of last year was on compensation. So we've made really good headways on compensation year-over-year. So that's an area that you definitely see that leverage in. Advertising has remained in good order as well. Certainly, when you have gross compression, it does impact, on a percentage basis, some of the store and overhead costs, but we've worked hard to offset that. So if you exclude the hail and the timing of the stock-based compensation, you have the 70% SG&A that remains around our target level. You'd like to see it lower than that, but in this gross pressure environment, it's going to be a little more difficult. I would say digital continues to be a medium- to longer-term exercise so we have made great headway with respect to the third-party lead generators that we previously used. So we brought that below the 9% mark from 15%-plus historically. So continued to see great traction there. And it really helps us deliver on the brand promise. So as we talked about we don't do separate call-outs for the exact impact of digital, but I will tell you that all of the indicators continue to be very positive from those efforts."

If I take GDP growth the last 2 -- well, we don't have the first quarter yet but I'm not -- nobody is real bullish on it. There's certainly going to be, I expect, less than 2%, significantly less than 2%, and the fourth quarter was tough. You certainly saw the Federal Reserve pull back on its plans to increase interest rates around its concerns on the economy. So I think it's not as strong out there as you might necessarily think, and we're at a high level. Don't forget, we're at a high level for vehicle purchases and is it really realistic to continue those types of increases. I would also point out, I have concerns going into an election year. I have observed in the past, when there's very controversial elections and it looks like we're on the road to having one of those this year, that consumers sometimes hesitate around big purchases, usually pick it up after the election. But leading up to election, it can be a little bit soft. So I think the economy's had a hesitation or a rough patch. We'll have to see if it resumes its stride. That would be very supportive of vehicle sales to get that. So I think my sense that I called out at the beginning of the year and I clearly was the odd man out at the party at the Detroit Motor Show to say, hey, everybody, I don't think things are just going zoom along here was a correct call. And so we're adjusting. I hope the industry adjusts, and it's still an environment where you can be very profitable."

Today, we reported an all-time record earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.08 and 8% increase as compared to EPS from continuing operations of $1 for the same period in the prior year. We achieved record EPS from continuing operations as we began to see the results of adjusting our cost structure and inventory levels to a plateauing industry sales environment.  We also saw a benefit from our opportunistic capital allocation strategy, which included acquisitions and share repurchase. 
Revenue for the quarter totaled $5.4 billion compared to $5.2 billion in the same period a year ago, an increase of 4%. AutoNation's total retail new vehicle unit sales for the quarter were flat. On a same-store basis, retail new vehicle unit sales were down 5%. 
During the quarter, we continue to see disruption from the Takata airbag recall, which impacted our used vehicle business. Approximately 20% of our used vehicle inventory is currently on hold due to open recalls and approximately, 75% of those vehicles are related to Takata airbags. 
Second quarter was a transitional quarter for certain brands as replacement parts for the Takata airbags became available. We anticipate that our used vehicle on hold. It will peak towards the end of 2016. 
Also in the second half of the year, once the vehicles that have been on hold are repaired and sold, we will recognize compensation related to certain brands paid by the manufacturer, which will partially offset our cost for having carried these vehicles. 
Despite a very disruptive Takata airbag recall on our business, our industry-leading recall policy is unchanged. Our customers's safety still remains a top priority, and we will not retail any vehicle that has an open recall. 
I'll now turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Cheryl Miller."

For the second quarter, we reported net income from continuing operations of $112 million or $1.08 per share versus net income of $115 million or $1 per share during the second quarter of 2015, an 8% increase on a per-share basis. There were no adjustments to net income in either periods. 
In the second quarter, revenue increased $217 million or 4% compared to the prior year and gross profit improved $23 million or 3%. 
SG&A as a percentage of gross profit was 69.5% for the quarter, which was relatively flat compared to the year ago period. 
We continue to focus on expense discipline and have aligned our cost structure to the plateauing industry environment. 
The provision for income tax in the quarter was $71 million or 38.8%. Net new vehicle floorplan was a benefit of $13.2 million, a decrease of $2.8 million from the second quarter of 2015. The decrease was primarily due to increased floorplan balances and higher interest rates, partially offset by higher floorplan assistance per unit. 
Floorplan debt decreased sequentially, approximately $237 million during the second quarter to $3.8 billion at quarter, primarily due to lower inventory balances, partially offset by increased borrowings on our used vehicle floorplan facilities. 
Nonvehicle interest expense increased to $28.7 million compared to $21.6 million in the second quarter of 2015. The $7.1 million increase in interest expense was driven by higher-average debt balances, resulting primarily from share repurchase and acquisitions. 
At the end of June, we had $2.7 billion of nonvehicle debt, an increase of $28 million compared to March 31, 2016. Nonvehicle debt includes $958 million of outstanding commercial paper borrowings. 
At the end of June, we had no amounts drawn under our revolving credit facility.  As a consequence, our nonvehicle debt fixed the floating mix was approximately 65% fixed and 35% floating. 
During the second quarter, we repurchased 1 million shares for $50 million at an average price of $48.51 per share. AutoNation has approximately $116 million of remaining board authorization for share repurchase. 
As of July 28, there were approximately 102 million shares outstanding and again, this does not include the dilutive impact of stock options. 
Our leverage ratio increased slightly to 2.7x at the end of Q2 as compared to 2.6x at the end of Q1. The leverage ratio was 2.6x on a net debt basis, including used floorplan availability and our covenants limit as a reminder, is 3.75x. 
Capital expenditures were $62 million for the quarter. Capital expenditures are an accrual basis, excluding operating lease buyouts and related asset sales. 
Our quarter end cash balance was $55 million, which combined with our additional borrowing capacity resulted in total liquidity of $853 million at the end of June. 
We remain committed to disciplined expense management, while also opportunistically deploying capital to drive long-term shareholder value. 
Now let me turn you over to our Chief Operating Officer, Bill Berman."

Before discussing our results, I'd like to comment on the new vehicle industry selling environment for the quarter. Industry retail sales were down 2%, owned centers were up 13%, and new vehicle leasing penetration, again, was over 30%. 
Turning to our results, my comments will be on a same-store basis as compared to the prior year unless noted otherwise. Gross profit per variable operations was $442 million, down 5%. Variable growth was $3,376 on a per vehicle retail basis, a decrease of $18 or 1%. New and used same-store unit volume was down 5% compared to the second quarter last year. 
As we stated in the first quarter, we took steps to reduce our inventory level, and we've made progress in the second quarter. We decreased our same-store new unit day supply from 76 days to 70 days or 6,000 units on a sequential basis. 
Our DSO target is in the low to mid-60s, and we expect our inventory level to normalize by the end of the third quarter. 
New vehicle revenue for the quarter was $2.9 billion, a decrease of $49 million or 2%. We retail 79,400 units, a decrease of 5%. New vehicle gross profit was $1,923 on a per vehicle retail basis, down 2%. Manufacturing volume basis in a program with high cell target to continue to create a rational behavior in the marketplace. 
Despite industry retail sales being down in the second quarter, certain manufacturers, in particular, Ford, Chrysler and Nissan, set double-digit lower targets that were unattainable. For reasons these targets were unreasonable, we did not pursue them. 
For the quarter, used vehicle retail revenue was $1 billion, a decrease of $38 million or 3%. Used vehicle retail were 52,300, down 6%. Used vehicle gross profit was $1,548 on a per retail basis, a decrease of $150 or 9%. 
As of June 30, 6,900 units or roughly 20% of our total used vehicle inventory was on hold. 4,300 units or 60% of those units were eligible for manufacture compensation. We anticipate over $3 million of manufacture compensation, which will partially offset our cost. We will recognize this compensation as each of these vehicles are sold. 
Also, at the end of the second quarter, approximately 75% or 5,200 of our used units on hold were related to Takata airbag recall. We started to receive limited Takata airbag replacement parts for certain brands and we expect our used vehicle inventory on hold to peek towards the end of 2016, assuming parts become more readily available and no additional major recalls are issue. 
Customer financial services total gross profit was $211 million, customer financial services gross profit on a per vehicle retail basis was $1,602, an increase of $66 or 4%. 
We set an all-time record in customer care gross profit of $337 million, an increase of $9 million or 3%. 
Also in the quarter, customer care revenue was $773 million, an increase of $17 million or 2%. Customer pay gross was $140 million, up 6% year-over-year. Warranty gross was $68 million, up 9%.  Coalition gross was $30 million, up 1%. 
We're continuing to work on adding additional capacity for our coalition business to meet the higher demand. 
Finally, I'd like to welcome our new Denver, Colorado and Westchester, New York associates to AutoNation, and we'd like to thank AutoNation's 25,000-plus associates for the hard work and dedication.

As part of the acquisition, we will be awarded a Land Rover franchise in White Plains and a Jaguar franchise in Mt. Kisco. 
Once our facility plan is complete, we will have 3 Jaguar and Land Rover stores in new state-of-the-art facilities in Westchester County, 1 in White Plains, 1 in Mt. Kisco and 1 in Larchmont/New Rochelle.  We expect to generate additional $100 million in revenue from these facilities once fully operational. 
We are excited about entering Westchester County, New York, an excellent Premium Luxury market with an outstanding platform of luxury franchises and attractive growth prospects.  The business will be supported by our existing market team based in the Baltimore, Washington, D.C. area and provides an opportunity to further leverage our existing management infrastructure. 
In 2016, we've closed-end on the acquisition of 18 stores, generating $1.1 billion in annual revenue. 
As of today, our store portfolio numbers 373 franchises and 263 stores in 16 states, representing 35 manufacturer brands. 
Looking forward, we will continue to actively pursue acquisitions and new store opportunities with a focus on enhancing brand representation within our existing markets and markets that can be supported by our existing management infrastructure. We will continue to be selective and prudent with our capital with a focus on investing to produce strong returns and long-term shareholder value.

This industry can, if you run it rationally, you can still be quite successful and be profitable. So if I look at how the first half of the year developed well from a market point of view, that's exactly where it is with retail in the second quarter down, let's say, 2% at retail, but it's still considerably higher incentives for that to happen. The recent diversions and manufacturer behavior, I would give -- for instance, I would complement General Motors, and you certainly look at the results, and you see if you find the right balance between supply and demand with a good disciplined approach and really marketing that's focused on the long-term, you can be quite successful. On the margin business, it's going to be very expensive from an incentive point of view. You don't take -- on the other hand, we have other manufacturers who are still very aggressive in their plans and if you want to -- Bill already mentioned it, if you want to look at Ford Motor Company where we have targets for the third quarter that significant number of our stores have targets that are 15%, 20%, 25% up to 40% higher the prior year. Well, it's just not going to happen, that's totally unrealistic, and we're not going to chase it. But it is disruptive in the marketplace and causes irrational behavior and there's a price tags for that. And if you look at Ford's total incentive being up 28% in the second quarter, I don't think they've got a return on that approach. So there's a good contrast as to what I was talking about and how it can be managed differently. Now we'll see what happens from this point. But the headline is progress is being made in principle and maybe we'll make even more progress in the second half of the year."

But the extreme practitioners of volume-based incentives are really, at this point, Nissan, Chrysler and Ford, I would say the intensity of the discussion between dealers, retailers, and those companies is going up. Some are even questioning the legality of how those programs are run in the fairness of those programs. So it's -- I think we're approaching a moment where I would hope that these extreme fair steps, which, again, I called out in my keynote speech in January, would be the issue in 2016 because if you take away a growing marketplace and these stair steps really don't work because they're entirely based on growth. Hopefully, the industry over the second half of the year will come to a better place on understanding how these programs can work and can't work. But at the moment, it's a source of real friction."

So all the public traded groups are behaving in a very rational way. They will all say, hey, this markets plateaued, we need to bring -- we need to adjust costs, and we need to bring inventories into life. I think it's very beneficial to the industry to see that big companies behaving in a rational way. And then to call out why if you look at Group 1, they did a fantastic job of saying, you know what, these targets are irrational, not attainable, we're going to manage for gross because we can't get the volume numbers and they actually increase their new vehicle front end gross and gave up the volume. So finding that line is difficult and ongoing, but it is a point of contention. I don't, in principle, have a problem with volume targets because they're realistic and attainable. But when you put out -- when you misjudge the market, and you put out the target that's not attainable and you'd sprinkle it out there in a capricious involuntary way, it's really disruptive in the marketplace and very difficult to manage, and you're going to have a lot of controversy with dealers. Yet you can go out to find dealers who say, they like you. Well, I can tell you something, they got a easy target there. They get an easy target, you'll love it. And for all those -- and since we have such a big footprint in so many stores, we see that without line of reason, you end up with stores that get huge targets, plus 25%, we have other stores that got lower targets than prior year. Go figure. So that's about much color that I can give you."

So when I look at from the manufacturer, I really think they shouldn't break into double-digit as a percent of their average MSRP, I think you hit a wall of diminishing return where the incentive is now such a level that it's already depressing the resell value so you haven't really delivered -- reduce the net difference in the cost of the vehicle. Does that make sense? Where your next dollar of incentive doesn't have a 10%, doesn't have the same impact that you went from 5% to 6%. There is a point of diminishing return that's dramatic. Second, I agree with you. Leasing is the same thing, it's -- you're selling a seat of day of reckoning that you really don't want, namely that you have so many vehicles coming back that are based on the residual value that's going to be higher than what the marketplace can handle. Now that -- all those risk are at the OEM level, not at the retail level, but we all know if you're basically pulling business forward now, that means that when the day of reckoning comes to the disruption is great.

It's very manageable. But can you screw it up? Yes, you can. And that's why we're speaking up.

I haven't checked everybody's numbers, but I have the sense that everybody's days supply has come down sequentially during the second quarter so everybody said they would do it in their out there doing that, and that's a very strong single back to the manufacturers, which they don't like, but I think is healthy that we can have a very profitable, sustainable, rational plateau period until we have very high interest rates for major recession, and then volumes will flow. Is that helpful?"

The millennials came of age with a great recession, they went back to school and double down in education and student debt. They are now entering the workforce, they have to pay down that student debt, but their fundamental desires to marry, have children, have a home, have a car are there.

Then you had Nissan arrived, which is just a little loose cannon rolling back and forth across the deck, wreaking havoc. And now you've had Ford as of this year, join in. So if more go down that road, that is a real problem. But I think it's going to go the other way.

Today, we reported an all-time record earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.08, an 8% increase as compared to EPS from continuing operations of $1 for the same period in the prior year. We achieved record EPS from continuing operations as we began to see the results of adjusting our cost structure and inventory levels to a plateauing industry sales environment. We also saw a benefit from our opportunistic capital allocation strategy, which included acquisitions and share repurchase. 
Revenue for the quarter totaled $5.4 billion compared to $5.2 billion in the same period a year ago, an increase of 4%. AutoNation's total retail new vehicle unit sales for the quarter were flat. In a same-store basis, retail new vehicle unit sales were down 5%. 
During the quarter, we continue to see disruption from the Takata airbag recall, which impacted our used vehicle business. Approximately 20% of our used vehicle inventory is currently on hold due to open recalls and approximately 75% of those vehicles are related to Takata airbags. 
Second quarter was a transitional quarter for certain brands as replacement parts for the Takata airbags became available. We anticipate that our used vehicle inventory on hold will peak towards the end of 2016. 
Also in the second half of the year, once the vehicles that have been on hold are repaired and sold, we will recognize compensation related to certain brands paid by the manufacturer, which will partially offset our cost for having carried these vehicles. 
Despite a very disruptive Takata airbag recall on our business, our industry-leading recall policy is unchanged. Our customers' safety still remains a top priority, and we will not retail any vehicle that has an open recall.

For the second quarter, we reported net income from continuing operations of $112 million or $1.08 per share versus net income of $115 million or $1 per share during the second quarter of 2015, an 8% increase on a per share basis. There were no adjustments to net income in either period. 
In the second quarter, revenue increased $217 million or 4% compared to the prior year and gross profit improved $23 million or 3%. 
SG&A as a percentage of gross profit was 69.5% for the quarter, which was relatively flat compared to the year ago period. 
We continue to focus on expense discipline and have aligned our cost structure to the plateauing industry environment. 
The provision for income tax in the quarter was $71 million or 38.8%. Net new vehicle floorplan was a benefit of $13.2 million, a decrease of $2.8 million from the second quarter of 2015. The decrease was primarily due to increased floorplan balances and higher interest rates, partially offset by higher floorplan assistance per unit. 
Floorplan debt decreased sequentially, approximately $237 million during the second quarter to $3.8 billion at quarter end, primarily due to lower inventory balances, partially offset by increased borrowings on our used vehicle floorplan facilities. 
Nonvehicle interest expense increased to $28.7 million compared to $21.6 million in the second quarter of 2015. The $7.1 million increase in interest expense was driven by higher average debt balances, resulting primarily from share repurchase and acquisitions. 
At the end of June, we had $2.7 billion of nonvehicle debt, an increase of $28 million compared to March 31, 2016. Nonvehicle debt includes $958 million of outstanding commercial paper borrowings. 
At the end of June, we had no amounts drawn under our revolving credit facility. As a consequence, our nonvehicle debt fixed to floating mix was approximately 65% fixed and 35% floating. 
During the second quarter, we repurchased 1 million shares for $50 million at an average price of $48.51 per share. AutoNation has approximately $116 million of remaining board authorization for share repurchase. 
As of July 28, there were approximately 102 million shares outstanding and again, this does not include the dilutive impact of stock options. 
Our leverage ratio increased slightly to 2.7x at the end of Q2 as compared to 2.6x at the end of Q1. The leverage ratio was 2.6x on a net debt basis, including used floorplan availability, and our covenant limit, as a reminder, is 3.75x. 
Capital expenditures were $62 million for the quarter. Capital expenditures are on an accrual basis, excluding operating lease buyouts and related asset sales. 
Our quarter-end cash balance was $55 million, which combined with our additional borrowing capacity resulted in total liquidity of $853 million at the end of June. 
We remain committed to disciplined expense management, while also opportunistically deploying capital to drive long-term shareholder value. 
Now let me turn you over to our Chief Operating Officer, Bill Berman."
112302,370154651,1017950,"AutoNation, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2016",2016-07-29,"Earnings Calls","AutoNation, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Cheryl, and good morning. Before discussing our results, I'd like to comment on the new vehicle industry selling environment for the quarter. Industry retail sales were down 2%, owned centers were up 13% and new vehicle leasing penetration, again,",578,"Thanks, Cheryl, and good morning. Before discussing our results, I'd like to comment on the new vehicle industry selling environment for the quarter. Industry retail sales were down 2%, owned centers were up 13% and new vehicle leasing penetration, again, was over 30%. 
Turning to our results, my comments will be on a same-store basis as compared to the prior year unless noted otherwise. Gross profit per variable operations was $442 million, down 5%. Variable gross was $3,376 on a per vehicle retail basis, a decrease of $18 or 1%. New and used same-store unit volume was down 5% compared to the second quarter last year. 
As we stated in the first quarter, we took steps to reduce our inventory levels, and we've made progress in the second quarter. We decreased our same-store new unit day supply from 76 days to 70 days or 6,000 units on a sequential basis. 
Our DSO target is in the low to mid-60s, and we expect our inventory levels to normalize by the end of the third quarter. 
New vehicle revenue for the quarter was $2.9 billion, a decrease of $49 million or 2%. We retail 79,400 units, a decrease of 5%. New vehicle gross profit was $1,923 on a per vehicle retail basis, down 2%. Manufactured volume basis in our program with high-cell target should continue to create a rational behavior in the marketplace. 
Despite industry retail sales being down in the second quarter, certain manufacturers, in particular, Ford, Chrysler and Nissan, set double-digit lower targets that were unattainable. For retail, these targets were unreasonable, we did not pursue them. 
For the quarter, used vehicle retail revenue was $1 billion, a decrease of $38 million or 3%. Used vehicle retail were 52,300, down 6%. Used vehicle gross profit was $1,548 on a per-retail basis, a decrease of $150 or 9%. As of June 30, 6,900 units or roughly 20% of our total used vehicle inventory was on hold, 4,300 units or 60% of those units were eligible for manufacture compensation. We anticipate over $3 million of manufacture compensation, which will partially offset our cost. We will recognize this compensation as each of these vehicles are sold. 
Also, at the end of the second quarter, approximately 75% or 5,200 of our used units on hold were related to Takata airbag recall. We started to receive limited Takata airbag replacement parts for certain brands, and we expect our used vehicle inventory on hold to peek towards the end of 2016, assuming parts become more readily available and no additional major recalls are issued. 
Customer financial services total gross profit was $211 million. Customer financial services gross profit on a per vehicle retail basis was $1,602, an increase of $66 or 4%. We set an all-time record in customer care gross profit of $337 million, an increase of $9 million or 3%. 
Also in the quarter, customer care revenue was $773 million, an increase of $17 million or 2%. Customer pay gross was $140 million, up 6% year-over-year. Warranty gross was $68 million, up 9%. Collision gross was $30 million, up 1%. We're continuing to work on adding additional capacity for our Collision business to meet the higher demand. 
Finally, I'd like to welcome our new Denver, Colorado and Westchester, New York associates to AutoNation, and we'd like to thank AutoNation's 25,000-plus associates for the hard work and dedication. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jon Ferrando, Executive Vice President responsible for M&A."

In July, we completed the previously announced acquisition of Centennial Chrysler Jeep in Denver, Colorado, a great brand fit for that market. Including this acquisition, we have 17 stores in the Denver market area. 
Also in July, we completed the previously announced acquisition of 4 Premium Luxury stores in Westchester County, New York. These stores consist of the BMW, Land Rover and Jaguar brands and collectively represent approximately $100 million in annual revenue. 
As part of the acquisition, we will be awarded a Land Rover franchise in White Plains and a Jaguar franchise in Mt. Kisco. 
Once our facility plan is complete, we will have 3 Jaguar and Land Rover stores in new state-of-the-art facilities in Westchester County, 1 in White Plains, 1 in Mt. Kisco and 1 in Larchmont/New Rochelle. We expect to generate an additional $100 million in revenue from these facilities once fully operational. 
We are excited about entering Westchester County, New York, an excellent Premium Luxury market with an outstanding platform of luxury franchises and attractive growth prospects. The business will be supported by our existing market team based in the Baltimore, Washington, D.C. area and provides an opportunity to further leverage our existing management infrastructure. 
In 2016, we've closed on the acquisition of 18 stores, generating $1.1 billion in annual revenue. 
As of today, our store portfolio numbers 373 franchises and 263 stores in 16 states, representing 35 manufacturer brands. 
Looking forward, we will continue to actively pursue acquisitions and new store opportunities with a focus on enhancing brand representation within our existing markets and markets that can be supported by our existing management infrastructure. We will continue to be selective and prudent with our capital with a focus on investing to produce strong returns and long-term shareholder value.

This industry can, if run it rationally, you can still be quite successful and very profitable. So if I look at how the first half of the year is developed, well, from a market point of view, that's exactly where it is with retail in the second quarter, down, let's say, 2% at retail. But it's still considerably higher incentives for that to happen. The recent diversions in manufacturer behavior, I would give -- for instance, I would complement General Motors. And you certainly look at their results and you see if you find the right balance between supply and demand with a good disciplined approach and really marketing that's focused on the long-term, you can be quite successful. And the -- on the margin business, it's going to be very expensive from an incentive point of view. You don't take. On the other hand, we have other manufacturers who are still very aggressive in their plans and if you want to -- Bill already mentioned it, and if you want to look at Ford Motor Company where we have targets for the third quarter that significant number of our stores have targets that are 15%, 20%, 25% up to 40% higher than prior year, well, it's just not going to happen. It's totally unrealistic, and we're not going to chase it. And -- but it is disruptive in the marketplace and causes irrational behavior, and there's a price tag for that. And if you look at Ford's total incentives being up 28% in the second quarter, I don't think they got a return on that approach. So there's a good contrast as to what I was talking about and how it can be managed differently. Now we'll see what happens from this point. But the headline is progress is being made in principle, and maybe we'll make even more progress in the second half of the year."

In one way, that was not -- it's not a difficult decision because the targets are so irrational or so unreasonable that you have no choice, but to pull back volume and try to manage for growth. The preciousness and arbitrary -- and how arbitrary the targets are is the problem because you'll have neighboring stores of competitors that got a completely different target that's very reachable and therefore, they're on a different price basis. And then you have others who think they can just make it that when they're closing or not going to make it, they do extremely irrational things. So it really -- it's a difficult situation to manage. But you're right, it will be a source of friction. But the extreme practitioners of volume-based incentives are really, at this point, Nissan, Chrysler and Ford. I would say the intensity of the discussion between dealers, retailers and those companies is going up. Some are even questioning the legality of how those programs are run in the fairness of those programs. So it's the -- I think we're approaching a moment where I would hope that these extreme fair steps, which, again, I called out in my keynote speech in January, would be the issue in 2016 because you take away a growing marketplace and these stair steps really don't work because they're entirely based on growth. Hopefully, the industry over the second half of the year will come to a better place on understanding how these programs can work and can't work. But at the moment, it's a source of real friction."

But when you put out -- when you've misjudged the market and you put out targets that are just not attainable and then you'd sprinkle it out there in a capricious arbitrary way, it really is disruptive in the marketplace and very difficult to manage, and you're going to have a lot of controversy with dealers.

Now can something else happen in the world that hammers the U.S. with recession? I suppose that can happen, but I don't see that a significant recession that would decline sales by 10% to 15%. So my outlook is high industry sales, high $16 million, just over $17 million for the next several years."

And then on the internal piece quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year, we're down about 5%.

So when I look at flat-out incentives, from the manufacturer, I really think they shouldn't break into double digit as a percent of their average MSRP. I think you hit a wall of diminishing return where the incentive is now at such a level that it's already depressing the resale value so you haven't really delivered the net -- reduced the net difference in the cost of the vehicle. Does that make sense? Where your next dollar of incentive doesn't have 10%, doesn't have the same impact when you went from 5% to 6%. There is a point of diminishing return that's dramatic. Second, I agree with you. Leasing is the same thing, it's -- you're selling the seeds of a day of reckoning that you really don't want, namely that you have so many vehicles coming back that are based on a residual value that's going to be higher than what the marketplace can handle. Now that -- all those risks are at the OEM level, not at the retail level, but we all know if you're basically pulling business forward now, that means that when the day of reckoning comes, the disruption is great.

And don't forget the retail market for used vehicles is 40 million units. So if you put it all together, we're looking at a market that's 55 million to 60 million units between new and used. It's very manageable. But can you screw it up? Yes, you can. And that's why we're speaking up. And by the way, I have to say if I look at all of the other publicly traded groups that have reported, they have all talked about taking more a -- taking a disciplined approach on the cost side and on the inventory side. I haven't checked everybody's numbers, but I have the sense that everybody's day supply has come down sequentially during the second quarter. So everybody said they were doing and they're out there doing that, and that's a very strong single back to the manufacturers, which they don't like, but I think is healthy that we can have a very profitable, sustainable, rational plateau period until we have very high interest rates or a major recession, and then volumes will fall.

I mean, do you have any examples of OEMs that are more rational in this environment currently?"

And as far as what the issue is, there's agreement -- seems to be agreement on -- within the industry now on plateau. But then I get the speech for the next 20 minutes as to why their company is going to be different. And not everybody can walk on water. So that's an issue. And as far as the pressure, I can tell you as having been at the table, you still have relatively high fixed cost or some costs where the marginal cost to produce another unit, the pressure is absolutely there, and they recognize revenue on shipment to us, they stuffed us as a Thanksgiving turkey, they recognize their revenue, and there it is, that's the third real for the industry and why this is a struggle. But hey, we're speaking up, and I think we're making progress. We're not where we need to be, but I'm hopeful we're making progress."

The millennials came of age with a great recession, they went back to school and double down on education and student debt.

They were highly skilled, very professional and rational, and they probably today are the most skilled practitioner of aggressive stair steps. Then you had Nissan arrived, which is just a loose cannon rolling back and forth across the deck, wreaking havoc. And now you've had Ford as of this year, join in. So if more go down that road, that is a real problem. But I think it's going to go the other way. The price tag of irrational stair steps incentives is beginning to be understood. And the damage to the brand, the change in your customer base, the impact on customer loyalty, the dissatisfaction and the fairness of pricing due to the fact that you've introduced a casino 3-car monte system, you've unleashed that on your customers. A manufacturer cannot talk about customer satisfaction in one breath and say, on the other hand, they're going to do aggressive stair steps because it's basically massively unfair to the customers. And finally, the relationship with your retailers that you really just wreak havoc.

Today, we reported an all-time record earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.08, an 8% increase as compared to EPS from continuing operations of $1 for the same period in the prior year. We achieved record EPS for continuing operations as we began to see the results of adjusting our cost structure and inventory levels to a plateauing industry sales environment. We also saw a benefit from our opportunistic capital allocation strategy, which included acquisitions and share repurchase. 
Revenue for the quarter totaled $5.4 billion compared to $5.2 billion in the same period a year ago, an increase of 4%. AutoNation's total retail new vehicle unit sales for the quarter were flat. On a same-store basis, retail new vehicle unit sales were down 5%. 
During the quarter, we continued to see disruption from the Takata airbag recall, which impacted our used vehicle business. Approximately 20% of our used vehicle inventory is currently on hold due to open recalls and approximately 75% of those vehicles are related to Takata airbags. 
Second quarter was a transitional quarter for certain brands as replacement parts for the Takata airbags became available. We anticipate that our used vehicle inventory on hold will peak towards the end of 2016. 
Also in the second half of the year, once the vehicles that have been on hold are repaired and sold, we will recognize compensation related to certain brands paid by the manufacturer, which will partially offset our cost for having carried these vehicles. 
Despite the very disruptive Takata airbag recall on our business, our industry-leading recall policy is unchanged. Our customers' safety still remains a top priority, and we will not retail any vehicle that has an open recall.

For the second quarter, we reported net income from continuing operations of $112 million or $1.08 per share versus net income of $115 million or $1 per share during the second quarter of 2015, an 8% increase on a per share basis. There were no adjustments to net income in either period. 
In the second quarter, revenue increased $217 million or 4% compared to the prior year and gross profit improved $23 million or 3%. 
SG&A as a percentage of gross profit was 69.5% for the quarter, which was relatively flat compared to the year ago period. 
We continue to focus on expense discipline and have aligned our cost structure to the plateauing industry environment. 
The provision for income tax in the quarter was $71 million or 38.8%. Net new vehicle floorplan was a benefit of $13.2 million, a decrease of $2.8 million from the second quarter of 2015. The decrease was primarily due to increased floorplan balances and higher interest rates, partially offset by higher floorplan assistance per unit. 
Floorplan debt decreased sequentially, approximately $237 million during the second quarter to $3.8 billion at quarter end, primarily due to lower inventory balances, partially offset by increased borrowings on our used vehicle floorplan facilities. 
Nonvehicle interest expense increased to $28.7 million compared to $21.6 million in the second quarter of 2015. The $7.1 million increase in interest expense was driven by higher average debt balances, resulting primarily from share repurchase and acquisitions. 
At the end of June, we had $2.7 billion of nonvehicle debt, an increase of $28 million compared to March 31, 2016. Nonvehicle debt includes $958 million of outstanding commercial paper borrowings. 
At the end of June, we had no amounts drawn under our revolving credit facility. As a consequence, our nonvehicle debt fixed to floating mix was approximately 65% fixed and 35% floating. 
During the second quarter, we repurchased 1 million shares for $50 million at an average price of $48.51 per share. AutoNation has approximately $116 million of remaining board authorization for share repurchase. 
As of July 28, there were approximately 102 million shares outstanding and again, this does not include the dilutive impact of stock options. 
Our leverage ratio increased slightly to 2.7x at the end of Q2 as compared to 2.6x at the end of Q1. The leverage ratio was 2.6x on a net debt basis, including used floorplan availability, and our covenant limit, as a reminder, is 3.75x. 
Capital expenditures were $62 million for the quarter. Capital expenditures are on an accrual basis, excluding operating lease buyouts and related asset sales. 
Our quarter-end cash balance was $55 million, which combined with our additional borrowing capacity resulted in total liquidity of $853 million at the end of June. 
We remain committed to disciplined expense management, while also opportunistically deploying capital to drive long-term shareholder value. 
Now let me turn you over to our Chief Operating Officer, Bill Berman."

Before discussing our results, I'd like to comment on the new vehicle industry selling environment for the quarter. Industry retail sales were down 2%, owned centers were up 13% and new vehicle leasing penetration, again,",579,"Thanks, Cheryl, and good morning. Before discussing our results, I'd like to comment on the new vehicle industry selling environment for the quarter. Industry retail sales were down 2%, owned centers were up 13% and new vehicle leasing penetration, again, was over 30%. 
Turning to our results, my comments will be on a same-store basis as compared to the prior year unless noted otherwise. Gross profit for variable operations was $442 million, down 5%. Variable gross was $3,376 on a per vehicle retail basis, a decrease of $18 or 1%. New and used same-store unit volume was down 5% compared to the second quarter last year. 
As we stated in the first quarter, we took steps to reduce our inventory levels, and we've made progress in the second quarter. We decreased our same-store new unit day supply from 76 days to 70 days or 6,000 units on a sequential basis. 
Our DSO target is in the low to mid-60s, and we expect our inventory levels to normalize by the end of the third quarter. 
New vehicle revenue for the quarter was $2.9 billion, a decrease of $49 million or 2%. We retailed 79,400 units, a decrease of 5%. New vehicle gross profit was $1,923 on a per vehicle retail basis, down 2%. Manufacturer volume-based incentive programs with high-sell targets should continue to create irrational behavior in the marketplace. 
Despite industry retail sales being down in the second quarter, certain manufacturers, in particular, Ford, Chrysler and Nissan, set double-digit growth targets that were unattainable. Where we felt these targets were unreasonable, we did not pursue them. 
For the quarter, used vehicle retail revenue was $1 billion, a decrease of $38 million or 3%. Used vehicle retailed were 52,300, down 6%. Used vehicle gross profit was $1,548 on a per-retail basis, a decrease of $150 or 9%. As of June 30, 6,900 units or roughly 20% of our total used vehicle inventory was on hold, 4,300 units or 60% of those units were eligible for manufacturer compensation. We anticipate over $3 million of manufacturer compensation, which will partially offset our cost. We will be able to recognize this compensation as each of these vehicles are sold. 
Also, at the end of the second quarter, approximately 75% or 5,200 of our used units on hold were related to Takata airbag recall. We started to receive limited Takata airbag replacement parts for certain brands, and we expect our used vehicle inventory on hold to peek towards the end of 2016, assuming parts become more readily available and no additional major recalls are issued. 
Customer financial services' total gross profit was $211 million. Customer financial services' gross profit on a per vehicle retail basis was $1,602, an increase of $66 or 4%. We set an all-time record in customer care gross profit of $337 million, an increase of $9 million or 3%. 
Also in the quarter, customer care revenue was $773 million, an increase of $17 million or 2%. Customer pay gross was $140 million, up 6% year-over-year. Warranty gross was $68 million, up 9%. Collision gross was $30 million, up 1%. We're continuing to work on adding additional capacity for our Collision business to meet the higher demand. 
Finally, I'd like to welcome our new Denver, Colorado and Westchester, New York associates to AutoNation, and would like to thank AutoNation's 25,000-plus associates for their hard work and dedication. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jon Ferrando, Executive Vice President responsible for M&A."

In July, we completed the previously announced acquisition of Centennial Chrysler Jeep in Denver, Colorado, a great brand fit for that market. Including this acquisition, we have 17 stores in the Denver market area. 
Also in July, we completed the previously announced acquisition of 4 Premium Luxury stores in Westchester County, New York. These stores consist of the BMW, Land Rover and Jaguar brands and collectively represent approximately $100 million in annual revenue. 
As part of the acquisition, we will be awarded a Land Rover franchise in White Plains and a Jaguar franchise in Mt. Kisco. 
Once our facility plan is complete, we will have 3 Jaguar and Land Rover stores in new state-of-the-art facilities in Westchester County, 1 in White Plains, 1 in Mt. Kisco and 1 in Larchmont/New Rochelle. We expect to generate an additional $100 million in revenue from these facilities once fully operational. 
We are excited about entering Westchester County, New York, an excellent Premium Luxury market with an outstanding platform of luxury franchises and attractive growth prospects. The business will be supported by our existing market team based in the Baltimore-Washington, D.C. area and provides an opportunity to further leverage our existing management infrastructure. 
In 2016, we've closed on the acquisition of 18 stores, generating $1.1 billion in annual revenue. 
As of today, our store portfolio numbers 373 franchises and 263 stores in 16 states, representing 35 manufacturer brands. 
Looking forward, we will continue to actively pursue acquisitions and new store opportunities with a focus on enhancing brand representation within our existing markets and markets that can be supported by our existing management infrastructure. We will continue to be selective and prudent with our capital with a focus on investing to produce strong returns and long-term shareholder value. 
I will now turn it back to Mike Jackson."

That the auto industry's in 3 phases, and the most misunderstood and mismanaged phase is plateau. Running at high 16 million, 17 million units, this industry can, if runs it rationally, you can still be quite successful and very profitable. So if I look at how the first half of the year has developed, well, from a market point of view that's exactly where it is, with retail in the second quarter down, let's say, 2% at retail. But it took considerably higher incentives for that to happen. There is a divergence in manufacturer behavior. I would give the -- for instance, I would complement General Motors. And you certainly look at their results and you see if you find the right balance between supply and demand with a good disciplined approach and, really, marketing that's focused on the long-term, you can be quite successful. And the -- on the margin business, it's going to be very expensive from an incentive point of view. You don't take. On the other hand, we have other manufacturers who are still very aggressive in their plans. And if you want to -- Bill already mentioned it, and if you want to look at Ford Motor Company where we have targets for the third quarter that -- significant number of our stores have targets that are 15%, 20%, 25% up to 40% higher than prior year. Well, that's just not going to happen. It's totally unrealistic, and we're not going to chase it. And -- but it is disruptive in the marketplace and causes irrational behavior, and there's a price tag for that. And if you look at Ford's total incentives being up 28% in the second quarter, I don't think they got a return on that approach. So there's a good contrast as to what I was talking about and how it can be managed differently. Now we'll see what happens from this point. But the headline is progress is being made in principle, and maybe we'll make even more progress in the second half of the year."

Yes, I think it is a major source of irritation and friction between retailers and manufacturers. In one way, it's not a difficult decision, because the targets are so irrational or so unreasonable that you have no choice but to pull back volume and try to manage for growth. The capriciousness and arbitrary -- and how arbitrary the targets are is a problem because you'll have neighboring stores of competitors that got a completely different target that's very reachable and therefore, they're on a different price basis. And then you have others who think they can just make it that when they get close and they're not going to make it, they do extremely irrational things. So it really -- it's a difficult situation to manage. But you're right, it will be a source of friction. But the extreme practitioners of volume-based incentives are really, at this point, Nissan, Chrysler and Ford. I would say the intensity of the discussion between dealers, retailers and those companies is going up. Some are even questioning the legality of how those programs are run and the fairness of those programs. So it's -- I think we're approaching a moment where I would hope that these extreme stair steps, which, again, I called out in my keynote speech in January, would be the issue in 2016. Because you take away a growing marketplace and these stair steps really don't work because they're entirely based on growth. Hopefully, the industry over the second half of the year will come to a better place on understanding how these programs can work and can't work. But at the moment, it's a source of real friction."

We need to bring -- we need to adjust costs and we need to bring inventories into line."" I think that's very beneficial to the industry to see the big companies behave in a rational way.

We're going to manage for gross because we can't get the volume numbers."" And they actually increased their new vehicle front-end gross and gave up the volume. So finding that line is difficult and ongoing, but it is a point of contention. I don't, in principle, have a problem with volume targets if they're realistic and attainable. But when you put out -- when you've misjudged the market and you put out targets that are just not attainable and then you sprinkle it out there in a capricious arbitrary way, it really is disruptive in the marketplace and very difficult to manage. And you're going to have a lot of controversy with dealers. Yes, you can go out and find dealers who say they like it. Well, I can tell you something, they got a easy target. Yes, if you get an easy target, you love it. But for all those -- and since we have such a big footprint and so many stores, we see that without rhyme and reason, you end up with stores that get huge targets plus 25%.

And upon sale, we'll recognize all that internal work that we did. So that has impacted our internal number. And Bill, why don't you talk about what internal was in the second quarter and talk about our hopes to add capacity on collision."

Warranty was up 9%, but to Mike's point, we still have some pent-up demand there with cars that we have on hold that are waiting for warranty repairs, primarily related to Takata air bags. On collision, you called that out right. We have record production levels, and we definitely have capacity issues. Not necessarily with people, it's more of a facility. And then on the internal piece quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year, we're down about 5%. But to Mike's point, that is 100% related to the number of new cars coming into inventory and the number of used cars that we're able to put through our system and put in the frontline. So as less cars on recall hold, we'll be able to see here an increase on our internal gross."

So when I look at flat-out incentives, from the manufacturer, I really think they shouldn't break into double digit as a percent of their average MSRP. I think you hit a wall of diminishing return where the incentive is now at such a level that it's already depressing the resale value so you haven't really delivered the net -- reduced the net difference in the cost of the vehicle. Does that make sense? Where your next dollar of incentive doesn't have -- at 10%, doesn't have the same impact that when you went from 5% to 6%. There is a point of diminishing return that's dramatic. Second, I agree with you. Leasing is the same thing, it's -- you're sowing the seeds of a day of reckoning that you really don't want. Namely that you have so many vehicles coming back that are based on a residual value that's going to be higher than what the marketplace can handle. Now that -- all those risks are at the OEM level, not at the retail level, but we all know if you're basically pulling business forward now, that means that when the day of reckoning comes, the disruption is great. And I'd just rather see the business managed more rationally and with stability now so that this plateau period is more sustainable. That's what I'm advocating."

Because ultimately, and I sort of alluded to it earlier, if the OEMs overdo it and push incentives too far, overproduce, push leasing too far, you are absolutely taking customers from the used vehicle market and converting them into the new vehicle market. And at the same time, you're increasing the supply of used vehicle coming back to the market on a faster turn. Well, you can see that, that is unsustainable, and there will be a day of reckoning. So I've been very clear that there is a risk there. I don't think we've gone over the cliff yet. I think it's still -- there's still plenty of time to manage this rationally and disciplined. And don't forget the retail market for used vehicles is 40 million units. So if you put it all together, we're looking at a market that's 55 million to 60 million units between new and used. It's very manageable. But can you screw it up? Yes, you can. And that's why we're speaking up. And by the way, I have to say if I look at all of the other publicly traded groups that have reported, they have all talked about taking more a -- taking a disciplined approach on the cost side and on the inventory side. I haven't checked everybody's numbers, but I have the sense that everybody's day supply has come down sequentially during the second quarter. So everybody said they would do it, and they're out there doing that. And that's a very strong signal back to the manufacturers, which they don't like, but I think is healthy that we can have a very profitable, sustainable, rational plateau period until we have very high interest rates or a major recession, and then volumes will fall.

So I think we're at a crucial point because if I look at the whole history, Chrysler was the first practitioner of aggressive stair steps. They were highly skilled, very professional and rational, and they probably today are the most skilled practitioner of aggressive stair steps. Then you had Nissan arrive, which is just a loose cannon rolling back and forth across the deck, wreaking havoc. And now you've had Ford as of this year, join in. So if more go down that road, that is a real problem. But I think it's going to go the other way. The price tag of irrational stair steps incentives is beginning to be understood. And the damage to the brand, the change in your customer base, the impact on customer loyalty, the dissatisfaction in the fairness of pricing due to the fact that you've introduced a casino 3-car monte system. You've unleashed that on your customers. A manufacturer cannot talk about customer satisfaction in one breath and say, on the other hand, they're going to do aggressive stair steps because it's basically massively unfair to the customers. And finally, the relationship with your retailers that you really just wreak havoc. So I think the long term -- yes, in the near term, it's like heroine, it feels nice, it feels pretty good. But then you look in the mirror one day, and you look like Dorian Gray, and you realize you can't go on like this. So we're at a crucial point, could go either way.

Today, we reported an all-time record earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.08, an 8% increase as compared to EPS from continuing operations of $1 for the same period in the prior year. We achieved record EPS for continuing operations as we began to see the results of adjusting our cost structure and inventory levels to a plateauing industry sales environment. We also saw a benefit from our opportunistic capital allocation strategy, which included acquisitions and share repurchase. 
Revenue for the quarter totaled $5.4 billion compared to $5.2 billion in the same period a year ago, an increase of 4%. AutoNation's total retail new vehicle unit sales for the quarter were flat. On a same-store basis, retail new vehicle unit sales were down 5%. 
During the quarter, we continued to see disruption from the Takata airbag recall, which impacted our used vehicle business. Approximately 20% of our used vehicle inventory is currently on hold due to open recalls and approximately 75% of those vehicles are related to Takata airbags. 
Second quarter was a transitional quarter for certain brands as replacement parts for the Takata airbags became available. We anticipate that our used vehicle inventory on hold will peak towards the end of 2016. 
Also in the second half of the year, once the vehicles that have been on hold are repaired and sold, we will recognize compensation related to certain brands paid by the manufacturer, which will partially offset our cost for having carried these vehicles. 
Despite the very disruptive Takata airbag recall on our business, our industry-leading recall policy is unchanged. Our customers' safety still remains a top priority, and we will not retail any vehicle that has an open recall.

For the second quarter, we reported net income from continuing operations of $112 million or $1.08 per share versus net income of $115 million or $1 per share during the second quarter of 2015, an 8% increase on a per share basis. There were no adjustments to net income in either period. 
In the second quarter, revenue increased $217 million or 4% compared to the prior year and gross profit improved $23 million or 3%. 
SG&A as a percentage of gross profit was 69.5% for the quarter, which was relatively flat compared to the year ago period. 
We continue to focus on expense discipline and have aligned our cost structure to the plateauing industry environment. 
The provision for income tax in the quarter was $71 million or 38.8%. Net new vehicle floorplan was a benefit of $13.2 million, a decrease of $2.8 million from the second quarter of 2015. The decrease was primarily due to increased floorplan balances and higher interest rates, partially offset by higher floorplan assistance per unit. 
Floorplan debt decreased sequentially, approximately $237 million during the second quarter to $3.8 billion at quarter end, primarily due to lower inventory balances, partially offset by increased borrowings on our used vehicle floorplan facilities. 
Nonvehicle interest expense increased to $28.7 million compared to $21.6 million in the second quarter of 2015. The $7.1 million increase in interest expense was driven by higher average debt balances, resulting primarily from share repurchase and acquisitions. 
At the end of June, we had $2.7 billion of nonvehicle debt, an increase of $28 million compared to March 31, 2016. Nonvehicle debt includes $958 million of outstanding commercial paper borrowings. 
At the end of June, we had no amounts drawn under our revolving credit facility. As a consequence, our nonvehicle debt fixed to floating mix was approximately 65% fixed and 35% floating. 
During the second quarter, we repurchased 1 million shares for $50 million at an average price of $48.51 per share. AutoNation has approximately $116 million of remaining board authorization for share repurchase. 
As of July 28, there were approximately 102 million shares outstanding and again, this does not include the dilutive impact of stock options. 
Our leverage ratio increased slightly to 2.7x at the end of Q2 as compared to 2.6x at the end of Q1. The leverage ratio was 2.6x on a net debt basis, including used floorplan availability, and our covenant limit, as a reminder, is 3.75x. 
Capital expenditures were $62 million for the quarter. Capital expenditures are on an accrual basis, excluding operating lease buyouts and related asset sales. 
Our quarter-end cash balance was $55 million, which combined with our additional borrowing capacity resulted in total liquidity of $853 million at the end of June. 
We remain committed to disciplined expense management, while also opportunistically deploying capital to drive long-term shareholder value. 
Now let me turn you over to our Chief Operating Officer, Bill Berman."

Before discussing our results, I'd like to comment on the new vehicle industry selling environment for the quarter. Industry retail sales were down 2%, owned centers were up 13% and new vehicle leasing penetration, again,",579,"Thanks, Cheryl, and good morning. Before discussing our results, I'd like to comment on the new vehicle industry selling environment for the quarter. Industry retail sales were down 2%, owned centers were up 13% and new vehicle leasing penetration, again, was over 30%. 
Turning to our results, my comments will be on a same-store basis as compared to the prior year unless noted otherwise. Gross profit for variable operations was $442 million, down 5%. Variable gross was $3,376 on a per vehicle retail basis, a decrease of $18 or 1%. New and used same-store unit volume was down 5% compared to the second quarter last year. 
As we stated in the first quarter, we took steps to reduce our inventory levels, and we've made progress in the second quarter. We decreased our same-store new unit day supply from 76 days to 70 days or 6,000 units on a sequential basis. 
Our DSO target is in the low to mid-60s, and we expect our inventory levels to normalize by the end of the third quarter. 
New vehicle revenue for the quarter was $2.9 billion, a decrease of $49 million or 2%. We retailed 79,400 units, a decrease of 5%. New vehicle gross profit was $1,923 on a per vehicle retail basis, down 2%. Manufacturer volume-based incentive programs with high-sell targets should continue to create irrational behavior in the marketplace. 
Despite industry retail sales being down in the second quarter, certain manufacturers, in particular, Ford, Chrysler and Nissan, set double-digit growth targets that were unattainable. Where we felt these targets were unreasonable, we did not pursue them. 
For the quarter, used vehicle retail revenue was $1 billion, a decrease of $38 million or 3%. Used vehicle retailed were 52,300, down 6%. Used vehicle gross profit was $1,548 on a per-retail basis, a decrease of $150 or 9%. As of June 30, 6,900 units or roughly 20% of our total used vehicle inventory was on hold, 4,300 units or 60% of those units were eligible for manufacturer compensation. We anticipate over $3 million of manufacturer compensation, which will partially offset our cost. We will be able to recognize this compensation as each of these vehicles are sold. 
Also, at the end of the second quarter, approximately 75% or 5,200 of our used units on hold were related to Takata airbag recall. We started to receive limited Takata airbag replacement parts for certain brands, and we expect our used vehicle inventory on hold to peek towards the end of 2016, assuming parts become more readily available and no additional major recalls are issued. 
Customer financial services' total gross profit was $211 million. Customer financial services' gross profit on a per vehicle retail basis was $1,602, an increase of $66 or 4%. We set an all-time record in customer care gross profit of $337 million, an increase of $9 million or 3%. 
Also in the quarter, customer care revenue was $773 million, an increase of $17 million or 2%. Customer pay gross was $140 million, up 6% year-over-year. Warranty gross was $68 million, up 9%. Collision gross was $30 million, up 1%. We're continuing to work on adding additional capacity for our Collision business to meet the higher demand. 
Finally, I'd like to welcome our new Denver, Colorado and Westchester, New York associates to AutoNation, and would like to thank AutoNation's 25,000-plus associates for their hard work and dedication.

As part of the acquisition, we will be awarded a Land Rover franchise in White Plains and a Jaguar franchise in Mt. Kisco. 
Once our facility plan is complete, we will have 3 Jaguar and Land Rover stores in new state-of-the-art facilities in Westchester County, 1 in White Plains, 1 in Mt. Kisco and 1 in Larchmont/New Rochelle. We expect to generate an additional $100 million in revenue from these facilities once fully operational.

As of today, our store portfolio numbers 373 franchises and 263 stores in 16 states, representing 35 manufacturer brands. 
Looking forward, we will continue to actively pursue acquisitions and new store opportunities with a focus on enhancing brand representation within our existing markets and markets that can be supported by our existing management infrastructure.

That the auto industry's in 3 phases, and the most misunderstood and mismanaged phase is plateau. Running at high 16 million, 17 million units, this industry can, if runs it rationally, you can still be quite successful and very profitable. So if I look at how the first half of the year has developed, well, from a market point of view that's exactly where it is, with retail in the second quarter down, let's say, 2% at retail. But it took considerably higher incentives for that to happen. There is a divergence in manufacturer behavior. I would give the -- for instance, I would complement General Motors. And you certainly look at their results and you see if you find the right balance between supply and demand with a good disciplined approach and, really, marketing that's focused on the long-term, you can be quite successful. And the -- on the margin business, it's going to be very expensive from an incentive point of view. You don't take. On the other hand, we have other manufacturers who are still very aggressive in their plans. And if you want to -- Bill already mentioned it, and if you want to look at Ford Motor Company where we have targets for the third quarter that -- significant number of our stores have targets that are 15%, 20%, 25% up to 40% higher than prior year. Well, that's just not going to happen. It's totally unrealistic, and we're not going to chase it. And -- but it is disruptive in the marketplace and causes irrational behavior, and there's a price tag for that. And if you look at Ford's total incentives being up 28% in the second quarter, I don't think they got a return on that approach. So there's a good contrast as to what I was talking about and how it can be managed differently. Now we'll see what happens from this point. But the headline is progress is being made in principle, and maybe we'll make even more progress in the second half of the year."

And they got to go through a whole design certification process to get the replacement parts to it.

Yes, I think it is a major source of irritation and friction between retailers and manufacturers. In one way, it's not a difficult decision, because the targets are so irrational or so unreasonable that you have no choice but to pull back volume and try to manage for growth. The capriciousness and arbitrary -- and how arbitrary the targets are is a problem because you'll have neighboring stores of competitors that got a completely different target that's very reachable and therefore, they're on a different price basis. And then you have others who think they can just make it that when they get close and they're not going to make it, they do extremely irrational things. So it really -- it's a difficult situation to manage. But you're right, it will be a source of friction. But the extreme practitioners of volume-based incentives are really, at this point, Nissan, Chrysler and Ford. I would say the intensity of the discussion between dealers, retailers and those companies is going up. Some are even questioning the legality of how those programs are run and the fairness of those programs. So it's -- I think we're approaching a moment where I would hope that these extreme stair steps, which, again, I called out in my keynote speech in January, would be the issue in 2016. Because you take away a growing marketplace and these stair steps really don't work because they're entirely based on growth. Hopefully, the industry over the second half of the year will come to a better place on understanding how these programs can work and can't work. But at the moment, it's a source of real friction."

We need to bring -- we need to adjust costs and we need to bring inventories into line."" I think that's very beneficial to the industry to see the big companies behave in a rational way.

We're going to manage for gross because we can't get the volume numbers."" And they actually increased their new vehicle front-end gross and gave up the volume. So finding that line is difficult and ongoing, but it is a point of contention. I don't, in principle, have a problem with volume targets if they're realistic and attainable. But when you put out -- when you've misjudged the market and you put out targets that are just not attainable and then you sprinkle it out there in a capricious arbitrary way, it really is disruptive in the marketplace and very difficult to manage. And you're going to have a lot of controversy with dealers. Yes, you can go out and find dealers who say they like it. Well, I can tell you something, they got a easy target. Yes, if you get an easy target, you love it. But for all those -- and since we have such a big footprint and so many stores, we see that without rhyme and reason, you end up with stores that get huge targets plus 25%.

So when I look at flat-out incentives, from the manufacturer, I really think they shouldn't break into double digit as a percent of their average MSRP. I think you hit a wall of diminishing return where the incentive is now at such a level that it's already depressing the resale value so you haven't really delivered the net -- reduced the net difference in the cost of the vehicle. Does that make sense? Where your next dollar of incentive doesn't have -- at 10%, doesn't have the same impact that when you went from 5% to 6%. There is a point of diminishing return that's dramatic. Second, I agree with you. Leasing is the same thing, it's -- you're sowing the seeds of a day of reckoning that you really don't want. Namely that you have so many vehicles coming back that are based on a residual value that's going to be higher than what the marketplace can handle. Now that -- all those risks are at the OEM level, not at the retail level, but we all know if you're basically pulling business forward now, that means that when the day of reckoning comes, the disruption is great. And I'd just rather see the business managed more rationally and with stability now so that this plateau period is more sustainable. That's what I'm advocating."

Because ultimately, and I sort of alluded to it earlier, if the OEMs overdo it and push incentives too far, overproduce, push leasing too far, you are absolutely taking customers from the used vehicle market and converting them into the new vehicle market. And at the same time, you're increasing the supply of used vehicle coming back to the market on a faster turn. Well, you can see that, that is unsustainable, and there will be a day of reckoning. So I've been very clear that there is a risk there. I don't think we've gone over the cliff yet. I think it's still -- there's still plenty of time to manage this rationally and disciplined. And don't forget the retail market for used vehicles is 40 million units. So if you put it all together, we're looking at a market that's 55 million to 60 million units between new and used. It's very manageable. But can you screw it up? Yes, you can. And that's why we're speaking up. And by the way, I have to say if I look at all of the other publicly traded groups that have reported, they have all talked about taking more a -- taking a disciplined approach on the cost side and on the inventory side. I haven't checked everybody's numbers, but I have the sense that everybody's day supply has come down sequentially during the second quarter. So everybody said they would do it, and they're out there doing that. And that's a very strong signal back to the manufacturers, which they don't like, but I think is healthy that we can have a very profitable, sustainable, rational plateau period until we have very high interest rates or a major recession, and then volumes will fall.

So from that standpoint, it's getting a little easier and there's still a good flow of potential sellers that will be ready to divest their business over the next few years, and we're in dialogue with a lot of those folks."

They're now entering the workforce, they have to pay down that student debt, but their fundamental desires to marry, have children, have a home, have a car are there.

Then you had Nissan arrive, which is just a loose cannon rolling back and forth across the deck, wreaking havoc. And now you've had Ford as of this year, join in. So if more go down that road, that is a real problem. But I think it's going to go the other way. The price tag of irrational stair steps incentives is beginning to be understood. And the damage to the brand, the change in your customer base, the impact on customer loyalty, the dissatisfaction in the fairness of pricing due to the fact that you've introduced a casino 3-card monte system. You've unleashed that on your customers. A manufacturer cannot talk about customer satisfaction in one breath and say, on the other hand, they're going to do aggressive stair steps because it's basically massively unfair to the customers.

And I am pleased to share the next phase of our customer-focused comprehensive brand extension strategy.
In 2013, we launched the AutoNation retail brand, a pivotal moment in the company's history which set the stage for AutoNation Express, AutoNation Customer Financial Service products and now, AutoNation USA standalone preowned vehicle sales and service centers. AutoNation USA is the next step in establishing AutoNation as the most recognized brand in auto retail.
We have identified 25 AutoNation USA sites in our existing markets of which 5 are planned to be opened in 2017.
Several building blocks for AutoNation USA have already been put in place in our existing franchise stores with tremendous success. One Price, our negotiation-free preowned vehicle pricing strategy, AutoNation Precision Parts and AutoNation Auto Gear, branded parts and accessory lines, were each launched in the third quarter.
One Price allows consumers to shop over 20,000 preowned vehicles on our website with transparent, hassle-free and fair pricing. Consumer and associate feedback has been phenomenal. Consumers have said the buying experience was very easy, simple, no hassle, just fair pricing. Employees have said it enhances the overall customer experience.
As part of the continued brand extension strategy, we're expanding our AutoNation Auto Auctions, AutoNation collision centers from coast-to-coast. Our plan is to open 4 additional auctions over the next 2 years. We also plan to acquire an additional 18 collision centers over the same period.
We expect that these investments in the next phase of the company's brand extension rollout will exceed $500 million in the aggregate over the next several years. The next phase in the company's history represents attractive opportunities that we expect will generate significant long-term shareholder value.
Turning to our third quarter results. Today, we reported EPS from continuing operations of $1.05, which matched our third quarter record achieved last year.
Revenue for the quarter totaled $5.6 billion compared to $5.4 billion in the same period a year ago, an increase of 4%. AutoNation's total retail new vehicle unit sales for the quarter were down 1% and our same-store sale basis, down 6%.
Today, we also announced the acquisition of 3 Premium Luxury franchises and the award of 3 Premium Luxury franchise add-points, which include our first BMW franchise in South Florida and our first Jaguar-Land Rover franchises in Texas. We also acquired our 70th collision center in Westmont, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago.
The combined anticipated annual revenue from these acquisition and add-points is $430 million once the add-points are fully operational.
I now turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Cheryl Miller."

For the third quarter, we reported net income from continuing operations of $108 million or $1.05 per share versus net income of $119 million or $1.05 per share during the third quarter of 2015. Effective as of the third quarter of 2015, AutoNation will only report its financial results in accordance with GAAP in its earnings releases and SEC reports and will not include non-GAAP core adjusted measures.
In the second quarter, revenue increased $214 million or 4% compared to the prior year and gross profit improved $6 million or 1%. SG&A as a percentage of gross profit was 70.7% for the quarter, which represents a 220 basis point increase compared to the year ago period. The increase was driven by gross profit pressure from certain manufacturers' disruptive marketing and sales incentive in the new vehicle marketplace. We believe that the continued pressure on gross profit from these incentives as well as expenses related to the brand extensions announced today may increase our SG&A as a percentage of gross profit by 100 basis points sequentially in the fourth quarter.
The provision for income tax in the quarter was $67 million or 38.3%. Net new vehicle floorplan was a benefit of $14.9 million, a decrease of $2.2 million from the third quarter of 2015. The decrease was primarily due to increased floorplan balances and higher interest rates, partially offset by higher floorplan assistance per unit.
Floorplan debt decreased sequentially, approximately $263 million during the third quarter to $3.5 billion at quarter end, primarily due to lower new inventory balances, partially offset by increased borrowings on our used vehicle floorplan facilities.
Non-vehicle interest expense increased to $28.9 million compared to $21.4 million in the third quarter of 2015. A $7.5 million increase in interest expense was driven by higher average debt balances, resulting primarily from share repurchase and acquisitions.
At the end of September, we had $2.8 billion of non-vehicle debt, an increase of $50 million compared to June 30, 2016. Non-vehicle debt includes $975 billion of outstanding commercial paper borrowings.
At the end of September, we had no amounts drawn under our revolving credit facility. As a consequence, our non-vehicle debt fixed to floating mix was approximately 65% fixed and 35% floating.
During the third quarter, we repurchased 1 million shares for $50 million at an average price of $48.62 per share. AutoNation has approximately $316 million of remaining board authorization per share repurchase.
As of October 26, there were approximately 101 million shares outstanding. This does not include the dilutive impact of stock option.
Our leverage ratio increased slightly to 2.8x at the end of Q3 as compared to 2.7x at the end of Q2. The leverage ratio was 2.7x on a net debt basis, including used floorplan availability, and our covenant limit is 3.75x.
Capital expenditures were $69 million for the quarter. Capital expenditures, again, are on an accrual basis, excluding operating lease buyouts and related asset sales. Our quarter end cash balance was $62 million which, combined with our additional borrowing capacity, resulted in total liquidity of $843 million at the end of September.
We're very excited about the brand extension opportunities announced today and their ability to diversify our business and once fully ramped, improve our profitability. We will continue to focus on driving shareholder value through strategic investments and opportunistic capital allocation.

Today, we are excited to announce and share our comprehensive brand extension strategy. I will start with AutoNation USA, our standalone preowned vehicle sales and service centers. Our plan is to open 5 AutoNation USA stores in 2017. We have also identified 20 additional sites over the next several years within our existing markets. Customers will have the opportunity to purchase on AutoNation-certified vehicle and service that vehicle at any AutoNation USA store. AutoNation USA will utilize AutoNation Express, the company's digital platform, which allows customers to dramatically reduce their transaction time by offering a seamless end-to-end experience where they can search online for inventory, select and reserve a vehicle, value their trade, prepayment options and apply for financing.
One Price, our negotiation-free, preowned vehicle pricing strategy, which we've already begun to roll out in our current franchise location, will also be the pricing strategy at our AutoNation USA stores. One Price allows us to leverage our centralized capabilities such as centralized pricing and appraisals. Initial customer and associate feedback has been exceptionally positive. One Price offers customers a transparent and stress-free buying experience and will be fully implemented in our existing locations by the end of the second quarter of 2017.
AutoNation USA will implement our new sales associate non-commission-based pay plan as well. The new pay plan has 4 simple metrics that give us a strategic advantage in recruiting associates. Our new pay plan offers salaries and paid training. It's competitive, it's a plan that is based on rewarding behaviors that drive productivity while delivering a peerless customer experience.
AutoNation USA stores service now centers will utilize AutoNation Precision Parts, an AutoNation branded line of high-quality, competitively priced maintenance and repair parts for the vehicle reconditioning and customer repairs.
We launched AutoNation Precision Parts in the third quarter with AutoNation branded batteries, which feature an industry-leading free lifetime replacement guarantee. Service now will also allow us to engage and recapture customers who are post the warranty and are no longer servicing at the franchise stores. We now offer our consumers a compelling value and options as well as drive service retention.
Also in the third quarter, we launched our automotive accessory line, AutoNation Auto Gear, featuring our partnership with WeatherTech, a leader in aftermarket auto accessories. We will continue to expand our precision parts and AutoNation Auto Gear product line in phases as our product portfolios are developed.
In addition, we're expanding our very successful AutoNation Auto Auctions from coast-to-coast. We have a successful wholesale auction in Southern California, processing over 25,000 vehicles annually, and we plan to leverage our brand and expertise in additional markets by wholesaling our own vehicles and offering third party buyers and sellers access to high-quality inventory. We plan to open 4 additional AutoNation-branded auctions over the next 2 years starting in Orlando, Florida and Houston, Texas in Q1 2017.
Lastly, our brand extension strategy will also include expanding our AutoNation collision center footprint. AutoNation currently owns and operates 70 collision and repair centers, including the newly acquired Westmont Body Werks in Westmont, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago. 
AutoNation has the largest collision center network among automotive retailers with expertise in servications with multiple manufacturers and as a preferred repair provider for many of the major insurance carriers. New locations are planned for key markets where AutoNation has stored identity but does not have existing collision presence or has capacity limitations. 
Over the next 2 years, we plan to open or acquire at least 18 new AutoNation branded collision centers across the country. The steps were taken with the launch of our customer-focused comprehensive brand extension strategy and diversified business model will position us to capitalize on our industry's leading retail plan. 
Now turning to our third quarter results. My comments today will be on the same-store basis as compared to the prior year unless noted otherwise. 
Gross profit for variable operations was $435 million, down 8%. Variable gross was $3,320 on a per vehicle retail basis, which is relatively flat compared to the same period last year. 
New and used same-store unit volume was down 6% compared to the third quarter last year. Certain manufacturers continued their disruptive marketing and sales incentives which resulted in multi-tier pricing despite new vehicle sales being down again in the third quarter. Manufacturers must find a rational and disciplined approach that does not erode their future brand value. 
New vehicle revenue for the quarter was $3 billion, a decrease of $87 million or 3%. We've retailed 81,600 units, a decrease of 6%. 
New vehicle gross profit was $1,805 on a per vehicle retailed basis, down 7%. 
As of September 30, approximately 14% or 5,400 units of our total used vehicle inventory was on the hold due to the Takata airbag recall. The Takata airbag recall negatively impacted our net income from continuing operations by $6 million after tax or $0.06 per share. 
We started to receive limited Takata airbag replacement parts for Honda and BMW only. 
Used vehicle retail revenue was $1 billion, a decrease of $25 million or 2%. Used vehicles retailed were 51,500, down 7%. Used vehicle gross profit was $1,543 on a per vehicle retailed basis, an increase of 2%. 
Customer financial services total gross profit was $215 million, customer financial services gross profit on a per vehicle retailed basis was $1,617, an increase of $60 or 4%. 
 
We set an all-time record in customer care gross profit of $338 million, an increase of $6 million or 2%. 
Also in the quarter, customer care revenue was $782 million, an increase of $22 million or 3%. Customer paid gross was $138 million, up 4% year-over-year, warranty gross was $71 million, up 9%. 
Collision gross was $29 million, up 1% year-over-year. 
Finally, I'd like to welcome our new San Diego, California and Westmont, Illinois associate to AutoNation and would like to thank [indiscernible] 25,000-plus associates for their hard work and dedication. This is truly an exciting time to be part of the AutoNation team as we launch AutoNation USA and implement our customer-focused comprehensive brand extension strategy, which will create new revenue and product streams for the company. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jon Ferrando, Executive Vice President responsible for M&A."

Starting with the acquisitions. In October, we completed the acquisition of BMW of Vista, our second BMW store in the Northern San Diego market and our 15th BMW store nationwide. As part of our AutoNation brand expansion strategy, we also completed the acquisition of Westmont Body Werks in our Chicago market, our 70th collision center. 
In the fourth quarter, we expect to close on the acquisition of Jaguar-Land Rover Bethesda, our 10th store in the Baltimore D.C. and our eighth Jaguar Land Rover store nationwide. 
The store has the largest Jaguar Land Rover showroom in the United States and fits well with the strong Premium Luxury demographics in that part of the Baltimore-Washington D.C. corridor. 
We also announced the award of BMW of Delray Beach and Jaguar Land Rover West Houston add-points. BMW of Delray Beach is our first BMW franchise in South Florida and our 25th Premium Luxury franchise in Florida. 
Jaguar and Land Rover West Houston is our 10th Premium Luxury store in Texas. The add-points will be a large Premium Luxury stores located in excellent other retail locations with very attractive luxury and growth demographics. Both of these add-points are expected to open in 2018. 
In 2016, we have completed or announced the acquisition award of 49 franchises, which are expected to generate approximately $1.5 billion in annual revenue once fully operational. 
As of today, we represent 35 manufacturer brands and our store portfolio numbers 372 franchises and 262 auto retail stores, along with 70 collision centers in 16 states. 
Looking forward, we will continue to actively pursue acquisitions and new store opportunities with a focus on enhancing brand representation within our existing markets and markets that can be supported by our existing management infrastructure. We will continue to be selective and prudent with our capital with a focus in investing to produce the strong returns and long-term shareholder value.

This year and through the third quarter, certain manufacturers continued disruptive marketing and sales incentives which resulted in multitier pricing that are unfair for consumers as well as retailers. 
In the third quarter, these marketing programs had a significant negative impact on new vehicle volume and gross profit per vehicle retailed. These disruptive invest incentive programs are damaging to the OEM brand and in my view on sustainable. Retail sales volume for manufacturers who use of these toxic marketing programs are significantly below market with, let's say, the market basically retail flat for the year and the irrational players being down 6%. 
And I also observed that they're eroding 3-year residual value of their brand, whereas the rational marketers have 3-year resale value of 50%, the irrational marketers are at 43%. This is undermining the retail value of their existing customers and therefore, their brand. 
These certain manufacturers must find irrational and disciplined approach that does not erode their future brand value. 
Having said that, this is an exciting time for AutoNation with the launch of AutoNation USA and our comprehensive brand extension strategy.

As you're going through this process and launching all these new initiatives, I guess, really just a very simple question is why now and what's driving this decision? I mean, is it something that is sort of hampered, the pressure you're seeing in your core business? Is something you kind of seeing your competitors do that is pretty good?

112302,403260837,1065334,"AutoNation, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 28, 2016",2016-10-28,"Earnings Calls","AutoNation, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, John.

So we also have to take into consideration that the new vehicle market is definitel",743,"Thanks, John. Well, our view, if I look at the automotive retail marketplace for retail new, it's less than $15 million, for retail preowned, it's approaching $40 million. So we also have to take into consideration that the new vehicle market is definitely cyclical with 1 or 3 phases growth plateau and decline. Now you can be in plateau quite some time, but it brings, but Plateau brings a whole set of issues if I go back 5 years ago anticipating that plateau would eventually arise, I said I need a strategy that we can take much more of our destiny in our own hands and continue to grow the business. Now to be able to do that successfully, I felt we needed 2 foundational elements: One was a brand that was well known in the marketplace already; and a digital capability that we knew could deliver sales. So we've done both of that steps successfully with the AutoNation brand and with our AutoNation Express launch. It now delivers almost 30% of our sales from those sites. So having taken that step as preconditions and in order to give us the confidence that these stores would turn profitable quickly, we knew we needed a value equation for the consumer and an outstanding experience. We know the customer craves fairness and transparency and price and that means they need to be one price. So then we said, well, the brand has to be in alignment between our existing franchise business and this extensive business. Therefore, we have do one price our existing preowned business. So that started already this year as a conditional element and has gone extremely well, and we will have all AutoNation franchise preowned one price sometime the beginning of next year, but certainly, by the time the first AutoNation USA stores open. Next is AutoNation USA stores have a customer care component. We wanted to value story there. Again, to your point, we do very well taking care of cars that are new to 5, 6, 7 years old and then there's the big drop-off. So we want to attract that market, but we need a value equation. So we want -- we're very significant purchaser of cars already today, so we want to make suppliers and negotiated exactly what the consumer would want and are launching AutoNation-branded parts and accessories. We're highly confident of the degree of trust for the consumer because of the AutoNation financial products that we had already launched. Again, we went to the major suppliers, say we have a profound understanding what the consumer wants. Here's the value equation we have to meet. But now the customer has to trust the product, and so it has to be branded to AutoNation. And we see already that the adoption rate in all the AutoNation-branded stores is approaching 95% of the AutoNation customer care products. All of that means that the significant cost of launching a brand has been done. The significant investment in launching AutoNation Express is done. Opening the door to make brand extensions and realizing opportunities that you have created by what has come before. Now referring back to the old megastores, I would hear for that and there was many customer friendly elements that I liked. There was credo of the grave elements that didn't make sense like the whole linkage between the rental car business and the megastores. The megastores having said that, they had many customer elements that were to be admired were conceptually completely the wrong size and scale with no ability to exit. And most importantly, the brand that exist and there's no alignment between the franchise business and what would be this freestanding business. So conflict was inherent. So all of those issues are resolved today, and we now move into this brand extension step with many more elements alignment with the existing business and in a very strong position with the goal of having much more control of our destiny and what I perceive we ultimately having them is the largest Premium Luxury business at retail in America approaching with what Jon Ferrando just announced, 100 franchises in the Premium Luxury business coast-to-coast, a volume franchise business branded under the name AutoNation and now, a freestanding AutoNation USA business that we can see -- what we see as a significant opportunity to grow in the much larger preowned business but doing it from a position of strength."

And we know these vehicles very well, who owns them, where they are, why they're dropped off. And we absolutely intend to attract them. So as far us pay off, here's the way I think about it. So if you look at our performance on financial products, it's already exception of and a big part of that growth and why it's sustainable is because of the AutoNation financial products. So the pay off was immediate for having built the brand. So what are the extensions that have immediate benefit to the company? Parts. Because these parts, these AutoNation parts are going to be available in our franchise stores as well as the AutoNation USA stores. The benefit is immediate. We have significant batteries, lighter blades, filters already in there, and we are in negotiation with supplier for hundreds of more parts that will be available both in our franchise business and in the AutoNation USA store. The benefit of that is immediate, both with the customer and for AutoNation. Of course, we will continue to offer OEM parts, and of course, we will use them for all warranty work or all customer care work that the manufacturer pays for. But beyond that, we will offer our customers choices, and we think there will be high adoption rate just like we saw in the service contract and oh, by the way, we will then be able to have this supply of parts on the cost basis for our reconditioning in our U.S.A. stores and in the customer care aspect of our U.S.A. stores. So there's an immediate benefit for that. The same thing with accessories. And by the way, the returns are moved to profitability from our auction site and on collision centers is very quick. Now the USA stores, there's a ramp in it. I think we'll be in the second year to see profitability from these stores or break into profitability, but I have a high degree of confidence that we will have significant market awareness and ability to generate sales because of our AutoNation Express capability. So that gives me quite a great deal of confident to say, the second year, these stores are going to break into profitability. Now for the last few quarters and early into next year, is there a surge of spending in investment in all the training building up the facility teams and everything else that has to go on to launch something? Yes, we'll take that in stride. It's nothing like launching a brand or launching AutoNation Express, but it's in there. And then that will move behind us. And then as these stores, the AutoNation USA stores start moving into profitability, we'll continue to build out as we've identified another 20 sites in development. So we're not starting from a standstill here is my point, and the return that we're receiving for certain initiatives is already a payback for some cost or past cost that we've already put into the brand in AutoNation Express. That's the way I think about it. Now we're really going to be reaping the opportunity of what we paid for in '13, '14 and '15. Now everyone sees why we took the risk and spent the money to create a band and create a digital capability. Now in the very near term and I mean, right this minute and into 2017, will I have some more cost to get these things up and going? Yes, I will, but that will be mitigated by the other initiatives and once you get past that first tranche of stores, off we go."

And then there are new entrants focus completely on online transaction and taking massive SG&A cost out of the selling process. And they're gaining some traction, too, but it obviously requires a lot of marketing push.

Now to your point on the cost side, we will absolutely take AutoNation Express, extend into the store as an operating system as the enterprise operating system. However, we're still convinced that brick and mortar plays a role. That it is an expensive item that people are purchasing, and they want the flexibility to change their buying. But you get to get them there at a cost-effective way and have a cost-effective experience that moves at speedy pace. So we think we have all that fall through and there's no question in our mind that we will be able to compete. And by the way, the one price across the entire enterprise as we are now doing means that your centralized pricing, your centralized purchasing, and you have an auction system to support it all. All of that is either done or underway. So all those risks and costs have been born, have been taken. And now we have the bulldozers moving on the sites and that gives us a high degree of confidence that it will present the consumer with a compelling value equation with a brand that they trust, and we've been able to attract to the store and deliver to them in a very cost-effective way."

So most manufacturers did not go down that road, most manufacturers are given credit for running the business in a very disciplined way successfully with an eye on the future and I see nothing too alarming. Those who embrace stair steps, whatever you want to call them. In the short term, yes, you get a pull forward in sales, but over an extended period and certainly, by the third quarter, it's an extended period, you clearly, it's indisputable that these multi-tier pricing systems are so unpopular with the vast majority of customers and retailers that your business begins to decline. So if I bifurcate the world into disciplined and undisciplined or rational and irrational and look at the numbers basically retail or the discipline rational group is flat, and it's down 6% for the stair steppers. And if I look at retail values for the stair steppers, it's eroding significantly, meaning it's unsustainable. Now I salute a company like Ford Motor Company that endeavored with their steps, they stepped away and have taken a much longer disciplined view, they're to be congratulated. The one practitioner who is still absolutely convinced that stair steps is the way to go is Nissan, and it's obviously very contentious situation at the moment and the end of that story, I don't know. But I do know it's a very disruptive to the Nissan business, and we'll have to see what happens there. But I think in principle, I think this is the big message. In principle, the whole industry has watched this story unfold in 2016. And once you see the resale values, gap remain as large it is, it's not growth. 700 basis points difference, you cannot make the case that stair steps work and what they see as they start dumping more into place to try to cover up the fact that it's not working at retail. My view is unsustainable, but there's movement away from them by certain manufacturers. I don't expect others to get in in a significant way but how it plays out with Nissan, I don't know."

There is certainly some cost at the moment into next year with all the training, development, systems to extend into the stores, both the franchise, changing the franchise business and existing stores as Cheryl already said, there will be some impact on SG&A, whether she wants to add something else.

And I am pleased to share the next phase of our customer-focused comprehensive brand extension strategy.
In 2013, we launched the AutoNation retail brand, a pivotal moment in the company's history which set the stage for AutoNation Express, AutoNation Customer Financial Service products and now, AutoNation USA standalone preowned vehicle sales and service centers. AutoNation USA is the next step in establishing AutoNation as the most recognized brand in auto retail.
We have identified 25 AutoNation USA sites in our existing markets of which 5 are planned to be opened in 2017.
Several building blocks for AutoNation USA have already been put in place in our existing franchise stores with tremendous success. One Price, our negotiation-free preowned vehicle pricing strategy, AutoNation Precision Parts and AutoNation Auto Gear, branded parts and accessory lines, were each launched in the third quarter.
One Price allows consumers to shop over 20,000 preowned vehicles on our website with transparent, hassle-free and fair pricing. Consumer and associate feedback has been phenomenal. Consumers have said the buying experience was very easy, simple, no hassle, just fair pricing. Employees have said it enhances the overall customer experience.
As part of the continued brand extension strategy, we're expanding our AutoNation Auto Auctions, AutoNation collision centers from coast-to-coast. Our plan is to open 4 additional auctions over the next 2 years. We also plan to acquire an additional 18 collision centers over the same period.
We expect that these investments in the next phase of the company's brand extension rollout will exceed $500 million in the aggregate over the next several years. The next phase in the company's history represents attractive opportunities that we expect will generate significant long-term shareholder value.
Turning to our third quarter results. Today, we reported EPS from continuing operations of $1.05, which matched our third quarter record achieved last year.
Revenue for the quarter totaled $5.6 billion compared to $5.4 billion in the same period a year ago, an increase of 4%. AutoNation's total retail new vehicle unit sales for the quarter were down 1% and our same-store sale basis, down 6%.
Today, we also announced the acquisition of 3 Premium Luxury franchises and the award of 3 Premium Luxury franchise add-points, which include our first BMW franchise in South Florida and our first Jaguar-Land Rover franchises in Texas. We also acquired our 70th collision center in Westmont, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago.
The combined anticipated annual revenue from these acquisition and add-points is $430 million once the add-points are fully operational.

Ef",578,"Thank you, Mike, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
For the third quarter, we reported net income from continuing operations of $108 million or $1.05 per share versus net income of $119 million or $1.05 per share during the third quarter of 2015. Effective as of the third quarter of 2015, AutoNation will only report its financial results in accordance with GAAP in its earnings releases and SEC reports and will not include non-GAAP core adjusted measures.
In the second quarter, revenue increased $214 million or 4% compared to the prior year and gross profit improved $6 million or 1%. SG&A as a percentage of gross profit was 70.7% for the quarter, which represents a 220 basis point increase compared to the year ago period. The increase was driven by gross profit pressure from certain manufacturers' disruptive marketing and sales incentive in the new vehicle marketplace. We believe that the continued pressure on gross profit from these incentives as well as expenses related to the brand extensions announced today may increase our SG&A as a percentage of gross profit by 100 basis points sequentially in the fourth quarter.
The provision for income tax in the quarter was $67 million or 38.3%. Net new vehicle floorplan was a benefit of $14.9 million, a decrease of $2.2 million from the third quarter of 2015. The decrease was primarily due to increased floorplan balances and higher interest rates, partially offset by higher floorplan assistance per unit.
Floorplan debt decreased sequentially, approximately $263 million during the third quarter to $3.5 billion at quarter end, primarily due to lower new inventory balances, partially offset by increased borrowings on our used vehicle floorplan facilities.
Non-vehicle interest expense increased to $28.9 million compared to $21.4 million in the third quarter of 2015. A $7.5 million increase in interest expense was driven by higher average debt balances, resulting primarily from share repurchase and acquisitions.
At the end of September, we had $2.8 billion of non-vehicle debt, an increase of $50 million compared to June 30, 2016. Non-vehicle debt includes $975 billion of outstanding commercial paper borrowings.
At the end of September, we had no amounts drawn under our revolving credit facility. As a consequence, our non-vehicle debt fixed to floating mix was approximately 65% fixed and 35% floating.
During the third quarter, we repurchased 1 million shares for $50 million at an average price of $48.62 per share. AutoNation has approximately $316 million of remaining board authorization per share repurchase.
As of October 26, there were approximately 101 million shares outstanding. This does not include the dilutive impact of stock option.
Our leverage ratio increased slightly to 2.8x at the end of Q3 as compared to 2.7x at the end of Q2. The leverage ratio was 2.7x on a net debt basis, including used floorplan availability, and our covenant limit is 3.75x.
Capital expenditures were $69 million for the quarter. Capital expenditures, again, are on an accrual basis, excluding operating lease buyouts and related asset sales. Our quarter end cash balance was $62 million which, combined with our additional borrowing capacity, resulted in total liquidity of $843 million at the end of September.
We're very excited about the brand extension opportunities announced today and their ability to diversify our business and once fully ramped, improve our profitability. We will continue to focus on driving shareholder value through strategic investments and opportunistic capital allocation.

Today, we are excited to announce and share our comprehensive brand extension strategy. I will start with AutoNation USA, our standalone preowned vehicle sales and service centers. Our plan is to open 5 AutoNation USA stores in 2017. We have also identified 20 additional sites over the next several years within our existing markets. Customers will have the opportunity to purchase on AutoNation-certified vehicle and service that vehicle at any AutoNation USA store. AutoNation USA will utilize AutoNation Express, the company's digital platform, which allows customers to dramatically reduce their transaction time by offering a seamless end-to-end experience where they can search online for inventory, select and reserve a vehicle, value their trade, prepayment options and apply for financing.
One Price, our negotiation-free, preowned vehicle pricing strategy, which we've already begun to roll out in our current franchise location, will also be the pricing strategy at our AutoNation USA stores. One Price allows us to leverage our centralized capabilities such as centralized pricing and appraisals. Initial customer and associate feedback has been exceptionally positive. One Price offers customers a transparent and stress-free buying experience and will be fully implemented in our existing locations by the end of the second quarter of 2017.
AutoNation USA will implement our new sales associate non-commission-based pay plan as well. The new pay plan has 4 simple metrics that give us a strategic advantage in recruiting associates. Our new pay plan offers salaries and paid training. It's competitive, it's a plan that is based on rewarding behaviors that drive productivity while delivering a peerless customer experience.
AutoNation USA stores service now centers will utilize AutoNation Precision Parts, an AutoNation branded line of high-quality, competitively priced maintenance and repair parts for the vehicle reconditioning and customer repairs.
We launched AutoNation Precision Parts in the third quarter with AutoNation branded batteries, which feature an industry-leading free lifetime replacement guarantee. Service now will also allow us to engage and recapture customers who are post the warranty and are no longer servicing at the franchise stores. We now offer our consumers a compelling value and options as well as drive service retention.
Also in the third quarter, we launched our automotive accessory line, AutoNation Auto Gear, featuring our partnership with WeatherTech, a leader in aftermarket auto accessories. We will continue to expand our precision parts and AutoNation Auto Gear product line in phases as our product portfolios are developed.
In addition, we're expanding our very successful AutoNation Auto Auctions from coast-to-coast. We have a successful wholesale auction in Southern California, processing over 25,000 vehicles annually, and we plan to leverage our brand and expertise in additional markets by wholesaling our own vehicles and offering third party buyers and sellers access to high-quality inventory. We plan to open 4 additional AutoNation-branded auctions over the next 2 years starting in Orlando, Florida and Houston, Texas in Q1 2017.
Lastly, our brand extension strategy will also include expanding our AutoNation collision center footprint. AutoNation currently owns and operates 70 collision and repair centers, including the newly acquired Westmont Body Werks in Westmont, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago.
AutoNation has the largest collision center network among automotive retailers with expertise in certifications with multiple manufacturers and is a preferred repair provider for many of the major insurance carriers. New locations are planned for key markets where AutoNation has store density but does not have existing collision presence or has capacity limitations.
Over the next 2 years, we plan to open or acquire at least 18 new AutoNation-branded collision centers across the country. The steps we have taken with the launch of our customer-focused comprehensive brand extension strategy and diversified business model will position us to capitalize on our industry's leading retail brand.
Now turning to our third quarter results. My comments today will be on a same-store basis as compared to the prior year unless noted otherwise.
Gross profit for variable operations was $435 million, down 8%. Variable gross was $3,320 on a per vehicle retail basis, which was relatively flat compared to the same period last year.
New and used same-store unit volume was down 6% compared to the third quarter last year. Certain manufacturers continued their disruptive marketing and sales incentives, which resulted in multi-tier pricing despite new vehicle sales being down again in the third quarter. Manufacturers must find a rational and disciplined approach that does not erode their future brand value.
New vehicle revenue for the quarter was $3 billion, a decrease of $87 million or 3%. We've retailed 81,600 units, a decrease of 6%.
New vehicle gross profit was $1,805 on a per vehicle retail basis, down 7%.
As of September 30, approximately 14% or 5,400 units of our total used vehicle inventory was on hold due to the Takata airbag recall. The Takata airbag recall negatively impacted our net income from continuing operations by $6 million after tax or $0.06 per share. We started to receive limited Takata airbag replacement parts for Honda and BMW only.
Used vehicle retail revenue was $1 billion, a decrease of $25 million or 2%. Used vehicles retailed were 51,500, down 7%. Used vehicle gross profit was $1,543 on a per vehicle retail basis, an increase of 2%.
Customer financial services total gross profit was $215 million, customer financial services gross profit on a per vehicle retail basis was $1,617, an increase of $60 or 4%.
We set an all-time record in customer care gross profit of $338 million, an increase of $6 million or 2%.
Also in the quarter, customer care revenue was $782 million, an increase of $22 million or 3%. Customer paid gross was $138 million, up 4% year-over-year, warranty gross was $71 million, up 9%. Collision gross was $29 million, up 1% year-over-year. 
Finally, I'd like to welcome our new San Diego, California and Westmont, Illinois associate to AutoNation and would like to thank AutoNation's 25,000-plus associates for their hard work and dedication. This is truly an exciting time to be part of the AutoNation team as we launch AutoNation USA and implement our customer-focused comprehensive brand extension strategy, which will create new revenue and profit streams for the company.
I now turn the call over to Jon Ferrando, Executive Vice President responsible for M&A."

We are pleased to announce the addition of 6 Premium Luxury franchises and a collision center with combined anticipated annual revenues of $430 million. Three of the Premium Luxury franchises are add-points awarded to us by the manufacturers, and the other 3 Premium Luxury franchises and the collision center are acquisitions.
Starting with the acquisitions. In October, we completed the acquisition of BMW of Vista, our second BMW store in the Northern San Diego market and our 15th BMW store nationwide. As part of our AutoNation brand extension strategy, we also completed the acquisition of Westmont Body Werks in our Chicago market, our 70th collision center.
In the fourth quarter, we expect to close on the acquisition of Jaguar-Land Rover Bethesda, our 10th store in the Baltimore-D.C. market and our eighth Jaguar-Land Rover store nationwide. The store has the largest Jaguar-Land Rover showroom in the United States, and it fits well with the strong Premium Luxury demographics in that part of the Baltimore-Washington, D.C. corridor.
We also announced the award of BMW of Delray Beach and Jaguar-Land Rover West Houston add-points. BMW of Delray Beach is our first BMW franchise in South Florida and our 25th Premium Luxury franchise in Florida. Jaguar and Land Rover West Houston is our 10th Premium Luxury store in Texas. The add-points will be large Premium Luxury stores located in excellent auto retail locations with very attractive luxury and growth demographics. Both these add-points are expected to open in 2018.
In 2016, we have completed or announced the acquisition or award of 49 franchises, which are expected to generate approximately $1.5 billion in annual revenue once fully operational. As of today, we represent 35 manufacturer brands, and our store portfolio numbers 372 franchises and 262 auto retail stores, along with 70 collision centers in 16 states.
Looking forward, we will continue to actively pursue acquisitions and new store opportunities, with a focus on enhancing brand representation within our existing markets and markets that can be supported by our existing management infrastructure. We will continue to be selective and prudent with our capital, with a focus on investing to produce strong returns and long-term shareholder value.
I will now turn it back to Mike Jackson."

This year and through the third quarter, certain manufacturers continued disruptive marketing and sales incentives which resulted in multitier pricing that were unfair for consumers as well as retailers. In the third quarter, these marketing programs had a significant negative impact on new vehicle volume and gross profit per vehicle retailed. These disruptive incentive programs are damaging to the OEM brand and in my view, unsustainable. Retail sales volume for manufacturers who use these toxic marketing programs are significantly below market with, let's say, the market [indiscernible] retail flat for the year and the irrational players being down 6%. And I also observed that they're eroding the 3-year residual value of their brand, whereas the rational marketers have a 3-year resale value of 50%, the irrational marketers are at 43%. This is undermining the resale value of their existing customers and therefore, their brand. These certain manufacturers must find a rational and disciplined approach that does not erode their future brand value.
Having said that, this is an exciting time for AutoNation with the launch of AutoNation USA and our comprehensive brand extension strategy. We have built an outstanding industry-leading brand, and we remain committed to achieving and sustaining operational excellence while continuing to create a peerless customer experience.
With that, we're delighted to take your questions."

Well, our view, if I look at the automotive retail marketplace, for retail new, it's less than $15 million. For retail preowned, it's approaching $40 million. So we also have to take into consideration that the new vehicle market is definitely cyclical with 1 or 3 phases, growth, plateau and decline. Now you could be in plateau quite some time, but it brings -- plateau brings a whole -- another set of issues. So if I go back 5 years ago, anticipating that plateau would eventually arise, I said I need a strategy that we can take much more of our destiny in our own hands and continue to grow the business. Now to be able to do that successfully, I felt we needed 2 foundational elements: One was a brand that was well-known in the marketplace already; and a digital capability that we knew could deliver sales. So we've done both of those steps successfully. With the AutoNation brand and with our AutoNation Express launch, it now delivers almost 30% of our sales from those sites. So having taken that step as preconditions in order to give us the confidence that these stores would turn profitable quickly, we knew we needed a value equation for the consumer and an outstanding experience. We know the customer craves fairness and transparency and price, and that means they need to be one-priced. So then we said, well, the brand has to be in alignment between our existing franchise business and this extensive business. Therefore, we have to one-price our existing preowned business. So that started already this year as a conditional element and has gone extremely well, and we will have all AutoNation franchise preowned one-priced sometime at the beginning of next year, but certainly, by the time the first AutoNation USA stores open. Next these AutoNation USA stores have a customer care component. We wanted a value story there. Again, to your point, we do very well taking care of cars that are new to 5, 6, 7 years old, and then there's a big drop-off. So we want to attract that market, but we need a value equation. So we went -- we're a significant purchaser of cars already today, so we went to major suppliers and negotiated exactly what the consumer would want and are launching AutoNation-branded parts and accessories. We're highly confident of the degree of trust from the consumer because of the AutoNation financial products that we had already launched. Again, we went to the major suppliers, say we have a profound understanding what the consumer wants. Here's the value equation we have to meet. But now the customer has to trust the product, and so it has to be branded to AutoNation. And we see already that the adoption rate in all the AutoNation-branded stores is approaching 95% of the AutoNation customer care products. All of that means that the significant cost of launching a brand has been done. The significant investment in launching AutoNation Express is done. Opening the door to make brand extensions and realizing opportunities that you have created by what has come before. Now referring back to the old megastores, I was here for that, and there was many customer-friendly elements that I liked. There was cradle-to-grave elements that didn't make sense like the whole linkage between the rental car business and the megastores. The megastores, having said that they had many customer elements that were to be admired, were conceptually, completely the wrong size and scale with no ability to fix it. And most importantly, they're -- a brand didn't exist, and there was no alignment between the franchise business and what would be this freestanding business. So conflict was inherent. So all of those issues are resolved today, and we now move into this, say, brand extension step with many more elements, alignment with the existing business and in a very strong position with the goal of having much more control of our destiny, and what I perceive, we ultimately having them is the largest Premium Luxury business at retail in America approaching with what Jon Ferrando just announced, 100 franchises in the Premium Luxury business coast-to-coast, a volume franchise business branded under the name AutoNation and now, a freestanding AutoNation USA business that we can see as a -- what we see as a significant opportunity to grow in the much larger preowned business but doing it from a position of strength."

And we know these vehicles very well, who owns them, where they are, why they drop off. And we absolutely intend to attract them. So as far as the pay off, here's the way I think about it. So if you look at our performance in financial products, it's already exceptional, and a big part of that growth and why it's sustainable is because of the AutoNation financial products. So it's -- the pay off was immediate for having built the brand. So what are the extensions that have immediate benefit to the company? Parts. Because these parts, these AutoNation parts are going to be available in our franchise stores as well as the AutoNation USA stores. The benefit is immediate. We have significant batteries, wiper blades, filters already in there, and we are in negotiation with supplier for hundreds of more parts that will be available, both in our franchise business and in the AutoNation USA store. The benefit of that is immediate, both for the customer and for AutoNation. Of course, we will continue to offer OEM parts, and of course, we will use them for all warranty work or all customer care work that the manufacturer pays for. But beyond that, we will offer our customers choices, and we think there'll be a high adoption rate just like we saw in the service contract, and, oh, by the way, we will then be able to have this supply of parts on a match -- by our cost basis for our reconditioning in our USA stores and in the customer care aspect of our USA stores. So there's an immediate benefit for that. The same thing with accessories. And by the way, the returns are moved to profitability from our auction site and on collision centers is very quick. Now the USA stores, there's a ramp in it. I think we'll be in the second year to see profitability from these stores or break into profitability, but I have a high degree of confidence that we will have significant market awareness and ability to generate sales because of our AutoNation Express capability. So that gives me a great deal of confident to say, yes, the second year, these stores are going to break into profitability. Now for the last few quarters and early into next year, is there a surge of spending in investment in all the training, building up the facility teams and everything else that has to go on to launch something? Yes, we'll take that in stride. It's nothing like launching a brand or launching AutoNation Express, but it's in there. And then that will move behind us. And then as the stores, the AutoNation USA stores start moving into profitability, we'll continue to build out as we've identified another 20 sites in development. So we're not starting from a standstill here is my point, and the return that we're receiving for certain initiatives is already a payback for some cost or past cost that we've already put into the brand in AutoNation Express. That's the way I think about it. Now we're really going to be reaping the opportunity of what we paid for in '13, '14 and '15. Now everyone sees why we took the risk and spent the money to create a band and create a digital capability. Now in the very near term, by that I mean right this minute, and into 2017, will I have some more cost to get these things up and going? Yes, I will, but that will be mitigated by the other initiatives, and once you get past that first tranche of stores, off we go."

And then there are new entrants focused completely on online transaction and taking massive SG&A cost out of the selling process.

We will absolutely take AutoNation Express, extend it into the store as an operating system, as the enterprise operating system. However, we're still convinced that brick and mortar plays a role. That it is as an expensive item that people are purchasing, and they want the flexibility to change their mind. But you got to get them there in a cost-effective way and have a cost-effective experience that moves at a speedy pace. So we think we have all that thought through, and there's no question in our mind that we will be able to compete. And by the way, the one price across the entire enterprise as we are now doing means that your centralized pricing and your centralized purchasing, and you have an auction system to support it all. All of that is either done or underway. So all those risks and costs have been born -- have been taken. And now we have the bulldozers moving on the sites, and that gives us a high degree of confidence that it will present the consumer with a compelling value equation with a brand that they trust, that we've been able to attract to the store and deliver to them in a very cost-effective way."

The response from the field has been overwhelmingly positive, both from our associates, management and even most importantly, from our customers. To Mike's point, we have seen no degradation in our volume or in our PVRs, and in a lot of cases, we're actually seeing a little bit more productivity out of our sales people because they're not having to kind of do the back and forth on the used vehicles, and the transaction times have come down significantly."

So most manuf",389,"So I go back to my Automotive News World Congress speech at the beginning of the year, and I said those manufacturers who pursue stair-steps that result in multitier-type pricing, it will be a disaster and very disruptive in the marketplace. So most manufacturers did not go down that road. Most manufacturers, I give them credit, are running the business in a very disciplined way successfully, with an eye on the future, and I see nothing too alarming. Those who embraced stair-steps, whatever you want to call them, in the short term, yes, you get a pull forward in sales, but over an extended period and certainly, by the third quarter, it's an extended period, you clearly, it's indisputable that these multitier-pricing systems are so unpopular with the vast majority of customers and retailers that your business begins to decline. So if I bifurcate the world into disciplined and undisciplined or rational and irrational and look at the numbers, basically retail or the disciplined rational group is flat, and it's down 6% for the stair-steppers. And if I look at retail values for the stair-steppers, it's eroding significantly, meaning it's unsustainable. Now I salute a company like Ford Motor Company that endeavored with their steps, they stepped away and have taken a much longer disciplined view, they're to be congratulated. The one practitioner who is still absolutely convinced that stair-steps is the way to go is Nissan, and it's obviously a very contentious situation at the moment, and the end of that story, I don't know. But I do know it's very disruptive to the Nissan business, and we'll have to see what happens there. But I think in principle, I think this is the big message. In principle, the whole industry has watched this story unfold in 2016. And once you see the resale values, gap remain as large it is, it's not growth, 700 basis points difference. You cannot make the case that stair-steps work, and then what you see is they start dumping more into fleets to try to cover up the fact that it's not working at retail. My view is unsustainable, but there's -- and there's movement away from them by certain manufacturers. I don't expect others to get in, in a significant way, but how it plays out with Nissan, I don't know."

I think that I've said this before, I said it at the beginning of the year, I think the demand for trucks is over 60% of the market, and the only restriction has been its called productive capacity. So I think all the manufacturers agree with that and have been adapting their production as much as possible to be more in alignment with the marketplace. And that is certainly good for the industry overall to have -- first, it's more profitable for the manufacturers on the truck side than on the car side, and they have a better alignment what -- between what people want to buy and what you're producing. It is always better. But I think it's basically a plateaued environment, and when I say plateaued, that's a couple points up, a few points down or flat, something in a narrow corridor. It is most likely what we're looking at. Hopefully, with -- no, I'm wanting to say, I'm confident there'll be fewer practitioners of extreme stair-steps in 2017, and most importantly, I hope there's a much better availability for Takata air bags."

The parts expansion margin opportunities will be very quick over the next several quarters. You're going to see some pressure on SG&A. But as we continue to run the other cost type, we talked about a sequential 100 basis points blip in SG&A as a percentage of gross profit.

The potential for $500 million is based over a number of years, and we'll continue to pace that out as we identify place and as we look at our base CapEx plan. So I think the big message is we have $850 million of liquidity today, great access to the capital markets for future, and we feel extremely well-positioned, really supported by the fact that the base model kicks off a lot of cash, and keep in mind that with AutoUSA, we have a service component in there as well, which is very cash generating."

Today I'm pleased to share the next phase of our customer-focused comprehensive brand extension strategy.
In 2013, we launched the AutoNation retail brand, a pivotal moment in the company's history, which set the stage for AutoNation Express, AutoNation Customer Financial Service products and now, AutoNation USA standalone preowned vehicle sales and service centers. AutoNation USA is the next step in establishing AutoNation as the most recognized brand in auto retail.
We have identified 25 AutoNation USA sites in our existing markets of which 5 are planned to be opened in 2017.
Several building blocks for AutoNation USA have already been put in place in our existing franchise stores with tremendous success. One Price, our negotiation-free preowned vehicle pricing strategy, AutoNation Precision Parts and AutoNation Auto Gear, branded parts and accessory lines, were each launched in the third quarter.
One Price allows consumers to shop over 20,000 preowned vehicles on our website with transparent, hassle-free and fair pricing. Consumer and associate feedback has been phenomenal. Consumers have said the buying experience was very easy, simple, no hassle, just fair pricing. Employees have said it enhances the overall customer experience.
As part of the continued brand extension strategy, we're expanding our AutoNation Auto Auctions, AutoNation collision centers from coast-to-coast. Our plan is to open 4 additional auctions over the next 2 years. We also plan to acquire an additional 18 collision centers over the same period.
We expect that these investments in the next phase of the company's brand extension rollout will exceed $500 million in the aggregate over the next several years. The next phase in the company's history represents attractive opportunities that we expect will generate significant long-term shareholder value.
Turning to our third quarter results. Today, we reported EPS from continuing operations of $1.05, which matched our third quarter record achieved last year.
Revenue for the quarter totaled $5.6 billion compared to $5.4 billion in the same period a year ago, an increase of 4%. AutoNation's total retail new vehicle unit sales for the quarter were down 1% and on a same-store sale basis, down 6%.
Today, we also announced the acquisition of 3 Premium Luxury franchises and the award of 3 Premium Luxury franchise add-points, which include our first BMW franchise in South Florida and our first Jaguar-Land Rover franchises in Texas. We also acquired our 70th collision center in Westmont, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago.
The combined anticipated annual revenue from these acquisition and add-points is $430 million once the add-points are fully operational.
I now turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Cheryl Miller."

Ef",578,"Thank you, Mike, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen.
For the third quarter, we reported net income from continuing operations of $108 million or $1.05 per share versus net income of $119 million or $1.05 per share during the third quarter of 2015. Effective as of the third quarter of 2016, AutoNation will only report its financial results in accordance with GAAP in its earnings releases and SEC reports and will not include non-GAAP or adjusted measures.
In the second quarter, revenue increased $214 million or 4% compared to the prior year and gross profit improved $6 million or 1%. SG&A as a percentage of gross profit was 70.7% for the quarter, which represents a 220 basis point increase compared to the year ago period. The increase was driven by gross profit pressure from certain manufacturers' disruptive marketing and sales incentives in the new vehicle marketplace. We believe that the continued pressure on gross profit from these incentives as well as expenses related to the brand extensions announced today may increase our SG&A as a percentage of gross profit by 100 basis points sequentially in the fourth quarter.
The provision for income tax in the quarter was $67 million or 38.3%. Net new vehicle floorplan was a benefit of $14.9 million, a decrease of $2.2 million from the third quarter of 2015. The decrease was primarily due to increased floorplan balances and higher interest rates, partially offset by higher floorplan assistance per unit.
Floorplan debt decreased sequentially, approximately $263 million during the third quarter to $3.5 billion at quarter end, primarily due to lower new inventory balances, partially offset by increased borrowings on our used vehicle floorplan facilities.
Non-vehicle interest expense increased to $28.9 million compared to $21.4 million in the third quarter of 2015. A $7.5 million increase in interest expense was driven by higher average debt balances, resulting primarily from share repurchase and acquisitions.
At the end of September, we had $2.8 billion of non-vehicle debt, an increase of $50 million compared to June 30, 2016. Non-vehicle debt includes $975 billion of outstanding commercial paper borrowings.
At the end of September, we had no amounts drawn under our revolving credit facility. As a consequence, our non-vehicle debt fixed to floating mix was approximately 65% fixed and 35% floating.
During the third quarter, we repurchased 1 million shares for $50 million at an average price of $48.62 per share. AutoNation has approximately $316 million of remaining board authorization per share repurchase.
As of October 26, there were approximately 101 million shares outstanding. This does not include the dilutive impact of stock options.
Our leverage ratio increased slightly to 2.8x at the end of Q3 as compared to 2.7x at the end of Q2. The leverage ratio was 2.7x on a net debt basis, including used floorplan availability, and our covenant limit is 3.75x.
Capital expenditures were $69 million for the quarter. Capital expenditures, again, are on an accrual basis, excluding operating lease buyouts and related asset sales. Our quarter end cash balance was $62 million which, combined with our additional borrowing capacity, resulted in total liquidity of $843 million at the end of September.
We're very excited about the brand extension opportunities announced today and their ability to diversify our business and once fully ramped, improve our profitability. We will continue to focus on driving shareholder value through strategic investments and opportunistic capital allocation.

Today, we are excited to announce and share our comprehensive brand extension strategy. I will start with AutoNation USA, our standalone preowned vehicle sales and service centers. Our plan is to open 5 AutoNation USA stores in 2017. We have also identified 20 additional sites over the next several years within our existing markets. Customers will have the opportunity to purchase an AutoNation-certified vehicle and service that vehicle at any AutoNation USA store. AutoNation USA will utilize AutoNation Express, the company's digital platform, which allows customers to dramatically reduce their transaction time by offering a seamless end-to-end experience where they can search online for inventory, select and reserve a vehicle, value their trade, see payment options and apply for financing.
One Price, our negotiation-free, preowned vehicle pricing strategy, which we've already begun to roll out in our current franchise locations, will also be the pricing strategy at our AutoNation USA stores. One Price allows us to leverage our centralized capabilities such as centralized pricing and appraisals. Initial customer and associate feedback has been exceptionally positive. One Price offers customers a transparent and stress-free buying experience and will be fully implemented in our existing locations by the end of the second quarter of 2017.
AutoNation USA will implement our new sales associate non-commission-based pay plan as well. The new pay plan has 4 simple metrics that give us a strategic advantage in recruiting associates. Our new pay plan offers salaries and paid training. It's competitive, and it's a plan that is based on rewarding behaviors that drive productivity while delivering a peerless customer experience.
AutoNation USA stores service now centers will utilize AutoNation Precision Parts, an AutoNation branded line of high-quality, competitively priced maintenance and repair parts for the vehicle reconditioning and customer repairs.
We launched AutoNation Precision Parts in the third quarter with AutoNation branded batteries, which feature an industry-leading free lifetime replacement guarantee. Service now will also allow us to engage and recapture customers who are post warranty and are no longer servicing at the franchise stores. We now offer consumers a compelling value and options as well as drive service retention.
Also in the third quarter, we launched our automotive accessory line, AutoNation Auto Gear, featuring our partnership with WeatherTech, a leader in aftermarket auto accessories. We will continue to expand our precision parts and AutoNation Auto Gear product lines in phases as their product portfolios are developed.
In addition, we're expanding our very successful AutoNation Auto Auction from coast-to-coast. We have a successful wholesale auction in Southern California, processing over 25,000 vehicles annually, and we plan to leverage our brand and expertise in additional markets by wholesaling our own vehicles and offering third party buyers and sellers access to high-quality inventory. We plan to open 4 additional AutoNation-branded auctions over the next 2 years starting in Orlando, Florida and Houston, Texas in Q1 2017.
Lastly, our brand extension strategy will also include expanding our AutoNation collision center footprint. AutoNation currently owns and operates 70 collision and repair centers, including the newly acquired Westmont Body Werks in Westmont, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago.
AutoNation has the largest collision center network among automotive retailers with expertise and certifications with multiple manufacturers and is a preferred repair provider for many of the major insurance carriers. New locations are planned for key markets where AutoNation has store density but does not have existing collision presence or has capacity limitations.
Over the next 2 years, we plan to open or acquire at least 18 new AutoNation-branded collision centers across the country. The steps we have taken with the launch of our customer-focused comprehensive brand extension strategy and diversified business model will position us to capitalize on our industry's leading retail brand.
Now turning to our third quarter results. My comments today will be on a same-store basis as compared to the prior year unless noted otherwise.
Gross profit for variable operations was $435 million, down 8%. Variable gross was $3,320 on a per vehicle retail basis, which was relatively flat compared to the same period last year.
New and used same-store unit volume was down 6% compared to the third quarter last year. Certain manufacturers continued their disruptive marketing and sales incentives, which resulted in multi-tier pricing despite new vehicle sales being down again in the third quarter. Manufacturers must find a rational and disciplined approach that does not erode their future brand value.
New vehicle revenue for the quarter was $3 billion, a decrease of $87 million or 3%. We've retailed 81,600 units, a decrease of 6%.
New vehicle gross profit was $1,805 on a per vehicle retail basis, down 7%.
As of September 30, approximately 14% or 5,400 units of our total used vehicle inventory was on hold due to the Takata airbag recall. The Takata airbag recall negatively impacted our net income from continuing operations by $6 million after tax or $0.06 per share. We've started to receive limited Takata airbag replacement parts for Honda and BMW only.
Used vehicle retail revenue was $1 billion, a decrease of $25 million or 2%. Used vehicles retailed were 51,500, down 7%. Used vehicle gross profit was $1,543 on a per vehicle retail basis, an increase of 2%.
Customer financial services total gross profit was $215 million. Customer financial services gross profit on a per vehicle retail basis was $1,617, an increase of $60 or 4%.
We set an all-time record in customer care gross profit of $338 million, an increase of $6 million or 2%.
Also in the quarter, customer care revenue was $782 million, an increase of $22 million or 3%. Customer paid gross was $138 million, up 4% year-over-year, warranty gross was $71 million, up 9%. Collision gross was $29 million, up 1% year-over-year. 
Finally, I'd like to welcome our new San Diego, California and Westmont, Illinois associates to AutoNation and would like to thank AutoNation's 25,000-plus associates for their hard work and dedication. This is truly an exciting time to be part of the AutoNation team as we launch AutoNation USA and implement our customer-focused comprehensive brand extension strategy, which will create new revenue and profit streams for the company.

We are pleased to announce the addition of 6 Premium Luxury franchises and a collision center with combined anticipated annual revenues of $430 million. Three of the Premium Luxury franchises are add-points awarded to us by the manufacturers, and the other 3 Premium Luxury franchises and the collision center are acquisitions.
Starting with the acquisitions. In October, we completed the acquisition of BMW of Vista, our second BMW store in the Northern San Diego market and our 15th BMW store nationwide. As part of our AutoNation brand extension strategy, we also completed the acquisition of Westmont Body Werks in our Chicago market, our 70th collision center.
In the fourth quarter, we expect to close on the acquisition of Jaguar-Land Rover Bethesda, our 10th store in the Baltimore-D.C. market and our eighth Jaguar-Land Rover store nationwide. The store has the largest Jaguar-Land Rover showroom in the United States and fits well with the strong Premium Luxury demographics in that part of the Baltimore-Washington, D.C. corridor.
We also announced the award of BMW of Delray Beach and Jaguar-Land Rover West Houston add-points. BMW of Delray Beach is our first BMW franchise in South Florida and our 25th Premium Luxury franchise in Florida. Jaguar-Land Rover West Houston is our 10th Premium Luxury store in Texas. The add-points will be large Premium Luxury stores located in excellent auto retail locations with very attractive luxury and growth demographics. Both of these add-points are expected to open in 2018.
In 2016, we have completed or announced the acquisition or award of 49 franchises, which are expected to generate approximately $1.5 billion in annual revenue once fully operational. As of today, we represent 35 manufacturer brands, and our store portfolio numbers 372 franchises and 262 auto retail stores, along with 70 collision centers in 16 states.
Looking forward, we will continue to actively pursue acquisitions and new store opportunities, with a focus on enhancing brand representation within our existing markets and markets that can be supported by our existing management infrastructure. We will continue to be selective and prudent with our capital, with a focus on investing to produce strong returns and long-term shareholder value.
I will now turn it back to Mike Jackson."

This year and through the third quarter, certain manufacturers continued disruptive marketing and sales incentives, which resulted in multitier pricing that were unfair for consumers as well as retailers. In the third quarter, these marketing programs had a significant negative impact on new vehicle volume and gross profit per vehicle retailed. These disruptive incentive programs are damaging to the OEM brand and in my view, unsustainable. Retail sales volume for manufacturers who use these toxic marketing programs are significantly below market with, let's say, the market basically at retail, flat for the year and the irrational players being down 6%. And I also observed that they're eroding the 3-year residual value of their brand, whereas the rational marketers have a 3-year resale value of 50%, the irrational marketers are at 43%. This is undermining the resale value of their existing customers and therefore, their brand. These certain manufacturers must find a rational and disciplined approach that does not erode their future brand value.
Having said that, this is an exciting time for AutoNation with the launch of AutoNation USA and our comprehensive brand extension strategy. We have built an outstanding industry-leading brand, and we remain committed to achieving and sustaining operational excellence while continuing to create a peerless customer experience.
With that, we're delighted to take your questions."

Well, our view, if I look at the automotive retail marketplace, for retail new, it's less than $15 million. For retail preowned, it's approaching $40 million. So you also have to take into consideration that the new vehicle market is definitely cyclical with 1 of 3 phases, growth, plateau and decline. Now you could be in plateau quite some time, but it brings -- plateau brings a whole -- another set of issues. So if I go back 5 years ago, anticipating that plateau would eventually arise, I said I need a strategy that we can take much more of our destiny in our own hands and continue to grow the business. Now to be able to do that successfully, I felt we needed 2 foundational elements: one was a brand that was well-known in the marketplace already; and a digital capability that we knew could deliver sales. So we've done both of those steps successfully with the AutoNation brand. And with our AutoNation Express launch, it now delivers almost 30% of our sales from those sites. So having taken that step as preconditions in order to give us the confidence that these stores would turn profitable quickly, we knew we needed a value equation for the consumer and an outstanding experience. We know the customer craves fairness and transparency and price, and that means they need to be one-priced. So then we said, well, the brand has to be in alignment between our existing franchise business and this extensive business. Therefore, we have to one-price our existing preowned business. So that started already this year as a conditional element and has gone extremely well. And we will have all AutoNation franchise preowned one-priced sometime at the beginning of next year, but certainly, by the time the first AutoNation USA stores open. Next these AutoNation USA stores have a customer care component. We wanted a value story there. Again, to your point, we do very well taking care of cars that are new to 5, 6, 7 years old, and then there's a big drop-off. So we want to attract that market, but we need a value equation. So we went -- we're a significant purchaser of parts already today, so we went to major suppliers and negotiated exactly what the consumer would want and are launching AutoNation-branded parts and accessories. We're highly confident of the degree of trust from the consumer because of the AutoNation financial products that we had already launched. Again, we went to the major suppliers, say we have a profound understanding what the consumer wants. Here's the value equation we have to meet. But now the customer has to trust the product, and so it has to be branded to AutoNation. And we see already that the adoption rate in all the AutoNation-branded stores is approaching 95% of the AutoNation customer care products. All of that means that the significant cost of launching a brand has been done. The significant investment in launching AutoNation Express is done. Opening the door to make brand extensions and realizing opportunities that you have created by what has come before. Now referring back to the old megastores, I was here for that, and there was many customer-friendly elements that I liked. There was cradle-to-grave elements that didn't make sense like the whole linkage between the rental car business and the megastores. The megastores, having said that they had many customer elements that were to be admired, were conceptually, completely the wrong size and scale with no ability to fix it. And most importantly, a brand didn't exist. And there was no alignment between the franchise business and what would be this freestanding business. So conflict was inherent. So all of those issues are resolved today, and we now move into this brand extension step with many more elements, alignment with the existing business and in a very strong position with the goal of having much more control of our destiny. And what I foresee we ultimately have in them is the largest Premium Luxury business at retail in America approaching with what Jon Ferrando just announced, 100 franchises in the Premium Luxury business coast-to-coast; a volume franchise business branded under the name AutoNation; and now, a freestanding AutoNation USA business that we can seize what we see as a significant opportunity to grow in the much larger preowned business but doing it from a position of strength."

And we know these vehicles very well, who owns them, where they are, why they drop off. And we absolutely intend to attract them. So as far as the pay off, here's the way I think about it. So if you look at our performance in financial products, it's already exceptional, and a big part of that growth and why it's sustainable is because of the AutoNation financial products. So it's -- the payoff was immediate for having built the brand. So what are the extensions that have immediate benefit to the company? Parts. Because these parts, these AutoNation parts are going to be available in our franchise stores as well as the AutoNation USA stores. The benefit is immediate. We have significant batteries, wiper blades, filters already in there, and we are in negotiation with supplier for hundreds of more parts that will be available, both in our franchise business and in the AutoNation USA store. The benefit of that is immediate, both for the customer and for AutoNation. Of course, we will continue to offer OEM parts, and of course, we will use them for all warranty work or all customer care work that the manufacturer pays for. But beyond that, we will offer our customers choices, and we think there'll be a high adoption rate just like we saw in the service contract. And, oh, by the way, we will then be able to have this supply of parts on a much better cost basis for our reconditioning in our USA stores and in the customer care aspect of our USA stores. So there's an immediate benefit for that. The same thing with accessories. And by the way, the returns -- our move to profitability from our auction site and on collision centers is very quick. Now the USA stores, there's a ramp in it. I think we'll be in the second year to see profitability from these stores or break into profitability. But I have a high degree of confidence that we will have significant market awareness and ability to generate sales because of our AutoNation Express capability. So that gives me a great deal of confidence to say, yes, the second year, these stores are going to break into profitability. Now for the last few quarters and early into next year, is there a surge of spending in investment in all the training, building up the facility teams and everything else that has to go on to launch something? Yes, we'll take that in stride. It's nothing like launching a brand or launching AutoNation Express, but it's in there. And then that will move behind us. And then as the stores, the AutoNation USA stores start moving into profitability, we'll continue to build out as we've identified another 20 sites in development. So we're not starting from a standstill here is my point, and the return that we're receiving for certain initiatives is already a payback for some cost or past cost that we've already put into the brand in AutoNation Express. There's the way I think about it. Now we're really going to be reaping the opportunity of what we paid for in '13, '14 and '15. Now everyone sees why we took the risk and spent the money to create a band and create a digital capability. Now in the very near term, by that I mean right this minute, and into 2017, will I have some more cost to get these things up and going? Yes, I will, but that will be mitigated by the other initiatives, and once you get past that first tranche of stores, off we go."

We will absolutely take AutoNation Express, extend it into the store as an operating system, as the enterprise operating system. However, we're still convinced that brick and mortar plays a role. That it is an expensive item that people are purchasing, and they want the flexibility to change their mind. But you got to get them there in a cost-effective way and have a cost-effective experience that moves at a speedy pace. So we think we have all that thought through, and there's no question in our mind that we will be able to compete.

So most manufacturers did not go down that road. Most manufacturers, I give them credit, are running the business in a very disciplined way successfully, with an eye on the future, and I see nothing too alarming. Those who embraced stair-steps, whatever you want to call them, in the short term, yes, you get a pull forward in sales. But over an extended period and certainly, by the third quarter it's an extended period, you clearly, it's indisputable that these multitier-pricing systems are so unpopular with the vast majority of customers and retailers that your business begins to decline. So if I bifurcate the world into disciplined and undisciplined or rational and irrational and look at the numbers, basically retail for the disciplined rational group is flat, and it's down 6% for the stair-steppers. And if I look at retail values for the stair-steppers, it's eroding significantly, meaning it's unsustainable. Now I salute a company like Ford Motor Company that endeavored with stair steps. They stepped away and have taken a much longer disciplined view. They're to be congratulated. The one practitioner who is still absolutely convinced that stair-steps is the way to go is Nissan. And it's obviously a very contentious situation at the moment, and the end of that story, I don't know. But I do know it's very disruptive to the Nissan business, and we'll have to see what happens there. But I think in principle -- I think this is the big message. In principle, the whole industry has watched this story unfold in 2016. And once you see the resale values gap remain as large it is, if not grow, 700 basis points difference. You cannot make the case that stair-steps work. And then what you see is they start dumping more into fleets to try to cover up the fact that it's not working at retail. My view, it's unsustainable, but there's -- and there's movement away from them by certain manufacturers. I don't expect others to get in, in a significant way, but how it plays out with Nissan, I don't know."

I think that -- I've said this before. I said it at the beginning of the year. I think the demand for trucks is over 60% of the market, and the only restriction has been its fall productive capacity. So I think all the manufacturers agree with that and have been adapting their production as much as possible to be more in alignment with the marketplace. And that is certainly good for the industry overall to have -- first, it's more profitable for the manufacturers on the truck side than on the car side. And to have a better alignment what -- between what people want to buy and what you're producing is always better. But I think it's basically a plateaued environment. And when I say plateaued, that's a couple points up, a few points down or flat. Something in a narrow corridor is most likely what we're looking at. Hopefully, with -- no, I wouldn't even say it.

So I think the big message is we have $850 million of liquidity today, great access to the capital markets for future, and we feel extremely well-positioned, really supported by the fact that the base model kicks off a lot of cash.

Today I'm pleased to share the next phase of our customer-focused comprehensive brand extension strategy.
In 2013, we launched the AutoNation retail brand, a pivotal moment in the company's history, which set the stage for AutoNation Express, AutoNation Customer Financial Service products and now, AutoNation USA standalone preowned vehicle sales and service centers. AutoNation USA is the next step in establishing AutoNation as the most recognized brand in auto retail.
We have identified 25 AutoNation USA sites in our existing markets of which 5 are planned to be opened in 2017.
Several building blocks for AutoNation USA have already been put in place in our existing franchise stores with tremendous success. One Price, our negotiation-free preowned vehicle pricing strategy, AutoNation Precision Parts and AutoNation Auto Gear, branded parts and accessory lines, were each launched in the third quarter.
One Price allows consumers to shop over 20,000 preowned vehicles on our website with transparent, hassle-free and fair pricing. Consumer and associate feedback has been phenomenal. Consumers have said the buying experience was very easy, simple, no hassle, just fair pricing. Employees have said it enhances the overall customer experience.
As part of the continued brand extension strategy, we're expanding our AutoNation Auto Auctions, AutoNation collision centers from coast-to-coast. Our plan is to open 4 additional auctions over the next 2 years. We also plan to acquire an additional 18 collision centers over the same period.
We expect that these investments in the next phase of the company's brand extension rollout will exceed $500 million in the aggregate over the next several years. The next phase in the company's history represents attractive opportunities that we expect will generate significant long-term shareholder value.
Turning to our third quarter results. Today, we reported EPS from continuing operations of $1.05, which matched our third quarter record achieved last year.
Revenue for the quarter totaled $5.6 billion compared to $5.4 billion in the same period a year ago, an increase of 4%. AutoNation's total retail new vehicle unit sales for the quarter were down 1% and on a same-store sale basis, down 6%.
Today, we also announced the acquisition of 3 Premium Luxury franchises and the award of 3 Premium Luxury franchise add-points, which include our first BMW franchise in South Florida and our first Jaguar-Land Rover franchises in Texas. We also acquired our 70th collision center in Westmont, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago.
The combined anticipated annual revenue from these acquisition and add-points is $430 million once the add-points are fully operational.
I now turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Cheryl Miller."

For the third quarter, we reported net income from continuing operations of $108 million or $1.05 per share versus net income of $119 million or $1.05 per share during the third quarter of 2015. Effective as of the third quarter of 2016, AutoNation will only report its financial results in accordance with GAAP in its earnings releases and SEC reports and will not include non-GAAP or adjusted measures.
In the second quarter, revenue increased $214 million or 4% compared to the prior year and gross profit improved $6 million or 1%. SG&A as a percentage of gross profit was 70.7% for the quarter, which represents a 220 basis point increase compared to the year ago period. The increase was driven by gross profit pressure from certain manufacturers' disruptive marketing and sales incentives in the new vehicle marketplace. We believe that the continued pressure on gross profit from these incentives as well as expenses related to the brand extensions announced today may increase our SG&A as a percentage of gross profit by 100 basis points sequentially in the fourth quarter.
The provision for income tax in the quarter was $67 million or 38.3%. Net new vehicle floorplan was a benefit of $14.9 million, a decrease of $2.2 million from the third quarter of 2015. The decrease was primarily due to increased floorplan balances and higher interest rates, partially offset by higher floorplan assistance per unit.
Floorplan debt decreased sequentially, approximately $263 million during the third quarter to $3.5 billion at quarter end, primarily due to lower new inventory balances, partially offset by increased borrowings on our used vehicle floorplan facilities.
Non-vehicle interest expense increased to $28.9 million compared to $21.4 million in the third quarter of 2015. A $7.5 million increase in interest expense was driven by higher average debt balances, resulting primarily from share repurchase and acquisitions.
At the end of September, we had $2.8 billion of non-vehicle debt, an increase of $50 million compared to June 30, 2016. Non-vehicle debt includes $975 billion of outstanding commercial paper borrowings.
At the end of September, we had no amounts drawn under our revolving credit facility. As a consequence, our non-vehicle debt fixed to floating mix was approximately 65% fixed and 35% floating.
During the third quarter, we repurchased 1 million shares for $50 million at an average price of $48.62 per share. AutoNation has approximately $316 million of remaining board authorization per share repurchase.
As of October 26, there were approximately 101 million shares outstanding. This does not include the dilutive impact of stock options.
Our leverage ratio increased slightly to 2.8x at the end of Q3 as compared to 2.7x at the end of Q2. The leverage ratio was 2.7x on a net debt basis, including used floorplan availability, and our covenant limit is 3.75x.
Capital expenditures were $69 million for the quarter. Capital expenditures, again, are on an accrual basis, excluding operating lease buyouts and related asset sales. Our quarter end cash balance was $62 million which, combined with our additional borrowing capacity, resulted in total liquidity of $843 million at the end of September.
We're very excited about the brand extension opportunities announced today and their ability to diversify our business and once fully ramped, improve our profitability. We will continue to focus on driving shareholder value through strategic investments and opportunistic capital allocation.

Today, we are excited to announce and share our comprehensive brand extension strategy. I will start with AutoNation USA, our standalone preowned vehicle sales and service centers. Our plan is to open 5 AutoNation USA stores in 2017. We have also identified 20 additional sites over the next several years within our existing markets. Customers will have the opportunity to purchase an AutoNation-certified vehicle and service that vehicle at any AutoNation USA store. AutoNation USA will utilize AutoNation Express, the company's digital platform, which allows customers to dramatically reduce their transaction time by offering a seamless end-to-end experience where they can search online for inventory, select and reserve a vehicle, value their trade, see payment options and apply for financing.
One Price, our negotiation-free, preowned vehicle pricing strategy, which we've already begun to roll out in our current franchise locations, will also be the pricing strategy at our AutoNation USA stores. One Price allows us to leverage our centralized capabilities such as centralized pricing and appraisals. Initial customer and associate feedback has been exceptionally positive. One Price offers customers a transparent and stress-free buying experience and will be fully implemented in our existing locations by the end of the second quarter of 2017.
AutoNation USA will implement our new sales associate non-commission-based pay plan as well. The new pay plan has 4 simple metrics that give us a strategic advantage in recruiting associates. Our new pay plan offers salaries and paid training. It's competitive, and it's a plan that is based on rewarding behaviors that drive productivity while delivering a peerless customer experience.
AutoNation USA stores service now centers will utilize AutoNation Precision Parts, an AutoNation branded line of high-quality, competitively priced maintenance and repair parts for the vehicle reconditioning and customer repairs.
We launched AutoNation Precision Parts in the third quarter with AutoNation branded batteries, which feature an industry-leading free lifetime replacement guarantee. Service now will also allow us to engage and recapture customers who are post warranty and are no longer servicing at the franchise stores. We now offer consumers a compelling value and options as well as drive service retention.
Also in the third quarter, we launched our automotive accessory line, AutoNation Auto Gear, featuring our partnership with WeatherTech, a leader in aftermarket auto accessories. We will continue to expand our precision parts and AutoNation Auto Gear product lines in phases as their product portfolios are developed.
In addition, we're expanding our very successful AutoNation Auto Auction from coast-to-coast. We have a successful wholesale auction in Southern California, processing over 25,000 vehicles annually, and we plan to leverage our brand and expertise in additional markets by wholesaling our own vehicles and offering third party buyers and sellers access to high-quality inventory. We plan to open 4 additional AutoNation-branded auctions over the next 2 years starting in Orlando, Florida and Houston, Texas in Q1 2017.
Lastly, our brand extension strategy will also include expanding our AutoNation collision center footprint. AutoNation currently owns and operates 70 collision and repair centers, including the newly acquired Westmont Body Werks in Westmont, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago.
AutoNation has the largest collision center network among automotive retailers with expertise and certifications with multiple manufacturers and is a preferred repair provider for many of the major insurance carriers. New locations are planned for key markets where AutoNation has store density but does not have existing collision presence or has capacity limitations.
Over the next 2 years, we plan to open or acquire at least 18 new AutoNation-branded collision centers across the country. The steps we have taken with the launch of our customer-focused comprehensive brand extension strategy and diversified business model will position us to capitalize on our industry's leading retail brand.
Now turning to our third quarter results. My comments today will be on a same-store basis as compared to the prior year unless noted otherwise.
Gross profit for variable operations was $435 million, down 8%. Variable gross was $3,320 on a per vehicle retail basis, which was relatively flat compared to the same period last year.
New and used same-store unit volume was down 6% compared to the third quarter last year. Certain manufacturers continued their disruptive marketing and sales incentives, which resulted in multi-tier pricing despite new vehicle sales being down again in the third quarter. Manufacturers must find a rational and disciplined approach that does not erode their future brand value.
New vehicle revenue for the quarter was $3 billion, a decrease of $87 million or 3%. We've retailed 81,600 units, a decrease of 6%.
New vehicle gross profit was $1,805 on a per vehicle retail basis, down 7%.
As of September 30, approximately 14% or 5,400 units of our total used vehicle inventory was on hold due to the Takata airbag recall. The Takata airbag recall negatively impacted our net income from continuing operations by $6 million after tax or $0.06 per share. We've started to receive limited Takata airbag replacement parts for Honda and BMW only.
Used vehicle retail revenue was $1 billion, a decrease of $25 million or 2%. Used vehicles retailed were 51,500, down 7%. Used vehicle gross profit was $1,543 on a per vehicle retail basis, an increase of 2%.
Customer financial services total gross profit was $215 million. Customer financial services gross profit on a per vehicle retail basis was $1,617, an increase of $60 or 4%.
We set an all-time record in customer care gross profit of $338 million, an increase of $6 million or 2%.
Also in the quarter, customer care revenue was $782 million, an increase of $22 million or 3%. Customer paid gross was $138 million, up 4% year-over-year, warranty gross was $71 million, up 9%. Collision gross was $29 million, up 1% year-over-year. 
Finally, I'd like to welcome our new San Diego, California and Westmont, Illinois associates to AutoNation and would like to thank AutoNation's 25,000-plus associates for their hard work and dedication. This is truly an exciting time to be part of the AutoNation team as we launch AutoNation USA and implement our customer-focused comprehensive brand extension strategy, which will create new revenue and profit streams for the company.

We are pleased to announce the addition of 6 Premium Luxury franchises and a collision center with combined anticipated annual revenues of $430 million. Three of the Premium Luxury franchises are add-points awarded to us by the manufacturers, and the other 3 Premium Luxury franchises and the collision center are acquisitions.
Starting with the acquisitions. In October, we completed the acquisition of BMW of Vista, our second BMW store in the Northern San Diego market and our 15th BMW store nationwide. As part of our AutoNation brand extension strategy, we also completed the acquisition of Westmont Body Werks in our Chicago market, our 70th collision center.
In the fourth quarter, we expect to close on the acquisition of Jaguar-Land Rover Bethesda, our 10th store in the Baltimore-D.C. market and our eighth Jaguar-Land Rover store nationwide. The store has the largest Jaguar-Land Rover showroom in the United States and fits well with the strong Premium Luxury demographics in that part of the Baltimore-Washington, D.C. corridor.
We also announced the award of BMW of Delray Beach and Jaguar-Land Rover West Houston add-points. BMW of Delray Beach is our first BMW franchise in South Florida and our 25th Premium Luxury franchise in Florida. Jaguar-Land Rover West Houston is our 10th Premium Luxury store in Texas. The add-points will be large Premium Luxury stores located in excellent auto retail locations with very attractive luxury and growth demographics. Both of these add-points are expected to open in 2018.
In 2016, we have completed or announced the acquisition or award of 49 franchises, which are expected to generate approximately $1.5 billion in annual revenue once fully operational. As of today, we represent 35 manufacturer brands, and our store portfolio numbers 372 franchises and 262 auto retail stores, along with 70 collision centers in 16 states.
Looking forward, we will continue to actively pursue acquisitions and new store opportunities, with a focus on enhancing brand representation within our existing markets and markets that can be supported by our existing management infrastructure. We will continue to be selective and prudent with our capital, with a focus on investing to produce strong returns and long-term shareholder value.
I will now turn it back to Mike Jackson."

This year and through the third quarter, certain manufacturers continued disruptive marketing and sales incentives, which resulted in multitier pricing that were unfair for consumers as well as retailers. In the third quarter, these marketing programs had a significant negative impact on new vehicle volume and gross profit per vehicle retailed. These disruptive incentive programs are damaging to the OEM brand and in my view, unsustainable. Retail sales volume for manufacturers who use these toxic marketing programs are significantly below market with, let's say, the market basically at retail, flat for the year and the irrational players being down 6%. And I also observed that they're eroding the 3-year residual value of their brand, whereas the rational marketers have a 3-year resale value of 50%, the irrational marketers are at 43%. This is undermining the resale value of their existing customers and therefore, their brand. These certain manufacturers must find a rational and disciplined approach that does not erode their future brand value.
Having said that, this is an exciting time for AutoNation with the launch of AutoNation USA and our comprehensive brand extension strategy. We have built an outstanding industry-leading brand, and we remain committed to achieving and sustaining operational excellence while continuing to create a peerless customer experience.

Well, our view, if I look at the automotive retail marketplace, for retail new, it's less than $15 million. For retail preowned, it's approaching $40 million. So you also have to take into consideration that the new vehicle market is definitely cyclical with 1 of 3 phases, growth, plateau and decline. Now you could be in plateau quite some time, but it brings -- plateau brings a whole -- another set of issues. So if I go back 5 years ago, anticipating that plateau would eventually arise, I said I need a strategy that we can take much more of our destiny in our own hands and continue to grow the business. Now to be able to do that successfully, I felt we needed 2 foundational elements: one was a brand that was well-known in the marketplace already; and a digital capability that we knew could deliver sales. So we've done both of those steps successfully with the AutoNation brand. And with our AutoNation Express launch, it now delivers almost 30% of our sales from those sites. So having taken that step as preconditions in order to give us the confidence that these stores would turn profitable quickly, we knew we needed a value equation for the consumer and an outstanding experience. We know the customer craves fairness and transparency and price, and that means they need to be one-priced. So then we said, well, the brand has to be in alignment between our existing franchise business and this extensive business. Therefore, we have to one-price our existing preowned business. So that started already this year as a conditional element and has gone extremely well. And we will have all AutoNation franchise preowned one-priced sometime at the beginning of next year, but certainly, by the time the first AutoNation USA stores open. Next these AutoNation USA stores have a customer care component. We wanted a value story there. Again, to your point, we do very well taking care of cars that are new to 5, 6, 7 years old, and then there's a big drop-off. So we want to attract that market, but we need a value equation. So we went -- we're a significant purchaser of parts already today, so we went to major suppliers and negotiated exactly what the consumer would want and are launching AutoNation-branded parts and accessories. We're highly confident of the degree of trust from the consumer because of the AutoNation financial products that we had already launched. Again, we went to the major suppliers, say we have a profound understanding what the consumer wants. Here's the value equation we have to meet. But now the customer has to trust the product, and so it has to be branded to AutoNation. And we see already that the adoption rate in all the AutoNation-branded stores is approaching 95% of the AutoNation customer care products. All of that means that the significant cost of launching a brand has been done. The significant investment in launching AutoNation Express is done. Opening the door to make brand extensions and realizing opportunities that you have created by what has come before. Now referring back to the old megastores, I was here for that, and there was many customer-friendly elements that I liked. There was cradle-to-grave elements that didn't make sense like the whole linkage between the rental car business and the megastores. The megastores, having said that they had many customer elements that were to be admired, were conceptually, completely the wrong size and scale with no ability to fix it. And most importantly, a brand didn't exist. And there was no alignment between the franchise business and what would be this freestanding business. So conflict was inherent. So all of those issues are resolved today, and we now move into this brand extension step with many more elements, alignment with the existing business and in a very strong position with the goal of having much more control of our destiny. And what I foresee we ultimately have in them is the largest Premium Luxury business at retail in America approaching with what Jon Ferrando just announced, 100 franchises in the Premium Luxury business coast-to-coast; a volume franchise business branded under the name AutoNation; and now, a freestanding AutoNation USA business that we can seize what we see as a significant opportunity to grow in the much larger preowned business but doing it from a position of strength."

And we know these vehicles very well, who owns them, where they are, why they drop off. And we absolutely intend to attract them. So as far as the pay off, here's the way I think about it. So if you look at our performance in financial products, it's already exceptional, and a big part of that growth and why it's sustainable is because of the AutoNation financial products. So it's -- the payoff was immediate for having built the brand. So what are the extensions that have immediate benefit to the company? Parts. Because these parts, these AutoNation parts are going to be available in our franchise stores as well as the AutoNation USA stores. The benefit is immediate. We have significant batteries, wiper blades, filters already in there, and we are in negotiation with supplier for hundreds of more parts that will be available, both in our franchise business and in the AutoNation USA store. The benefit of that is immediate, both for the customer and for AutoNation. Of course, we will continue to offer OEM parts, and of course, we will use them for all warranty work or all customer care work that the manufacturer pays for. But beyond that, we will offer our customers choices, and we think there'll be a high adoption rate just like we saw in the service contract. And, oh, by the way, we will then be able to have this supply of parts on a much better cost basis for our reconditioning in our USA stores and in the customer care aspect of our USA stores. So there's an immediate benefit for that. The same thing with accessories. And by the way, the returns -- our move to profitability from our auction site and on collision centers is very quick. Now the USA stores, there's a ramp in it. I think we'll be in the second year to see profitability from these stores or break into profitability. But I have a high degree of confidence that we will have significant market awareness and ability to generate sales because of our AutoNation Express capability. So that gives me a great deal of confidence to say, yes, the second year, these stores are going to break into profitability. Now for the last few quarters and early into next year, is there a surge of spending in investment in all the training, building up the facility teams and everything else that has to go on to launch something? Yes, we'll take that in stride. It's nothing like launching a brand or launching AutoNation Express, but it's in there. And then that will move behind us. And then as the stores, the AutoNation USA stores start moving into profitability, we'll continue to build out as we've identified another 20 sites in development. So we're not starting from a standstill here is my point, and the return that we're receiving for certain initiatives is already a payback for some cost or past cost that we've already put into the brand in AutoNation Express. There's the way I think about it. Now we're really going to be reaping the opportunity of what we paid for in '13, '14 and '15. Now everyone sees why we took the risk and spent the money to create a band and create a digital capability. Now in the very near term, by that I mean right this minute, and into 2017, will I have some more cost to get these things up and going? Yes, I will, but that will be mitigated by the other initiatives, and once you get past that first tranche of stores, off we go."

When we look at the public dealer space, it's kind of split here on having standalone new stores, which obviously involves a lot more brick-and-mortar spending. And then there are new entrants focused completely on online transaction and taking massive SG&A cost out of the selling process. And they're gaining some traction, too, but it obviously requires a lot of marketing push. The question is, given AutoNation's unique positioning here, why not leverage your brand and digital capabilities through a bigger marketing push in the near term for online-only businesses and gaining share through an asset-light model, with much lower SG&A cost, rather than a brick-and-mortar strategy?"

We will absolutely take AutoNation Express, extend it into the store as an operating system, as the enterprise operating system. However, we're still convinced that brick and mortar plays a role. That it is an expensive item that people are purchasing, and they want the flexibility to change their mind. But you got to get them there in a cost-effective way and have a cost-effective experience that moves at a speedy pace. So we think we have all that thought through, and there's no question in our mind that we will be able to compete.

So most manufacturers did not go down that road. Most manufacturers, I give them credit, are running the business in a very disciplined way successfully, with an eye on the future, and I see nothing too alarming. Those who embraced stair-steps, whatever you want to call them, in the short term, yes, you get a pull forward in sales. But over an extended period and certainly, by the third quarter it's an extended period, you clearly, it's indisputable that these multitier-pricing systems are so unpopular with the vast majority of customers and retailers that your business begins to decline. So if I bifurcate the world into disciplined and undisciplined or rational and irrational and look at the numbers, basically retail for the disciplined rational group is flat, and it's down 6% for the stair-steppers. And if I look at retail values for the stair-steppers, it's eroding significantly, meaning it's unsustainable. Now I salute a company like Ford Motor Company that endeavored with stair steps. They stepped away and have taken a much longer disciplined view. They're to be congratulated. The one practitioner who is still absolutely convinced that stair-steps is the way to go is Nissan. And it's obviously a very contentious situation at the moment, and the end of that story, I don't know. But I do know it's very disruptive to the Nissan business, and we'll have to see what happens there. But I think in principle -- I think this is the big message. In principle, the whole industry has watched this story unfold in 2016. And once you see the resale values gap remain as large it is, if not grow, 700 basis points difference. You cannot make the case that stair-steps work. And then what you see is they start dumping more into fleets to try to cover up the fact that it's not working at retail. My view, it's unsustainable, but there's -- and there's movement away from them by certain manufacturers. I don't expect others to get in, in a significant way, but how it plays out with Nissan, I don't know."

I think that -- I've said this before. I said it at the beginning of the year. I think the demand for trucks is over 60% of the market, and the only restriction has been its fall productive capacity.

And that is certainly good for the industry overall to have -- first, it's more profitable for the manufacturers on the truck side than on the car side. And to have a better alignment what -- between what people want to buy and what you're producing is always better. But I think it's basically a plateaued environment.

So I'd add that with AutoNation Express and the different programs with respect to the brand extensions in AutoNation USA, we're being prudent. We're doing most of that in existing markets, so in certain cases, you can repurpose or look at existing land and different things there to control the total capital investment again. The potential for $500 million is spaced over a number of years, and we'll continue to pace that out as we identify place and as we look at our base CapEx plan. So I think the big message is we have $850 million of liquidity today, great access to the capital markets for future, and we feel extremely well-positioned, really supported by the fact that the base model kicks off a lot of cash. And keep in mind that with AutoUSA, we have a service component in there as well, which is very cash generating."

Plus we have our current source of inventory which comes from trade-ins from our existing stores. Plus with the influx of cars coming off a lease over the next 12 to 18 months, there'll be additional inventory that's going to come in that the existing new car franchise stores will not be able to handle all of it. And we'll be able to use that inventory to help supply our USA stores."
