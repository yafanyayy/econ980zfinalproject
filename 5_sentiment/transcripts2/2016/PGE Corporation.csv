Hello, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. 
2015 was a really strong year for us, both operationally and financially. We continue to improve the safety and reliability of our gas and electric systems while delivering really solid financial results. 
Our earnings from operations in 2015 were $3.12 a share, which is slightly ahead of our guidance range. 
So I will spend a few minutes reviewing the operational and regulatory progress we made, and then I'm going to turn over to Jason Wells to review our financial results in more detail. 
We continue to believe that focusing on 3 key areas: positioning the company for a clean energy economy; delivering on customer expectations; and addressing outstanding issues, will provide the foundation for operational and financial success. 
So let me start with how we're positioning the company for a clean energy economy. PG&E continues to be a recognized leader in supporting the nation's goal around clean energy. In December, several PG&E team members and I joined Governor Brown for the global climate Summit in Paris. We participated in a number of events and panels where we shared the actions PG&E and California are taking to reduce carbon emissions, advanced clean energy technologies and spur economic growth. We were very proud to represent the California utility perspective at such a significant global forum. 
In 2015, nearly 30% of the PG&E's electric deliveries came from qualifying renewable resources. And even more meaningfully, nearly 60% of the energy that we delivered was carbon [indiscernible]. We know that as our energy mix continues to evolve, so do the needs of our electric grid. To deliver on California's low carbon future, we need to continue investing in a smarter, more resilient grid. And we need to ensure that rate structures are keeping up with these changes. Although we didn't make as much progress on rate reform last year as we would have liked, the commission has started to address the issues through flattening our residential tiers and moving towards mandatory time of use rates. And they have committed to review the rate structure again in 2019. We look forward to continuing to work with all the parties to develop the appropriate rate structure to meet our customers' changing needs. 
Turning to customer expectations. On the electric side of the business, last year, we delivered a seventh straight year of improved electric reliability. Our outage duration and frequency are now in the second quartile for the industry. We also delivered first quartile performance in both our 911 emergency response, our 911 emergency response and our wire down metrics. 
On the gas side of the business, we delivered top decile emergency response performance and broke ground on a new state-of-the-art gas training facility which we expect to open in 2017. We're also the first company in the United States to be certified in meeting the American Petroleum Institute's recommended practice 1173, which is a new standard related to pipeline safety and safety culture. We now have 3 external certifications recognizing the quality of our gas asset management and safety culture programs. We also continue to make progress towards resolving our outstanding issues. I'm pleased to report that we've closed out another one of the MTSB's recommendations by installing more than 200 automated and remote shutoff valves across our gas transmission system, and we're well on the way to completing the final recommendation to strength test nearly 1,000 miles of transmission pipe. In an important step forward, the Commission has officially closed out the San Bruno investigation. We've also completed hearings in the gas distribution record-keeping investigation and we look forward to resolution of that case this year. 
In the criminal proceeding, we received some positive rulings from the court late past year that narrowed the scope of the case. Most significantly, the court dismissed the government's alternative [indiscernible] claim based on alleged losses. The court is still considering whether to allow the government to proceed with an alternative fines act claim based on alleged gains. That determination will be made after the first phase of the trial where the government will have to prove that PG&E employees knowingly and willfully the law. We continue to believe that the evidence just does not support the charges. 
So to sum up. We had a really strong year in 2015 and we're committed to making additional progress in 2016. Before I turn it over to Jason, I want to reconfirm that we expect to address the dividend in 2016. I'm committed to doing that this year, although I don't have any specifics on timing for you yet. I'm excited to continue to work with Jason in his new role as CFO. He's been working closely with our finance and operational teams for a number of years, so he knows the company extremely well, and he provides  a wealth of experience and will be instrumental in helping this move forward. 
So Jason, welcome, and let me hand it over to you to discuss our financials."

I've enjoyed meeting many of you already and I look forward to meeting more of you this spring. I'll begin my remarks today by going through our Q4 and full year 2015 results, and then I'll provide some insights regarding our 2016 outlook.
Slide 5 shows our 2015 results for Q4 and the full year. We had solid results in 2015, coming in slightly above our guidance range for the year due to some smaller positive miscellaneous items. 
Earnings from operations came in at $0.50 for the quarter and $3.12 for the year. GAAP earnings, including the items impacting comparability, are also shown here. All items impacting comparability came in within our guidance ranges. 
Pipeline-related expenses came in at $30 million pretax for the quarter and $103 million pretax for the year. 
Our legal and regulatory-related expenses were $14 million pretax for the quarter and $58 million pretax for the year. 
Fines and penalties were $137 million pretax for the quarter and $907 million for the year. The Q4 amount represents our estimate of the disallowed capital work coming out of the final San Bruno penalty decision, which we are accruing as we complete the work. 
Finally, our annual results show insurance recoveries of $49 million pretax. As we mentioned last quarter, we have now resolved all insurance claims related to San Bruno, recovering a total of $515 million. 
Slide 6 shows our quarter-over-quarter comparison from earnings from operations, up $0.53 in Q4 last year and $0.50 in Q4 this year. You've seen most of these drivers in previous quarters, so I'll cover them briefly. 
The biggest item, a decrease of $0.10, is associated with lower cost recovery in 2015 because we did not receive a decision in the gas transmission rate case during the year. So we incurred those expenses, but did not collect the associated revenues. 
Next, the nuclear refueling outage in the fourth quarter drove a $0.05 decrease over the same period last year. There was a $0.01 for regulatory and legal matters and $0.02 negative resulting from additional shares quarter-over-quarter. These negative drivers were partially offset by three positive items. First, we have $0.05 of growth in rate based earnings. Second, timing of taxes was also a small positive for the quarter and for the full year, as we've said, this item nets to zero. And finally, we had $0.09 of smaller miscellaneous items. For the full year, this line netted to $0.02 positive. More detail around the annual results is available on the appendix of today's slide deck. 
Moving to Slide 7. Today, we're introducing guidance for 2016 earnings from operations, up $3.65 to $3.85 per share. We're also providing ranges for items impacting comparability, which I'll come back to in a minute. 
First, I want to cover the assumptions we had in the guidance on Slide 8. Starting in the upper left corner, you'll see, we are assuming capital expenditures of roughly $5.6 billion this year. The breakdown by line of business is also included. Importantly, the gas transmission line assumes a range of $500 million to $700 million for the year and as you know, we're still waiting on a proposed decision on that rate case. This range includes about $300 million of safety-related capital expenditures that we estimate will be disallowed as part of the CPUC's penalty decision last year. In the upper right of the slide, you'll see that estimate of weighted average authorized rate base is about $32.6 billion for the year. Both the CapEx and rate base assumptions are consistent with ranges we previously provided. In the lower left, you'll see that we continue to assume a CPUC authorized equity ratio of 52% and a return on equity of 10.4%, which we now have certainty on through 2017. Finally, at the bottom right, we list some other factors we believe will affect 2016 earnings from operations. Our objective is to earn the authorized return on rate base for the enterprise as a whole, plus the net impact of the factors listed here. Many of these probably look familiar to you from 2015, so I'll cover them briefly. 
In terms of the gas transmission rate case, the first bullet highlights a key assumption underlying our guidance, which is that we will receive a reasonable outcome in the case this year. The second bullet is a reminder that we haven't sought cost recovery for certain corrosion control and strength testing work in the gas transmission rate case. We previously indicated these operating expenses should average a total of roughly $50 million annually over the 3-year rate case period, although the amount may vary year to year. 
Next is the tax benefits associated with our payers reduction. The net impact of this continues to be roughly $0.25 per share in 2016. 
The last item is incentive revenues for things like our customer energy efficiency programs. 
Finally, we continue to expect earnings on construction work in progress to be roughly offset by our below the line costs, which include advertising, share over contributions, some environmental costs and other items. 
One more point before I move to the next slide. Since we do not yet have a proposed decision in the gas transmission rate case, we do not expect a final to decision until at least the second quarter. So while the timing should not affect our annual earnings from operations in 2016, it will continue to have an impact on our cash flows and quarterly results as you saw last year.  In 2015, that impact was roughly $0.60. 
Now turning to Slide 9. The guidance for the items impacting comparability is $565 million to $665 million pretax. You can see that most of these categories are consistent with last year, pipeline-related expenses, legal and regulatory-related expenses and fines and penalties. We will also have a new positive category relating to the 2015 portion of revenues from the gas transmission rate case. We expect a final decision in the case this year with revenues retroactive to January 2015. This will be booking two years worth of revenues in 2016 will pull up the 2015 portion as an item impacting comparability once we get that final decision. 
The estimated range for pipeline-related expenses is $100 million to $150 million pretax. This component relates to clearing our pipeline rights-of-way. We are entering the fourth year of that program, which we've estimated will not exceed $500 million from its start in 2013 through its planned completion in 2017. The second component is legal and regulatory-related expenses, which we estimate to be between $25 million and $75 million pretax for the year. This component represents costs incurred in connection with enforcement, regulatory and litigation activities regarding natural gas matters and regulatory communications. The third component is potential fines and penalties, again, related to natural gas matters for regulatory communications. As you can see in the table at the bottom of the page, our 2016 guidance of $440 million pretax for fines and penalties, reflects our estimate of the remaining portion of the $850 million of safety-related spending that the commission disallowed as part of the San Bruno penalty decision last year. This range does not included any other potential fines or penalties. And last, we have the new positive item for 2015 gas transmission revenues, which will update after we receive a decision of that case. 
Turning to Slide 10. We assume equity issuance of $600 million to $800 million in 2016. That compares to equity issuance last year of right about $800 million. The 2016 range reflects a number of assumptions, including the timing and amount of revenues we will receive in the gas transmission rate case. 
Moving to Slides 11 and 12. We're providing updated CapEx and rate base ranges through 2019. 
First, on Slide 11. As I mentioned earlier, we're estimating about $5.6 billion in CapEx in 2016. This is a little higher than the $5.4 billion we spent in 2015. As you'll recall, [indiscernible] of our planned work last year to wildfire response. For 2017 through 2019, the $6.5 billion high end of the range is the same as you saw last quarter. As a reminder, the high end reflects the full request in our pending rate cases, which are the 2017 through 2019 General Rate Case, the 2015 through 2017 gas transmission rate case and the electric transmission TO17 rate case. And for the outer years of the gas and electric transmission rate cases where we have not yet filed a request, we've kept the high-end of the range flat with our current request. At the low end of the range, we simply assume that capital expenditures through 2019 stay flat with 2015 spending of $5.4 billion. 
Slide 12 shows our estimated rate base levels from 2016 through 2019. Next week, we will formally update our 2017 General Rate Case forecast to reflect the impact of the recent 5-year extension of bonus depreciation. The ranges shown here incorporate that update. Before I go into the numbers, I want to briefly discuss the impact of bonus depreciation on rate base and earnings per share. 
While bonus depreciation results in higher deferred taxes, which lowers rate base, it also reduces our equity needs. So while bonus depreciation have a noticeable impact on rate base, it has a small impact on earnings per share because of the lower equity needs. In 2016, bonus depreciation will not impact rate base because we are already in a net operating loss position through the end of the year. In fact, we now expect to be in an NOL at the enterprise level through 2019. However, we are also required to perform separate NOL calculations for each of our rate cases. As you know, we've had significant unrecovered costs in our gas transmission business, which has contributed to the enterprise-level NOL. But when we look at the lines of business covered by our General Rate Case, which are our electric and gas distribution and electric generation businesses, we do not expect to be in an NOL position beyond 2016. As a result, bonus depreciation will impact our rate base request in the GRC beginning in 2017. The cumulative impact of bonus depreciation in 2019 is a rate base reduction of approximately $1 billion at the low end of the range and about $1.5 billion at the high-end of the range compared to the guidance we provided in Q3. There is a smaller impact in 2017 and 2018. The majority of that relates to the 2017 through 2019 General Rate Case. A smaller amount of that reduction relates to the electric transmission assets, which are covered by our FERC transmission [indiscernible] rate case. The result is rate base grows at a compound annual growth rate of 5% to 7% from 2017 through 2019. And again, because bonus depreciation also reduces our equity needs, that mitigates the impact on future earnings per share. To help you with this, we're providing a simple rule of thumb to estimate the net impact on earnings per share from both the reduction and authorized rate base and the lower equity needs. On the margin, a $500 million reduction in authorized rate base equates to roughly $0.02 in earnings per share. 
One last note on CapEx and rate base before I open it up for questions. Remember that the high end of our CapEx range reflects only our currently filed rate cases, so there is some potential upside as we file future rate cases. 
Let me close by saying that I'm happy to be in the CFO role and I look forward to working with all of you. This is an exacting time for PG&E as we continue to see strong growth driven by California's policies and our focus on enhancing safety and reliability. 
With that, let's open up the lines for questions."

It's not the silver bullet that solve all the problems and in total, that NEM decision, and we feel didn't really go far enough in addressing the issues that are caused by subsidization that happens with the NEM rate. But we'll continue to look at that decision. The commission did decide that they will be revisiting it in 2019 and I will just remind you, between now and 2019, we have a lot of changes that are happening in base rates in California with collapsing of the tiers and with the potential to move customers -- all customers to time of use rates.

But that said, I don't think a week goes by where one of us on the team doesn't somebody coming in and having some ideas about how technology can improve this business. We actually look at them, generally incorporate them within the utility structure and be successful and help us there wouldn't help the bottom line necessarily, but might lower our cost to customers, which, in the long run, I think is a very positive thing. So we are looking at those opportunities because we really to believe that we are as far, if not farther along, then most of the utility in incorporating some of these technologies into the grid. I mean, as I said, we've crossed over 30% on renewables now and as for the 33% requirement by 2020, so where way ahead of the curve. Going to 50% renewables, we are confident that we can manage 50% renewable. Many of our colleagues in the industry are struggling with, how do you handle 10% or 15% renewables on your system? So we put in place the mechanisms and the technology to do it."

We continue to improve the safety and reliability of our gas and electric systems while delivering really sol",834,"Well, thank you, Janet. Hello, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. 
2015 was a really strong year for us, both operationally and financially. We continue to improve the safety and reliability of our gas and electric systems while delivering really solid financial results. Our earnings from operations in 2015 were $3.12 a share, which is slightly ahead of our guidance range. So I'm going to spend a few minutes reviewing the operational and regulatory progress we made, and then I'm going to turn it over to Jason Wells to review our financial results in more detail. 
We continue to believe that focusing on 3 key areas: positioning the company for a clean energy economy; delivering on customer expectations; and addressing outstanding issues, will provide the foundation for operational and financial success. So let me start with how we're positioning the company for a clean energy economy. 
PG&E continues to be a recognized leader in supporting the nation's goals around clean energy. In December, several PG&E team members and I joined Governor Brown for the global climate summit in Paris. We participated in a number of events and panels where we shared the actions PG&E and California are taking to reduce carbon emissions, advance clean energy technologies and spur economic growth. We were very proud to represent the California utility perspective at such a significant global forum. 
In 2015, nearly 30% of PG&E's electric deliveries came from qualifying renewable resources. And even more meaningfully, nearly 60% of the energy that we delivered was carbon free We know that as our energy mix continues to evolve, so do the needs of our electric grid. To deliver on California's low carbon future, we need to continue investing in a smarter, more resilient grid, and we need to ensure that rate structures are keeping up with these changes. Although we didn't make as much progress on rate reform last year as we would have liked, the commission has started to address the issue through flattening our residential tiers and moving towards mandatory time-of-use rates. And they've committed to review the rate structure again in 2019. We look forward to continuing to work with all the parties to develop the appropriate rate structure to meet our customers' changing needs. 
Turning to customer expectations. On the electric side of the business, last year, we delivered a seventh straight year of improved electric reliability. Our outage duration and frequency are now in the second quartile for the industry. We also delivered first-quartile performance in both our 911 emergency response, our 911 emergency response and our wire down metrics. 
On the gas side of the business, we delivered top-decile emergency response performance and broke ground on a new state-of-the-art gas training facility, which we expect to open in 2017. We're also the first company in the United States to be certified in meeting the American Petroleum Institute's Recommended Practice 1173, which is a new standard related to pipeline safety and safety culture. We now have 3 external certifications recognizing the quality of our gas asset management and safety culture programs. 
We also continue to make progress towards resolving our outstanding issues. I'm pleased to report that we've closed out another one of the NTSB's recommendations by installing more than 200 automated and remote shut-off valves across our gas transmission system, and we're well on the way to completing the final recommendation to strength test nearly 1,000 miles of transmission pipe. In an important step forward, the commission has officially closed out the San Bruno investigation. We've also completed hearings in the gas distribution record-keeping investigation and we look forward to resolution of that case this year. 
In the criminal proceeding, we received some positive rulings from the court late past year that narrowed the scope of the case. Most significantly, the court dismissed the government's Alternative Fines Act claim based on alleged losses. The court is still considering whether to allow the government to proceed with an Alternative Fines Act claim based on alleged gains. That determination will be made after the first phase of the trial, where the government will have to prove that PG&E employees knowingly and willfully violated the law. We continue to believe that the evidence just does not support the charges. 
So to sum up. We had a really strong year in 2015 and we're committed to making additional progress in 2016. Before I turn it over to Jason, I want to reconfirm that we expect to address the dividend in 2016. I'm committed to doing that this year, although I don't have any specifics on timing for you yet. 
I'm excited to continue to work with Jason in his new role as CFO. He's been working closely with our finance and operational teams for a number of years, so he knows the company extremely well. And he provides a wealth of experience and will be instrumental in helping us move forward. 
So Jason, welcome, and let me hand it over to you to discuss our financials."

I've enjoyed meeting many of you already, and I look forward to meeting more of you this spring. I'll begin my remarks today by going through our Q4 and full year 2015 results, and then I'll provide some insights regarding our 2016 outlook.
Slide 5 shows our 2015 results for Q4 and the full year. We had solid results in 2015, coming in slightly above our guidance range for the year, due to some smaller positive miscellaneous items. Earnings from operations came in at $0.50 for the quarter and $3.12 for the year. GAAP earnings, including the items impacting comparability, are also shown here. All items impacting comparability came in within our guidance ranges. 
Pipeline-related expenses came in at $39 million pretax for the quarter and $103 million pretax for the year. Our legal and regulatory-related expenses were $14 million pretax for the quarter and $58 million pretax for the year. 
Fines and penalties were $137 million pretax for the quarter and $907 million pretax for the year. The Q4 amount represents our estimate of the disallowed capital work coming out of the final San Bruno penalty decision, which we are accruing as we complete that work. 
Finally, our annual results show insurance recoveries of $49 million, pretax. As we mentioned last quarter, we have now resolved all insurance claims related to San Bruno, recovering a total of $515 million. 
Slide 6 shows our quarter-over-quarter comparison from earnings from operations of $0.53 in Q4 last year and $0.50 in Q4 this year. You've seen most of these drivers in previous quarters, so I'll cover them briefly. 
The biggest item, a decrease of $0.10, is associated with lower cost recovery in 2015 because we did not receive a decision on the Gas Transmission rate case during the year. So we incurred those expenses, but did not collect the associated revenues. 
Next, the nuclear refueling outage in the fourth quarter drove a $0.05 decrease over the same period last year. There was a $0.01 for regulatory and legal matters and $0.02 negative resulting from additional shares quarter-over-quarter. These negative drivers were partially offset by 3 positive items. First, we have $0.05 of growth in rate-based earnings. Second, timing of taxes was also a small positive for the quarter, and for the full year, as we've said, this item nets to zero. And finally, we had $0.09 of smaller miscellaneous items. For the full year, this line netted to $0.02 positive. More detail around the annual results is available on the appendix of today's slide deck. 
Moving to Slide 7. Today, we're introducing guidance for 2016 earnings from operations of $3.65 to $3.85 per share. We're also providing ranges for items impacting comparability, which I'll come back to in a minute. 
First, I want to cover the assumptions we had in the guidance on Slide 8. Starting in the upper left corner, you'll see we are assuming capital expenditures of roughly $5.6 billion this year. A breakdown by line of business is also included. Importantly, the gas transmission line assumes a range of $500 million to $700 million for the year, and as you know, we're still waiting on a proposed decision on that rate case. This range includes about $300 million of safety-related capital expenditures that we estimate will be disallowed as part of the CPUC's penalty decision last year. 
In the upper right of the slide, you'll see that our estimate of weighted average authorized rate base is about $32.6 billion for the year. Both the CapEx and rate base assumptions are consistent with ranges we previously provided. 
In the lower left, you'll see that we continue to assume a CPUC-authorized equity ratio of 52% and a return on equity of 10.4%, which we now have certainty on through 2017. Finally, at the bottom right, we list some other factors we believe will affect 2016 earnings from operations. Our objective is to earn the authorized return on rate base for the enterprise as a whole, plus the net impact of the factors listed here. Many of these probably look familiar to you from 2015, so I'll cover them briefly. 
In terms of the Gas Transmission rate case, the first bullet highlights a key assumption underlying our guidance, which is that we will receive a reasonable outcome in the case this year. The second bullet is a reminder that we haven't sought cost recovery for certain corrosion control and strength testing work in the Gas Transmission rate case. We previously indicated these operating expenses should average a total of roughly $50 million annually over the 3-year rate case period, although the amount may vary year to year. Next is the tax benefits associated with a repair reduction. The net impact of this continues to be roughly $0.25 per share in 2016. The last item is incentive revenues for things like our customer energy efficiency programs. Finally, we continue to expect earnings on construction work in progress to be roughly offset by our below-the-line cost, which include advertising, charitable contributions, some environmental costs and other items. 
One more point before I move to the next slide. Since we do not yet have a proposed decision in the Gas Transmission rate case, we do not expect a final to decision until at least the second quarter. So while the timing should not affect our annual earnings from operations in 2016, it will continue to have an impact on our cash flows and quarterly results as you saw last year. In 2015, that impact was roughly $0.60. 
Now turning to Slide 9. The guidance for the items impacting comparability is $565 million to $665 million pretax. You can see that most of these categories are consistent with last year: pipeline-related expenses, legal and regulatory-related expenses, and fines and penalties. We will also have a new positive category relating to the 2015 portion of revenues from the Gas Transmission rate case. We expect a final decision in the case this year with revenues retroactive to January 2015. This will be booking 2 years' worth of revenues in 2016. We'll pull out the 2015 portion as an item impacting comparability once we get that final decision. 
The estimated range for pipeline-related expenses is $100 million to $150 million pretax. This component relates to clearing our pipeline rights-of-way. We are entering the fourth year of that program, which we've estimated will not exceed $500 million from its start in 2013 through its planned completion in 2017. 
The second component is legal and regulatory-related expenses, which we estimate to be between $25 million and $75 million pretax for the year. This component represents costs incurred in connection with enforcement, regulatory and litigation activities regarding natural gas matters and regulatory communications. 
The third component is potential fines and penalties, again, related to natural gas matters for regulatory communications. As you can see in the table at the bottom of the page, our 2016 guidance of $440 million pretax for fines and penalties, reflects our estimate of the remaining portion of the $850 million of safety-related spending that the commission disallowed as part of the San Bruno penalty decision last year. This range does not included any other potential fines or penalties. And last, we have the new positive item for 2015 gas transmission revenues, which will update after we receive a decision on that case. 
Turning to Slide 10. We assume equity issuance of $600 million to $800 million in 2016. That compares to equity issuance last year of right about $800 million. The 2016 range reflects a number of assumptions, including the timing and amount of revenues we will receive in the Gas Transmission rate case. 
Moving to Slides 11 and 12. We're providing updated CapEx and rate base ranges through 2019. First, on Slide 11. As I mentioned earlier, we're estimating about $5.6 billion in CapEx in 2016. This is a little higher than the $5.4 billion we spent in 2015. As you'll recall, we had to defer some of our planned work last year due to wildfire response. For 2017 through 2019, the $6.5 billion high end of the range is the same as you saw last quarter. As a reminder, the high end reflects the full request in our pending rate cases, which are the 2017 through 2019 General Rate Case, the 2015 through 2017 Gas Transmission rate case and the electric transmission TO '17 rate case. And for the outer years of the gas and electric transmission rate cases where we have not yet filed a request, we've kept the high end of the range flat with our current request. At the low end of the range, we simply assume that capital expenditures through 2019 stay flat with 2015 spending of $5.4 billion. 
Slide 12 shows our estimated rate base levels from 2016 through 2019. Next week, we will formally update our 2017 General Rate Case forecast to reflect the impact of the recent 5-year extension of bonus depreciation. The ranges shown here incorporate that update. Before I go into the numbers, I want to briefly discuss the impact of bonus depreciation on rate base and earnings per share. 
While bonus depreciation results in higher deferred taxes, which lowers rate base, it also reduces our equity needs. So while bonus depreciation has a noticeable impact on rate base, it has a small impact on earnings per share because of the lower equity needs. In 2016, bonus depreciation will not impact rate base because we are already in a net operating loss position through the end of the year. In fact, we now expect to be in an NOL at the enterprise level through 2019. However, we are also required to perform separate NOL calculations for each of our rate cases. As you know, we've had significant unrecovered costs in our gas transmission business, which has contributed to the enterprise-level NOL. But when we look at the lines of business covered by our General Rate Case, which are our electric and gas distribution and electric generation businesses, we do not expect to be in an NOL position beyond 2016. As a result, bonus depreciation will impact our rate base request in the GRC beginning in 2017. The cumulative impact of bonus depreciation in 2019 is a rate base reduction of approximately $1 billion at the low end of the range and about $1.5 billion at the high end of the range compared to the guidance we provided in Q3. There is a smaller impact in 2017 and 2018. The majority of that relates to the 2017 through 2019 General Rate Case. A smaller amount of that reduction relates to the electric transmission assets, which are covered by our FERC Transmission Owner rate case. The result is rate base grows at a compound annual growth rate of 5% to 7% from 2017 through 2019. And again, because bonus depreciation also reduces our equity needs, that mitigates the impact on future earnings per share. 
To help you with this, we're providing a simple rule of thumb to estimate the net impact on earnings per share from both the reduction in authorized rate base and the lower equity needs. On the margin, a $500 million reduction in authorized rate base equates to roughly $0.02 in earnings per share. 
One last note on CapEx and rate base before I open it up for questions. Remember that the high end of our CapEx range reflects only our currently filed rate cases, so there is some potential upside as we file future rate cases. 
Let me close by saying that I'm happy to be in a CFO role and I look forward to working with all of you. This is an exciting time for PG&E as we continue to see strong growth, driven by California's policies and our focus on enhancing safety and reliability. 
With that, let's open up the lines for questions."

So we're trying to figure that out. And then, the third thing on timing is, obviously, we still have a lot of things going on, and we want to make sure that we don't make the change at a time that would not be appropriate, given all the things that are going on.

And over the 4.5 years I've been here, the focus has been on really focusing on back to basics, getting the company running well, getting through the regulatory proceedings, things we talked about on this call. We do think that there are opportunities. I will tell you, the affiliate rules here in California make that very difficult. In many states, you can have your experts in various areas, spend part of their time looking outside the utilities and divvy up their time to make sure that they're being -- that their time is being charged at the right place. Whereas at California, it's very difficult to use the expertise you've developed in utility to work on things outside the utility. So you have to have a big enough opportunity to say, ""All right, I'm going to bite the bullet, set up a whole separate organization to pursue these things."" But that said, I don't think a week goes by where one of us on the team doesn't have somebody coming in and having some ideas about how technology can improve this business. We actually look at them. Can we incorporate them within the utility structure and be successful and help us there? Wouldn't help the bottom line, necessarily, but it might lower our cost to our customers, which, in the long run, I think is a very positive thing. So we are looking at those opportunities, because we really to believe that we are as far, if not farther along, then most other utility in incorporating some of these technologies into the grid. I mean, as I said, we've crossed over 30% on renewables now and as for the 33% requirement by 2020, so we're way ahead of the curve. Going to 50% renewables, we are confident that we can manage 50% renewable. Many of our colleagues in the industry are struggling with, how do you handle 10% or 15% renewables on your system? So we've put in place the mechanisms and the technology to do it."

Thanks for joining us today. 2015 was a really strong year for us, both operationally and financially.

2015 was a really strong year for us, both operationally and financially. We continue to improve the safety and reliability of our gas and electric systems while delivering really solid financial results. Our earnings from operations in 2015 were $3.12 a share, which is slightly ahead of our guidance range. So I'm going to spend a few minutes reviewing the operational and regulatory progress we made, and then I'm going to turn it over to Jason Wells to review our financial results in more detail. 
We continue to believe that focusing on 3 key areas: positioning the company for a clean energy economy; delivering on customer expectations; and addressing outstanding issues, will provide the foundation for operational and financial success. So let me start with how we're positioning the company for a clean energy economy. 
PG&E continues to be a recognized leader in supporting the nation's goals around clean energy. In December, several PG&E team members and I joined Governor Brown for the global climate summit in Paris. We participated in a number of events and panels where we shared the actions PG&E and California are taking to reduce carbon emissions, advance clean energy technologies and spur economic growth. We were very proud to represent the California utility perspective at such a significant global forum. 
In 2015, nearly 30% of PG&E's electric deliveries came from qualifying renewable resources. And even more meaningfully, nearly 60% of the energy that we delivered was carbon free. We know that as our energy mix continues to evolve, so do the needs of our electric grid. To deliver on California's low carbon future, we need to continue investing in a smarter, more resilient grid, and we need to ensure that rate structures are keeping up with these changes. Although we didn't make as much progress on rate reform last year as we would have liked, the commission has started to address the issue through flattening our residential tiers and moving towards mandatory time-of-use rates. And they've committed to review the rate structure again in 2019. We look forward to continuing to work with all the parties to develop the appropriate rate structure to meet our customers' changing needs. 
Turning to customer expectations. On the electric side of the business, last year, we delivered a seventh straight year of improved electric reliability. Our outage duration and frequency are now in the second quartile for the industry. We also delivered first-quartile performance in both our 911 emergency response and our wire down metrics. 
On the gas side of the business, we delivered top-decile emergency response performance and broke ground on a new state-of-the-art gas training facility, which we expect to open in 2017. We were also the first company in the United States to be certified in meeting the American Petroleum Institute's Recommended Practice 1173, which is a new standard related to pipeline safety and safety culture. We now have 3 external certifications recognizing the quality of our gas asset management and safety culture programs. 
We also continue to make progress towards resolving our outstanding issues. I'm pleased to report that we've closed out another one of the NTSB's recommendations by installing more than 200 automated and remote shut-off valves across our gas transmission system, and we're well on the way to completing the final recommendation to strength test nearly 1,000 miles of transmission pipe. In an important step forward, the commission has officially closed out the San Bruno investigation. We've also completed hearings in the gas distribution record-keeping investigation and we look forward to resolution of that case this year. 
In the criminal proceeding, we received some positive rulings from the court late past year that narrowed the scope of the case. Most significantly, the court dismissed the government's Alternative Fines Act claim based on alleged losses. The court is still considering whether to allow the government to proceed with an Alternative Fines Act claim based on alleged gains. That determination will be made after the first phase of the trial, where the government will have to prove that PG&E employees knowingly and willfully violated the law. We continue to believe that the evidence just does not support the charges. 
So to sum up. We had a really strong year in 2015 and we're committed to making additional progress in 2016. Before I turn it over to Jason, I want to reconfirm that we expect to address the dividend in 2016. I'm committed to doing that this year, although I don't have any specifics on timing for you yet. 
I'm excited to continue to work with Jason in his new role as CFO. He's been working closely with our finance and operational teams for a number of years, so he knows the company extremely well. And he provides a wealth of experience and will be instrumental in helping us move forward. 
So Jason, welcome, and let me hand it over to you to discuss our financials."

I've enjoyed meeting many of you already, and I look forward to meeting more of you this spring. I'll begin my remarks today by going through our Q4 and full year 2015 results, and then I'll provide some insights regarding our 2016 outlook.
Slide 5 shows our 2015 results for Q4 and the full year. We had solid results in 2015, coming in slightly above our guidance range for the year, due to some smaller positive miscellaneous items. Earnings from operations came in at $0.50 for the quarter and $3.12 for the year. GAAP earnings, including the items impacting comparability, are also shown here. All items impacting comparability came in within our guidance ranges. 
Pipeline-related expenses came in at $39 million pretax for the quarter and $103 million pretax for the year. Our legal and regulatory-related expenses were $14 million pretax for the quarter and $58 million pretax for the year. 
Fines and penalties were $137 million pretax for the quarter and $907 million pretax for the year. The Q4 amount represents our estimate of the disallowed capital work coming out of the final San Bruno penalty decision, which we are accruing as we complete that work. 
Finally, our annual results show insurance recoveries of $49 million, pretax. As we mentioned last quarter, we have now resolved all insurance claims related to San Bruno, recovering a total of $515 million. 
Slide 6 shows our quarter-over-quarter comparison from earnings from operations of $0.53 in Q4 last year and $0.50 in Q4 this year. You've seen most of these drivers in previous quarters, so I'll cover them briefly. 
The biggest item, a decrease of $0.10, is associated with lower cost recovery in 2015 because we did not receive a decision on the Gas Transmission rate case during the year. So we incurred those expenses, but did not collect the associated revenues. 
Next, the nuclear refueling outage in the fourth quarter drove a $0.05 decrease over the same period last year. There was a $0.01 for regulatory and legal matters and $0.02 negative resulting from additional shares quarter-over-quarter. These negative drivers were partially offset by 3 positive items. First, we have $0.05 of growth in rate-based earnings. Second, timing of taxes was also a small positive for the quarter, and for the full year, as we've said, this item nets to zero. And finally, we had $0.09 of smaller miscellaneous items. For the full year, this line netted to $0.02 positive. More detail around the annual results is available on the appendix of today's slide deck. 
Moving to Slide 7. Today, we're introducing guidance for 2016 earnings from operations of $3.65 to $3.85 per share. We're also providing ranges for items impacting comparability, which I'll come back to in a minute. 
First, I want to cover the assumptions we had in the guidance on Slide 8. Starting in the upper left corner, you'll see we are assuming capital expenditures of roughly $5.6 billion this year. A breakdown by line of business is also included. Importantly, the gas transmission line assumes a range of $500 million to $700 million for the year, and as you know, we're still waiting on a proposed decision on that rate case. This range includes about $300 million of safety-related capital expenditures that we estimate will be disallowed as part of the CPUC's penalty decision last year. 
In the upper right of the slide, you'll see that our estimate of weighted average authorized rate base is about $32.6 billion for the year. Both the CapEx and rate base assumptions are consistent with ranges we previously provided. 
In the lower left, you'll see that we continue to assume a CPUC-authorized equity ratio of 52% and a return on equity of 10.4%, which we now have certainty on through 2017. Finally, at the bottom right, we list some other factors we believe will affect 2016 earnings from operations. Our objective is to earn the authorized return on rate base for the enterprise as a whole, plus the net impact of the factors listed here. Many of these probably look familiar to you from 2015, so I'll cover them briefly. 
In terms of the Gas Transmission rate case, the first bullet highlights a key assumption underlying our guidance, which is that we will receive a reasonable outcome in the case this year. The second bullet is a reminder that we haven't sought cost recovery for certain corrosion control and strength testing work in the Gas Transmission rate case. We previously indicated these operating expenses should average a total of roughly $50 million annually over the 3-year rate case period, although the amount may vary year to year. Next is the tax benefits associated with a repairs reduction. The net impact of this continues to be roughly $0.25 per share in 2016. The last item is incentive revenues for things like our customer energy efficiency programs. Finally, we continue to expect earnings on construction work in progress to be roughly offset by our below-the-line cost, which include advertising, charitable contributions, some environmental costs and other items. 
One more point before I move to the next slide. Since we do not yet have a proposed decision in the Gas Transmission rate case, we do not expect a final to decision until at least the second quarter. So while the timing should not affect our annual earnings from operations in 2016, it will continue to have an impact on our cash flows and quarterly results as you saw last year. In 2015, that impact was roughly $0.60. 
Now turning to Slide 9. The guidance for the items impacting comparability is $565 million to $665 million pretax. You can see that most of these categories are consistent with last year: pipeline-related expenses, legal and regulatory-related expenses, and fines and penalties. We will also have a new positive category relating to the 2015 portion of revenues from the Gas Transmission rate case. We expect a final decision in the case this year with revenues retroactive to January 2015. This will be booking 2 years' worth of revenues in 2016. We'll pull out the 2015 portion as an item impacting comparability once we get that final decision. 
The estimated range for pipeline-related expenses is $100 million to $150 million pretax. This component relates to clearing our pipeline rights-of-way. We are entering the fourth year of that program, which we've estimated will not exceed $500 million from its start in 2013 through its planned completion in 2017. 
The second component is legal and regulatory-related expenses, which we estimate to be between $25 million and $75 million pretax for the year. This component represents costs incurred in connection with enforcement, regulatory and litigation activities regarding natural gas matters and regulatory communications. 
The third component is potential fines and penalties, again, related to natural gas matters or regulatory communications. As you can see in the table at the bottom of the page, our 2016 guidance of $440 million pretax for fines and penalties, reflects our estimate of the remaining portion of the $850 million of safety-related spending that the commission disallowed as part of the San Bruno penalty decision last year. This range does not included any other potential fines or penalties. And last, we have the new positive item for 2015 gas transmission revenues, which will update after we receive a decision on that case. 
Turning to Slide 10. We assume equity issuance of $600 million to $800 million in 2016. That compares to equity issuance last year of right about $800 million. The 2016 range reflects a number of assumptions, including the timing and amount of revenues we will receive in the Gas Transmission rate case. 
Moving to Slides 11 and 12. We're providing updated CapEx and rate base ranges through 2019. First, on Slide 11. As I mentioned earlier, we're estimating about $5.6 billion in CapEx in 2016. This is a little higher than the $5.4 billion we spent in 2015. As you'll recall, we had to defer some of our planned work last year due to wildfire response. For 2017 through 2019, the $6.5 billion high end of the range is the same as you saw last quarter. As a reminder, the high end reflects the full request in our pending rate cases, which are the 2017 through 2019 General Rate Case, the 2015 through 2017 Gas Transmission rate case and the electric transmission TO '17 rate case. And for the outer years of the gas and electric transmission rate cases where we have not yet filed a request, we've kept the high end of the range flat with our current request. At the low end of the range, we simply assume that capital expenditures through 2019 stay flat with 2015 spending of $5.4 billion. 
Slide 12 shows our estimated rate base levels from 2016 through 2019. Next week, we will formally update our 2017 General Rate Case forecast to reflect the impact of the recent 5-year extension of bonus depreciation. The ranges shown here incorporate that update. Before I go into the numbers, I want to briefly discuss the impact of bonus depreciation on rate base and earnings per share. 
While bonus depreciation results in higher deferred taxes, which lowers rate base, it also reduces our equity needs. So while bonus depreciation has a noticeable impact on rate base, it has a small impact on earnings per share because of the lower equity needs. In 2016, bonus depreciation will not impact rate base because we are already in a net operating loss position through the end of the year. In fact, we now expect to be in an NOL at the enterprise level through 2019. However, we are also required to perform separate NOL calculations for each of our rate cases. As you know, we've had significant unrecovered costs in our gas transmission business, which has contributed to the enterprise-level NOL. But when we look at the lines of business covered by our General Rate Case, which are our electric and gas distribution and electric generation businesses, we do not expect to be in an NOL position beyond 2016. As a result, bonus depreciation will impact our rate base request in the GRC beginning in 2017. The cumulative impact of bonus depreciation in 2019 is a rate base reduction of approximately $1 billion at the low end of the range and about $1.5 billion at the high end of the range compared to the guidance we provided in Q3. There is a smaller impact in 2017 and 2018. The majority of that relates to the 2017 through 2019 General Rate Case. A smaller amount of that reduction relates to the electric transmission assets, which are covered by our FERC Transmission Owner rate case. The result is rate base grows at a compound annual growth rate of 5% to 7% from 2017 through 2019. And again, because bonus depreciation also reduces our equity needs, that mitigates the impact on future earnings per share. 
To help you with this, we're providing a simple rule of thumb to estimate the net impact on earnings per share from both the reduction in authorized rate base and the lower equity needs. On the margin, a $500 million reduction in authorized rate base equates to roughly $0.02 in earnings per share. 
One last note on CapEx and rate base before I open it up for questions. Remember that the high end of our CapEx range reflects only our currently filed rate cases, so there is some potential upside as we file future rate cases. 
Let me close by saying that I'm happy to be in a CFO role and I look forward to working with all of you. This is an exciting time for PG&E as we continue to see strong growth, driven by California's policies and our focus on enhancing safety and reliability. 
With that, let's open up the lines for questions."

And over the 4.5 years I've been here, the focus has been on really focusing on back to basics, getting the company running well, getting through the regulatory proceedings, things we talked about on this call. We do think that there are opportunities. I will tell you, the affiliate rules here in California make that very difficult. In many states, you can have your experts in various areas, spend part of their time looking outside the utilities and divvy up their time to make sure that they're being -- that their time is being charged to the right place. Whereas at California, it's very difficult to use the expertise you've developed in utility to work on things outside the utility. So you have to have a big enough opportunity to say, ""All right, I'm going to bite the bullet, set up a whole separate organization to pursue these things."" But that said, I don't think a week goes by where one of us on the team doesn't have somebody coming in and having some ideas about how technology can improve this business. We actually look at them. Can we incorporate them within the utility structure and be successful and help us there? It wouldn't help the bottom line, necessarily, but it might lower our cost to our customers, which, in the long run, I think is a very positive thing. So we are looking at those opportunities, because we really to believe that we are as far, if not farther along, then most other utility in incorporating some of these technologies into the grid. I mean, as I said, we've crossed over 30% on renewables now and that with a the 33% requirement by 2020, so we're way ahead of the curve. Going to 50% renewables, we are confident that we can manage 50% renewable. Many of our colleagues in the industry are struggling with, how do you handle 10% or 15% renewables on your system?

I've got some opening remarks and then I'll turn it over to Jason to review our financial results for the quarter. 
We continue to believe that the 3 key focus areas shown on the Slide 3 are the foundation for long-term operational and financial success. I'll also cover some of our near-term challenges later in my remarks, but I do want to touch on some of the fundamental drivers of growth first. So let me start with an update on how we're positioning ourselves for a clean energy economy and the growth that it will make possible. 
As you know California has some of the most ambitious greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals in the country and we're helping to stay to achieve those goals. First, as we plan for a 50% renewable portfolio standard, we're building additional flexibility into our contracts effectively respond to changing market conditions. We've also begun our second round of energy storage solicitations targeting nearly 600 megawatts of storage by 2024 to help manage intermittency of renewables. 
In March, we reached a settlement with many of the parties engage in our electric vehicle charging infrastructure proposal, which is critical to enable the levels of PV adoptions state is targeting over the next decade. We're hopeful the commission will approve this settlement later this summer. 
And finally, as the uses of our energy grid now grow and evolve, we continue to invest in new technologies and equipment to enable distributed energy resources and more actively engage with other stakeholders to shape future policies. 
Turning to customer expectations. Our recent J.D. Power survey results show that we made significant progress with our gas and electric business customers, with the largest year-over-year increase in customer satisfaction in almost a decade. These results reflect concerted efforts to improve the customer experience through ongoing safety and reliability investments. 
The El Niño storms this winter were good news and bad news. On the positive side, given all the of precipitation we've had, we expect Hydro production this year to be closer to normal compared with just 50% of normal last year. However, the increase storms also negatively impacted our electric reliability during the quarter. Nevertheless, we continue to show very strong emergency response performance on both the gas and electric sides of the business. And our teams are working to get our reliability back on track for the remainder of the year. We also continue to focus on reducing the number of third-party dig-ins on our gas lines. As you know, third-party dig-ins pose a significant public safety risk and are completely preventable through the free 811 call before you dig service. The significant steps we've taken to raise public awareness on this issue were recently recognized by the Common Ground Alliance and our efforts have resulted in industry-leading performance. 
In April, we announced that PG&E entered into an agreement with TransCanyon LLC, a joint venture between subsidiaries of Berkshire Hathaway Energy and Pinnacle West. the agreement with TransCanyon allows us to jointly pursue competitive electric transmission projects throughout the California ISO footprint. We look forward to leveraging our collective experience and resources to explore future opportunities. 
Last week, we had a development in the Butte fire when [indiscernible] fire issued its investigation reports. The [indiscernible] report concluded that the fire was caused by a tree, into contact with one of our alliance consistent with what had been reported in the press earlier. First, let me say that our thoughts and prayers continue to be with the victims and communities who suffered losses as a result of that fire and all of the devastating fires across California last summer. We also want to thank Cal fire and other first responders including our own for their heroic efforts in responding to all those fires. 
We continue to believe that we have one of the best vegetation management programs in the industry and disagree with the report's conclusion that our practices fell short. To give you a sense of that magnitude of our program, every year, our certified arborist and registered professional foresters monitor nearly 50 million trees across our service territory and remove more than 1 million trees each year. 
We use some of the most sophisticated technology that I have seen in my career for this program. Jason will review the financial impact of the Butte fire in just a minute. And finally, I want to provide a few regulatory and legal updates. I'll start with the 2015 gas transmission and storage rate case, which I know is top of mine for many of us. Although we had hoped to receive a proposed decision in the first quarter of this year, we are still waiting for that to be issued. As Jason will discuss, our quarterly financial results will continue to be impacted until we receive a final decision. 
In the 2017 General Rate Case, we are really gratified to receive a report from the safety enforcement division recognizing our risk management practices as industry-leading. The SED report found that PG&E's risk assessment approach provides greater transparency and successfully maps risk outcomes to requested expenditures meeting the commission's goal of moving safety to a fundamental consideration in the case. 
The SED report also acknowledged that the value of the third-party certifications -- they have acknowledged the value of the third-party certifications we received in our gas asset management programs. 
In April, we also received testimony from the other parties in the case which recommended reductions to our requests. Obviously, we disagree with those proposed reductions and we'll be filing our response later this month. 
In the gas distribution record keeping investigation, we receive penalty recommendations from both the safety and enforcement division and the city of Carmel. Fundamentally, we do not believe that any of the penalties are warranted in the case, however, our response noted that if the CPUC decides to issue a penalty, we believe it should not exceed $33.6 million and should be applied to its future spending rather than taking the form of a fine. 
At this point, the record is complete and we are awaiting a decision from the commission. I also want to provide a brief update on the criminal case. We continue to believe that the changes do not -- the charges do not have any merit. While we have acknowledged that we've made mistakes in the past, we simply haven't seen any evidence to indicate that PG&E employees knowingly and willfully violated the law. We're anxious to get the case on the way but just 2 weeks before the trial was scheduled to begin, the government finally provided us with more than 100,000 pages of documents that we've been requesting for more than a year. To ensure we could thoroughly review all of these material, we are compelled to ask the court for a delay. We're scheduled to go back before the court tomorrow to provide an update on our review of the documents and we hope to get a reasonable new trial date at that time. 
There are some things up. While we continue to work through some of the outstanding regulatory and legal issues, we are well positioned for growth as we support California's clean energy future. 
So with that, I'll hand it over to Jason to review the financials."
139813,330035349,972232,"PG&E Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 04, 2016",2016-05-04,"Earnings Calls","PG&E Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Tony, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin by covering the first quarter results and then quickly review the 2016 outlook. Slide 5 shows our results for the first quarter. Earnings from operations came in at $0.82. GAAP earnings including t",930,"Thank you, Tony, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin by covering the first quarter results and then quickly review the 2016 outlook. 
Slide 5 shows our results for the first quarter. Earnings from operations came in at $0.82. GAAP earnings including the items impacting comparability were also shown here. The pretext number is for the items impacting comparability at the bottom of the page. Pipeline-related expenses came in at $22 million pretax in Q1. Our legal and regulatory-related expenses were $17 million pretax for the quarter, and fines and penalties were $87 million pretax. As a reminder, this amount represents our estimate of the disallowed capital work out of the final San Bruno penalty decision which we are accruing as we complete the work. 
Our results for the first quarter including new items impacting comparability for cost related to the Butte fire. Based on the Cal fire report, we've taken in charge for $381 million pretax for the first quarter. As background, California has a theory of inverse condemnation, under which utilities may be reliable for property damages without finding negligence when a powerline is involved in a fire. The charge was taken includes $350 million to reflect the low end of a range for property damage and an additional $31 million for other costs related to the fire. 
At this point, we are not able to estimate the upper end of the range. We do carry reliability insurance for claims like this, so we would expect to be able to recover a significant portion of those costs through insurance in the future. And we would show of the interim recoveries as an offsetting positive item impacting comparability in the future periods as they are recorded. 
Finally, it is important to note that the $381 million does not include an accrual for any fire suppression or personal injury images. Both of which would require a show in negligence. 
Slide 6 shows the quarter-over-quarter comparison from earnings from operations of $0.87 in Q1 of last year and $0.82 in Q1 of this year. The largest item relates to the timing of taxes during the quarter, which was $0.08 negative. GAAP accounting requires us to smooth the impact of taxes across the quarters even as income fluctuates. This is purely a timing item that would reverse by year-end. In the first quarter of 2015, we completed our disposition of the SolarCity shares. We did not have that item this quarter resulting in $0.03 negative. 
In issuing additional shares also resulted in $0.03 negative. These negative drivers were partially offset by growth in rate base earnings, which was $0.05 positive for the quarter. This item reflects assets covered by our General Rate Case and our electric transmission PR rate case. It does not include the gas transmission rate case since we do not yet have a decision. 
At this point, we would not expect a final decision on the first phase of the case until at least midyear. So while timing should not affect our annual earnings from operations in 2016, it will continue to have an impact on our cash flows and quarterly results as you saw last year. 
And finally, we have $0.04 [ph] of smaller positive miscellaneous items that impacted the quarter. Today, we are reaffirming our guidance for earnings from operations of $3.65 to $3.85 per share and that is shown on Slide 7. 
The underlying assumptions for earnings from operations remain the same as what we provided last quarter, so I'll just quickly cover the highlights. On Slide 8, we continue to assume capital expenditures of roughly $5.6 billion and a weighted average authorized rate base of about $32.6 billion for the year. 
On the bottom right, I want to reiterate a key assumption to our guidance which is that we receive a reasonable outcome in the Gas Transmission rate case this year. 
Turning to Slide 9. The guidance for the items impacting comparability has been updated to include the Butte fire-related costs. The other items impacting comparability are unchanged from last quarter. 
Our guidance for the year for the Butte fire-related cost reflects the Q1 charge of $381 million, which is the low end of the range for property damages, plus some other fire-related costs. As I mentioned, we are not able to estimate the high end of the range at this time. As shown at the bottom of the slides, the current range for items impacting comparability in 2016 is right about $1 billion. 
And as a reminder, this range excludes any potential future fines or penalties beyond our estimates of the disallowed capital and expense costs associated with the San Bruno penalty. 
On Slide 10, we continue to assume equity issuance of $600 million to $800 million in 2016. During the first quarter, we issued about $150 million in equity through our internal and integral programs. As a reminder, the range reflects a number of assumptions including the timing and amount of revenues we received in the Gas Transmission rate case. The charge for the Butte fire results in roughly $100 million in new equity needs this year, which puts us towards the high end of our range. 
And finally on Slide 11 and 12, we are reaffirming the CapEx and rate base ranges through 2019. So to conclude, we continue to have a strong growth profile supported by California's long-term policy objectives. We are confident on our ability to exit on our operational plans as we continue to work throughout outstanding regulatory and legal issues. 
With that, let's open up the lines for questions."

The first question was about our prior experience with fires and yes, we have had fires in the past. And for example, in 2013, we settled 2 fires, 2004 power fire and 2008 whiskey fire and it cost us $50.5 million to settle that -- those fire cases. In 2012, we spent approximately $30 million, settling the 2004 spreads and Sims fires. And 2009, we spent approximately $50 million to settle the 1999 fires. So those are the recent experience with fire cases. And yes, a question I think about inverse condemnation and basically, inverse condemnation is a doctrine that is based on the California Constitution. It's based on the takings clause of the California Constitution. And court said basically held that inverse condemnation may be found when 3 elements are satisfied. First, there has to be injury to private property. And second, the property damage was substantially cost. So there has to be substantial cost optimization and it does not matter whether there's fault or not. And thirdly, the damage had to be caused by a public improvement operating as deliberately designed constructed or maintained. So that's the language from the case law. And inverse condemnation has been applied to utility fire cases, where fires were caused by power lines. And court cases have basically describe the underlying purpose of the thumbprints is in getting to distribute throughout the community any loss inflicted upon an individual property owner by public improvement. And inverse condemnation allows recovery for property damage, prejudgment interest and attorneys fees."

I've got some opening remarks, and then I'll turn it over to Jason to review our financial results for the quarter. 
We continue to believe that the 3 key focus areas shown on the Slide 3 are the foundation for long-term operational and financial success. I'll also cover some of our near-term challenges later in my remarks, but I do want to touch on some of the fundamental drivers of growth first. So let me start with an update on how we're positioning ourselves for a clean energy economy and the growth that it will make possible. 
As you know, California has some of the most ambitious greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals in the country, and we're helping the state to achieve those goals. First, as we plan for a 50% renewable portfolio standard, we're building additional flexibility into our contracts to effectively respond to changing market conditions. We've also begun our second round of energy storage solicitations, targeting nearly 600 megawatts of storage by 2024 to help manage the intermittency of renewables. In March, we reached a settlement with many of the parties engaged in our electric vehicle charging infrastructure proposal, which is critical to enable the levels of PV adoption the state is targeting over the next decade. We're hopeful the commission will approve this settlement later this summer. 
And finally, as the uses of our energy grid now grow and evolve, we continue to invest in new technologies and equipment to enable distributed energy resources and more actively engage with other stakeholders to shape future policies. 
Turning to customer expectations. Our recent J.D. Power survey results show that we've made significant progress with our gas and electric business customers, with the largest year-over-year increase in customer satisfaction in almost a decade. These results reflect concerted efforts to improve the customer experience through ongoing safety and reliability investments. 
The El Niño storms this winter were good news and bad news. On the positive side, given all the of precipitation we've had, we expect hydro production this year to be closer to normal compared with just 50% of normal last year. However, the increased storms also negatively impacted our electric reliability during the quarter. Nevertheless, we continue to show very strong emergency response performance on both the gas and electric sides of the business, and our teams are working to get our reliability back on track for the remainder of the year. We also continue to focus on reducing the number of third-party dig-ins on our gas lines. As you know, third-party dig-ins pose a significant public safety risk and are completely preventable through the free 811 Call Before You Dig service. The significant steps we've taken to raise public awareness on this issue were recently recognized by the Common Ground Alliance, and our efforts have resulted in industry-leading performance. 
In April, we announced that PG&E entered into an agreement with TransCanyon LLC, a joint venture between subsidiaries of Berkshire Hathaway Energy and Pinnacle West. The agreement with TransCanyon allows us to jointly pursue competitive electric transmission projects throughout the California ISO footprint. We look forward to leveraging our collective experience and resources to explore future opportunities. 
Last week, we had a development in the Butte Fire when CAL FIRE issued its investigation reports. The CAL FIRE report concluded that the fire was caused by a tree coming into contact with one of our line, consistent with what had been reported in the press earlier. First, let me say that our thoughts and prayers continue to be with the victims and communities who suffered losses as a result of that fire and all of the devastating fires across California last summer. We also want to thank CAL FIRE and other first responders, including our own, for their heroic efforts in responding to all of those fires. 
We continue to believe that we have one of the best vegetation management programs in the industry and disagree with the report's conclusion that our practices fell short. To give you a sense of the magnitude of our program, every year, our certified arborist and registered professional foresters monitor nearly 50 million trees across our service territory and remove more than 1 million trees each year. We use some of the most sophisticated technology that I've seen in my career for this program. Jason will review the financial impact of the Butte Fire in just a minute. 
And finally, I want to provide a few regulatory and legal updates. I'll start with the 2015 Gas Transmission & Storage rate case, which I know is top of mind for many of us. Although we had hoped to receive a proposed decision in the first quarter of this year, we are still waiting for that to be issued. As Jason will discuss, our quarterly financial results will continue to be impacted until we receive a final decision. 
In the 2017 General Rate Case, we are really gratified to receive a report from the Safety and Enforcement Division, recognizing our risk management practices as industry-leading. The SED report found that PG&E's risk assessment approach provides greater transparency and successfully maps risk outcomes to requested expenditures, meeting the commission's goal of moving safety to a fundamental consideration in the case. The SED report also acknowledged that the value of the third-party certifications -- they have acknowledged the value of the third-party certifications we received in our gas asset management programs. 
In April, we also received testimony from the other parties in the case, which recommended reductions to our request. Obviously, we disagree with those proposed reductions, and we'll be filing our response later this month. 
In the gas distribution recordkeeping investigation, we received penalty recommendations from both the Safety and Enforcement Division and the City of Carmel. Fundamentally, we do not believe that any of the penalties are warranted in the case. However, our response noted that if the CPUC decides to issue a penalty, we believe it should not exceed $33.6 million and should be applied towards future spending rather than taking the form of a fine. At this point, the record is complete, and we're awaiting a decision from the commission. 
I also want to provide a brief update on the criminal case. We continue to believe that the changes do not -- the charges do not have any merit. While we have acknowledged that we've made mistakes in the past, we simply haven't seen any evidence to indicate that PG&E employees knowingly and willfully violated the law. We're anxious to get the case underway. But just 2 weeks before the trial was scheduled to begin, the government finally provided us with more than 100,000 pages of documents that we'd been requesting for more than a year. To ensure we could thoroughly review all of this material, we were compelled to ask the court for a delay. We're scheduled to go back before the court tomorrow to provide an update on our review of the documents, and we hope to get a reasonable new trial date at that time. 
So to sum things up. While we continue to work through some of the outstanding regulatory and legal issues, we are well positioned for growth as we support California's clean energy future. 
So with that, I'll hand it over to Jason to review the financials."
139813,330035349,972584,"PG&E Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 04, 2016",2016-05-04,"Earnings Calls","PG&E Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Tony, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin by covering the first quarter results, and then quickly review the 2016 outlook. Slide 5 shows our results for the first quarter. Earnings from operations came in at $0.82. GAAP earnings, including",931,"Thank you, Tony, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin by covering the first quarter results, and then quickly review the 2016 outlook. 
Slide 5 shows our results for the first quarter. Earnings from operations came in at $0.82. GAAP earnings, including the items impacting comparability, are also shown here. The pretax numbers for the items impacting comparability are at the bottom of the page. Pipeline-related expenses came in at $22 million pretax in Q1. Our legal and regulatory-related expenses were $17 million pretax for the quarter, and fines and penalties were $87 million pretax. As a reminder, this amount represents our estimate of the disallowed capital work out coming out of the final San Bruno penalty decision, which we are accruing as we complete the work. 
Our results for the first quarter, including new items impacting comparability, were costs related to the Butte Fire. Based on the CAL FIRE report, we've taken in charge for $381 million pretax for the first quarter. As background, California has a theory of inverse condemnation, under which utilities may be liable for property damages without finding them negligent when a power line is involved in a fire. The charge we've taken includes $350 million to reflect the low end of a range for property damage and an additional $31 million for other costs related to the fire. At this point, we are not able to estimate the upper end of the range. We do carry liability insurance for claims like these, so we would expect to be able to recover a significant portion of those costs through insurance in the future. And we would show the insurance recoveries as an offsetting positive item impacting comparability in the future periods as they are recorded. 
Finally, it is important to note that the $381 million does not include an accrual for any fire suppression or personal injury images, both of which would require a showing of negligence. 
Slide 6 shows the quarter-over-quarter comparison from earnings from operations of $0.87 in Q1 last year and $0.82 in Q1 this year. The largest item relates to the timing of taxes during the quarter, which was $0.08 negative. GAAP accounting requires us to smooth the impact of taxes across the quarters even as income fluctuates. This is purely a timing item that would reverse by year-end. 
In the first quarter of 2015, we completed our disposition of the SolarCity shares. We did not have that item this quarter, resulting in $0.03 negative. And issuing additional shares also resulted in $0.03 negative. These negative drivers were partially offset by growth in rate base earnings, which was $0.05 positive for the quarter. This item reflects assets covered by our General Rate Case and our electric transmission TO rate case. It does not include the Gas Transmission rate case since we do not yet have a decision. 
At this point, we would not expect a final decision on the first phase of the case until at least midyear. So while the timing should not affect our annual earnings from operations in 2016, it will continue to have an impact on our cash flows and quarterly results as you saw last year. 
And finally, we had $0.04 of smaller positive miscellaneous items that impacted the quarter. 
Today, we are reaffirming our guidance for earnings from operations of $3.65 to $3.85 per share, and that is shown on Slide 7. The underlying assumptions for earnings from operations remain the same as what we've provided last quarter, so I'll just quickly cover the highlights. 
On Slide 8, we continue to assume capital expenditures of roughly $5.6 billion and a weighted average authorized rate base of about $32.6 billion for the year. On the bottom right, I want to reiterate a key assumption to our guidance, which is that we receive a reasonable outcome in the Gas Transmission rate case this year. 
Turning to Slide 9. The guidance for the items impacting comparability has been updated to include the Butte Fire-related costs. The other items impacting comparability are unchanged from last quarter. Our guidance for the year for the Butte Fire-related costs reflects the Q1 charge of $381 million, which is the low end of the range for property damages, plus some other fire-related costs. As I mentioned, we are not able to estimate the high end of the range at this time. As shown at the bottom of the slide, the current range for items impacting comparability in 2016 is right about $1 billion. And as a reminder, this range excludes any potential future fines or penalties beyond our estimates of the disallowed capital and expense costs associated with the San Bruno penalty. 
On Slide 10, we continue to assume equity issuance of $600 million to $800 million in 2016. During the first quarter, we issued about $150 million in equity through our internal and dribble programs. As a reminder, the range reflects a number of assumptions, including the timing and amount of revenues we receive in the Gas Transmission rate case. The charge for the Butte Fire results in roughly $100 million in new equity needs this year, which puts us towards the high end of our range. 
And finally on Slides 11 and 12, we are reaffirming the CapEx and rate base ranges through 2019. So to conclude, we continue to have a strong growth profile supported by California's long-term policy objectives. We are confident in our ability to execute on our operational plans as we continue to work through outstanding regulatory and legal issues. 
With that, let's open up the lines for questions."

The first question was about our prior experience with fires. And yes, we have had fires in the past. And for example, in 2013, we settled 2 fires, 2004 Power Fire and 2008 Whiskey Fire, and it cost us $50.5 million to settle that -- those fire cases. In 2012, we spent approximately $30 million settling the 2004 Freds and Sims Fires. And then 2009, we spent approximately $15 million to settle the 1999 Pendola Fire. So those are the recent experience with fire cases. And you asked a question I think about inverse condemnation. And basically, inverse condemnation is a doctrine that is based on the California Constitution. It's based on the takings clause of the California Constitution. And the courts basically held that inverse condemnation may be found when 3 elements are satisfied: First, there has to be injury to private property; and second, the property damage was substantially caused. So there has to be substantial causation, and it does not matter whether there was fault or not; and thirdly, the damage had to be caused by a public improvement operating as deliberately designed, constructed or maintained. So that's the language from the case law. And inverse condemnation has been applied to utility fire cases, where fires were caused by power lines. And court cases have basically described the underlying purpose of this doctrine as intending to distribute throughout the community any loss inflicted upon an individual property owner by public improvement. And inverse condemnation allows recovery for property damage, prejudgment interest and attorneys fees."

We also have a right-of-way program on our -- in the gas transmission business, which will continue through 2017. And as a quick reminder, that was a $500 million program to be completed over 5 years ending in 2017. So that will continue into 2017. And then you'll have to make your assumptions around any additional unrecovered costs. But absent any new items, unrecovered costs should start to decrease in 17 and '18 and be much less of a driver of the ongoing equity needs for the business."

I've got some opening remarks, and then I'll turn it over to Jason to review our financial results for the quarter. 
We continue to believe that the 3 key focus areas shown on the Slide 3 are the foundation for long-term operational and financial success. I'll also cover some of our near-term challenges later in my remarks, but I do want to touch on some of the fundamental drivers of growth first. So let me start with an update on how we're positioning ourselves for a clean energy economy and the growth that it will make possible. 
As you know, California has some of the most ambitious greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals in the country, and we're helping the state to achieve those goals. First, as we plan for a 50% renewable portfolio standard, we're building additional flexibility into our contracts to effectively respond to changing market conditions. We've also begun our second round of energy storage solicitations, targeting nearly 600 megawatts of storage by 2024 to help manage the intermittency of renewables. In March, we reached a settlement with many of the parties engaged in our electric vehicle charging infrastructure proposal, which is critical to enable the levels of PV adoption the state is targeting over the next decade. We're hopeful the commission will approve this settlement later this summer. 
And finally, as the uses of our energy grid now grow and evolve, we continue to invest in new technologies and equipment to enable distributed energy resources and more actively engage with other stakeholders to shape future policies. 
Turning to customer expectations. Our recent J.D. Power survey results show that we've made significant progress with our gas and electric business customers, with the largest year-over-year increase in customer satisfaction in almost a decade. These results reflect concerted efforts to improve the customer experience through ongoing safety and reliability investments. 
 
The El Niño storms this winter were good news and bad news. On the positive side, given all the of precipitation we've had, we expect hydro production this year to be closer to normal compared with just 50% of normal last year. However, the increased storms also negatively impacted our electric reliability during the quarter. Nevertheless, we continue to show very strong emergency response performance on both the gas and electric sides of the business, and our teams are working to get our reliability back on track for the remainder of the year. We also continue to focus on reducing the number of third-party dig-ins on our gas lines. As you know, third-party dig-ins pose a significant public safety risk and are completely preventable through the free 811 Call Before You Dig service. The significant steps we've taken to raise public awareness on this issue were recently recognized by the Common Ground Alliance, and our efforts have resulted in industry-leading performance. 
In April, we announced that PG&E entered into an agreement with TransCanyon LLC, a joint venture between subsidiaries of Berkshire Hathaway Energy and Pinnacle West. The agreement with TransCanyon allows us to jointly pursue competitive electric transmission projects throughout the California ISO footprint. We look forward to leveraging our collective experience and resources to explore future opportunities. 
Last week, we had a development in the Butte Fire when CAL FIRE issued its investigation reports. The CAL FIRE report concluded that the fire was caused by a tree coming into contact with one of our line, consistent with what had been reported in the press earlier. First, let me say that our thoughts and prayers continue to be with the victims and communities who suffered losses as a result of that fire and all of the devastating fires across California last summer. We also want to thank CAL FIRE and other first responders, including our own, for their heroic efforts in responding to all of those fires. 
We continue to believe that we have one of the best vegetation management programs in the industry and disagree with the report's conclusion that our practices fell short. To give you a sense of the magnitude of our program, every year, our certified arborist and registered professional foresters monitor nearly 50 million trees across our service territory and remove more than 1 million trees each year. We use some of the most sophisticated technology that I've seen in my career for this program. Jason will review the financial impact of the Butte Fire in just a minute. 
And finally, I want to provide a few regulatory and legal updates. I'll start with the 2015 Gas Transmission & Storage rate case, which I know is top of mind for many of us. Although we had hoped to receive a proposed decision in the first quarter of this year, we are still waiting for that to be issued. As Jason will discuss, our quarterly financial results will continue to be impacted until we receive a final decision. 
In the 2017 General Rate Case, we are really gratified to receive a report from the Safety and Enforcement Division, recognizing our risk management practices as industry-leading. The SED report found that PG&E's risk assessment approach provides greater transparency and successfully maps risk outcomes to requested expenditures, meeting the commission's goal of moving safety to a fundamental consideration in the case. The SED report also acknowledged that the value of the third-party certifications -- they have acknowledged the value of the third-party certifications we received in our gas asset management programs. 
In April, we also received testimony from the other parties in the case, which recommended reductions to our request. Obviously, we disagree with those proposed reductions, and we'll be filing our response later this month. 
In the gas distribution recordkeeping investigation, we received penalty recommendations from both the Safety and Enforcement Division and the City of Carmel. Fundamentally, we do not believe that any of the penalties are warranted in the case. However, our response noted that if the CPUC decides to issue a penalty, we believe it should not exceed $33.6 million and should be applied towards future spending rather than taking the form of a fine. At this point, the record is complete, and we're awaiting a decision from the commission. 
I also want to provide a brief update on the criminal case. We continue to believe that the changes do not -- the charges do not have any merit. While we have acknowledged that we've made mistakes in the past, we simply haven't seen any evidence to indicate that PG&E employees knowingly and willfully violated the law. We're anxious to get the case underway. But just 2 weeks before the trial was scheduled to begin, the government finally provided us with more than 100,000 pages of documents that we'd been requesting for more than a year. To ensure we could thoroughly review all of this material, we were compelled to ask the court for a delay. We're scheduled to go back before the court tomorrow to provide an update on our review of the documents, and we hope to get a reasonable new trial date at that time. 
So to sum things up. While we continue to work through some of the outstanding regulatory and legal issues, we are well positioned for growth as we support California's clean energy future. 
So with that, I'll hand it over to Jason to review the financials."
139813,330035349,972851,"PG&E Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 04, 2016",2016-05-04,"Earnings Calls","PG&E Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Tony, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin by covering the first quarter results, and then quickly review the 2016 outlook. Slide 5 shows our results for the first quarter. Earnings from operations came in at $0.82. GAAP earnings, including",931,"Thank you, Tony, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin by covering the first quarter results, and then quickly review the 2016 outlook. 
Slide 5 shows our results for the first quarter. Earnings from operations came in at $0.82. GAAP earnings, including the items impacting comparability, are also shown here. The pretax numbers for the items impacting comparability are at the bottom of the page. Pipeline-related expenses came in at $22 million pretax in Q1. Our legal and regulatory-related expenses were $17 million pretax for the quarter, and fines and penalties were $87 million pretax. As a reminder, this amount represents our estimate of the disallowed capital work out coming out of the final San Bruno penalty decision, which we are accruing as we complete the work. 
Our results for the first quarter, including new items impacting comparability, were costs related to the Butte Fire. Based on the CAL FIRE report, we've taken in charge for $381 million pretax for the first quarter. As background, California has a theory of inverse condemnation, under which utilities may be liable for property damages without finding them negligent when a power line is involved in a fire. The charge we've taken includes $350 million to reflect the low end of a range for property damage and an additional $31 million for other costs related to the fire. At this point, we are not able to estimate the upper end of the range. We do carry liability insurance for claims like these, so we would expect to be able to recover a significant portion of those costs through insurance in the future. And we would show the insurance recoveries as an offsetting positive item impacting comparability in the future periods as they are recorded. 
Finally, it is important to note that the $381 million does not include an accrual for any fire suppression or personal injury damages, both of which would require a showing of negligence. 
Slide 6 shows the quarter-over-quarter comparison from earnings from operations of $0.87 in Q1 last year and $0.82 in Q1 this year. The largest item relates to the timing of taxes during the quarter, which was $0.08 negative. GAAP accounting requires us to smooth the impact of taxes across the quarters even as income fluctuates. This is purely a timing item that would reverse by year-end. 
In the first quarter of 2015, we completed our disposition of the SolarCity shares. We did not have that item this quarter, resulting in $0.03 negative. And issuing additional shares also resulted in $0.03 negative. These negative drivers were partially offset by growth in rate base earnings, which was $0.05 positive for the quarter. This item reflects assets covered by our General Rate Case and our electric transmission TO rate case. It does not include the Gas Transmission rate case since we do not yet have a decision. 
At this point, we would not expect a final decision on the first phase of the case until at least midyear. So while the timing should not affect our annual earnings from operations in 2016, it will continue to have an impact on our cash flows and quarterly results as you saw last year. 
And finally, we had $0.04 of smaller positive miscellaneous items that impacted the quarter. 
Today, we are reaffirming our guidance for earnings from operations of $3.65 to $3.85 per share, and that is shown on Slide 7. The underlying assumptions for earnings from operations remain the same as what we've provided last quarter, so I'll just quickly cover the highlights. 
On Slide 8, we continue to assume capital expenditures of roughly $5.6 billion and a weighted average authorized rate base of about $32.6 billion for the year. On the bottom right, I want to reiterate a key assumption to our guidance, which is that we receive a reasonable outcome in the Gas Transmission rate case this year. 
Turning to Slide 9. The guidance for the items impacting comparability has been updated to include the Butte Fire-related costs. The other items impacting comparability are unchanged from last quarter. Our guidance for the year for the Butte Fire-related costs reflects the Q1 charge of $381 million, which is the low end of the range for property damages, plus some other fire-related costs. As I mentioned, we are not able to estimate the high end of the range at this time. As shown at the bottom of the slide, the current range for items impacting comparability in 2016 is right about $1 billion. And as a reminder, this range excludes any potential future fines or penalties beyond our estimates of the disallowed capital and expense costs associated with the San Bruno penalty. 
On Slide 10, we continue to assume equity issuance of $600 million to $800 million in 2016. During the first quarter, we issued about $150 million in equity through our internal and dribble programs. As a reminder, the range reflects a number of assumptions, including the timing and amount of revenues we receive in the Gas Transmission rate case. The charge for the Butte Fire results in roughly $100 million in new equity needs this year, which puts us towards the high end of our range. 
And finally on Slides 11 and 12, we are reaffirming the CapEx and rate base ranges through 2019. So to conclude, we continue to have a strong growth profile supported by California's long-term policy objectives. We are confident in our ability to execute on our operational plans as we continue to work through outstanding regulatory and legal issues. 
With that, let's open up the lines for questions."

In 2012, we spent approximately $30 million settling the 2004 Freds and Sims Fires. And then 2009, we spent approximately $15 million to settle the 1999 Pendola Fire. So those are the recent experience with fire cases. And you asked a question I think about inverse condemnation. And basically, inverse condemnation is a doctrine that is based on the California Constitution. It's based on the takings clause of the California Constitution. And courts basically held that inverse condemnation may be found when 3 elements are satisfied: First, there has to be injury to private property; and second, the property damage was substantially caused. So there has to be substantial causation, and it does not matter whether there was fault or not; and thirdly, the damage had to be caused by a public improvement operating as deliberately designed, constructed or maintained. So that's the language from the case law. And inverse condemnation has been applied to utility fire cases, where fires were caused by power lines. And court cases have basically described the underlying purpose of this doctrine as intending to distribute throughout the community any loss inflicted upon an individual property owner by public improvement. And inverse condemnation allows recovery for property damage, prejudgment interest and attorneys fees."

I appreciate you joining us this morning on what I know is a busy day for all of you. So I'm going to start with some opening remarks and then turn it over to Jason to go through our financial results. 
We continue to believe that the key focus areas shown on Slide 3 provide the foundation for operational and financial success, so I'll start with how we're thinking about the future in the context of California's clean energy policies. With the passage of AB 350 last year, California will be doubling its energy efficiency goals and increasing the renewable portfolio standard to 50% by 2030. Over time, these mandates will impact both our electric procurement needs and our investment opportunities. Now on the investment side, California's policies will drive capital expenditures in both electric distribution and transmission systems. We are going to have to continue to upgrade the distribution grid to support increasing levels of distributed resources and we'll need new and upgraded transmission lines to support the utility scale renewables required to meet the higher RPS standards. 
On a procurement side, we expect electric demand to decrease as customers continue to reduce the energy they need from PG&E through energy efficiency and distributed generation. We also expect that some cities will pursue community choice aggregation where they will purchase their own generation. As we consider the changing energy landscape in California, it became clear to us that we needed to take a hard look at the future of the Diablo Canyon. Working with a diverse coalition of labor and environmental groups, we crafted a joint proposal to retire Diablo Canyon at the end of its current license terms, which are 2024 for one year and 2025 for another, and replace it with a greenhouse gas free portfolio of renewable energy, energy efficiency and energy storage. We've also voluntarily committed to a 55% RPS target beginning in 2031. 
I'm very pleased to report that the State Lands Commission recently extended the release for Diablo Canyon intake and outflow structures so that it now runs through the current NRC license terms, and that was an important first step in carrying out our plan. In August, we'll be filing an application for CPUC approval of the joint proposal by the end of 2017. We believe the joint proposal fully supports California's long-term clean energy goals while providing time for a thoughtful transition to new greenhouse, gas-free resources. 
Turning to customer expectations. We've had -- made significant progress in all of our key rate cases during the quarter. As you know, we received a final decision in the first phase of the 2015 Gas Transmission and Storage Rate Case in June. The decision acknowledged the need to continue investing in the safety of the system and authorize revenues for much of the work that we have requested. Given the significant delays in the case that also included revenues for an additional attrition year in 2018. In a separate phase of the case the commission will consider how to allocate the $850 million disallowance supported last year as part of the San Bruno penalty decision. And we hope to get a final Phase 2 decision sometime this fall. Jason will take you through our expectations around the financial impacts of that decision, which is quite complex. 
Moving on to our general rate case which covers most of our business, we've been engaged in settlement discussions with other parties over the last few months. Last week, we filed a notice of settlement conference which will take place on August 3. Given the confidentiality of settlement discussions, we can't really comment further today, but we do consider this a positive development. We're also continuing to have settlement discussions in the TO '17 [ph] rate case. The rates are in place subject to refund while the case is pending. And tomorrow, we'll be filing our next electric transmission rate case, TO-18 [ph]. We'll be requesting an additional $100 million in capital expenditures which we've incorporated into our multiyear projections. 
So let me shift to the operational side of things. As we get into the driest part of the year, we launched aggressive fire preparedness efforts focused on prevention, detection and response. Although we have had more rain this year than last, California's experiencing significant tree mortality following several years of drought. To mitigate this increased fire risk we're supplementing our annual inspections by conducting daily aryl aerial patrols and proactive foot patrols over fire-prone parts of our service territory. 
And finally, we continue to work towards resolving outstanding issues. In June, we received the presiding officer's decision in the gas distribution recordkeeping investigation. Overall we thought the decision was balanced, recognizing the actions we've taken to improve our record in the safety of the system and found that many of the violations were isolated rather than systemic issues. The Safety and Enforcement Division in the city of Carmel have appealed the decision seeking a higher fine and we're now waiting for a commission to issue a final decision. 
The federal trial -- the trial and the federal criminal case began in June, and the case was submitted to the jury yesterday. Because we're in the sensitive part of the trial, we're just in the position to comment on any of the specific evidence or testimony. I can tell you that we continue to believe that no PG&E employee knowingly and locally violated the law but now it's in the hands of the jury. 
So to sum things up, we're working to resolve all of our pending rate cases and we continue to make steady progress on outstanding regulatory and legal issues. And we are well-positioned to help drive California's clean energy future through sustained investment. 
So with that, let me hand it over to Jason to walk you through our financials. Jason?"
139813,370265618,1015420,"PG&E Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","PG&E Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Tony, and good morning, everyone. [indiscernible] Second quarter results, I want to provide a brief overview of the Phase 1 Gas Transmission rate case decision. I'll start by saying that this is one of the most complicated rate case decisions",2165,"Thank you, Tony, and good morning, everyone. [indiscernible] Second quarter results, I want to provide a brief overview of the Phase 1 Gas Transmission rate case decision. 
I'll start by saying that this is one of the most complicated rate case decisions we've ever seen. Our financial results and projections reflect a number of key assumptions and new items from the decision, so I want to make sure we're all grounded on those. 
Turning to Slide 4. The first thing I'll cover is revenue recognition. Because the decision came so late in the rate case period, we have not collected any incremental revenues for 2015 or for the first 7 months of 2016. Those incremental revenues make up our undercollected amounts. There are 2 important point I'd like to cover regarding incremental revenues. First, while the Phase 1 decision allows us to begin billing customers on August 1, we will not be able to recognize the full true-up of the undercollected revenues until after the Phase 2 decision when we know the final revenue requirement. Second, the Phase 1 decision requires us to amortize these undercollected amounts over 36 months. Utility accounting rules allow us to recognize revenues only as will be collected within 24 months of the end of the year. As a result, assuming we get a final Phase 2 decision by year end, we will recognize 29 months out of the 36 month amortization period in 2016. That 29 months includes the actual revenues we will collect in the remaining 5 months of 2016 plus the amounts we will collect over the subsequent 24 months. This means we will recognize the remaining 7 months of undercollected amounts in the first quarter of 2017. These revenue recognition factors are important assumptions for the guidance I'll be covering today. 
The decision also impacts our capital expenditure forecasts. First, it permanently disallowed a portion of the 2011 through 2014 capital spend that we sought to true-up in this rate case and subjects the remaining portion to audit the potential for future recovery. The decision also includes a number of programs, specific cost caps and one-way balancing accounts. Since we are not in a position to adjust the spending the already completed, we anticipate that some capital programs will see the authorized amounts over the rate case period and will not be recoverable in the future. As I'll discuss in a minute, we've taken a onetime charge for this during the quarter for those items. 
And finally, the Phase 2 decision allocating the $850 [ph] million San Bruno penalty creates some additional uncertainty. Several parties have suggested that all of the $850 million should be allocated to expense. For purposes of today's presentation, we assume that we received a final Phase 2 decision this year and that the penalty will be allocated to roughly $690 million in capital and $160 million in expense, consistent with the original San Bruno penalty decision. We obviously need to make adjustments if the Phase 2 decision changes that allocation. 
So with that overview, let's go through the financials. Slide 5 shows our results for the second quarter. Earnings from operations came in at $0.66. GAAP earnings, including  the items impacting comparability are also shown here. Pipeline-related expenses came in at $27 million pretax for the quarter. Our legal and regulatory expenses were $14 million pretax, and fines and penalties were $172 million pretax. The fines and penalties item reflects 2 components this quarter. The first component represents our estimate of the disallowed safety related capital, resulting from the San Bruno penalty decision, which we are accruing as we complete the work. This item totaled $148 million pretax for the quarter. 
The second component is a fine of $24 million for the gas distribution recordkeeping investigation. For now, we reflected the presiding officer's decision. We'll make any necessary adjustments when the commission rules on the appeals. The Butte Fire related costs also reflected components. First we booked $49 million pretax for additional cleanup, repair and legal costs associated with the Butte Fire. We do not expect any additional cleanup and repair costs in the future. 
This item is offset by positive insurance receivable of $260 [ph] million, which reflects the low end of the range for estimated insurance recoveries. The 2 components net way positive $211 million pretax. 
One important note regarding the insurance receivable. While we recorded the low end of the range at this time, we plan to seek full recovery of cost for insurance and believe that nearly all of the third party claims will ultimately be recovered through insurance. So the $260 million receivable should not be interpreted as a ceiling on insurance recovery. 
The next line item, GT&S capital disallowance is new this quarter. We booked a charge of $190 million pretax reflecting the 2 components of disallowed capital I discussed on Slide 4, which are the $135 million for work performed in 2011 through 2014, plus $55 million for capital spend in 2015 through 2018 that we expect will exceed authorized cost caps. 
The last slide relates to the impact of the timing of the Gas Transmission Rate Case decision. This is where we will reflect out of period GT&S revenues once we begin recognizing them. To ensure that our 2016 results are comparable year-over-year, we plan to reflect all of the revenues authorized for our 2016 cost of service and earnings from operations this year and reflect the outer period revenues as an item-impacting comparability. 
Consistent with the revenue recognition factors on Slide 4, this item will continue into 2017 when we recognize the remaining 7 months of the out of period of revenues. 
Moving on, Slide 6 shows our quarter-over-quarter comparison for earnings from operations of $0.91 in Q2 last year and $0.66 in Q2 this year. The timing of taxes during the quarter was $0.08 negative. As a reminder, this line is purely a timing item that in total will reverse by year-end. A number of smaller miscellaneous items totaled $0.08 negative for the quarter. A nuclear refueling outage during the quarter resulted in $0.06 negative. Regulatory and legal matters totaled $0.05 negative for the quarter and issue and additional sales resulted in $0.03 negative. These negative drivers were partially offset by growth in rate base earnings, which was $0.05 positive for the quarter. This item reflects assets covered by our general rate case and our electric transmission TO rate case. It does not include the Gas Transmission rate case since we did not recognize any revenue increase in Q2. 
Today, we are reaffirming our guidance for earnings from operations of $3.65 to $3.85 per share, and that is shown on Slide 7 along with the GAAP guidance. 
On Slide 8, you can see the underlying assumptions for that guidance, which we've updated to reflect the Phase 1 Gas Transmission rate case decision. Starting at the top left, we assume capital expenditures are roughly $5.6 billion for the year, consistent with the last quarter. The gas transmission CapEx is now $700 million, consistent with the amounts authorized in the Phase 1 decision. Last quarter, we showed a range of $500 million to $700 million. 
We've also reduced the electric distribution CapEx by $50 million to reflect our current spending projections. 
Moving to the top right. We've also adjusted our assumption for weighted average rate-based to about $32.4 billion from our previous assumption of about $32.6 billion. Consistent with the Phase 1 Gas Transmission rate case decision, we've adjusted the Gas Transmission rate case to $2.8 billion, down from $3 billion to $3.4 billion range we showed last quarter. This reduction is driven primarily by removal of the roughly $700 million in 2011 through 2014 capital spend that we had expected to true-up in rate base this year. As a reminder, rate base and corporates depreciation and deferred taxes, so it's not a one-for-one relationship with capital expenditures, particularly since this capital was spent several years ago. As a result, the rate base impact of the spend is closer to $500 million. On the bottom right, I want to reiterate our 2016 guidance assumes that we receive a final Phase 2 decision in the Gas Transmission rate case this year and that it allocates the disallowance of safety-related spend consistent with the San Bruno penalty decision. The other bullets are consistent to what we have shown here before. 
The bottom line is that based on these assumptions, we continue to target earning our authorized return on equity across the enterprise plus the net impact of the other earnings factors listed here. 
Turning to Slide 9, the guidance for our 2016 [ph] items impacting comparability has been updated to include: The Phase 1 Gas Transmission rate case decision; and our assumptions for Phase 2. I'll walk through each of these items briefly. There's no change in the for pipeline-related costs, which covers the work to reclaim our right away. Legal and regular related expenses also remain unchanged. The fines and penalties items has been adjusted for 2 items: First, the guidance includes the $24 million accrual fuel for the presiding officers decision of the gas distribution record-seeking investigation. And second, it disallowed expense charge for the San Bruno penalty has been reduced from $160 million to $130 million due to the 36 month amortization period. The remaining $30 million will shift to 2017. This item excludes any potential future fines or penalties beyond our current assumptions for the distribution record seeking penalty and the San Bruno penalty. When we make a final Phase 2 decision of the Gas Transmission rate case, we will also include the associated export penalty in this item. 
The Butte Fire related costs are showing next. At this time, we remain unable to estimate the high end of the range for third-party damages associated with the fire. As a reminder, last quarter we booked $350 million to reflect our estimate of the low end of the range for property damage. This quarter, we recorded an insurance receivable of $260 million, reflecting the low end of the range for estimated insurance recoveries. The remaining amounts reflect our recorded legal and operational cost associated with the Butte Fire. 
Next, we show the nnew item impacting comparability for the GT&S capital disallowance, which is consistent with assumptions shown on Slide 4. The last item covers the impacts of the timing of GT&S positioned. The $350 million shown here reflects the 29 months of out of period revenues we expect to recognize in 2016. As I mentioned, this item will continue into 2017 when we recognize the remaining 7 months. 
Moving on to Slide 10. We currently expect to issue right around $800 million in equity in 2016, so we've eliminated the range we've shown in Q1. The incremental equity required by the new charges this quarter is roughly offset by the Butte Fire insurance receivable. In the first half of this year, we issued about $300 million to our internal and global programs. 
Turning to Slide 11, we are updating the multiyear CapEx ranges. For gas and electric distribution and generation, the high end of the range continues to reflect the requested amounts in the general rate case to 2019. For gas transmission, the high end of the ranges through 2018 has been reduced to reflect the lower authorized CapEx and the Phase 1 decision in the Gas Transmission rate case. These expenditures are held flat in 2019. For electric transmission, the high end of the range in 2017 now reflects the request in the TO18 electric transmission rate case which we will file tomorrow. These expenditures are held flat in 2018 and 2019. Taken together, these changes reduce the high end of the range to $6.4 billion compared to $6.5 billion shown last quarter. The low end of the range remains consistent with our 2015 capital spending. Overall, you can see that we continue to expect robust capital spending going forward. 
On Slide 12, we've updated the rate base changes consistent with the capital spending on the previous slide. The higher end of the range also assumes that the portion of the 2011 through 2014 capital spend subject to audit is added to rate base in 2017. These adjustments narrow the range of rate-based to a compound annual growth rate of 5.5% to 6.5% between 2017 and 2019. 
Finally, we added a new Slide 13 showing our dividend payout ratio targets. Consistent with our announcement during the quarter, we increased the dividend this year by about 8% to $1.96 per share. We are targeting a 55% to 65% payout ratio with a specific objective of reaching 60% by 2019. 
I know we covered a lot this morning. Let me close by saying we continue to reach important regulatory financial and operational milestones and we are confident in our ability to deliver on our plans as we position the company for future success. 
So with that, let's open up the lines for questions."

The remaining $30 million which we have thought will be recognized in '16 is now expected to be recognized in 2017, assuming that the allocation between capital and expense does not change in the Phase 2 decision."

I appreciate you joining us this morning on what I know is a busy day for all of you. So I'm going to start with some opening remarks and then turn it over to Jason to go through our financial results. 
We continue to believe that the key focus areas shown on Slide 3 provide the foundation for operational and financial success, so I'll start with how we're thinking about the future in the context of California's clean energy policies. With the passage of AB 350 (sic) [ SB 350 ] last year, California will be doubling its energy efficiency goals and increasing the renewable portfolio standard to 50% by 2030. Over time, these mandates will impact both our electric procurement needs and our investment opportunities. 
Now on the investment side, California's policies will drive capital expenditures in both the electric distribution and transmission systems. We're going to have to continue to upgrade the distribution grid to support increasing levels of distributed resources, and we'll need new and upgraded transmission lines to support the utility scale renewables required to meet the higher RPS standards. 
On the procurement side, we expect electric demand to decrease as customers continue to reduce the energy they need from PG&E through energy efficiency and distributed generation. We also expect that some cities will pursue community choice aggregation, where they will purchase their own generation. 
As we considered the changing energy landscape in California, it became clear to us that we needed to take a hard look at the future of Diablo Canyon. Working with a diverse coalition of labor and environmental groups, we crafted a joint proposal to retire Diablo Canyon at the end of its current license terms, which are 2024 for 1 year and 2025 for another, and replace it with a greenhouse gas-free portfolio of renewable energy, energy efficiency and energy storage. We've also voluntarily committed to a 55% RPS target beginning in 2031. 
I'm very pleased to report that the state lands commission recently extended the lease for Diablo Canyon intake and outflow structures so that it now runs through the current NRC license terms, and that was an important first step in carrying out our plan. In August, we'll be filing an application for CPUC approval of the joint proposal by the end of 2017. We believe the joint proposal fully supports California's long-term clean energy goals while providing time for a thoughtful transition to new greenhouse gas-free resources. 
Turning to customer expectations. We've made significant progress in all of our key rate cases during the quarter. As you know, we received a final decision in the first phase of the 2015 Gas Transmission & Storage Rate Case in June. The decision acknowledged the need to continue investing in the safety of the system and authorized revenues for much of the work that we have requested. Given the significant delays in the case, it also included revenues for an additional attrition year in 2018. 
In a separate phase of the case, the commission will consider how to allocate the $850 million disallowance ordered last year as part of the San Bruno penalty decision. And we hope to get a final Phase 2 decision sometime this fall. And Jason going to take you through our expectations around the financial impacts of that decision, which is quite complex. 
Moving on to our general rate case, which covers most of our business, we've been engaged in settlement discussions with other parties over the last few months. Last week, we filed a notice of settlement conference, which will take place on August 3. But given the confidentiality of settlement discussions, we can't really comment further today, but we do consider this a positive development. 
We're also continuing to have settlement discussions in the TO17 rate case. The rates are in place subject to refund while the case is pending. And tomorrow, we'll be filing our next electric transmission rate case, TO18. We'll be requesting an additional $100 million in capital expenditures, which we've incorporated into our multiyear projections. 
So let me shift to the operational side of things. As we get into the driest part of the year, we launched aggressive fire preparedness efforts focused on prevention, detection and response. Although we have had more rain this year than last, California's experiencing significant tree mortality following several years of drought. To mitigate this increased fire risk, we're supplementing our annual inspections by conducting daily aerial patrols and proactive foot patrols over fire-prone parts of our service territory. 
And finally, we continue to work towards resolving outstanding issues. In June, we received the presiding officer's decision in the gas distribution recordkeeping investigation. Overall, we thought the decision was balanced, recognizing the actions we've taken to improve our records in the safety of the system and finding that many of the violations were isolated rather than systemic issues. The Safety and Enforcement Division in the city of Carmel have appealed the decision, seeking a higher fine, and we're now waiting for a commission to issue a final decision. 
The federal trial in the -- the trial in the federal criminal case began in June, and the case was submitted to the jury yesterday. Because we're in the sensitive part of the trial, we're just not in a position to comment on any of the specific evidence or testimony. I can tell you that we continue to believe that no PG&E employee knowingly and locally violated the law, but now it's in the hands of the jury. 
So to sum things up, we're working to resolve all of our pending rate cases, and we continue to make steady progress on outstanding regulatory and legal issues. And we are well positioned to help drive California's clean energy future through sustained investment. 
So with that, let me hand it over to Jason to walk you through our financials. Jason?"

I'll start by saying that this is one of the most complicated rate case decisi",2151,"Thank you, Tony. Good morning, everyone. Before I give [ph] the second quarter results, I want to provide a brief overview of the Phase 1 Gas Transmission rate case decision. 
I'll start by saying that this is one of the most complicated rate case decisions we've ever seen. Our financial results and projections reflect a number of key assumptions and new items from the decision, so I want to make sure that we're all grounded on those. 
Turning to Slide 4. The first thing I'll cover is revenue recognition. Because the decision came so late in the rate-case period, we have not collected any incremental revenues for 2015 or for the first 7 months of 2016. Those incremental revenues make up our undercollected amounts. There are 2 important points I'd like to cover regarding incremental revenues. 
First, while the Phase 1 decision allows us to begin billing customers on August 1, we will not be able to recognize the full true-up of the undercollected revenues until after the Phase 2 decision when we know the final revenue requirement. 
Second, the Phase 1 decision requires us to amortize these undercollected amounts over 36 months. Utility accounting rules allow us to recognize revenues only if they'll be collected within 24 months of the end of the year. As a result, assuming we get a final Phase 2 decision by year-end, we will recognize 29 months out of the 36-month amortization period in 2016. That 29 months includes the actual revenues we will collect in the remaining 5 months of 2016 plus the amounts we will collect over the subsequent 24 months. This means we'll recognize the remaining 7 months of undercollected amounts in the first quarter of 2017. These revenue recognition factors are important assumptions for the guidance I'll be covering today. 
The decision also impacts our capital expenditure forecasts. First, it permanently disallows a portion of the 2011 through 2014 capital spend that we sought to true-up in this rate case and subjects the remaining portion to audit with potential for future recovery. The decision also includes a number of programs, specific cost caps and one-way balancing accounts. Since we are not in a position to adjust the spending we've already completed, we anticipate that some capital programs will see the authorized amounts over the rate-case period that will not be recoverable in the future. As I'll discuss in a minute, we've taken a onetime charge for this during the quarter for those items. 
And finally, the Phase 2 decision allocating the $850 million San Bruno penalty creates some additional uncertainty. Several parties have suggested that all of the $850 million should be allocated to expense. For purposes of today's presentation, we assume that we receive a final Phase 2 decision this year and that the penalty will be allocated to roughly $690 million in capital and $160 million in expense, consistent with the original San Bruno penalty decision. We'll obviously need to make adjustments if the Phase 2 decision changes that allocation. 
So with that overview, let's go through the financials. Slide 5 shows our results for the second quarter. Earnings from operations came in at $0.66. GAAP earnings, including the items impacting comparability, are also shown here. Pipeline-related expenses came in at $27 million pretax for the quarter. Our legal and regulatory-related expenses were $14 million pretax, and fines and penalties were $172 million pretax. 
The fines and penalties item reflects 2 components this quarter. The first component represents our estimate of the disallowed safety-related capital, resulting from the San Bruno penalty decision, which we are accruing as we complete the work. This item totaled $148 million pretax for the quarter. 
The second component is a fine of $24 million for the gas distribution recordkeeping investigation. For now, we reflected the presiding officer's decision. We'll make any necessary adjustments when the commission rules on the appeals. The Butte Fire related cost also reflected components. First, we booked $49 million pretax for additional cleanup, repair and legal costs associated with the Butte Fire. We do not expect any additional cleanup and repair costs in the future. 
This item is offset by positive insurance receivable of $260 million, which reflects the low end of the range for estimated insurance recoveries. The 2 components net to a positive $211 million pretax. 
One important note regarding the insurance receivable. While we recorded the low end of the range at this time, we plan to seek full recovery of cost for insurance and believe that nearly all of the third-party claims will ultimately be recovered through insurance. So the $260 million receivable should not be interpreted as a ceiling on insurance recovery. 
The next line item, GT&S capital disallowance, is new this quarter. We booked a charge of $190 million pretax, reflecting the 2 components of disallowed capital I discussed on Slide 4, which are the $135 million for work performed in 2011 through 2014, plus $55 million for capital spend in 2015 through 2018 that we expect will exceed authorized cost caps. 
The last line relates to the impact of the timing of the Gas Transmission rate-case decision. This is where we will reflect out-of-period GT&S revenues once we begin recognizing them. To ensure that our 2016 results are comparable year-over-year, we plan to reflect all of the revenues authorized for our 2016 cost of service and earnings from operations this year and reflect the out-of-period revenues as an item impacting comparability. Consistent with the revenue-recognition factors on Slide 4, this item will continue into 2017 when we recognize the remaining 7 months of the out-of-period revenues. 
Moving on. Slide 6 shows our quarter-over-quarter comparison for earnings from operations of $0.91 in Q2 last year and $0.66 in Q2 this year. The timing of taxes during the quarter was $0.08 negative. As a reminder, this line is purely a timing item that, in total, will reverse by year-end. A number of smaller miscellaneous items totaled $0.08 negative for the quarter. A nuclear refueling outage during the quarter resulted in $0.06 negative. Regulatory and legal matters totaled $0.05 negative for the quarter and issuing additional sales resulted in $0.03 negative. 
These negative drivers were partially offset by growth in rate-base earnings, which was $0.05 positive for the quarter. This item reflects assets covered by our general rate case and our electric transmission TO rate case. It does not include the Gas Transmission rate case since we did not recognize any revenue increase in Q2. 
Today, we are reaffirming our guidance for earnings from operations of $3.65 to $3.85 per share, and that is shown on Slide 7 along with the GAAP guidance. 
On Slide 8, you can see the underlying assumptions for that guidance, which we've updated to reflect the Phase 1 Gas Transmission rate-case decision. Starting at the top left, we assumed capital expenditures are roughly $5.6 billion for the year, consistent with the last quarter. The gas transmission CapEx is now $700 million, consistent with the amounts authorized in the Phase 1 decision. Last quarter, we showed a range of $500 million to $700 million. 
We've also reduced the electric distribution CapEx by $50 million to reflect our current spending projections. 
Moving to the top right. We've also adjusted our assumption for weighted average authorize rate base to about $32.4 billion from our previous assumption of about $32.6 billion. Consistent with the Phase 1 Gas Transmission rate-case decision, we've adjusted the Gas Transmission rate base to $2.8 billion, down from $3 billion to $3.4 billion range we showed last quarter. 
This reduction is driven primarily by removal of the roughly $700 million in 2011 through 2014 capital spend that we had expected to true up in rate base this year. As a reminder, rate base incorporates depreciation and deferred taxes, so it's not a one-for-one relationship with capital expenditures, particularly since this capital was spent several years ago. As a result, the rate base impact of this spend is closer to $500 million. 
On the bottom right, I want to reiterate that our 2016 guidance assumes that we receive a final Phase 2 decision in the Gas Transmission rate case this year and that it allocates the disallowance of safety-related spend consistent with the San Bruno penalty decision. The other bullets are consistent with what we've shown here before. 
The bottom line is that, based on these assumptions, we continue to target earning our authorized return on equity across the enterprise plus the net impact of the other earnings factors listed here. 
Turning to Slide 9, the guidance for our 2016 items impacting comparability has been updated to include the Phase 1 Gas Transmission rate-case decision and our assumptions for Phase 2. I'll walk through each of these items briefly. There's no change to the range for pipeline-related costs, which covers the work to reclaim our rights of way. Legal and regulatory-related expenses also remain unchanged. 
The fines and penalties item has been adjusted for 2 items: first, the guidance includes the $24 million accrual for the presiding officer's decision in the gas distribution recordkeeping investigation. And second, the disallowed expense charge for the San Bruno penalty has been reduced from $160 million to $130 million due to the 36-month amortization period. The remaining $30 million will shift to 2017. 
This item excludes any additional potential future fines or penalties beyond our current assumptions for the distribution recordkeeping penalty and the San Bruno penalty. When we have a final Phase 2 decision in the Gas Transmission rate case, we will also include the associated ex parte penalty in this item. 
The Butte Fire related costs are shown next. At this time, we remain unable to estimate the high end of the range for third-party damages associated with the fire. As a reminder, last quarter, we booked $350 million to reflect our estimate of the low end of the range for property damage. This quarter, we recorded an insurance receivable of $260 million, reflecting the low end of the range for estimated insurance recoveries. The remaining amounts reflect our recorded legal and operational cost associated with the Butte Fire. 
Next, we show the new item impacting comparability for the GT&S capital disallowance, which is consistent with the assumptions shown on Slide 4. The last item covers the impact of the timing of the GT&S decision. The $350 million shown here reflects the 29 months of out-of-period revenues we expect to recognize in 2016. As I mentioned, this item will continue into 2017 when we recognize the remaining 7 months. 
Moving on to Slide 10. We currently expect to issue right around $800 million in equity in 2016, so we've eliminated the range we've showed in Q1. The incremental equity required by the new charges this quarter is roughly offset by the Butte Fire insurance receivable. In the first half of this year, we issued about $300 million to our internal and Dribble programs. 
Turning to Slide 11. We're updating the multiyear CapEx ranges. For gas and electric distribution and generation, the high end of the range continues to reflect the requested amounts in the general rate case through 2019. For gas transmission, the high end of the range through 2018 has been reduced to reflect the lower authorized CapEx in the Phase 1 decision in the Gas Transmission rate case. These expenditures are held flat in 2019. 
For electric transmission, the high end of the range in 2017 now reflects the request in the TO18 electric transmission rate case, which we will file tomorrow. These expenditures are held flat in 2018 and 2019. Taken together, these changes reduce the high end of the range to $6.4 billion, compared to $6.5 billion shown last quarter. The low end of the range remains consistent with our 2015 capital spending. Overall, you can see that we continue to expect robust capital spending going forward. 
On Slide 12, we've updated the rate-base ranges consistent with the capital spending on the previous slide. The high end of the range also assumes that the portion of the 2011 through 2014 capital spend that is subject to audit is added to rate base in 2017. These adjustments narrow the range of rate base to a compound annual growth rate of 5.5% to 6.5% between 2017 and 2019. 
Finally, we've added a new Slide 13 showing our dividend payout ratio targets. Consistent with our announcement during the quarter, we increased the dividend this year by about 8% to $1.96 per share. We're targeting a 55% to 65% payout ratio with a specific objective of reaching 60% by 2019. 
I know we've covered a lot this morning. Let me close by saying that we continue to reach important regulatory, financial and operational milestones, and we are confident in our ability to deliver on our plans as we position the company for future success. 
So with that, let's open up the lines for questions."

So our guidance assumes that the Phase 2 decision allocates the San Bruno penalty disallowance consistent with the original allocation. So about 80% is a capital disallowance and about 20% is expense. As you know, we've been accruing the capital portion of the disallowance since we first originally received that decision. And so really, what remains outstanding is the disallowance for expense. And what we've talked about in the past is that disallowance for that expense is really a disallowance of incremental revenues. So I would say the one key change for the quarter is that, given the 36-month amortization period, which prevents us from recognizing all of the true-up revenues, essentially, we will only recognize about $130 million of that San Bruno expense disallowance here in 2016. The remaining $30 million, which we had thought would be recognized in '16, is now expected to be recognized in 2017, assuming that the allocation between capital and expense does not change in the Phase 2 decision."

I appreciate you joining us this morning on what I know is a busy day for all of you. So I'm going to start with some opening remarks and then turn it over to Jason to go through our financial results. 
We continue to believe that the key focus areas shown on Slide 3 provide the foundation for operational and financial success, so I'll start with how we're thinking about the future in the context of California's clean energy policies. With the passage of AB 350 (sic) [ SB 350 ] last year, California will be doubling its energy efficiency goals and increasing the renewable portfolio standard to 50% by 2030. Over time, these mandates will impact both our electric procurement needs and our investment opportunities. 
Now on the investment side, California's policies will drive capital expenditures in both the electric distribution and transmission systems. We're going to have to continue to upgrade the distribution grid to support increasing levels of distributed resources, and we'll need new and upgraded transmission lines to support the utility scale renewables required to meet the higher RPS standards. 
On the procurement side, we expect electric demand to decrease as customers continue to reduce the energy they need from PG&E through energy efficiency and distributed generation. We also expect that some cities will pursue community choice aggregation, where they will purchase their own generation. 
As we considered the changing energy landscape in California, it became clear to us that we needed to take a hard look at the future of Diablo Canyon. Working with a diverse coalition of labor and environmental groups, we crafted a joint proposal to retire Diablo Canyon at the end of its current license terms, which are 2024 for 1 year and 2025 for another, and replace it with a greenhouse gas-free portfolio of renewable energy, energy efficiency and energy storage. We've also voluntarily committed to a 55% RPS target beginning in 2031. 
I'm very pleased to report that the state lands commission recently extended the lease for Diablo Canyon intake and outflow structures so that it now runs through the current NRC license terms, and that was an important first step in carrying out our plan. In August, we'll be filing an application for CPUC approval of the joint proposal by the end of 2017. We believe the joint proposal fully supports California's long-term clean energy goals while providing time for a thoughtful transition to new greenhouse gas-free resources. 
Turning to customer expectations. We've made significant progress in all of our key rate cases during the quarter. As you know, we received a final decision in the first phase of the 2015 Gas Transmission & Storage Rate Case in June. The decision acknowledged the need to continue investing in the safety of the system and authorized revenues for much of the work that we had requested. Given the significant delays in the case, it also included revenues for an additional attrition year in 2018. 
In a separate phase of the case, the commission will consider how to allocate the $850 million disallowance ordered last year as part of the San Bruno penalty decision. And we hope to get a final Phase 2 decision sometime this fall. And Jason going to take you through our expectations around the financial impacts of that decision, which is quite complex. 
Moving on to our general rate case, which covers most of our business, we've been engaged in settlement discussions with other parties over the last few months. Last week, we filed a notice of settlement conference, which will take place on August 3. But given the confidentiality of settlement discussions, we can't really comment further today, but we do consider this a positive development. 
We're also continuing to have settlement discussions in the TO17 rate case. The rates are in place subject to refund while the case is pending. And tomorrow, we'll be filing our next electric transmission rate case, TO18. We'll be requesting an additional $100 million in capital expenditures, which we've incorporated into our multiyear projections. 
So let me shift to the operational side of things. As we get into the driest part of the year, we've launched aggressive fire preparedness efforts focused on prevention, detection and response. Although we have had more rain this year than last, California's experiencing significant tree mortality following several years of drought. To mitigate this increased fire risk, we're supplementing our annual inspections by conducting daily aerial patrols and proactive foot patrols over fire-prone parts of our service territory. 
And finally, we continue to work towards resolving outstanding issues. In June, we received the presiding officer's decision in the gas distribution recordkeeping investigation. Overall, we thought the decision was balanced, recognizing the actions we've taken to improve our records in the safety of the system and finding that many of the violations were isolated rather than systemic issues. The Safety and Enforcement Division in the city of Carmel have appealed the decision, seeking a higher fine, and we're now waiting for a commission to issue a final decision. 
The federal trial in the -- the trial in the federal criminal case began in June, and the case was submitted to the jury yesterday. Because we're in the sensitive part of the trial, we're just not in a position to comment on any of the specific evidence or testimony. I can tell you that we continue to believe that no PG&E employee knowingly and willfully violated the law, but now it's in the hands of the jury. 
So to sum things up, we're working to resolve all of our pending rate cases, and we continue to make steady progress on outstanding regulatory and legal issues. And we are well positioned to help drive California's clean energy future through sustained investment. 
So with that, let me hand it over to Jason to walk you through our financials. Jason?"
139813,370265618,1017038,"PG&E Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","PG&E Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Tony. Good morning, everyone. Before I give you the second quarter results, I want to provide a brief overview of the Phase 1 Gas Transmission rate case decision. I'll start by saying that this is one of the most complicated rate case decisio",2155,"Thank you, Tony. Good morning, everyone. Before I give you the second quarter results, I want to provide a brief overview of the Phase 1 Gas Transmission rate case decision. 
I'll start by saying that this is one of the most complicated rate case decisions we've ever seen. Our financial results and projections reflect a number of key assumptions and new items from the decision, so I want to make sure that we're all grounded on those. 
Turning to Slide 4. The first thing I'll cover is revenue recognition. Because the decision came so late in the rate-case period, we have not collected any incremental revenues for 2015 or for the first 7 months of 2016. Those incremental revenues make up our undercollected amounts. There are 2 important points I'd like to cover regarding incremental revenues. 
First, while the Phase 1 decision allows us to begin billing customers on August 1, we will not be able to recognize the full true-up of the undercollected revenues until after the Phase 2 decision when we know the final revenue requirement. 
Second, the Phase 1 decision requires us to amortize these undercollected amounts over 36 months. Utility accounting rules allow us to recognize revenues only if they'll be collected within 24 months of the end of the year. As a result, assuming we get a final Phase 2 decision by year-end, we will recognize 29 months out of the 36-month amortization period in 2016. The 29 months includes the actual revenues we will collect in the remaining 5 months of 2016 plus the amounts we will collect over the subsequent 24 months. This means we'll recognize the remaining 7 months of undercollected amounts in the first quarter of 2017. These revenue recognition factors are important assumptions for the guidance I'll be covering today. 
The decision also impacts our capital expenditure forecasts. First, it permanently disallows a portion of the 2011 through 2014 capital spend that we sought to true-up in this rate case and subjects the remaining portion to audit with potential for future recovery. The decision also includes a number of programs, specific cost caps and one-way balancing accounts. Since we are not in a position to adjust the spending we've already completed, we anticipate that some capital programs will see the authorized amounts over the rate-case period that will not be recoverable in the future. As I'll discuss in a minute, we've taken a onetime charge for this during the quarter for those items. 
And finally, the Phase 2 decision allocating the $850 million San Bruno penalty creates some additional uncertainty. Several parties have suggested that all of the $850 million should be allocated to expense. For purposes of today's presentation, we assume that we receive a final Phase 2 decision this year and that the penalty will be allocated to roughly $690 million in capital and $160 million in expense, consistent with the original San Bruno penalty decision. We'll obviously need to make adjustments if the Phase 2 decision changes that allocation. 
So with that overview, let's go through the financials. Slide 5 shows our results for the second quarter. Earnings from operations came in at $0.66. GAAP earnings, including the items impacting comparability, are also shown here. Pipeline-related expenses came in at $27 million pretax for the quarter. Our legal and regulatory-related expenses were $14 million pretax, and fines and penalties were $172 million pretax. 
The fines and penalties item reflects 2 components this quarter. The first component represents our estimate of the disallowed safety-related capital, resulting from the San Bruno penalty decision, which we are accruing as we complete the work. This item totaled $148 million pretax for the quarter. 
The second component is a fine of $24 million for the gas distribution recordkeeping investigation. For now, we reflected the presiding officer's decision. We'll make any necessary adjustments when the commission rules on the appeals. The Butte Fire related cost also reflect 2 components. First, we booked $49 million pretax for additional cleanup, repair and legal costs associated with the Butte Fire. We do not expect any additional cleanup and repair costs in the future. 
This item is offset by a positive insurance receivable of $260 million, which reflects the low end of the range for estimated insurance recoveries. The 2 components net to a positive $211 million pretax. 
One important note regarding the insurance receivable. While we recorded the low end of the range at this time, we plan to seek full recovery of cost through insurance and believe that nearly all of the third-party claims will ultimately be recovered through insurance. So the $260 million receivable should not be interpreted as a ceiling on insurance recovery. 
The next line item, GT&S capital disallowance, is new this quarter. We booked a charge of $190 million pretax, reflecting the 2 components of disallowed capital I discussed on Slide 4, which are the $135 million for work performed in 2011 through 2014, plus $55 million for capital spend in 2015 through 2018 that we expect will exceed authorized cost caps. 
The last line relates to the impact of the timing of the Gas Transmission rate-case decision. This is where we will reflect out-of-period GT&S revenues once we begin recognizing them. To ensure that our 2016 results are comparable year-over-year, we plan to reflect all of the revenues authorized for our 2016 cost of service and earnings from operations this year and reflect the out-of-period revenues as an item impacting comparability. Consistent with the revenue-recognition factors on Slide 4, this item will continue into 2017 when we recognize the remaining 7 months of the out-of-period revenues. 
Moving on. Slide 6 shows our quarter-over-quarter comparison for earnings from operations of $0.91 in Q2 last year and $0.66 in Q2 this year. The timing of taxes during the quarter was $0.08 negative. As a reminder, this line is purely a timing item that, in total, will reverse by year-end. A number of smaller miscellaneous items totaled $0.08 negative for the quarter. A nuclear refueling outage during the quarter resulted in $0.06 negative. Regulatory and legal matters totaled $0.05 negative for the quarter and issuing additional sales resulted in $0.03 negative. 
These negative drivers were partially offset by growth in rate-base earnings, which was $0.05 positive for the quarter. This item reflects assets covered by our general rate case and our electric transmission TO rate case. It does not include the Gas Transmission rate case since we did not recognize any revenue increase in Q2. 
Today, we are reaffirming our guidance for earnings from operations of $3.65 to $3.85 per share, and that is shown on Slide 7 along with the GAAP guidance. 
On Slide 8, you can see the underlying assumptions for that guidance, which we've updated to reflect the Phase 1 Gas Transmission rate-case decision. Starting at the top left, we assumed capital expenditures are roughly $5.6 billion for the year, consistent with the last quarter. The gas transmission CapEx is now $700 million, consistent with the amounts authorized in the Phase 1 decision. Last quarter, we showed a range of $500 million to $700 million. 
We've also reduced the electric distribution CapEx by $50 million to reflect our current spending projections. 
Moving to the top right. We've also adjusted our assumption for a weighted average authorize rate base to about $32.4 billion from our previous assumption of about $32.6 billion. Consistent with the Phase 1 Gas Transmission rate-case decision, we've adjusted the Gas Transmission rate base to $2.8 billion, down from $3 billion to $3.4 billion range we showed last quarter. 
This reduction is driven primarily by removal of the roughly $700 million in 2011 through 2014 capital spend that we had expected to true up in rate base this year. As a reminder, rate base incorporates depreciation and deferred taxes, so it's not a one-for-one relationship with capital expenditures, particularly since this capital was spent several years ago. As a result, the rate base impact of this spend is closer to $500 million. 
On the bottom right, I want to reiterate that our 2016 guidance assumes that we receive a final Phase 2 decision in the Gas Transmission rate case this year and that it allocates the disallowance of safety-related spend consistent with the San Bruno penalty decision. The other bullets are consistent with what we've shown here before. 
The bottom line is that, based on these assumptions, we continue to target earning our authorized return on equity across the enterprise plus the net impact of the other earnings factors listed here. 
Turning to Slide 9, the guidance for our 2016 items impacting comparability has been updated to include the Phase 1 Gas Transmission rate-case decision and our assumptions for Phase 2. I'll walk through each of these items briefly. There's no change to the range for pipeline-related costs, which covers the work to reclaim our rights of way. Legal and regulatory-related expenses also remain unchanged. 
The fines and penalties item has been adjusted for 2 items: first, the guidance includes the $24 million accrual for the presiding officer's decision in the gas distribution recordkeeping investigation. And second, the disallowed expense charge for the San Bruno penalty has been reduced from $160 million to $130 million due to the 36-month amortization period. The remaining $30 million will shift to 2017. 
This item excludes any additional potential future fines or penalties beyond our current assumptions for the distribution recordkeeping penalty and the San Bruno penalty. When we have a final Phase 2 decision in the Gas Transmission rate case, we will also include the associated ex parte penalty in this item. 
The Butte Fire related costs are shown next. At this time, we remain unable to estimate the high end of the range for third-party damages associated with the fire. As a reminder, last quarter, we booked $350 million to reflect our estimate of the low end of the range for property damage. This quarter, we recorded an insurance receivable of $260 million, reflecting the low end of the range for estimated insurance recoveries. The remaining amounts reflect our recorded legal and operational cost associated with the Butte Fire. 
Next, we show the new item impacting comparability for the GT&S capital disallowance, which is consistent with the assumptions shown on Slide 4. The last item covers the impact of the timing of the GT&S decision. The $350 million shown here reflects the 29 months of out-of-period revenues we expect to recognize in 2016. As I mentioned, this item will continue into 2017 when we recognize the remaining 7 months. 
Moving on to Slide 10. We currently expect to issue right around $800 million in equity in 2016, so we've eliminated the range we've showed in Q1. The incremental equity required by the new charges to this quarter is roughly offset by the Butte Fire insurance receivable. In the first half of this year, we issued about $300 million to our internal and Dribble programs. 
Turning to Slide 11. We're updating the multiyear CapEx ranges. For gas and electric distribution and generation, the high end of the range continues to reflect the requested amounts in the general rate case through 2019. For gas transmission, the high end of the range through 2018 has been reduced to reflect the lower authorized CapEx in the Phase 1 decision in the Gas Transmission rate case. These expenditures are held flat in 2019. 
For electric transmission, the high end of the range in 2017 now reflects the request in the TO18 electric transmission rate case, which we will file tomorrow. These expenditures are held flat in 2018 and 2019. Taken together, these changes reduce the high end of the range to $6.4 billion, compared to $6.5 billion shown last quarter. The low end of the range remains consistent with our 2015 capital spending. Overall, you can see that we continue to expect robust capital spending going forward. 
On Slide 12, we've updated the rate-base ranges consistent with the capital spending on the previous slide. The high end of the range also assumes that the portion of the 2011 through 2014 capital spend that is subject to audit is added to rate base in 2017. These adjustments narrow the range of rate base to a compound annual growth rate of 5.5% to 6.5% between 2017 and 2019. 
Finally, we've added a new Slide 13 showing our dividend payout ratio targets. Consistent with our announcement during the quarter, we increased the dividend this year by about 8% to $1.96 per share. We're targeting a 55% to 65% payout ratio with a specific objective of reaching 60% by 2019.

So our guidance assumes that the Phase 2 decision allocates the San Bruno penalty disallowance consistent with the original allocation. So about 80% is a capital disallowance and about 20% as expense. As you know, we've been accruing the capital portion of the disallowance since we first originally received that decision. And so really, what remains outstanding is the disallowance for expense. And what we've talked about in the past is that disallowance for that expense is really a disallowance of incremental revenues. So I would say the one key change for the quarter is that, given the 36-month amortization period, which prevents us from recognizing all of the true-up revenues, essentially, we will only recognize about $130 million of that San Bruno expense disallowance here in 2016. The remaining $30 million, which we had thought would be recognized in '16, is now expected to be recognized in 2017, assuming that the allocation between capital and expense does not change in the Phase 2 decision."

I appreciate you joining us this morning on what I know is a busy day for all of you. So I'm going to start with some opening remarks and then turn it over to Jason to go through our financial results. 
We continue to believe that the key focus areas shown on Slide 3 provide the foundation for operational and financial success, so I'll start with how we're thinking about the future in the context of California's clean energy policies. With the passage of AB 350 (sic) [ SB 350 ] last year, California will be doubling its energy efficiency goals and increasing the renewable portfolio standard to 50% by 2030. Over time, these mandates will impact both our electric procurement needs and our investment opportunities. 
Now on the investment side, California's policies will drive capital expenditures in both the electric distribution and transmission systems. We're going to have to continue to upgrade the distribution grid to support increasing levels of distributed resources, and we'll need new and upgraded transmission lines to support the utility scale renewables required to meet the higher RPS standards. 
On the procurement side, we expect electric demand to decrease as customers continue to reduce the energy they need from PG&E through energy efficiency and distributed generation. We also expect that some cities will pursue community choice aggregation, where they will purchase their own generation. 
As we considered the changing energy landscape in California, it became clear to us that we needed to take a hard look at the future of Diablo Canyon. Working with a diverse coalition of labor and environmental groups, we crafted a joint proposal to retire Diablo Canyon at the end of its current license terms, which are 2024 for 1 year and 2025 for another, and replace it with a greenhouse gas-free portfolio of renewable energy, energy efficiency and energy storage. We've also voluntarily committed to a 55% RPS target beginning in 2031. 
I'm very pleased to report that the state lands commission recently extended the lease for Diablo Canyon intake and outflow structures so that it now runs through the current NRC license terms, and that was an important first step in carrying out our plan. In August, we'll be filing an application for CPUC approval of the joint proposal by the end of 2017. We believe the joint proposal fully supports California's long-term clean energy goals while providing time for a thoughtful transition to new greenhouse gas-free resources. 
Turning to customer expectations. We've made significant progress in all of our key rate cases during the quarter. As you know, we received a final decision in the first phase of the 2015 Gas Transmission & Storage Rate Case in June. The decision acknowledged the need to continue investing in the safety of the system and authorized revenues for much of the work that we had requested. Given the significant delays in the case, it also included revenues for an additional attrition year in 2018. 
In a separate phase of the case, the commission will consider how to allocate the $850 million disallowance ordered last year as part of the San Bruno penalty decision. And we hope to get a final Phase 2 decision sometime this fall. And Jason going to take you through our expectations around the financial impacts of that decision, which is quite complex. 
Moving on to our general rate case, which covers most of our business, we've been engaged in settlement discussions with other parties over the last few months. Last week, we filed a notice of settlement conference, which will take place on August 3. But given the confidentiality of settlement discussions, we can't really comment further today, but we do consider this a positive development. 
We're also continuing to have settlement discussions in the TO17 rate case. The rates are in place subject to refund while the case is pending. And tomorrow, we'll be filing our next electric transmission rate case, TO18. We'll be requesting an additional $100 million in capital expenditures, which we've incorporated into our multiyear projections. 
So let me shift to the operational side of things. As we get into the driest part of the year, we've launched aggressive fire preparedness efforts focused on prevention, detection and response. Although we have had more rain this year than last, California's experiencing significant tree mortality following several years of drought. To mitigate this increased fire risk, we're supplementing our annual inspections by conducting daily aerial patrols and proactive foot patrols over fire-prone parts of our service territory. 
And finally, we continue to work towards resolving outstanding issues. In June, we received the presiding officer's decision in the gas distribution recordkeeping investigation. Overall, we thought the decision was balanced, recognizing the actions we've taken to improve our records in the safety of the system and finding that many of the violations were isolated rather than systemic issues. The Safety and Enforcement Division in the city of Carmel have appealed the decision, seeking a higher fine, and we're now waiting for a commission to issue a final decision. 
The federal trial in the -- the trial in the federal criminal case began in June, and the case was submitted to the jury yesterday. Because we're in the sensitive part of the trial, we're just not in a position to comment on any of the specific evidence or testimony. I can tell you that we continue to believe that no PG&E employee knowingly and willfully violated the law, but now it's in the hands of the jury. 
So to sum things up, we're working to resolve all of our pending rate cases, and we continue to make steady progress on outstanding regulatory and legal issues. And we are well positioned to help drive California's clean energy future through sustained investment. 
So with that, let me hand it over to Jason to walk you through our financials. Jason?"
139813,370265618,1018326,"PG&E Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","PG&E Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Tony. Good morning, everyone. Before I give you the second quarter results, I want to provide a brief overview of the Phase 1 Gas Transmission rate case decision. I'll start by saying that this is one of the most complicated rate case decisio",2155,"Thank you, Tony. Good morning, everyone. Before I give you the second quarter results, I want to provide a brief overview of the Phase 1 Gas Transmission rate case decision. 
I'll start by saying that this is one of the most complicated rate case decisions we've ever seen. Our financial results and projections reflect a number of key assumptions and new items from the decision, so I want to make sure that we're all grounded on those. 
Turning to Slide 4. The first thing I'll cover is revenue recognition. Because the decision came so late in the rate-case period, we have not collected any incremental revenues for 2015 or for the first 7 months of 2016. Those incremental revenues make up our undercollected amounts. There are 2 important points I'd like to cover regarding incremental revenues. 
First, while the Phase 1 decision allows us to begin billing customers on August 1, we will not be able to recognize the full true-up of the undercollected revenues until after the Phase 2 decision when we know the final revenue requirement. 
Second, the Phase 1 decision requires us to amortize these undercollected amounts over 36 months. Utility accounting rules allow us to recognize revenues only if they'll be collected within 24 months of the end of the year. As a result, assuming we get a final Phase 2 decision by year-end, we will recognize 29 months out of the 36-month amortization period in 2016. The 29 months includes the actual revenues we will collect in the remaining 5 months of 2016 plus the amounts we will collect over the subsequent 24 months. This means we'll recognize the remaining 7 months of undercollected amounts in the first quarter of 2017. These revenue recognition factors are important assumptions for the guidance I'll be covering today. 
The decision also impacts our capital expenditure forecasts. First, it permanently disallows a portion of the 2011 through 2014 capital spend that we sought to true-up in this rate case and subjects the remaining portion to audit with potential for future recovery. The decision also includes a number of programs, specific cost caps and one-way balancing accounts. Since we are not in a position to adjust the spending we've already completed, we anticipate that some capital programs will see the authorized amounts over the rate-case period that will not be recoverable in the future. As I'll discuss in a minute, we've taken a onetime charge for this during the quarter for those items. 
And finally, the Phase 2 decision allocating the $850 million San Bruno penalty creates some additional uncertainty. Several parties have suggested that all of the $850 million should be allocated to expense. For purposes of today's presentation, we assume that we receive a final Phase 2 decision this year and that the penalty will be allocated to roughly $690 million in capital and $160 million in expense, consistent with the original San Bruno penalty decision. We'll obviously need to make adjustments if the Phase 2 decision changes that allocation. 
So with that overview, let's go through the financials. Slide 5 shows our results for the second quarter. Earnings from operations came in at $0.66. GAAP earnings, including the items impacting comparability, are also shown here. Pipeline-related expenses came in at $27 million pretax for the quarter. Our legal and regulatory-related expenses were $14 million pretax, and fines and penalties were $172 million pretax. 
The fines and penalties item reflects 2 components this quarter. The first component represents our estimate of the disallowed safety-related capital, resulting from the San Bruno penalty decision, which we are accruing as we complete the work. This item totaled $148 million pretax for the quarter. 
The second component is a fine of $24 million for the gas distribution recordkeeping investigation. For now, we reflected the presiding officer's decision. We'll make any necessary adjustments when the commission rules on the appeals. The Butte Fire related cost also reflect 2 components. First, we booked $49 million pretax for additional cleanup, repair and legal costs associated with the Butte Fire. We do not expect any additional cleanup and repair costs in the future. 
This item is offset by a positive insurance receivable of $260 million, which reflects the low end of the range for estimated insurance recoveries. The 2 components net to a positive $211 million pretax. 
One important note regarding the insurance receivable. While we recorded the low end of the range at this time, we plan to seek full recovery of cost through insurance and believe that nearly all of the third-party claims will ultimately be recovered through insurance. So the $260 million receivable should not be interpreted as a ceiling on insurance recovery. 
The next line item, GT&S capital disallowance, is new this quarter. We booked a charge of $190 million pretax, reflecting the 2 components of disallowed capital I discussed on Slide 4, which are the $135 million for work performed in 2011 through 2014, plus $55 million for capital spend in 2015 through 2018 that we expect will exceed authorized cost caps. 
The last line relates to the impact of the timing of the Gas Transmission rate-case decision. This is where we will reflect out-of-period GT&S revenues once we begin recognizing them. To ensure that our 2016 results are comparable year-over-year, we plan to reflect all of the revenues authorized for our 2016 cost of service and earnings from operations this year and reflect the out-of-period revenues as an item impacting comparability. Consistent with the revenue-recognition factors on Slide 4, this item will continue into 2017 when we recognize the remaining 7 months of the out-of-period revenues. 
Moving on. Slide 6 shows our quarter-over-quarter comparison for earnings from operations of $0.91 in Q2 last year and $0.66 in Q2 this year. The timing of taxes during the quarter was $0.08 negative. As a reminder, this line is purely a timing item that, in total, will reverse by year-end. A number of smaller miscellaneous items totaled $0.08 negative for the quarter. A nuclear refueling outage during the quarter resulted in $0.06 negative. Regulatory and legal matters totaled $0.05 negative for the quarter and issuing additional sales resulted in $0.03 negative. 
These negative drivers were partially offset by growth in rate-base earnings, which was $0.05 positive for the quarter. This item reflects assets covered by our general rate case and our electric transmission TO rate case. It does not include the Gas Transmission rate case since we did not recognize any revenue increase in Q2. 
Today, we are reaffirming our guidance for earnings from operations of $3.65 to $3.85 per share, and that is shown on Slide 7 along with the GAAP guidance. 
On Slide 8, you can see the underlying assumptions for that guidance, which we've updated to reflect the Phase 1 Gas Transmission rate-case decision. Starting at the top left, we assumed capital expenditures are roughly $5.6 billion for the year, consistent with the last quarter. The gas transmission CapEx is now $700 million, consistent with the amounts authorized in the Phase 1 decision. Last quarter, we showed a range of $500 million to $700 million. 
We've also reduced the electric distribution CapEx by $50 million to reflect our current spending projections. 
Moving to the top right. We've also adjusted our assumption for a weighted average authorize rate base to about $32.4 billion from our previous assumption of about $32.6 billion. Consistent with the Phase 1 Gas Transmission rate-case decision, we've adjusted the Gas Transmission rate base to $2.8 billion, down from $3 billion to $3.4 billion range we showed last quarter. 
This reduction is driven primarily by removal of the roughly $700 million in 2011 through 2014 capital spend that we had expected to true up in rate base this year. As a reminder, rate base incorporates depreciation and deferred taxes, so it's not a one-for-one relationship with capital expenditures, particularly since this capital was spent several years ago. As a result, the rate base impact of this spend is closer to $500 million. 
On the bottom right, I want to reiterate that our 2016 guidance assumes that we receive a final Phase 2 decision in the Gas Transmission rate case this year and that it allocates the disallowance of safety-related spend consistent with the San Bruno penalty decision. The other bullets are consistent with what we've shown here before. 
The bottom line is that, based on these assumptions, we continue to target earning our authorized return on equity across the enterprise plus the net impact of the other earnings factors listed here. 
Turning to Slide 9, the guidance for our 2016 items impacting comparability has been updated to include the Phase 1 Gas Transmission rate-case decision and our assumptions for Phase 2. I'll walk through each of these items briefly. There's no change to the range for pipeline-related costs, which covers the work to reclaim our rights of way. Legal and regulatory-related expenses also remain unchanged. 
The fines and penalties item has been adjusted for 2 items: first, the guidance includes the $24 million accrual for the presiding officer's decision in the gas distribution recordkeeping investigation. And second, the disallowed expense charge for the San Bruno penalty has been reduced from $160 million to $130 million due to the 36-month amortization period. The remaining $30 million will shift to 2017. 
This item excludes any additional potential future fines or penalties beyond our current assumptions for the distribution recordkeeping penalty and the San Bruno penalty. When we have a final Phase 2 decision in the Gas Transmission rate case, we will also include the associated ex parte penalty in this item. 
The Butte Fire related costs are shown next. At this time, we remain unable to estimate the high end of the range for third-party damages associated with the fire. As a reminder, last quarter, we booked $350 million to reflect our estimate of the low end of the range for property damage. This quarter, we recorded an insurance receivable of $260 million, reflecting the low end of the range for estimated insurance recoveries. The remaining amounts reflect our recorded legal and operational cost associated with the Butte Fire. 
Next, we show the new item impacting comparability for the GT&S capital disallowance, which is consistent with the assumptions shown on Slide 4. The last item covers the impact of the timing of the GT&S decision. The $350 million shown here reflects the 29 months of out-of-period revenues we expect to recognize in 2016. As I mentioned, this item will continue into 2017 when we recognize the remaining 7 months. 
Moving on to Slide 10. We currently expect to issue right around $800 million in equity in 2016, so we've eliminated the range we've showed in Q1. The incremental equity required by the new charges to this quarter is roughly offset by the Butte Fire insurance receivable. In the first half of this year, we issued about $300 million to our internal and Dribble programs. 
Turning to Slide 11. We're updating the multiyear CapEx ranges. For gas and electric distribution and generation, the high end of the range continues to reflect the requested amounts in the general rate case through 2019. For gas transmission, the high end of the range through 2018 has been reduced to reflect the lower authorized CapEx in the Phase 1 decision in the Gas Transmission rate case. These expenditures are held flat in 2019. 
For electric transmission, the high end of the range in 2017 now reflects the request in the TO18 electric transmission rate case, which we will file tomorrow. These expenditures are held flat in 2018 and 2019. Taken together, these changes reduce the high end of the range to $6.4 billion, compared to $6.5 billion shown last quarter. The low end of the range remains consistent with our 2015 capital spending. Overall, you can see that we continue to expect robust capital spending going forward. 
On Slide 12, we've updated the rate-base ranges consistent with the capital spending on the previous slide. The high end of the range also assumes that the portion of the 2011 through 2014 capital spend that is subject to audit is added to rate base in 2017. These adjustments narrow the range of rate base to a compound annual growth rate of 5.5% to 6.5% between 2017 and 2019. 
Finally, we've added a new Slide 13 showing our dividend payout ratio targets. Consistent with our announcement during the quarter, we increased the dividend this year by about 8% to $1.96 per share. We're targeting a 55% to 65% payout ratio with a specific objective of reaching 60% by 2019. 
I know we've covered a lot this morning. Let me close by saying that we continue to reach important regulatory, financial and operational milestones, and we are confident in our ability to deliver on our plans as we position the company for future success.

So our guidance assumes that the Phase 2 decision allocates the San Bruno penalty disallowance consistent with the original allocation. So about 80% is a capital disallowance and about 20% as expense. As you know, we've been accruing the capital portion of the disallowance since we first originally received that decision. And so really, what remains outstanding is the disallowance for expense. And what we've talked about in the past is that disallowance for that expense is really a disallowance of incremental revenues. So I would say the one key change for the quarter is that, given the 36-month amortization period, which prevents us from recognizing all of the true-up revenues, essentially, we will only recognize about $130 million of that San Bruno expense disallowance here in 2016. The remaining $30 million, which we had thought would be recognized in '16, is now expected to be recognized in 2017, assuming that the allocation between capital and expense does not change in the Phase 2 decision."

That was a small increase in 2017 that we held flat then in 2018 and 2019. The high end of the range and really then what provides probably the greatest sort of variability in that range relates to the general rate case, which covers the period 2017 through 2019 that we're in the process of negotiating.

I'm going to start with the third quarter earnings presentation that we issued this morning and then we'll move to the business update presentation. Slide 3 shows our results for the third quarter. Earnings f",916,"Thank you, Tony, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start with the third quarter earnings presentation that we issued this morning and then we'll move to the business update presentation. 
Slide 3 shows our results for the third quarter. Earnings from operations came in at $0.94. I know this is lower than many of you expected, but we are reaffirming our guidance from earnings from operations for the full year. As I'll discuss more in a minute, the Q3 results are largely driven by timing items. Our third quarter GAAP earnings, including the items impacting comparability, were also shown on Slide 3. Pipeline-related expenses were $31 million pretax this quarter. The charge for legal and regulatory-related expenses was $23 million pretax, and fines and penalties were $67 million pretax and are primarily related to the San Bruno penalty decision. We're showing $60 million pretax for the Butte fire-related cost net of insurance, which are largely for legal costs associated with the Butte fire. We did not adjust our insurance receivable this third quarter. However, we do intend to seek recovery of all insured losses from our insurance carriers. And as a reminder, the current receivables should not be viewed as a ceiling on insurance recoveries. 
Moving to Slide 4. You'll see our quarter-over-quarter comparison of earnings from operations of $0.84 in Q3 of last year to $0.94 in Q3 of this year. As a result of the Phase 1 gas transmission storage rate case decision, we increased our rates in August to begin a recovery in the higher improved revenues. This resulted in $0.11 of higher revenues compared to Q3 of last year. 
We also continue to see $0.05 positive for growth in rate concerns, and regulatory and legal matters totaled $0.05 positive for the quarter. This item includes some incentive revenue awards. Timing and taxes was $0.04 negative for the quarter. And as a reminder, this is purely a timing item that will net to 0 by year-end. As a result, you can expect to see a $0.20 pick up in the fourth quarter to fully offset the amount recognized through Q3. We also had $0.03 negative for an increase in outstanding shares and $0.04 negative for a number of miscellaneous items. 
Turning to Slide 5. We are reaffirming our guidance from earnings from operations to $3.65 to $3.85 per share. GAAP guidance is shown here as well. We're also reaffirming our expectation of roughly $800 million in equity issuance this year. 
Slide 6 shows our updated guidance assumptions. We assume capital expenditures of roughly $5.7 billion, which is slightly higher than our second quarter projection of $5.6 billion. We've increased the gas distribution number to reflect our best estimate of spend through the end of the year. 
Our assumption for weighted average rate base is $32.4 billion consistent with last quarter. And in the bottom right, we've updated the other factors affecting earnings from operations to reflect the proposed Phase 2 decision we received earlier this week in the Gas Transmission rate case. Our guidance assumes that the proposed decision is approved this year without any material modifications. If we do not receive a final Phase 2 decision before the end of the year, our earnings will be reduced by about $0.25. And we continue to target earning our 10.4% CPUC-authorized return on equity across the enterprise, plus the net impact of the other earnings factors listed here. 
Moving to Slide 7. We've updated the ranges for several of the 2016 items impacting comparability. The range for pipeline-related expenses is the same as last quarter. For legal and regulatory-related expenses, we've updated the slide to reflect our expectation that will come in at about $75 million, which is the high end of the previous range. The fines and penalties increased by $15 million pretax, reflecting a number of updates, which I'll cover in a minute. 
We've also updated the Butte fire-related cost reflect a charge of $16 million pretax in Q3, largely driven by legal costs. We remain unable to estimate the high end of the range at this time. The remaining items are unchanged from last quarter. The tables at the bottom of the page shows our updates to fines and penalties. First, the charge for disallowed capital has increased by $6 million. We have now fully accrued for all of this safety-related capital we expect to be disallowed in the Phase 2 gas transmission decision. 
Second, we incurred $4 million charge for the ex parte penalty associated with the higher gas transmission revenues we collected in August and September. Assuming the proposed Phase 2 decision is approved this year, we will record an additional $54 million in Q4 to reflect the full 2016 impact of the ex parte penalty. 
Third, we increased the gas distribution record-keeping fine by $2 million to reflect the modified presiding officer's decision. The total is now $26 million. 
And finally, we've included a $3 million charge as a result of the federal criminal verdict. 
So that concludes the Q3 earnings update. We continue to have confidence in our ability to achieve our guidance this year, assuming the proposed Phase 2 decision of the Gas Transmission rate case is approved in December. With the resolution of a number of significant issues over the last several months, we have much greater clarity on our future operational and financial performance, which we've laid out in the business update. 
So with that, let me turn it back over to Tony."

I'd encourage all of you to have the presentation in front of you as I share my comments because I think it'll be a little easier to follow along. As you",2585,"Thanks, Jason. Let me turn to the business update presentation that we issued earlier this morning. I'd encourage all of you to have the presentation in front of you as I share my comments because I think it'll be a little easier to follow along. 
As you can see on Slide 3, we're going to cover 3 areas today. First, I'm going to review the progress we've made over the last 6 years because we have come a long way. We know we still have more work to do, but I am really proud of what the team has accomplished, and I want to share some of those results with you. Second, I'm going to talk about some of the things that really provide PG&E with a strategic advantage. And third, I'm going to talk about what's driving growth going forward. As part of that, Jason is going to review the 2017 earnings guidance as well as our updated CapEx and rate base guidance through 2019. Between our 6.5% to 7% rate base growth and our above average dividend per share growth, we expect to deliver strong returns over the next several years. 
So let me start with the progress that we made. Slide 5 provides the high-level overview of the company. As you can see, over 90% of our revenues are set by the California Public Utilities Commission with the remainder set by FERC. And nearly half of our revenues are passed through for things like energy procurement costs and public purpose programs. 
Turning to Slide 6. One of the things I'm most proud of is how we've embedded safety into our core governance structures. Safety is really the foundation of everything that we do. When I joined the company in 2011, we began a back-to-basics strategy with safety at the forefront. Let me give you some examples of that. 
At the leadership level, we've supplemented our team with new board members and executives who bring significant utility experience. At the Board of Directors, we brought on a number of former utility CEOs like Anne Shen Smith from Southern Cal Gas, Dick Kelly from Xcel Energy, and Fred Fowler from Spectra Energy. We brought in a whole new leadership team on the gas side of the business starting with Nick Stavropoulos, who brings more than 35 years of experience in the gas industry. We've included bios for some of our leadership team in the appendix. 
In 2012, we became the first utility in the industry to publish a dashboard that tracks how we're performing on key public safety metrics such as emergency response times and reduction of gas dig-ins and electric wire downs. And that focus has driven significant operational improvements, as I'll discuss in just a minute. 
Several years ago, we also restructured our short-term variable compensation plan so that 50% is now tied to our performance on public and employee safety. This incentive program applies to all of our management employees as well as some of our union representative employees. 
And finally, we've done a lot a work on our safety culture. This is probably the most critical piece because it's our culture that ultimately drives the performance that we're looking for. Part of our strategy has been to install a continuous improvement mindset by encouraging employees to identify gaps and opportunities and then close them through benchmarking and process improvement. We also wanted to make sure that every employee felt comfortable raising concerns no matter how big or small. So we made a number of changes to encourage all employees to speak up when something doesn't seem right. For example, we worked with our unions to develop a nonpunitive self-reporting policy. We've also adapted the nuclear industry's corrective action program across the company to make it easy for employees to report things that need to be fixed. In fact, employees can now report corrective action items through a simple app on their smart devices. And we've created a number of awards to publicly recognize employees when they do speak up so that we're encouraging and reinforcing that behavior. All of these efforts have really paid off. 
As you can see on Slide 7, we've achieved industry-leading performance on a number of gas safety metrics. We've reduced our emergency response time and gas dig-ins by about 40%. And we virtually eliminated our leak backlog by completely redesigning our approach to finding and repairing leaks including deploying sophisticated new technologies that are 1,000 times more sensitive than traditional detection equipment. 
We've also replaced or upgraded hundreds of miles of distribution and transmission pipeline. We're the first utility in the country to be certified under PAS-55, ISO-55001 and RC14001 for our asset management programs. And we're the first company in the U.S. to meet the rigor of the American Petroleum Institute 1173 standard for pipeline safety and safety culture. So I couldn't be more proud of how the team has turned the gas business around. 
We've also made tremendous improvements on the electric side of the business, as you can see on Slide 8. Our emergency response performance is now in the first quartile. And as a result of our investments in SmartMeters, automated switches and circuit upgrades, we've delivered 7 straight years of record-breaking electric reliability. Our customers are experiencing fewer and shorter outages than ever before. All of these improvements are really showing up in our customer satisfaction scores. While we still have more work to do, our J.D. Power results across all customer classes have increased steadily since 2012, as you can see on Slide 9. 
The improvements we made in safety and reliability over the last 6 years have put us in a position to deliver strong financial results going forward. Earlier this year, we announced our first dividend increase in 6 years, and we've committed to achieving a roughly 60% payout ratio by 2019. Combined with our expected rate base growth, we're confident we can deliver a strong overall return for our shareholders. 
Turning to the next section. I want to highlight a few areas that provide PG&E with a strategic advantage, particularly as our industry undergoes significant change. One of the trends we've seen over the last decade is the increasing focus on climate change and greenhouse gas reduction, and that trend is only going to intensify in coming years. At PG&E, we've been committed to sustainability for decades and we're one of the greenest utilities in the country. 
As you can see on Slide 13, nearly 60% of our electric deliveries come from carbon-free and renewable resources. That's almost twice the national average. And that's important to our customers who pride themselves on environmental stewardship. PG&E's customers are leading the way for the country, with 25% of all rooftop solar installations and 20% of all electric vehicles. 
We've also expanded our engagement efforts, establishing an advisory council last year to help inform our sustainability strategy and priorities. This council is made up of a diverse group of leaders from environmental organizations like Ceres and the Natural Resources Defense Council as well as policy experts, academia and businesses. And we've consistently been recognized as one of the leading companies by a number of third-party sustainability assessments. 
We've also had the privilege of operating in a state that has a number of constructive regulatory mechanisms, which is shown on Slide 14. In California, revenues have been decoupled from sales for decades to help encourage energy efficiency so PG&E's revenues are not impacted by changes in load. The CPUC has also authorized a number of balancing accounts that allow us to track and recover costs that are more unpredictable such as the cost to respond to earthquakes and other large scale emergencies. Our rate cases are based on forward-looking test years and the CPUC is now reviewing all requests through the lens of risk mitigation. We think this is the right approach and aligns well with our strategic planning process, which starts with a detailed risk assessment of all of our assets. In fact, earlier this year, the CPUC's safety and enforcement division found PG&E's risk management process to be industry-leading. 
California also has a separate cost of capital proceeding that establishes the authorized capital structure and return on equity over a 3-year period for all of the IOUs. Our current 10.4% return on equity is fixed through 2017. 
Turning to Slide 15. California continues to be a leader on energy policy. The state is now targeting to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to at least 40% below 1990 levels by 2030. To get there, California will be increasing renewables to 50%, doubling energy efficiency and electrifying the transportation sector, and PG&E will continue to be a critical partner in helping the state achieve its energy policy goals. 
So that brings me to our last differentiator. California's policy goals around safety and environmental leadership will continue to provide opportunities for sustained infrastructure investment. To support safety and reliability, PG&E is investing in multi-year programs to enhance our gas, electric and generation assets, and I'll provide some specific examples in just a minute. To enable California's clean energy economy, PG&E will continue to modernize the grid to ensure that our systems can effectively integrate both the increased renewables and distributed energy resources. Longer term, California is working on some of the largest rail and water infrastructure projects in the country, which we expect will require hundreds of millions in PG&E investments over the next 15 years. With our proven track record of being able to finance and deliver on these types of large-scale projects, we are well positioned to help the state achieve all of its goals at a reasonable cost. 
This brings me to our last section which focuses on our future growth profile. As you can see on Slide 18, we have 3 focus areas: continuing to enhance safety and reliability, enabling California's clean energy economy, and ensuring that our customers' rates will continue to be affordable, particularly in light of future load projections. 
Slide 19 shows a few examples of some of the longer-term programs we'll be executing to enhance safety and reliability. On the gas side of the business, we've been steadily increasing the percentage of our gas transmission pipelines that is capable of in-line inspection and we're targeting to reach about 65% by 2026. In fact, we partnered with a number of companies to create the next generation of in-line inspection tools that can capture even more detailed information about the integrity of the pipeline without any interruption to gas service. We also continue to increase the number of miles of gas distribution pipeline we're replacing each year. 
On the electric side, by 2019, we're targeting to install automated switches on about 45% of our urban distribution lines and upgrade about 85% of our urban substations. These investments will continue to enhance electric reliability by increasing our ability to automatically reroute power during outages. 
California's clean energy policies will also drive continued investment. As you can see on Slide 20, we expect to spend about $1 billion through 2020 on grid modernization projects. As I mentioned earlier, our customers are already adopters of technology and we already have the most solar route installations and electric vehicles in the country. The demands on our distribution grid are greater than ever before and we need to continue to invest in technologies and systems that seamlessly integrate distributed energy resources and accommodate to a power flow. We also expect to play a critical role in helping to electrify the transportation sector by building out the necessary charging infrastructure. And we see this trend continuing well into the next decade as the state moves towards its longer-term goal of increased renewables, energy efficiency, energy storage and electric vehicles. 
With all of these investments in our future we are keenly focused on affordability. As you can see a Slide 21, we're in good shape today. Our builds are 30% lower than the national average, and over the last couple of decades, our electric rates have grown in line with the rate of inflation. But we know it will be challenging to continue this trend. Over the next 10 to 15 years, we expect our bundled electric load to decline due to a combination of increased energy efficiency and demand response and communities electing to procure their own generation and through community choice aggregation. In fact, this was a major driver behind our decision not to seek to extend the Diablo Canyon power plant license beyond the current expiration dates of 2024 and 2025. As you can see on Slide 22, we have a number of strategies to manage this change. 
Our current electric portfolio gives us a lot of flexibility. We purchased over half of our energy from third parties and about 30% of the megawatt powers under contracts are expiring over the next 5 years. As I mentioned earlier, our revenues have been decoupled from sales for decades. And we have mechanisms in place to allocate appropriate cost to our departing customers. So while declining load doesn't impact our earnings, it does shift cost among our customers under the current rate structures. That's why our strategy also includes modernizing our rate structures. As the use of our grid changes, the way our rates are designed needs to be changed as well. Both the state legislature and the Public Utilities Commission have recognized the need for reform, and we've made some progress over the last year through flattening the residential tiers and moving new net energy metering customers to time of use rates. We've also shifted the peak period for our time of use rates from midday to the evening hours in recognition of the significant amount of solar generation now available during the day. The more work needs to be done. 
In September, the CPUC issued a draft white paper on its distributed energy resources action plan which outlined its vision for effectively integrating distributed energy resources into the system. Part of that vision is to develop rate structures for the new grid uses while ensuring that rates remain affordable for non-DER customers. We look forward to working with the commission over the next several years to update our rate structures to better reflect the current and future uses of the grid. 
At the same time, we're working to drive sustainable efficiencies in our own cost structures. Through our benchmarking and continuous improvement efforts, we've successfully reduced cost in a number of areas over the last few years. Going forward, we'll continue to capture savings through process improvement, technology investments and procurement efficiencies while maintaining a strong focus on safety and reliability. 
So as I think you can see, we're at the forefront of a lot of exciting industry changes. California's vision of a decarbonized economy creates a lot of investment opportunities. As we just discussed, we are well positioned to manage changes to our load profile as customer choice increases. 
So before I turn it back over to Jason to talk about our updated guidance, I want to say again how proud I am of the progress that this team has made over the last 6 years. We have had a relentless focus on safety and reliability, and you can really see the results of that in our operational metrics. I'm excited about our future and confident in our ability to deliver strong operational and financial results going forward. 
So with that, let me turn it back over to Jason"
139813,403758895,1074181,"PG&E Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2016",2016-11-04,"Earnings Calls","PG&E Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Tony. I'm going to finish up today's presentation by reviewing our 2017 earnings guidance and updated CapEx and rate base guidance through 2019. Turning to Slide 25. Our 2017 guidance on an earnings from operations basis is $3.55 to $3.75 per",1020,"Thank you, Tony. I'm going to finish up today's presentation by reviewing our 2017 earnings guidance and updated CapEx and rate base guidance through 2019. 
Turning to Slide 25. Our 2017 guidance on an earnings from operations basis is $3.55 to $3.75 per share. We're also providing ranges for the items impacting comparability, which I'll come back to in a minute after we review the guidance assumptions on Slide 26. 
Starting with the upper left corner, you'll see we're assuming capital expenditures of roughly $6 billion. We've included the breakdown by rate case here. In the upper right corner, our estimated weighted average rate base is about $34.3 billion for the year. Both the CapEx and rate base assumptions are within the ranges we provided last quarter. In the lower left, we continue to assume a CPUC authorized equity ratio of 52% and a return on equity of 10.4%. 
Finally, in the bottom right corner, we list some of the other factors we believe will affect 2017 earnings from operations. Our guidance assumes that both the GRC settlement and the proposed Phase 2 decision in the Gas Transmission rate case are approved without material change. And you's will recall that we do not seek recovery in the gas transmission rate case for about $50 million of cost in 2017. We're also showing a positive item here for incentive revenues and other benefits which include things like our energy efficiency programs. I'll note that we're no longer showing a positive item for tax benefits consistent with the guidance we previously provided. And we continue to expect that earnings will be offset by below-the-line costs which includes things like charitable contributions, advertising and certain environmental costs. In 2017, we expect that a number of other -- we expect that the other earnings factors listed here will largely offset each other. As a result, we are targeting to earn the CPUC authorized return on equity on rate base for the enterprise as a whole. 
Turning to Slide 27. The guidance for our items impacting comparability ranges from a negative $35 million to a positive $40 million pretax. The [indiscernible] are consistent with items we had in 2016. The estimated range for pipeline-related expenses is $80 million to $125 million pretax. This item relates to clearing our gas transmission rights-of-way. While we're confident in our ability to fully complete the program within this range, there is a chance that a small portion of that work could slip to 2018 due to permitting requirements. We'll monitor the program throughout the year and provide updates as we have better information. 
The second component is legal and regulatory-related expenses, which we estimate to be between $10 million and $40 million pretax. This represents costs incurred with enforcement, regulatory and litigation activities regarding natural gas matters and regulatory communications. 
The third component is for potential fines and penalties again related to natural gas matters and regulatory communications. We're showing a total of $30 million which reflect the 2017 portion of the disallowed expense expected from the Phase 2 Gas Transmission rate case decision. While we haven't yet reflected the 2017 portion of the ex parte penalty, we'd expect to report an additional $40 million pretax after the proposed Phase 2 decision is approved. These fire-related costs were uncertain in 2017 but this item will affect any updates to third-party liability estimates, legal costs and insurance receivables. And finally, for the Gas Transmission rate case, we're showing a positive $160 million for the portion of the 2015 and 2016 out-of-period revenues that we plan to recognize in 2017. 
Turning to Slide 20. We assume equity issuance of about $400 million to $600 million in 2017. That compares to roughly $800 million in 2016. The main drivers for the difference are the lower expected San Bruno penalty costs and gas transmission capital disallowance. Partially offsetting these reductions are higher capital expenditures. 
After 2017, we expect our unrecovered cost to continue to decline as we wrap up the gas transmission rights-of-way program. As a result, in 2018 and 2019, we expect to be able to meet our equity needs largely through our internal programs which could generate about $350 million annually. 
Moving to Slides 29 and 30. We've updated our CapEx and rate base guidance through 2019. This year, we're including a breakdown by major rate case. For the General Rate Case, the numbers are consistent with the all party settlement we announced earlier this year. From the gas transmission and storage rate case, the numbers are consistent with the assumptions embedded in our Q2 guidance with one exception. We previously assumed that roughly $400 million would be added to rate base in 2017 for the 2011 through 2014 capital spend subject to audit. Because that audit has not yet begun, we're now assuming that $400 million will be added to rate base in 2018. For the electric transmission audit rate case, we saw a small range which represents the TO18 request at the high end and the TO17 settlement at the low end. We've held these assumptions flat through 2019. 
We've also listed some items here that are not included in our rate base assumptions including primarily any new investments that will be included in the 2019 gas transmission rate case and the 2018 and 2019 electric transmission rate cases. 
Finally, 5 31 is just a reminder that we are targeting a roughly 60% payout ratio for our dividend by 2019. On average, this should provide for above average dividend per share growth. I knew we've covered a lot this morning. Let me conclude by reiterating the points Tony started with. Over the last 6 years, our focus on safety has resulted in significant operational improvements. We have a number of strategic advantages that helped position us to effectively manage industry changes. And we believe our roughly 6.5% to 7.5% -- sorry, we believe our roughly 6.5% to 7% rate base growth and above average dividends per share growth through 2019 make us an attractive investment. 
With that, I'll open it up for questions in the time we have remaining."

I'm going to start with the third quarter earnings presentation that we issued this morning and then we'll move to the business update presentation. 
Slide 3 shows our results for the third quarter. Earnings from operations came in at $0.94. I know this is lower than many of you expected, but we are reaffirming our guidance from earnings from operations for the full year. As I'll discuss more in a minute, the Q3 results are largely driven by timing items. Our third quarter GAAP earnings, including the items impacting comparability, were also shown on Slide 3. Pipeline-related expenses were $31 million pretax this quarter. The charge for legal and regulatory-related expenses was $23 million pretax, and fines and penalties were $67 million pretax and are primarily related to the San Bruno penalty decision. We're showing $60 million pretax for the Butte fire-related cost net of insurance, which are largely for legal costs associated with the Butte fire. We did not adjust our insurance receivable this third quarter. However, we do intend to seek recovery of all insured losses from our insurance carriers. And as a reminder, the current receivables should not be viewed as a ceiling on insurance recoveries. 
Moving to Slide 4. You'll see our quarter-over-quarter comparison of earnings from operations of $0.84 in Q3 of last year to $0.94 in Q3 of this year. As a result of the Phase 1 gas transmission storage rate case decision, we increased our rates in August to begin a recovery in the higher improved revenues. This resulted in $0.11 of higher revenues compared to Q3 of last year. 
We also continue to see $0.05 positive for growth in rate concerns, and regulatory and legal matters totaled $0.05 positive for the quarter. This item includes some incentive revenue awards. Timing and taxes was $0.04 negative for the quarter. And as a reminder, this is purely a timing item that will net to 0 by year-end. As a result, you can expect to see a $0.20 pick up in the fourth quarter to fully offset the amount recognized through Q3. We also had $0.03 negative for an increase in outstanding shares and $0.04 negative for a number of miscellaneous items. 
Turning to Slide 5. We are reaffirming our guidance from earnings from operations to $3.65 to $3.85 per share. GAAP guidance is shown here as well. We're also reaffirming our expectation of roughly $800 million in equity issuance this year. 
Slide 6 shows our updated guidance assumptions. We assume capital expenditures of roughly $5.7 billion, which is slightly higher than our second quarter projection of $5.6 billion. We've increased the gas distribution number to reflect our best estimate of spend through the end of the year. 
Our assumption for weighted average rate base is $32.4 billion consistent with last quarter. And in the bottom right, we've updated the other factors affecting earnings from operations to reflect the proposed Phase 2 decision we received earlier this week in the Gas Transmission rate case. Our guidance assumes that the proposed decision is approved this year without any material modifications. If we do not receive a final Phase 2 decision before the end of the year, our earnings will be reduced by about $0.25. And we continue to target earning our 10.4% CPUC-authorized return on equity across the enterprise, plus the net impact of the other earnings factors listed here. 
Moving to Slide 7. We've updated the ranges for several of the 2016 items impacting comparability. The range for pipeline-related expenses is the same as last quarter. For legal and regulatory-related expenses, we've updated the slide to reflect our expectation that will come in at about $75 million, which is the high end of the previous range. The fines and penalties increased by $15 million pretax, reflecting a number of updates, which I'll cover in a minute. 
We've also updated the Butte fire-related cost reflect a charge of $16 million pretax in Q3, largely driven by legal costs. We remain unable to estimate the high end of the range at this time. The remaining items are unchanged from last quarter. The tables at the bottom of the page shows our updates to fines and penalties. First, the charge for disallowed capital has increased by $6 million. We have now fully accrued for all of this safety-related capital we expect to be disallowed in the Phase 2 gas transmission decision. 
Second, we incurred $4 million charge for the ex-parte penalty associated with the higher gas transmission revenues we collected in August and September. Assuming the proposed Phase 2 decision is approved this year, we will record an additional $54 million in Q4 to reflect the full 2016 impact of the ex-parte penalty. 
Third, we increased the gas distribution record-keeping fine by $2 million to reflect the modified presiding officer's decision. The total is now $26 million. 
And finally, we've included a $3 million charge as a result of the federal criminal verdict. 
So that concludes the Q3 earnings update. We continue to have confidence in our ability to achieve our guidance this year, assuming the proposed Phase 2 decision of the Gas Transmission rate case is approved in December. With the resolution of a number of significant issues over the last several months, we have much greater clarity on our future operational and financial performance, which we've laid out in the business update. 
So with that, let me turn it back over to Tony."

Let me turn to the business update presentation that we issued earlier this morning. I'd encourage all of you to have the presentation in front of you as I share my comments because I think it'll be a little easier to follow along. As you",2580,"Thanks, Jason. Let me turn to the business update presentation that we issued earlier this morning. I'd encourage all of you to have the presentation in front of you as I share my comments because I think it'll be a little easier to follow along. 
As you can see on Slide 3, we're going to cover 3 areas today. First, I'm going to review the progress we've made over the last 6 years because we have come a long way. We know we still have more work to do, but I am really proud of what the team has accomplished, and I want to share some of those results with you. Second, I'm going to talk about some of the things that really provide PG&E with a strategic advantage. And third, I'm going to talk about what's driving growth going forward. As part of that, Jason is going to review the 2017 earnings guidance as well as our updated CapEx and rate base guidance through 2019. Between our 6.5% to 7% rate base growth and our above average dividend per share growth, we expect to deliver strong returns over the next several years. 
So let me start with the progress that we made. Slide 5 provides the high-level overview of the company. As you can see, over 90% of our revenues are set by the California Public Utilities Commission with the remainder set by FERC. And nearly half of our revenues are passed through for things like energy procurement costs and public purpose programs. 
Turning to Slide 6. One of the things I'm most proud of is how we've embedded safety into our core governance structures. Safety is really the foundation of everything that we do. When I joined the company in 2011, we began a back-to-basics strategy with safety at the forefront. Let me give you some examples of that. 
At the leadership level, we've supplemented our team with new board members and executives who bring significant utility experience. At the Board of Directors, we brought on a number of former utility CEOs like Anne Shen Smith from Southern Cal Gas, Dick Kelly from Xcel Energy, and Fred Fowler from Spectra Energy. We brought in a whole new leadership team on the gas side of the business starting with Nick Stavropoulos, who brings more than 35 years of experience in the gas industry. We've included bios for some of our leadership team in the appendix. 
In 2012, we became the first utility in the industry to publish a dashboard that tracks how we're performing on key public safety metrics such as emergency response times and reduction of gas dig-ins and electric wire downs. And that focus has driven significant operational improvements, as I'll discuss in just a minute. 
Several years ago, we also restructured our short-term variable compensation plan so that 50% is now tied to our performance on public and employee safety. This incentive program applies to all of our management employees as well as some of our union representative employees. 
And finally, we've done a lot a work on our safety culture. This is probably the most critical piece because it's our culture that ultimately drives the performance that we're looking for. Part of our strategy has been to install a continuous improvement mindset by encouraging employees to identify gaps and opportunities and then close them through benchmarking and process improvement. We also wanted to make sure that every employee felt comfortable raising concerns no matter how big or small. So we made a number of changes to encourage all employees to speak up when something doesn't seem right. For example, we worked with our unions to develop a nonpunitive self-reporting policy. We've also adapted the nuclear industry's corrective action program across the company to make it easy for employees to report things that need to be fixed. In fact, employees can now report corrective action items through a simple app on their smart devices. And we've created a number of awards to publicly recognize employees when they do speak up so that we're encouraging and reinforcing that behavior. All of these efforts have really paid off. 
As you can see on Slide 7, we've achieved industry-leading performance on a number of gas safety metrics. We've reduced our emergency response time and gas dig-ins by about 40%. And we virtually eliminated our leak backlog by completely redesigning our approach to finding and repairing leaks including deploying sophisticated new technologies that are 1,000 times more sensitive than traditional detection equipment. 
We've also replaced or upgraded hundreds of miles of distribution and transmission pipeline. We're the first utility in the country to be certified under PAS-55, ISO-55001 and RC14001 for our asset management programs. And we're the first company in the U.S. to meet the rigor of the American Petroleum Institute 1173 standard for pipeline safety and safety culture. So I couldn't be more proud of how the team has turned the gas business around. 
We've also made tremendous improvements on the electric side of the business, as you can see on Slide 8. Our emergency response performance is now in the first quartile. And as a result of our investments in SmartMeters, automated switches and circuit upgrades, we've delivered 7 straight years of record-breaking electric reliability. Our customers are experiencing fewer and shorter outages than ever before. All of these improvements are really showing up in our customer satisfaction scores. While we still have more work to do, our J.D. Power results across all customer classes have increased steadily since 2012, as you can see on Slide 9. 
The improvements we made in safety and reliability over the last 6 years have put us in a position to deliver strong financial results going forward. Earlier this year, we announced our first dividend increase in 6 years, and we've committed to achieving a roughly 60% payout ratio by 2019. Combined with our expected rate base growth, we're confident we can deliver a strong overall return for our shareholders. 
Turning to the next section. I want to highlight a few areas that provide PG&E with a strategic advantage, particularly as our industry undergoes significant change. One of the trends we've seen over the last decade is the increasing focus on climate change and greenhouse gas reduction, and that trend is only going to intensify in coming years. At PG&E, we've been committed to sustainability for decades and we're one of the greenest utilities in the country. 
As you can see on Slide 13, nearly 60% of our electric deliveries come from carbon-free and renewable resources. That's almost twice the national average. And that's important to our customers who pride themselves on environmental stewardship. PG&E's customers are leading the way for the country, with 25% of all rooftop solar installations and 20% of all electric vehicles. 
We've also expanded our engagement efforts, establishing an advisory council last year to help inform our sustainability strategy and priorities. This council is made up of a diverse group of leaders from environmental organizations like Ceres and the Natural Resources Defense Council as well as policy experts, academia and businesses. And we've consistently been recognized as one of the leading companies by a number of third-party sustainability assessments. 
We've also had the privilege of operating in a state that has a number of constructive regulatory mechanisms, which is shown on Slide 14. In California, revenues have been decoupled from sales for decades to help encourage energy efficiency so PG&E's revenues are not impacted by changes in load. The CPUC has also authorized a number of balancing accounts that allow us to track and recover costs that are more unpredictable such as the cost to respond to earthquakes and other large scale emergencies. Our rate cases are based on forward-looking test years and the CPUC is now reviewing all requests through the lens of risk mitigation. We think this is the right approach and aligns well with our strategic planning process, which starts with a detailed risk assessment of all of our assets. In fact, earlier this year, the CPUC's safety and enforcement division found PG&E's risk management process to be industry-leading. 
California also has a separate cost of capital proceeding that establishes the authorized capital structure and return on equity over a 3-year period for all of the IOUs. Our current 10.4% return on equity is fixed through 2017. 
Turning to Slide 15. California continues to be a leader on energy policy. The state is now targeting to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to at least 40% below 1990 levels by 2030. To get there, California will be increasing renewables to 50%, doubling energy efficiency and electrifying the transportation sector, and PG&E will continue to be a critical partner in helping the state achieve its energy policy goals. 
So that brings me to our last differentiator. California's policy goals around safety and environmental leadership will continue to provide opportunities for sustained infrastructure investment. To support safety and reliability, PG&E is investing in multi-year programs to enhance our gas, electric and generation assets, and I'll provide some specific examples in just a minute. To enable California's clean energy economy, PG&E will continue to modernize the grid to ensure that our systems can effectively integrate both the increased renewables and distributed energy resources. Longer term, California is working on some of the largest rail and water infrastructure projects in the country, which we expect will require hundreds of millions in PG&E investments over the next 15 years. With our proven track record of being able to finance and deliver on these types of large-scale projects, we are well positioned to help the state achieve all of its goals at a reasonable cost. 
This brings me to our last section, which focuses on our future growth profile. As you can see on Slide 18, we have 3 focus areas: continuing to enhance safety and reliability, enabling California's clean energy economy, and ensuring that our customers' rates will continue to be affordable, particularly in light of future load projections. 
Slide 19 shows a few examples of some of the longer-term programs we'll be executing to enhance safety and reliability. On the gas side of the business, we've been steadily increasing the percentage of our gas transmission pipelines that is capable of in-line inspection and we're targeting to reach about 65% by 2026. In fact, we partnered with a number of companies to create the next generation of in-line inspection tools that can capture even more detailed information about the integrity of the pipeline without any interruption to gas service. We also continue to increase the number of miles of gas distribution pipeline we're replacing each year. 
On the electric side, by 2019, we're targeting to install automated switches on about 45% of our urban distribution lines and upgrade about 85% of our urban substations. These investments will continue to enhance electric reliability by increasing our ability to automatically reroute power during outages. 
California's clean energy policies will also drive continued investment. As you can see on Slide 20, we expect to spend about $1 billion through 2020 on grid modernization projects. As I mentioned earlier, our customers are already adopters of technology and we already have the most solar rooftop installations and electric vehicles in the country. The demands on our distribution grid are greater than ever before and we need to continue to invest in technologies and systems that seamlessly integrate distributed energy resources and accommodate to a power flow. We also expect to play a critical role in helping to electrify the transportation sector by building out the necessary charging infrastructure. And we see this trend continuing well into the next decade as the state moves towards its longer-term goals of increased renewables, energy efficiency, energy storage and electric vehicles. 
With all of these investments in our future we are keenly focused on affordability. As you can see on Slide 21, we're in good shape today. Our builds are 30% lower than the national average, and over the last couple of decades, our electric rates have grown in line with the rate of inflation. But we know it will be challenging to continue this trend. Over the next 10 to 15 years, we expect our bundled electric load to decline due to a combination of increased energy efficiency and demand response and communities electing to procure their own generation through community choice aggregation. In fact, this was a major driver behind our decision not to seek to extend the Diablo Canyon Power Plant license beyond the current expiration dates of 2024 and 2025. As you can see on Slide 22, we have a number of strategies to manage this change. 
Our current electric portfolio gives us a lot of flexibility. We purchased over half of our energy from third parties and about 30% of the megawatt hours under contract are expiring over the next 5 years. As I mentioned earlier, our revenues have been decoupled from sales for decades. And we have mechanisms in place to allocate appropriate cost to our departing customers. So while declining load doesn't impact our earnings, it does shift cost among our customers under the current rate structures. That's why our strategy also includes modernizing our rate structures. As the use of our grid changes, the way our rates are designed needs to be changed as well. Both the state legislature and the Public Utilities Commission have recognized the need for reform, and we've made some progress over the last year through flattening the residential tiers and moving new net energy metering customers to Time-of-Use rates. We've also shifted the peak period for our Time-of-Use rates from midday to the evening hours in recognition of the significant amount of solar generation now available during the day, but more work needs to be done. 
In September, the CPUC issued a draft white paper on its distributed energy resources action plan which outlined its vision for effectively integrating distributed energy resources into the system. Part of that vision is to develop rate structures for the new grid uses while ensuring that rates remain affordable for non-DER customers. We look forward to working with the commission over the next several years to update our rate structures to better reflect the current and future uses of the grid. 
At the same time, we're working to drive sustainable efficiencies in our own cost structures. Through our benchmarking and continuous improvement efforts, we've successfully reduced cost in a number of areas over the last few years. Going forward, we'll continue to capture savings through process improvement, technology investments and procurement efficiencies while maintaining a strong focus on safety and reliability. 
So as I think you can see, we're at the forefront of a lot of exciting industry changes. California's vision of a decarbonized economy creates a lot of investment opportunities. As we just discussed, we are well positioned to manage changes to our load profile as customer choice increases. 
So before I turn it back over to Jason to talk about our updated guidance, I want to say again how proud I am of the progress that this team has made over the last 6 years. We have had a relentless focus on safety and reliability, and you can really see the results of that in our operational metrics. I'm excited about our future and confident in our ability to deliver strong operational and financial results going forward. 
So with that, let me turn it back over to Jason"
139813,403758895,1074426,"PG&E Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2016",2016-11-04,"Earnings Calls","PG&E Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Tony. I'm going to finish up today's presentation by reviewing our 2017 earnings guidance and updated CapEx and rate base guidance through 2019. Turning to Slide 25. Our 2017 guidance on an earnings from operations basis is $3.55 to $3.75 per",1017,"Thank you, Tony. I'm going to finish up today's presentation by reviewing our 2017 earnings guidance and updated CapEx and rate base guidance through 2019. 
Turning to Slide 25. Our 2017 guidance on an earnings from operations basis is $3.55 to $3.75 per share. We're also providing ranges for the items impacting comparability, which I'll come back to in a minute after we review the guidance assumptions on Slide 26. 
Starting with the upper left corner, you'll see we're assuming capital expenditures of roughly $6 billion. We've included the breakdown by rate case here. In the upper right corner, our estimated weighted average rate base is about $34.3 billion for the year. Both the CapEx and rate base assumptions are within the ranges we provided last quarter. In the lower left, we continue to assume a CPUC-authorized equity ratio of 52% and a return on equity of 10.4%. 
Finally, in the bottom right corner, we list some of the other factors we believe will affect 2017 earnings from operations. Our guidance assumes that both the GRC settlement and the proposed Phase 2 decision in the Gas Transmission rate case are approved without material change. And you'll recall that we do not seek recovery in the Gas Transmission rate case for about $50 million of cost in 2017. We're also showing a positive item here for incentive revenues and other benefits, which include things like our energy efficiency programs. I'll note that we're no longer showing a positive item for tax benefits consistent with the guidance we previously provided. And we continue to expect that CWIP earnings will be offset by below-the-line costs, which includes things like charitable contributions, advertising and certain environmental costs. In 2017, we expect that a number of other -- we expect that the other earnings factors listed here will largely offset each other. As a result, we are targeting to earn the CPUC-authorized return on equity on rate base for the enterprise as a whole. 
Turning to Slide 27. The guidance for our items impacting comparability ranges from a negative $35 million to a positive $40 million pretax. The [indiscernible] are consistent with the items we had in 2016. The estimated range for pipeline-related expenses is $80 million to $125 million pretax. This item relates to clearing our gas transmission rights-of-way. While we're confident in our ability to fully complete the program within this range, there is a chance that a small portion of that work could slip to 2018 due to permitting requirements. We'll monitor the program throughout the year and provide updates as we have better information. 
The second component is legal and regulatory-related expenses, which we estimate to be between $10 million and $40 million pretax. This represents costs incurred with enforcement, regulatory and litigation activities regarding natural gas matters and regulatory communications. 
The third component is for potential fines and penalties again related to natural gas matters and regulatory communications. We're showing a total of $30 million, which reflect the 2017 portion of the disallowed expenses expected from the Phase 2 Gas Transmission rate case decision. While we haven't yet reflected the 2017 portion of the ex-parte penalty, we'd expect to report an additional $40 million pretax after the proposed Phase 2 decision is approved. Butte fire-related costs were uncertain in 2017, but this item will reflect any updates to third-party liability estimates, legal costs and insurance receivables. And finally, for the Gas Transmission rate case, we're showing a positive $160 million for the portion of the 2015 and 2016 out-of-period revenues that we plan to recognize in 2017. 
Turning to Slide 28. We assume equity issuance of about $400 million to $600 million in 2017. That compares to roughly $800 million in 2016. The main drivers for the difference are the lower expected San Bruno penalty costs and gas transmission capital disallowance. Partially offsetting these reductions are higher capital expenditures. 
After 2017, we expect our unrecovered cost to continue to decline as we wrap up the gas transmission rights-of-way program. As a result, in 2018 and 2019, we expect to be able to meet our equity needs largely through our internal programs, which can generate about $350 million annually. 
Moving to Slides 29 and 30. We've updated our CapEx and rate base guidance through 2019. This year, we're including a breakdown by major rate case. For the General Rate Case, the numbers are consistent with the all-party settlement we announced earlier this year. For the gas transmission and storage rate case, the numbers are consistent with the assumptions embedded in our Q2 guidance with one exception. We previously assumed that roughly $400 million would be added to rate base in 2017 for their 2011 through 2014 capital spend, subject to audit. Because that audit has not yet begun, we're now assuming that $400 million will be added to rate base in 2018. For the electric Transmission Owner rate case, we show a small range, which represents the TO18 request at the high end and the TO17 settlement at the low end. We've held these assumptions flat through 2019. 
We've also listed some items here that are not included in our rate base assumptions including primarily any new investments that will be included in the 2019 Gas Transmission rate case and the 2018 and 2019 electric transmission rate cases. 
Finally, Slide 31 is just a reminder that we are targeting a roughly 60% payout ratio for our dividend by 2019. On average, this should provide for above average dividend per share growth. I knew we've covered a lot this morning. Let me conclude by reiterating the points Tony started with. Over the last 6 years, our focus on safety has resulted in significant operational improvements. We have a number of strategic advantages that help position us to effectively manage industry changes. And we believe our roughly 6.5% to 7.5% -- sorry, we believe our roughly 6.5% to 7% rate base growth and above average dividend per share growth through 2019 make us an attractive investment. 
With that, I'll open it up for questions in the time we have remaining."

So with that, let me turn it over to Jason to cover the third quarter results, and then I'll talk more about our longer-term vision."
139813,403758895,1074674,"PG&E Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2016",2016-11-04,"Earnings Calls","PG&E Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Tony, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start with the third quarter earnings presentation that we issued this morning and then we'll move to the business update presentation. Slide 3 shows our results for the third quarter. Earnings f",915,"Thank you, Tony, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start with the third quarter earnings presentation that we issued this morning and then we'll move to the business update presentation. 
Slide 3 shows our results for the third quarter. Earnings from operations came in at $0.94. I know this is lower than many of you expected, but we are reaffirming our guidance from earnings from operations for the full year. As I'll discuss more in a minute, the Q3 results are largely driven by timing items. Our third quarter GAAP earnings, including the items impacting comparability, are also shown on Slide 3. Pipeline-related expenses were $31 million pretax this quarter. The charge for legal and regulatory-related expenses was $23 million pretax, and fines and penalties were $67 million pretax and are primarily related to the San Bruno penalty decision. We're showing $60 million pretax for the Butte fire-related cost net of insurance, which are largely for legal costs associated with the Butte fire. We did not adjust our insurance receivable this third quarter. However, we do intend to seek recovery of all insured losses from our insurance carriers. And as a reminder, the current receivables should not be viewed as a ceiling on insurance recoveries. 
Moving to Slide 4. You'll see our quarter-over-quarter comparison of earnings from operations of $0.84 in Q3 of last year to $0.94 in Q3 of this year. As a result of the Phase 1 gas transmission storage rate case decision, we increased our rates in August to begin a recovery in the higher improved revenues. This resulted in $0.11 of higher revenues compared to Q3 of last year. 
We also continue to see $0.05 positive for growth in rate concerns, and regulatory and legal matters totaled $0.05 positive for the quarter. This item includes some incentive revenue awards. Timing and taxes was $0.04 negative for the quarter. And as a reminder, this is purely a timing item that will net to 0 by year-end. As a result, you can expect to see a $0.20 pick up in the fourth quarter to fully offset the amount recognized through Q3. We also had $0.03 negative for an increase in outstanding shares and $0.04 negative for a number of miscellaneous items. 
Turning to Slide 5. We are reaffirming our guidance from earnings from operations to $3.65 to $3.85 per share. GAAP guidance is shown here as well. We're also reaffirming our expectation of roughly $800 million in equity issuance this year. 
Slide 6 shows our updated guidance assumptions. We assume capital expenditures of roughly $5.7 billion, which is slightly higher than our second quarter projection of $5.6 billion. We've increased the gas distribution number to reflect our best estimate of spend through the end of the year. 
Our assumption for weighted average rate base is $32.4 billion consistent with last quarter. And in the bottom right, we've updated the other factors affecting earnings from operations to reflect the proposed Phase 2 decision we received earlier this week in the Gas Transmission rate case. Our guidance assumes that the proposed decision is approved this year without any material modifications. If we do not receive a final Phase 2 decision before the end of the year, our earnings will be reduced by about $0.25. And we continue to target earning our 10.4% CPUC-authorized return on equity across the enterprise, plus the net impact of the other earnings factors listed here. 
Moving to Slide 7. We've updated the ranges for several of the 2016 items impacting comparability. The range for pipeline-related expenses is the same as last quarter. For legal and regulatory-related expenses, we've updated the slide to reflect our expectation that we'll come in at about $75 million, which is the high end of the previous range. The fines and penalties increased by $15 million pretax, reflecting a number of updates, which I'll cover in a minute. 
We've also updated the Butte fire-related cost to reflect a charge of $16 million pretax in Q3, largely driven by legal costs. We remain unable to estimate the high end of the range at this time. The remaining items are unchanged from last quarter. The tables at the bottom of the page shows our updates to fines and penalties. First, the charge for disallowed capital has increased by $6 million. We have now fully accrued for all of this safety-related capital we expect to be disallowed in the Phase 2 gas transmission decision. 
Second, we incurred $4 million charge for the ex-parte penalty associated with the higher gas transmission revenues we collected in August and September. Assuming the proposed Phase 2 decision is approved this year, we will record an additional $54 million in Q4 to reflect the full 2016 impact of the ex-parte penalty. 
Third, we increased the gas distribution record-keeping fine by $2 million to reflect the modified presiding officer's decision. The total is now $26 million. 
And finally, we've included a $3 million charge as a result of the federal criminal verdict. 
So that concludes the Q3 earnings update. We continue to have confidence in our ability to achieve our guidance this year, assuming the proposed Phase 2 decision of the Gas Transmission rate case is approved in December. With the resolution of a number of significant issues over the last several months, we have much greater clarity on our future operational and financial performance, which we've laid out in the business update. 
So with that, let me turn it back over to Tony."

I'd encourage all of you to have the presentation in front of you as I share my comments because I think it'll be a little easier to follow along. As you",2580,"Thanks, Jason. Let me turn to the business update presentation that we issued earlier this morning. I'd encourage all of you to have the presentation in front of you as I share my comments because I think it'll be a little easier to follow along. 
As you can see on Slide 3, we're going to cover 3 areas today. First, I'm going to review the progress we've made over the last 6 years because we have come a long way. We know we still have more work to do, but I am really proud of what the team has accomplished, and I want to share some of those results with you. Second, I'm going to talk about some of the things that really provide PG&E with a strategic advantage. And third, I'm going to talk about what's driving growth going forward. As part of that, Jason is going to review the 2017 earnings guidance as well as our updated CapEx and rate base guidance through 2019. Between our 6.5% to 7% rate base growth and our above average dividend per share growth, we expect to deliver strong returns over the next several years. 
So let me start with the progress that we made. Slide 5 provides a high-level overview of the company. As you can see, over 90% of our revenues are set by the California Public Utilities Commission with the remainder set by FERC. And nearly half of our revenues are passed through for things like energy procurement costs and public purpose programs. 
Turning to Slide 6. One of the things I'm most proud of is how we've embedded safety into our core governance structures. Safety is really the foundation of everything that we do. When I joined the company in 2011, we began a back-to-basics strategy with safety at the forefront. Let me give you some examples of that. 
At the leadership level, we've supplemented our team with new board members and executives who bring significant utility experience. At the Board of Directors, we brought on a number of former utility CEOs like Anne Shen Smith from Southern Cal Gas, Dick Kelly from Xcel Energy, and Fred Fowler from Spectra Energy. We brought in a whole new leadership team on the gas side of the business starting with Nick Stavropoulos, who brings more than 35 years of experience in the gas industry. We've included bios for some of our leadership team in the appendix. 
In 2012, we became the first utility in the industry to publish a dashboard that tracks how we're performing on key public safety metrics such as emergency response times and reduction of gas dig-ins and electric wire downs. And that focus has driven significant operational improvements, as I'll discuss in just a minute. 
Several years ago, we also restructured our short-term variable compensation plan so that 50% is now tied to our performance on public and employee safety. This incentive program applies to all of our management employees as well as some of our union representative employees. 
And finally, we've done a lot a work on our safety culture. This is probably the most critical piece because it's our culture that ultimately drives the performance that we're looking for. Part of our strategy has been to install a continuous improvement mindset by encouraging employees to identify gaps and opportunities and then close them through benchmarking and process improvement. We also wanted to make sure that every employee felt comfortable raising concerns no matter how big or small. So we made a number of changes to encourage all employees to speak up when something doesn't seem right. For example, we worked with our unions to develop a nonpunitive self-reporting policy. We've also adapted the nuclear industry's corrective action program across the company to make it easy for employees to report things that need to be fixed. In fact, employees can now report corrective action items through a simple app on their smart devices. And we've created a number of awards to publicly recognize employees when they do speak up so that we're encouraging and reinforcing that behavior. All of these efforts have really paid off. 
As you can see on Slide 7, we've achieved industry-leading performance on a number of gas safety metrics. We've reduced our emergency response time and gas dig-ins by about 40%. And we virtually eliminated our leak backlog by completely redesigning our approach to finding and repairing leaks including deploying sophisticated new technologies that are 1,000 times more sensitive than traditional detection equipment. 
We've also replaced or upgraded hundreds of miles of distribution and transmission pipeline. We're the first utility in the country to be certified under PAS-55, ISO-55001 and RC14001 for our asset management programs. And we're the first company in the U.S. to meet the rigor of the American Petroleum Institute 1173 standard for pipeline safety and safety culture. So I couldn't be more proud of how the team has turned the gas business around. 
We've also made tremendous improvements on the electric side of the business, as you can see on Slide 8. Our emergency response performance is now in the first quartile. And as a result of our investments in SmartMeters, automated switches and circuit upgrades, we've delivered 7 straight years of record-breaking electrical reliability. Our customers are experiencing fewer and shorter outages than ever before. All of these improvements are really showing up in our customer satisfaction scores. While we still have more work to do, our J.D. Power results across all customer classes have increased steadily since 2012, as you can see on Slide 9. 
The improvements we made in safety and reliability over the last 6 years have put us in a position to deliver strong financial results going forward. Earlier this year, we announced our first dividend increase in 6 years, and we've committed to achieving a roughly 60% payout ratio by 2019. Combined with our expected rate base growth, we're confident we can deliver a strong overall return for our shareholders. 
Turning to the next section. I want to highlight a few areas that provide PG&E with a strategic advantage, particularly as our industry undergoes significant change. One of the trends we've seen over the last decade is the increasing focus on climate change and greenhouse gas reduction, and that trend is only going to intensify in coming years. At PG&E, we've been committed to sustainability for decades and we're one of the greenest utilities in the country. 
As you can see on Slide 13, nearly 60% of our electric deliveries come from carbon-free and renewable resources. That's almost twice the national average. And that's important to our customers who pride themselves on environmental stewardship. PG&E's customers are leading the way for the country, with 25% of all rooftop solar installations and 20% of all electric vehicles. 
We've also expanded our engagement efforts, establishing an advisory council last year to help inform our sustainability strategy and priorities. This council is made up of a diverse group of leaders from environmental organizations like Ceres and the Natural Resources Defense Council as well as policy experts, academia and businesses. And we've consistently been recognized as one of the leading companies by a number of third-party sustainability assessments. 
We've also had the privilege of operating in a state that has a number of constructive regulatory mechanisms, which is shown on Slide 14. In California, revenues have been decoupled from sales for decades to help encourage energy efficiency so PG&E's revenues are not impacted by changes in load. The CPUC has also authorized a number of balancing accounts that allow us to track and recover costs that are more unpredictable such as the cost to respond to earthquakes and other large scale emergencies. Our rate cases are based on forward-looking test years and the CPUC is now reviewing all requests through the lens of risk mitigation. We think this is the right approach and aligns well with our strategic planning process, which starts with a detailed risk assessment of all of our assets. In fact, earlier this year, the CPUC's safety and enforcement division found PG&E's risk management process to be industry-leading. 
California also has a separate cost of capital proceeding that establishes the authorized capital structure and return on equity over a 3-year period for all of the IOUs. Our current 10.4% return on equity is fixed through 2017. 
Turning to Slide 15. California continues to be a leader on energy policy. The state is now targeting to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to at least 40% below 1990 levels by 2030. To get there, California will be increasing renewables to 50%, doubling energy efficiency and electrifying the transportation sector, and PG&E will continue to be a critical partner in helping the state achieve its energy policy goals. 
So that brings me to our last differentiator. California's policy goals around safety and environmental leadership will continue to provide opportunities for sustained infrastructure investment. To support safety and reliability, PG&E is investing in multi-year programs to enhance our gas, electric and generation assets, and I'll provide some specific examples in just a minute. To enable California's clean energy economy, PG&E will continue to modernize the grid to ensure that our systems can effectively integrate both the increased renewables and distributed energy resources. Longer term, California is working on some of the largest rail and water infrastructure projects in the country, which we expect will require hundreds of millions in PG&E investments over the next 15 years. With our proven track record of being able to finance and deliver on these types of large-scale projects, we are well positioned to help the state achieve all of its goals at a reasonable cost. 
This brings me to our last section which focuses on our future growth profile. As you can see on Slide 18, we have 3 focus areas: continuing to enhance safety and reliability, enabling California's clean energy economy, and ensuring that our customers' rates will continue to be affordable, particularly in light of future load projections. 
Slide 19 shows a few examples of some of the longer-term programs we'll be executing to enhance safety and reliability. On the gas side of the business, we've been steadily increasing the percentage of our gas transmission pipeline that is capable of in-line inspection and we're targeting to reach about 65% by 2026. In fact, we partnered with a number of companies to create the next generation of in-line inspection tools that can capture even more detailed information about the integrity of the pipeline without any interruption to gas service. We also continue to increase the number of miles of gas distribution pipeline we're replacing each year. 
On the electric side, by 2019, we're targeting to install automated switches on about 45% of our urban distribution lines and upgrade about 85% of our urban substations. These investments will continue to enhance electric reliability by increasing our ability to automatically reroute power during outages. 
California's clean energy policies will also drive continued investment. As you can see on Slide 20, we expect to spend about $1 billion through 2020 on grid modernization projects. As I mentioned earlier, our customers are already adopters of technology and we already have the most solar rooftop installations and electric vehicles in the country. The demands on our distribution grid are greater than ever before and we need to continue to invest in technologies and systems that seamlessly integrate distributed energy resources and accommodate to a power flow. We also expect to play a critical role in helping to electrify the transportation sector by building out the necessary charging infrastructure. And we see this trend continuing well into the next decade as the state moves towards its longer-term goals of increased renewables, energy efficiency, energy storage and electric vehicles. 
With all of this investment in our future we are keenly focused on affordability. As you can see on Slide 21, we're in good shape today. Our builds are 30% lower than the national average, and over the last couple of decades, our electric rates have grown in line with the rate of inflation. But we know it will be challenging to continue this trend. Over the next 10 to 15 years, we expect our bundled electric load to decline due to a combination of increased energy efficiency and demand response and communities electing to procure their own generation through community choice aggregation. In fact, this was a major driver behind our decision not to seek to extend the Diablo Canyon Power Plant license beyond the current expiration dates of 2024 and 2025. As you can see on Slide 22, we have a number of strategies to manage this change. 
Our current electric portfolio gives us a lot of flexibility. We purchas over half of our energy from third parties and about 30% of the megawatt hours under contract are expiring over the next 5 years. As I mentioned earlier, our revenues have been decoupled from sales for decades. And we have mechanisms in place to allocate appropriate cost to our departing customers. So while declining load doesn't impact our earnings, it does shift cost among our customers under the current rate structures. That's why our strategy also includes modernizing our rate structures. As the use of our grid changes, the way our rates are designed needs to be changed as well. Both the state legislature and the Public Utilities Commission have recognized the need for reform, and we've made some progress over the last year through flattening the residential tiers and moving new net energy metering customers to Time-of-Use rates. We've also shifted the peak period for our Time-of-Use rates from midday to the evening hours in recognition of the significant amount of solar generation now available during the day, but more work needs to be done. 
In September, the CPUC issued a draft white paper on its distributed energy resources action plan which outlined its vision for effectively integrating distributed energy resources into the system. Part of that vision is to develop rate structures for the new grid uses while ensuring that rates remain affordable for non-DER customers. We look forward to working with the commission over the next several years to update our rate structures to better reflect the current and future uses of the grid. 
At the same time, we're working to drive sustainable efficiencies in our own cost structures. Through our benchmarking and continuous improvement efforts, we've successfully reduced cost in a number of areas over the last few years. Going forward, we'll continue to capture savings through process improvement, technology investments and procurement efficiencies while maintaining a strong focus on safety and reliability. 
So as I think you can see, we're at the forefront of a lot of exciting industry changes. California's vision of a decarbonized economy creates a lot of investment opportunities. As we just discussed, we are well positioned to manage changes to our load profile as customer choice increases. 
So before I turn it back over to Jason to talk about our updated guidance, I want to say again how proud I am of the progress that this team has made over the last 6 years. We have had a relentless focus on safety and reliability, and you can really see the results of that in our operational metrics. I'm excited about our future and confident in our ability to deliver strong operational and financial results going forward. 
So with that, let me turn it back over to Jason"
139813,403758895,1074674,"PG&E Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2016",2016-11-04,"Earnings Calls","PG&E Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Tony. I'm going to finish up today's presentation by reviewing our 2017 earnings guidance and updated CapEx and rate base guidance through 2019. Turning to Slide 25. Our 2017 guidance on an earnings from operations basis is $3.55 to $3.75 per",1018,"Thank you, Tony. I'm going to finish up today's presentation by reviewing our 2017 earnings guidance and updated CapEx and rate base guidance through 2019. 
Turning to Slide 25. Our 2017 guidance on an earnings from operations basis is $3.55 to $3.75 per share. We're also providing ranges for the items impacting comparability, which I'll come back to in a minute after we review the guidance assumptions on Slide 26. 
Starting with the upper left corner, you'll see we're assuming capital expenditures of roughly $6 billion. We've included the breakdown by rate case here. In the upper right corner, our estimated weighted average rate base is about $34.3 billion for the year. Both the CapEx and rate base assumptions are within the ranges we provided last quarter. In the lower left, we continue to assume a CPUC-authorized equity ratio of 52% and a return on equity of 10.4%. 
Finally, in the bottom right corner, we list some of the other factors we believe will affect 2017 earnings from operations. Our guidance assumes that both the GRC settlement and the proposed Phase 2 decision in the Gas Transmission rate case are approved without material change. And you'll recall that we do not seek recovery in the Gas Transmission rate case for about $50 million of cost in 2017. We're also showing a positive item here for incentive revenues and other benefits, which include things like our energy efficiency programs. I'll note that we're no longer showing a positive item for tax benefits consistent with the guidance we previously provided. And we continue to expect that CWIP earnings will be offset by below-the-line costs, which includes things like charitable contributions, advertising and certain environmental costs. In 2017, we expect that a number of other -- we expect that the other earnings factors listed here will largely offset each other. As a result, we are targeting to earn the CPUC-authorized return on equity on rate base for the enterprise as a whole. 
Turning to Slide 27. The guidance for our items impacting comparability ranges from a negative $35 million to a positive $40 million pretax. The catagories are consistent with the items we had in 2016. The estimated range for pipeline-related expenses is $80 million to $125 million pretax. This item relates to clearing our gas transmission rights-of-way. While we're confident in our ability to fully complete the program within this range, there is a chance that a small portion of that work could slip to 2018 due to permitting requirements. We'll monitor the program throughout the year and provide updates as we have better information. 
The second component is legal and regulatory-related expenses, which we estimate to be between $10 million and $40 million pretax. This represents costs incurred with enforcement, regulatory and litigation activities regarding natural gas matters and regulatory communications. 
The third component is for potential fines and penalties again related to natural gas matters and regulatory communications. We're showing a total of $30 million, which reflect the 2017 portion of the disallowed expenses expected from the Phase 2 Gas Transmission rate case decision. While we haven't yet reflected the 2017 portion of the ex-parte penalty, we'd expect to record an additional $14 million pretax after the proposed Phase 2 decision is approved. Butte fire-related costs were uncertain in 2017, but this item will reflect any updates to third-party liability estimates, legal costs and insurance receivables. And finally, for the Gas Transmission rate case, we're showing a positive $160 million for the portion of the 2015 and 2016 out-of-period revenues that we plan to recognize in 2017. 
Turning to Slide 28. We assume equity issuance of about $400 million to $600 million in 2017. That compares to roughly $800 million in 2016. The main drivers for the difference are the lower expected San Bruno penalty costs and gas transmission capital disallowance. Partially offsetting these reductions are higher capital expenditures. 
After 2017, we expect our unrecovered cost to continue to decline as we wrap up the gas transmission rights-of-way program. As a result, in 2018 and 2019, we expect to be able to meet our equity needs largely through our internal programs, which can generate about $350 million annually. 
Moving to Slides 29 and 30. We've updated our CapEx and rate base guidance through 2019. This year, we're including a breakdown by major rate case. For the General Rate Case, the numbers are consistent with the all-party settlement we announced earlier this year. For the gas transmission and storage rate case, the numbers are consistent with the assumptions embedded in our Q2 guidance with one exception. We previously assumed that roughly $400 million would be added to rate base in 2017 for their 2011 through 2014 capital spend, subject to audit. Because that audit has not yet begun, we're now assuming that the $400 million will be added to rate base in 2018. For the electric Transmission Owner rate case, we show a small range, which represents the TO18 request at the high end and the TO17 settlement at the low end. We've held these assumptions flat through 2019. 
We've also listed some items here that are not included in our rate base assumptions including primarily any new investments that will be included in the 2019 Gas Transmission rate case and the 2018 and 2019 electric transmission rate cases. 
Finally, Slide 31 is just a reminder that we are targeting a roughly 60% payout ratio for our dividend by 2019. On average, this should provide for above average dividend per share growth. I knew we've covered a lot this morning. Let me conclude by reiterating the points Tony started with. Over the last 6 years, our focus on safety has resulted in significant operational improvements. We have a number of strategic advantages that help position us to effectively manage industry changes. And we believe our roughly 6.5% to 7.5% -- sorry, we believe our roughly 6.5% to 7% rate base growth and above average dividend per share growth through 2019 make us an attractive investment. 
With that, I'll open it up for questions in the time we have remaining."

I'm going to start with the third quarter earnings presentation that we issued this morning and then we'll move to the business update presentation. Slide 3 shows our results for the third quarter. Earnings f",914,"Thank you, Tony, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start with the third quarter earnings presentation that we issued this morning and then we'll move to the business update presentation. 
Slide 3 shows our results for the third quarter. Earnings from operations came in at $0.94. I know this is lower than many of you expected, but we are reaffirming our guidance from earnings from operations for the full year. As I'll discuss more in a minute, the Q3 results are largely driven by timing items. Our third quarter GAAP earnings, including the items impacting comparability, are also shown on Slide 3. Pipeline-related expenses were $31 million pretax this quarter. The charge for legal and regulatory-related expenses was $23 million pretax, and fines and penalties were $67 million pretax and are primarily related to the San Bruno penalty decision. We're showing $60 million pretax for the Butte fire-related cost net of insurance, which are largely for legal costs associated with the Butte fire. We did not adjust our insurance receivable this third quarter. However, we do intend to seek recovery of all insured losses from our insurance carriers. And as a reminder, the current receivables should not be viewed as a ceiling on insurance recoveries. 
Moving to Slide 4. You'll see our quarter-over-quarter comparison of earnings from operations of $0.84 in Q3 of last year to $0.94 in Q3 of this year. As a result of the Phase 1 gas transmission storage rate case decision, we increased our rates in August to begin a recovery in the higher improved revenues. This resulted in $0.11 of higher revenues compared to Q3 of last year. 
We also continue to see $0.05 positive for growth in rate concerns, and regulatory and legal matters totaled $0.05 positive for the quarter. This item includes some incentive revenue awards. Timing and taxes was $0.04 negative for the quarter. And as a reminder, this is purely a timing item that will net to 0 by year-end. As a result, you can expect to see a $0.20 pickup in the fourth quarter to fully offset the amount recognized through Q3. We also had $0.03 negative for an increase in outstanding shares and $0.04 negative for a number of miscellaneous items. 
Turning to Slide 5. We are reaffirming our guidance from earnings from operations to $3.65 to $3.85 per share. GAAP guidance is shown here as well. We're also reaffirming our expectation of roughly $800 million in equity issuance this year. 
Slide 6 shows our updated guidance assumptions. We assume capital expenditures of roughly $5.7 billion, which is slightly higher than our second quarter projection of $5.6 billion. We've increased the gas distribution number to reflect our best estimate of spend through the end of the year. 
Our assumption for weighted average rate base is $32.4 billion consistent with last quarter. And in the bottom right, we've updated the other factors affecting earnings from operations to reflect the proposed Phase 2 decision we received earlier this week in the Gas Transmission rate case. Our guidance assumes that the proposed decision is approved this year without any material modifications. If we do not receive a final Phase 2 decision before the end of the year, our earnings will be reduced by about $0.25. And we continue to target earning our 10.4% CPUC-authorized return on equity across the enterprise, plus the net impact of the other earnings factors listed here. 
Moving to Slide 7. We've updated the ranges for several of the 2016 items impacting comparability. The range for pipeline-related expenses is the same as last quarter. For legal and regulatory-related expenses, we've updated the slide to reflect our expectation that we'll come in at about $75 million, which is the high end of the previous range. The fines and penalties increased by $15 million pretax, reflecting a number of updates, which I'll cover in a minute. 
We've also updated the Butte fire-related cost to reflect a charge of $16 million pretax in Q3, largely driven by legal costs. We remain unable to estimate the high end of the range at this time. The remaining items are unchanged from last quarter. The tables at the bottom of the page shows our updates to fines and penalties. First, the charge for disallowed capital has increased by $6 million. We have now fully accrued for all of this safety-related capital we expect to be disallowed in the Phase 2 gas transmission decision. 
Second, we incurred $4 million charge for the ex-parte penalty associated with the higher gas transmission revenues we collected in August and September. Assuming the proposed Phase 2 decision is approved this year, we will record an additional $54 million in Q4 to reflect the full 2016 impact of the ex-parte penalty. 
Third, we increased the gas distribution record-keeping fine by $2 million to reflect the modified presiding officer's decision. The total is now $26 million. 
And finally, we've included a $3 million charge as a result of the federal criminal verdict. 
So that concludes the Q3 earnings update. We continue to have confidence in our ability to achieve our guidance this year, assuming the proposed Phase 2 decision of the Gas Transmission rate case is approved in December. With the resolution of a number of significant issues over the last several months, we have much greater clarity on our future operational and financial performance, which we've laid out in the business update. 
So with that, let me turn it back over to Tony."

I'd encourage all of you to have the presentation in front of you as I share my comments because I think it'll be a little easier to follow along. As you",2580,"Thanks, Jason. Let me turn to the business update presentation that we issued earlier this morning. I'd encourage all of you to have the presentation in front of you as I share my comments because I think it'll be a little easier to follow along. 
As you can see on Slide 3, we're going to cover 3 areas today. First, I'm going to review the progress we've made over the last 6 years because we have come a long way. We know we still have more work to do, but I am really proud of what the team has accomplished, and I want to share some of those results with you. Second, I'm going to talk about some of the things that really provide PG&E with a strategic advantage. And third, I'm going to talk about what's driving growth going forward. As part of that, Jason is going to review the 2017 earnings guidance as well as our updated CapEx and rate base guidance through 2019. Between our 6.5% to 7% rate base growth and our above average dividend per share growth, we expect to deliver strong returns over the next several years. 
So let me start with the progress that we made. Slide 5 provides a high-level overview of the company. As you can see, over 90% of our revenues are set by the California Public Utilities Commission with the remainder set by FERC. And nearly half of our revenues are passed through for things like energy procurement costs and public purpose programs. 
Turning to Slide 6. One of the things I'm most proud of is how we've embedded safety into our core governance structures. Safety is really the foundation of everything that we do. When I joined the company in 2011, we began a back-to-basics strategy with safety at the forefront. Let me give you some examples of that. 
At the leadership level, we've supplemented our team with new board members and executives who bring significant utility experience. At the Board of Directors, we brought on a number of former utility CEOs like Anne Shen Smith from Southern Cal Gas, Dick Kelly from Xcel Energy, and Fred Fowler from Spectra Energy. We brought in a whole new leadership team on the gas side of the business starting with Nick Stavropoulos, who brings more than 35 years of experience in the gas industry. We've included bios for some of our leadership team in the appendix. 
In 2012, we became the first utility in the industry to publish a dashboard that tracks how we're performing on key public safety metrics such as emergency response times and reduction of gas dig-ins and electric wire downs. And that focus has driven significant operational improvements, as I'll discuss in just a minute. 
Several years ago, we also restructured our short-term variable compensation plan so that 50% is now tied to our performance on public and employee safety. This incentive program applies to all of our management employees as well as some of our union representative employees. 
And finally, we've done a lot a work on our safety culture. This is probably the most critical piece because it's our culture that ultimately drives the performance that we're looking for. Part of our strategy has been to install a continuous improvement mindset by encouraging employees to identify gaps and opportunities and then close them through benchmarking and process improvement. We also wanted to make sure that every employee felt comfortable raising concerns no matter how big or small. So we made a number of changes to encourage all employees to speak up when something doesn't seem right. For example, we worked with our unions to develop a nonpunitive self-reporting policy. We've also adapted the nuclear industry's corrective action program across the company to make it easy for employees to report things that need to be fixed. In fact, employees can now report corrective action items through a simple app on their smart devices. And we've created a number of awards to publicly recognize employees when they do speak up so that we're encouraging and reinforcing that behavior. All of these efforts have really paid off. 
As you can see on Slide 7, we've achieved industry-leading performance on a number of gas safety metrics. We've reduced our emergency response time and gas dig-ins by about 40%. And we virtually eliminated our leak backlog by completely redesigning our approach to finding and repairing leaks including deploying sophisticated new technologies that are 1,000 times more sensitive than traditional detection equipment. 
We've also replaced or upgraded hundreds of miles of distribution and transmission pipeline. We're the first utility in the country to be certified under PAS-55, ISO-55001 and RC14001 for our asset management programs. And we're the first company in the U.S. to meet the rigor of the American Petroleum Institute 1173 standard for pipeline safety and safety culture. So I couldn't be more proud of how the team has turned the gas business around. 
We've also made tremendous improvements on the electric side of the business, as you can see on Slide 8. Our emergency response performance is now in the first quartile. And as a result of our investments in SmartMeters, automated switches and circuit upgrades, we've delivered 7 straight years of record-breaking electrical reliability. Our customers are experiencing fewer and shorter outages than ever before. All of these improvements are really showing up in our customer satisfaction scores. While we still have more work to do, our J.D. Power results across all customer classes have increased steadily since 2012, as you can see on Slide 9. 
The improvements we made in safety and reliability over the last 6 years have put us in a position to deliver strong financial results going forward. Earlier this year, we announced our first dividend increase in 6 years, and we've committed to achieving a roughly 60% payout ratio by 2019. Combined with our expected rate base growth, we're confident we can deliver a strong overall return for our shareholders. 
Turning to the next section. I want to highlight a few areas that provide PG&E with a strategic advantage, particularly as our industry undergoes significant change. One of the trends we've seen over the last decade is the increasing focus on climate change and greenhouse gas reduction, and that trend is only going to intensify in coming years. At PG&E, we've been committed to sustainability for decades and we're one of the greenest utilities in the country. 
As you can see on Slide 13, nearly 60% of our electric deliveries come from carbon-free and renewable resources. That's almost twice the national average. And that's important to our customers who pride themselves on environmental stewardship. PG&E's customers are leading the way for the country, with 25% of all rooftop solar installations and 20% of all electric vehicles. 
We've also expanded our engagement efforts, establishing an advisory council last year to help inform our sustainability strategy and priorities. This council is made up of a diverse group of leaders from environmental organizations like Ceres and the Natural Resources Defense Council as well as policy experts, academia and businesses. And we've consistently been recognized as one of the leading companies by a number of third-party sustainability assessments. 
We've also had the privilege of operating in a state that has a number of constructive regulatory mechanisms, which is shown on Slide 14. In California, revenues have been decoupled from sales for decades to help encourage energy efficiency so PG&E's revenues are not impacted by changes in load. The CPUC has also authorized a number of balancing accounts that allow us to track and recover costs that are more unpredictable such as the cost to respond to earthquakes and other large scale emergencies. Our rate cases are based on forward-looking test years and the CPUC is now reviewing all requests through the lens of risk mitigation. We think this is the right approach and aligns well with our strategic planning process, which starts with a detailed risk assessment of all of our assets. In fact, earlier this year, the CPUC's safety and enforcement division found PG&E's risk management process to be industry-leading. 
California also has a separate cost of capital proceeding that establishes the authorized capital structure and return on equity over a 3-year period for all of the IOUs. Our current 10.4% return on equity is fixed through 2017. 
Turning to Slide 15. California continues to be a leader on energy policy. The state is now targeting to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to at least 40% below 1990 levels by 2030. To get there, California will be increasing renewables to 50%, doubling energy efficiency and electrifying the transportation sector, and PG&E will continue to be a critical partner in helping the state achieve its energy policy goals. 
So that brings me to our last differentiator. California's policy goals around safety and environmental leadership will continue to provide opportunities for sustained infrastructure investment. To support safety and reliability, PG&E is investing in multi-year programs to enhance our gas, electric and generation assets, and I'll provide some specific examples in just a minute. To enable California's clean energy economy, PG&E will continue to modernize the grid to ensure that our systems can effectively integrate both the increased renewables and distributed energy resources. Longer term, California is working on some of the largest rail and water infrastructure projects in the country, which we expect will require hundreds of millions in PG&E investments over the next 15 years. With our proven track record of being able to finance and deliver on these types of large-scale projects, we are well positioned to help the state achieve all of its goals at a reasonable cost. 
This brings me to our last section which focuses on our future growth profile. As you can see on Slide 18, we have 3 focus areas: continuing to enhance safety and reliability, enabling California's clean energy economy, and ensuring that our customers' rates will continue to be affordable, particularly in light of future load projections. 
Slide 19 shows a few examples of some of the longer-term programs we'll be executing to enhance safety and reliability. On the gas side of the business, we've been steadily increasing the percentage of our gas transmission pipeline that is capable of in-line inspection and we're targeting to reach about 65% by 2026. In fact, we partnered with a number of companies to create the next generation of in-line inspection tools that can capture even more detailed information about the integrity of the pipeline without any interruption to gas service. We also continue to increase the number of miles of gas distribution pipeline we're replacing each year. 
On the electric side, by 2019, we're targeting to install automated switches on about 45% of our urban distribution lines and upgrade about 85% of our urban substations. These investments will continue to enhance electric reliability by increasing our ability to automatically reroute power during outages. 
California's clean energy policies will also drive continued investment. As you can see on Slide 20, we expect to spend about $1 billion through 2020 on grid modernization projects. As I mentioned earlier, our customers are already adopters of technology and we already have the most solar rooftop installations and electric vehicles in the country. The demands on our distribution grid are greater than ever before and we need to continue to invest in technologies and systems that seamlessly integrate distributed energy resources and accommodate to a power flow. We also expect to play a critical role in helping to electrify the transportation sector by building out the necessary charging infrastructure. And we see this trend continuing well into the next decade as the state moves towards its longer-term goals of increased renewables, energy efficiency, energy storage and electric vehicles. 
With all of this investment in our future we are keenly focused on affordability. As you can see on Slide 21, we're in good shape today. Our builds are 30% lower than the national average, and over the last couple of decades, our electric rates have grown in line with the rate of inflation. But we know it will be challenging to continue this trend. Over the next 10 to 15 years, we expect our bundled electric load to decline due to a combination of increased energy efficiency and demand response and communities electing to procure their own generation through community choice aggregation. In fact, this was a major driver behind our decision not to seek to extend the Diablo Canyon Power Plant license beyond the current expiration dates of 2024 and 2025. As you can see on Slide 22, we have a number of strategies to manage this change. 
Our current electric portfolio gives us a lot of flexibility. We purchase over half of our energy from third parties and about 30% of the megawatt hours under contract are expiring over the next 5 years. As I mentioned earlier, our revenues have been decoupled from sales for decades. And we have mechanisms in place to allocate appropriate cost to our departing customers. So while declining load doesn't impact our earnings, it does shift cost among our customers under the current rate structures. That's why our strategy also includes modernizing our rate structures. As the use of our grid changes, the way our rates are designed needs to be changed as well. Both the state legislature and the Public Utilities Commission have recognized the need for reform, and we've made some progress over the last year through flattening the residential tiers and moving new net energy metering customers to Time-of-Use rates. We've also shifted the peak period for our Time-of-Use rates from midday to the evening hours in recognition of the significant amount of solar generation now available during the day, but more work needs to be done. 
In September, the CPUC issued a draft white paper on its distributed energy resources action plan which outlined its vision for effectively integrating distributed energy resources into the system. Part of that vision is to develop rate structures for the new grid uses while ensuring that rates remain affordable for non-DER customers. We look forward to working with the commission over the next several years to update our rate structures to better reflect the current and future uses of the grid. 
At the same time, we're working to drive sustainable efficiencies in our own cost structures. Through our benchmarking and continuous improvement efforts, we've successfully reduced cost in a number of areas over the last few years. Going forward, we'll continue to capture savings through process improvement, technology investments and procurement efficiencies while maintaining a strong focus on safety and reliability. 
So as I think you can see, we're at the forefront of a lot of exciting industry changes. California's vision of a decarbonized economy creates a lot of investment opportunities. As we just discussed, we are well positioned to manage changes to our load profile as customer choice increases. 
So before I turn it back over to Jason to talk about our updated guidance, I want to say again how proud I am of the progress that this team has made over the last 6 years. We have had a relentless focus on safety and reliability, and you can really see the results of that in our operational metrics. I'm excited about our future and confident in our ability to deliver strong operational and financial results going forward. 
So with that, let me turn it back over to Jason"
139813,403758895,1077029,"PG&E Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2016",2016-11-04,"Earnings Calls","PG&E Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Tony. I'm going to finish up today's presentation by reviewing our 2017 earnings guidance and updated CapEx and rate base guidance through 2019. Turning to Slide 25. Our 2017 guidance on an earnings from operations basis is $3.55 to $3.75 per",1018,"Thank you, Tony. I'm going to finish up today's presentation by reviewing our 2017 earnings guidance and updated CapEx and rate base guidance through 2019. 
Turning to Slide 25. Our 2017 guidance on an earnings from operations basis is $3.55 to $3.75 per share. We're also providing ranges for the items impacting comparability, which I'll come back to in a minute after we review the guidance assumptions on Slide 26. 
Starting with the upper left corner, you'll see we're assuming capital expenditures of roughly $6 billion. We've included the breakdown by rate case here. In the upper right corner, our estimated weighted average rate base is about $34.3 billion for the year. Both the CapEx and rate base assumptions are within the ranges we provided last quarter. In the lower left, we continue to assume a CPUC-authorized equity ratio of 52% and a return on equity of 10.4%. 
Finally, in the bottom right corner, we list some of the other factors we believe will affect 2017 earnings from operations. Our guidance assumes that both the GRC settlement and the proposed Phase 2 decision in the Gas Transmission rate case are approved without material change. And you'll recall that we do not seek recovery in the Gas Transmission rate case for about $50 million of cost in 2017. We're also showing a positive item here for incentive revenues and other benefits, which include things like our energy efficiency programs. I'll note that we're no longer showing a positive item for tax benefits consistent with the guidance we previously provided. And we continue to expect that CWIP earnings will be offset by below-the-line costs, which includes things like charitable contributions, advertising and certain environmental costs. In 2017, we expect that a number of other -- we expect that the other earnings factors listed here will largely offset each other. As a result, we are targeting to earn the CPUC-authorized return on equity on rate base for the enterprise as a whole. 
Turning to Slide 27. The guidance for our items impacting comparability ranges from a negative $35 million to a positive $40 million pretax. The categories are consistent with the items we had in 2016. The estimated range for pipeline-related expenses is $80 million to $125 million pretax. This item relates to clearing our gas transmission rights-of-way. While we're confident in our ability to fully complete the program within this range, there is a chance that a small portion of that work could slip to 2018 due to permitting requirements. We'll monitor the program throughout the year and provide updates as we have better information. 
The second component is legal and regulatory-related expenses, which we estimate to be between $10 million and $40 million pretax. This represents costs incurred with enforcement, regulatory and litigation activities regarding natural gas matters and regulatory communications. 
The third component is for potential fines and penalties again related to natural gas matters and regulatory communications. We're showing a total of $30 million, which reflect the 2017 portion of the disallowed expenses expected from the Phase 2 Gas Transmission rate case decision. While we haven't yet reflected the 2017 portion of the ex-parte penalty, we'd expect to record an additional $14 million pretax after the proposed Phase 2 decision is approved. Butte fire-related costs were uncertain in 2017, but this item will reflect any updates to third-party liability estimates, legal costs and insurance receivables. And finally, for the Gas Transmission rate case, we're showing a positive $160 million for the portion of the 2015 and 2016 out-of-period revenues that we plan to recognize in 2017. 
Turning to Slide 28. We assume equity issuance of about $400 million to $600 million in 2017. That compares to roughly $800 million in 2016. The main drivers for the difference are the lower expected San Bruno penalty costs and gas transmission capital disallowance. Partially offsetting these reductions are higher capital expenditures. 
After 2017, we expect our unrecovered cost to continue to decline as we wrap up the gas transmission rights-of-way program. As a result, in 2018 and 2019, we expect to be able to meet our equity needs largely through our internal programs, which can generate about $350 million annually. 
Moving to Slides 29 and 30. We've updated our CapEx and rate base guidance through 2019. This year, we're including a breakdown by major rate case. For the General Rate Case, the numbers are consistent with the all-party settlement we announced earlier this year. For the gas transmission and storage rate case, the numbers are consistent with the assumptions embedded in our Q2 guidance with one exception. We previously assumed that roughly $400 million would be added to rate base in 2017 for their 2011 through 2014 capital spend, subject to audit. Because that audit has not yet begun, we're now assuming that the $400 million will be added to rate base in 2018. For the electric Transmission Owner rate case, we show a small range, which represents the TO18 request at the high end and the TO17 settlement at the low end. We've held these assumptions flat through 2019. 
We've also listed some items here that are not included in our rate base assumptions including primarily any new investments that will be included in the 2019 Gas Transmission rate case and the 2018 and 2019 electric transmission rate cases. 
Finally, Slide 31 is just a reminder that we are targeting a roughly 60% payout ratio for our dividend by 2019. On average, this should provide for above average dividend per share growth. I knew we've covered a lot this morning. Let me conclude by reiterating the points Tony started with. Over the last 6 years, our focus on safety has resulted in significant operational improvements. We have a number of strategic advantages that help position us to effectively manage industry changes. And we believe our roughly 6.5% to 7.5% -- sorry, we believe our roughly 6.5% to 7% rate base growth and above average dividend per share growth through 2019 make us an attractive investment. 
With that, I'll open it up for questions in the time we have remaining."
