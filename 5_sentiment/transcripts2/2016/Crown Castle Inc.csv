As you saw from our release yesterday, the fourth quarter was another great quarter, bringing 2015 to a strong close and positioning us to raise our full year 2016 outlook. For the full year 2015, AFFO per share of $4.30 was up 8% compared to 2014, and our increased midpoint for full year 2016 outlook for AFFO per share of $4.68 represents a 9% increase compared to 2015.
In addition to delivering great results and extending our track record of execution, 2015 was marked by several significant accomplishments. During 2015, we achieved an investment-grade credit rating from each of S&P and Fitch ratings. Also during the year, we redeployed capital from the divestiture of our former Australian subsidiary to further grow and strengthen our leadership position in wireless infrastructure in the U.S., which we believe is the most attractive market for wireless investment.
Today, with our portfolio of approximately 40,000 towers and 16,000 miles of fiber supported small cell deployments. We are able to provide wireless carriers comprehensive solutions across the country as they continue to upgrade and enhance their networks to meet increasing consumer demand for mobile data.
Shifting to the fourth quarter results on Slide 4, site rental revenue grew 9% year-over-year from $723 million to $785 million, an increase of $62 million. The $62 million increase is comprised of $49 million of organic site rental revenue growth, less $17 million in adjustments for straight line accounting associated with contracted fixed rate escalation, plus $30 million in contributions from acquisitions, which primarily consisted of [indiscernible] and other adjustments. The organic site rental revenue growth of $49 [ph]  Million represents growth of 7% year-over-year comprised of approximately 10% growth from new leasing activity and cash escalations, net of approximately 3% in tenant nonrenewals.
Moving to Slide 5. Our fourth quarter results reflect rental gross margin adjusted EBITDA and AFFO exceeded the midpoint of our previously provided fourth quarter 2015 outlook.
Turning to investment activity, as shown on Slide 6. During the fourth quarter, we invested $251 million in capital expenditures, of which $29 million was sustaining capital expenditures and $222 million was discretionary investment. Included in our discretionary investment is approximately $23 million for land purchases. 
Our proactive approach to achieving long-term control of the ground beneath our sites is core to our business as we seek to control our largest operating expense and produce stable and growing cash flow over time. Today, 3/4 of our site rental gross margin generated from towers on land owned or controlled for more than 20 years. Where we have ground leases, the average term remaining on our ground leases is approximately 30 years. Of the remaining discretionary investments, we invested $199 million in revenue-generating capital expenditures consisting of $90 million on existing sites and $109 million on the construction of new sites, primarily small cell construction activity. Small cells continued to perform ahead of expectations and currently generate 12% of total site rental revenue and 11% of total site rental gross margin. Excluding the benefit from our recent acquisition of Sunesys, small cell site rental revenue grew approximately 30% year-over-year. 
Today, our small cell networks consist of approximately 17,000 nodes on air here or under construction supported by 16,000 miles of fiber. Of the 17,000 nodes miles, approximately 12,000 of the nodes are on air with the other approximately 5,000 nodes under construction and expected to be completed over the next 12 to 24 months. 
Continuing on to financing activities, during the quarter, we paid a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.885 per share or $295 million in the aggregate. For the full year 2015, we paid quarterly common stock dividend in aggregate of $3.345 per common share. Additionally, in January, we closed on a $5.5 billion senior unsecured credit facility. Proceeds from the new facility, together with cash on hand, were used to repay our previous senior secured credit facilities as of January 26 [ph], we have $1.6 billion of availability under our 5-year revolver. As a result of the refinancing, our senior unsecured notes were upgraded by S&P to investment grade.
Even more impactful than lowering the cost of debt, we believe that an investment-grade capital structure will ultimately drive down our cost of equity. Equally as important, we believe having access to a deeper pool of capital will result in a more stable, long-term cash flow and increased flexibility to pursue discretionary growth opportunities.
Moving on to the full year 2016 on Slide 7. We have increased our expectations at the midpoint for site rental revenues by $10 million, site rental gross margin by $7 million and adjusted EBITDA by $12 million and AFFO by $11 million. The increase in the outlook reflects the strong results from the fourth quarter, our continuing belief that 2016  leasing activities will be similar to 2015, and the timing benefit related to tenant nonrenewals occurring later than previously expected.
It is important to note that our overall expectations for the number of tenant nonrenewals in aggregate has remained unchanged. For more detailed information regarding our current book of contracted tenant leases, including our expectations for nonrenewals, those are available in our supplemental information package.
At the AFFO per share line, the updated midpoint of our full year 2016 outlook results to 9% growth year-over-year compared to 2015, increasing from $4.30 per share to $4.68 [ph] per share.
Like 2015, 2016 is shaking up to be another great year. We believe the essential elements for long-term shareholder value creation are attractive as they've ever been. We continue to see stable and consists leasing from our carrier customers. We have a run rate of attractive discretionary investment opportunities, primarily in the form of small cell to enhance and grow our business. And we have an opportunity to manage the cost of debt and lower the cost of equity as we transition to an investment-grade balance sheet. All of this gives us confidence in maintaining our long-term goal of delivering AFFO per share and dividend per share growth of 6% to 7% on an annual basis.
Before turning the call over to Ben, I'd like to take this moment to discuss the announced succession plan. I'm honored and excited to have the opportunity to lead the Crown Castle team. I've had the privilege of working with Ben over the last 17 years and he has been a great friend and mentor to me. Over the last 8 years, through Ben's leadership as CEO, we have grown the business significantly, increasing AFFO per share from $1.66 to $4.30 and have successfully doubled the size of our tower portfolio, established ourselves as the leader in small cell and strengthened our balance sheet, positioning us better than ever to capitalize on the to tremendous opportunities that lie ahead. I will benefit greatly in my new role by being surrounded by very talented and experienced executive team that has been instrumental in all of these accomplishments.
Together with the rest of the Crown Castle team, we are looking forward to continuing to execute on our strategy of driving long-term shareholder return through disciplined capital allocation, dividend growth and delivering for our customers. And with that, I'll turn it over to Ben."

I'll touch on our success plan in a moment, but first I'd like to comment on 2015 results and what lies ahead. In short, we had a great year, exceeding our expectations throughout the year and an executing on strategic actions through, the sale of our Australian and the purchase of the Sunesys fiber assets that really sets us up well to win in the future.
I want to thank my colleagues at Crown Castle for their hard work in delivering on our commitments in 2015. 
Now on to the future. As Jay just mentioned, we believe we have the essential elements from long-term shareholder value creation and they're as attractive as ever. I'd like to spend a few minutes to further elaborate on Jay's comments regarding each of these elements. These include: a continued healthy and sustained leasing environment over the next several years; a long runway of investment opportunities that we expect to drive high-quality long-term growth and all the while maintaining a strong balance sheet and managing risk appropriately to drive down the cost of capital. 
First, on leasing. We believe that we're in the midst of a multiyear wireless investment cycle that will result in a sustained level of leasing activity, similar to what we experienced in 2014 and 2015. And that is what we expect to see in 2016.
For 2016, we're expecting approximately $170 million in new leasing activity. Of which, $150 million -- $115 million will come from tower leasing. The $115 million in tower leasing represents a pace of adding approximately 1 tenant equivalent over a 10-year period on our 40,000 towers or 1/10 of a tenant per year per tower, which is approximately our average pace of annual leasing over the last 7 years. Importantly, through those 7 years, we've been through a number of different macroeconomic cycles and covered several different wireless investment cycles in terms of technology, level of engagement by carrier customers and different environments. Given the underlying long-term perspective of positive fundamentals, from the continued increase in mobile data consumption, we believe that this pace of leasing is a reasonable expectation for our future growth.
Industry research projects mobile data to increase sevenfold between 2014 and 2019, a compounded annual growth rate of 47% while roughly doubling every 2 years. Recently, some of the wireless carriers have recorded mobile data growth even higher in the range 60% to 75% per year growth during 2015. Against this backdrop, we expect the carriers to continue to invest on a consistent basis to maintain and improve network quality, which is a competitive necessity as carriers retain existing customers, attract new customers and monetize their networks through the development of new revenue streams, such as over-the-top video and telematics.
As a shared wireless infrastructure provider, Crown Castle stands ready to assist wireless carriers in this by providing them with quick cost-effective access to wireless infrastructure as they seek to upgrade and enhance their networks.
With our tower portfolio and small cell expertise, we have the unique capability to deliver across all means of shared infrastructure to meet the network needs of our carrier customers. Additionally, the run rate for our growth is further supported by the amount of spectrum that is expected to be deployed over the next several years, including a spectrum from last year's AWS3 auction, the spectrum from this year's anticipated broadcast incentive auction and the spectrum currently held by the carriers and others such as dish and FirstNet. 
Turning to capital allocation. When we evaluate various investment alternatives we have whether it's small cell, share purchases or acquisitions, our goal is to drive long-term growth and AFFO per share and dividend per share. By this measure, we are very excited by a recent and ongoing investment in small cells. To date, our $3 billion investment in small cells generates a yield of approximately 8%, inclusive of our initial $1 billion investment in NextG, the acquisition we did in 2012 with, an initial yield of approximately 3% to 4% and our continued greenfield investments.
We are underwriting new small cell builds with anticipated initial yield of 6% to 8% on the anchor tenant where we believe we have the opportunity to drive yields higher through co-location, with the second tenant expected to achieve low to mid teens yield and the expectation of further yield accretion when we add a third and fourth tenant in overtime.
On this front, in addition to the anchor tenant, we are seeing strong co-location demand on our small cell networks. We have focused our small cell efforts in the top 25 markets and believe that these early systems will be some of the most attractive locations in the future given their franchise value.  
Just like towers, the need for network densification is driving small cell growth. Given the challenges carriers space and bringing more capacity to many urban and suburban geographies, the need to get closer to the subscribers, and focused on resuing spectrum more efficiently, carriers are turning to small cells as a critical tool to improve their networks.
With a very similar business and economic model is our tower business. We see a long runway of attractive investment opportunities in small cells. 
Shifting to the balance sheet and risk profile. We view our dividend as a growing annuity paid to shareholders, while we effectively pass through the cash flow we generate from providing U.S. wireless carriers with access to mission-critical infrastructure. Our goal is to protect and grow the dividend stream over time. 
Our dividend is supported by long-term recurring contracted leases that we have in place, which currently represent approximately $20 billion of future contracted rent payments plus future growth from contracted rent escalators and a continuing wireless investments being made, as I mentioned. From this foundation, we are focused on managing financial and operating risk as we allocate capital and grow the business. 
On the balance sheet side, we believe maintaining an investment grade balance sheet should provide us with access to a deeper and more stable pool of capital, reducing risk to our cash flow and providing us with an increased flexibility to pursue potential investment opportunities, both of which are supportive of the securing growing dividend.  This bank perspective drives our capital allocation decisions as we continue to believe that the U.S. market provides us with the most attractive risk-adjusted return opportunities.
Bottom line, with the sustained level of leasing that we expect to continue over the next several years, the small cell opportunities still ahead of us, the strength of our balance sheet, and the quality of our business, we believe we can continue to deliver 6% to 7% AFFO per share and dividend growth per share. Further, we believe our expected growth rate combined with our current dividend yield of approximately 4.3% represents a very attractive long-term total return profile for shareholders.
Finally, I'd like to speak to our CEO succession plan that we announced last night. I began contemplating this and subsequently engaged the board in this conversation from time to go after on a number of considerations that led me to conclude that 2016 was the right time to begin this transition.
First, as we discussed on this call, the company is incredibly well positioned for this transition, having accomplished a number of strategic objectives that I believe are important to set us up for the next generation of market leadership and value creation. Including on this list would be assemblage of our unrivaled tower portfolio, the sale of our Australian business, the acquisition of Sunesys and leadership in the exciting small cell arena, and the strength in the balance sheet with the achievement of investment-grade rating late last year.
Second, Jay is ready, ready to step up. We worked together for 17 years since the early days of Crown Castle, and he has been an integral part of all we have accomplished. He has the trust and respect of the board, the executive team and the organization as well as the investment community.
I am very fortunate to have him as a successor and have absolute confidence that he is the right leader to lead the organization into this next chapter of success. Most importantly though, Jay will be leading a team of seasoned professionals who are very good at executing for customers across all our assets of towers and small cells. 
Finally, on a personal level, it's been an unbelievable privilege to lead Crown as CEO these last 8 years. I have always found it available from time to time to push myself out of my comfort zone in search of new challenges. Many years ago, I lost my dad to a heart attack when he was only 47. In 2014, my wife has a breast cancer scare before she was caught early has resulted in a full recovery. With our kids out of the house now, our once lives have changed. It is with all these considerations and the reminder that life is short but I sense that it is the right time to initiate this move out of my comfort zone. I look forward to pursuing many new challenges, some personal and some professional.  I also look forward to my continuing investment and involvement in Crown Castle in this capacity, ensuring leadership continuity as Executive Vice Chairman. I am proud of what we've accomplished. And through this succession plan, I'm highly confident this team will continue to reward shareholders, customers and employees for choosing Crown Castle.
Thank you to all of you on this call who has supported me and this management team over the years. I look forward to our continued association. 
With that, operator, we'd be happy to turn the call over for questions."

I'm looking forward to continue to work with both of you guys. The -- kind of focusing on the business as we kind of look ahead, I guess I've got a couple of questions. One, just on the obvious, with respect to kind of all the noise coming out of Sprint, with respect to their network architecture. We don't have to talk about Sprint necessarily the correct that that is looking to explore new more ways to build the network and it seems that they're looking to reevaluate their renewal schedule on the tower leases as we go forward. I was wondering if you can kind of talk about what if anything you see ahead for that strategy? And then second, Jay, a year ago, you were sitting here and I think the outlook was for new site leasing activity of maybe 5% and now we're sitting here looking at actually 6%, a better outlook for this year. Over the course of last year, that outlook actually went up by about a percentage point. So kind of what are the factors that you see maybe evolving in 2016 that could do to this year's guidance what happened in the last year's guidance in terms of walking it up the curve of touch over the course of the year?"
27198,321591835,922142,"Crown Castle International Corp. (REIT), Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2016",2016-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Crown Castle Inc.","Executives","Sure, Dave. This is Ben.

This is Ben. First of all, without addressing Sprint what I'd like to talk about is the fact that 3 of the 4 carriers have reported thus far and I think all of them in various ways have confirmed the need for macro sites being an integral part of their network now and in the future, and that shouldn't be surprising any of us most of the business. Macro sites, i.e. towers, remains the most attractive and cost effective way to cover a given geography with the spectrum that they own. That said, there are certainly hybrid sites and architectures that we participate in, and many people do, that are going to augment the capacity of the networks going forward and that's the whole small cell underlay approach. And frankly, sites that look at like crosses between macro sites and small cells, dark fiber and that sort of see Cal architecture looks like over time. When you think about our business fundamentally, it's a capital-intensive business. Those with the lowest cost of capital tend to win. And when you introduce on top of that the notion of shared economics, i.e. the carriers only pay for the proportion of the assets that they need, it's an incredibly compelling model and it's one that I think it's going to continue to work as it has for the last 20 years for the investment in the future. So when carriers work on new deployments and new architectures with certain inappropriate due to save cost, we're going to be right there with them at every step of the way. And I can say that we're working with all 4 carriers in that regard to utilize our cost of capital and sharing model to be an integral part of their solution going forward. And so, I think it's been helpful for the last couple of weeks at 3 of the 4 carriers have confirmed that macro tower sites are an integral part of their model going forward. It's not surprising to us but I think this hybrid type network going forward is going to be very important and we're incredibly well positioned with assets and capability to take advantage of that. But when you hear us talk about cost of capital, it's not simply just to lower the cost on the balance sheet of our interest expense. It is very much to be the most competitive company out there that can deploy capital assets on behalf of these carriers and be very efficient for them. And that is something we're spending a lot of time on as an executive team and very comfortable with what you've seen in front of us."

So if you look at our guidance for 2016, we held that elevated level of leasing activities throughout the full year, full calendar year 2016 such that leasing activity we think this year will match that 2015. As for potential upside there, I'd point to the fact that typically in the business, we have about 6 to 8 months of visibility from the time we have an application from a carrier to the time it's actually revenue-producing. So we have a really good idea as to where our new tenant leasing is going to be for at least the first half of the year and maybe a bit into the third quarter. To the extent that there was an additional leasing activity over the course of the year, that's more likely to impact our run rates going into 2017 that it is to be that meaningful to results in 2016."

So when you think of a tower co-location, which is a 100% co-location on existing site, a co-location or an additional on a Sunesys piece of fiber or a Crown fiber is always a hybrid. So there's always a percentage of overlap and a percentage of new typically, but and examples maybe otherwise like Manhattan where there was pretty full overlap. So that's working well. It drives our increasing sort of accretive yields on the assets. As I mentioned in my remarks, represents about 8% on the embedded capital like to date. And so as we're building additional -- either additional laterals or a combination co-locations, it's essentially driving up that yield over time. Now we're going to have better metrics for you in the coming quarters because of this is got a lot of moving parts to and we're going to come up with that for everyone to help with their modeling later in the year. What we focus on as a management team is ultimately yield on the investment capital. That cuts through all the metrics, whether it's tenants per node or nodes per mile or revenue per mile. And so we're going to help everybody with that later in the year so that we can all be clear. But that's how we've given you these sort of run rate yields. It's validating for ourselves as well, but we're continuing to see accretive investments in that space."

We bought 17,000 sites in the last, I guess, 3 years that are looking for more tenants. So those towers were acquired from AT&T mobile most recently, are very attractive co-location candidates and probably, not probably, absolutely represent the biggest value creation opportunity we have in the company and that is to co-locate on an existing power and we're quite happy with that going forward. The fact is that the carriers have essentially sold the vast majority of their sites. There's some small portfolios out there and it has been somewhat aggregated by the 3 large tower companies. So I don't see any large on the horizon another. It's certainly not a requirement for us to create significant value, as we just mentioned. The organic growth is what drives value around here. But I would also highlights, go back to 2001 and 2000 and 1999, when essentially the carriers sold out all their sites initially and then went to a whole another wave of that some 15 [ph] years later. So we do think there'll be a need for more tower sites over time as cell sites continue to shrink and requirements continue to increase. There's nothing significant other today and we're certainly advancing our leadership position on this newer architecture around small cells as we talked about. On the outdoor business for small cells, while we are about 90% focused in the top 25 markets, we're constantly looking at opportunities outside the 25 markets. And so your question, I think is how big could this be and the answer, we don't really know but it looks like it can be sort of a whole another tower business. It's hard. It's expensive. It takes a long time to build these systems. But at the same time, we are focused on what we think are franchise locations in something of a land grab that reminds us a lot of the early days of the tower business. And so, we're focusing our efforts in these top 25 markets, but I don't think it's going to be limited to that. In fact, I know it's not because we're looking at opportunities occasionally outside those markets. And it looks like it's got a long long runway."

A tenant in an office building can set up their own system or an office building can own their own system. There's a lot of different variations. And then there's a limitation in the marketplace still as to what the carriers will ultimately elect to pay for in terms of the rent. As we've said forever, and you all know this, there's more need in the market for a densification in network than there are hours in the day or capital that carries can invest. So there's a rational privatization going on. I think you're certainly seeing this extent to health care facilities now. And so we're certainly looking at the indoor business out there when we find it effective, but I don't think it's as large as the outdoor business."

Miles of fiber were relatively flat and we added nodes against those fiber miles. It's exactly co-location. I mean that's the business that we're in and why we're interested in the tower business and why we like the small cell business. We have an asset investment against additional recurring revenue and that drives the long-term view of that invested capital and that's the model we're seeing play out, as Ben and I referenced in our comments. We've seen really attractive lease up activity on the fiber that we own today and that's driving additional nodes against number of miles of fiber. We're going to continue to see that as well as continuing to make investments as we build new systems and that's the driver of our activity at the moment. On the second question, the propagation characteristics of a small cell, there's no simple answer to that question or [indiscernible] answer to that question. It's designed based on what the carriers desire. And so you can go into a given area and find small cell every 100, 200 yards where they're trying to really increase the density of their network. At other places, you'll see space a little further than that. So there's no easy answer to say that propagation of the small cell has to do with what spectrum they deploy, what small cell, how much power they use, so it can vary. I would say in a typical urban environment, you're going to cover about a block to 2 blocks of area when deploy -- when the carriers deploy small cells. And so we will see what it was about every other block would be a relatively normal deployment into urban areas. But if you look at across the entire portfolio on an outdoor basis, we're typically -- when we're building a new system for someone, we'll be somewhere between 2 and 2.5 nodes per mile of fiber on the initial deployment so that gives you some idea of what we see. And obviously, there can be some pretty wide swings depending on whether or not we're doing the central business district or doing something outside of the density populated areas [indiscernible]."

And so, we have seen opportunities come back to us on occasion, where the awardee may have had some challenges in the market. What matters most carriers if they have a need for small cells is execution, meeting your milestones, getting on the air so that they can accomplish the capacity enhancements that they're trying to do on with their network.

So as the carriers come in to launch a spectrum, to get maximum efficiency out of that very expensive spectrum, they're adding more equipment to the sites, to the existing sites. That just makes sense. The cost of that incremental amendment on a tower is nothing compared to getting the maximum value out of that spectrum in that particular geography. And that's what's driving a lot of our amendment activity across all of the carriers and has for years. I don't see that changing. But in addition to that, you're not going to cover the capacity requirements simply by adding spectrum to existing sites. It's just mathematically impossible. You can't get the capacity requirements that are required. And so what happens is in addition to adding that spectrum on the existing sites, we're then seeing small cells added in an approach which gives the multiples of that spectrum capacity because they're better using the spectrum in that geography and unloading, effectively unloading the capacity challenge on the macro side. So you're going to see both. It's exactly what's driving our business today. The carriers are obviously being very rational about how do they prioritize their spend and they're looking at spectrum auction and having to pay for the spectrum often, and then how do they maximize the capacity over time. And then various carriers, they're in various stages of that today whether that's sulci densification or macro site amendments.

Wireless carriers essentially rebuilt the tower portfolio on their own balance sheet since we have an industry acquired in the early 2000s and then elected to monetize it over time in the last 3 years. I think carriers will from time to time experiment with lots of different methods to add capacity to the network. That's not new. It goes back to the earlier comment and there's a lot different technology variations. I think it's generally accepted that fiber connectivity for small cells and towers ultimately through dark fiber connectivity provides the most flexibility and the most capacity for a given location. And so I think you're going to see over time that fiber, whether you're talking about fiber to the cell or fiber to the small cell, is a necessary element long term to accomplish what they need. And it goes back to the earlier comments on this call around cost of capital and sharing model. Certainly, it's possible for carriers to work and build their own systems and certainly, free to do that and operate in the same constraints that we do around permitting and zoning and rights of lay and things like that. But they can avail themselves of a lower cost of capital, allow themselves to put their capital back to work in their primary business, and we pass along some of that shared economics to them in that construct, that's going to make a lot of sense and it has for the last 20 years and that's what we're pursuing."

In those are 25 markets, how many of those are you where you're comfortable with the amount of fiber that you had? And really what I'm getting at is what's the likelihood of you going and doing another Sunesys like acquisition in 2016?

On the third question, when we did the Sunesys acquisition, I know initially when we announced it, we weren't sure exactly what the timing of the closing was going to be. The revenue growth year-over-year is a couple of million dollars to the guidance that we gave you was what we were expecting in 2016. And really, your 2 questions are fairly closely tied together. When we look at fiber in these markets and the opportunities that we're seeing more broadly than just Sunesys and whether that's expanding our portfolio on the top 25 markets, or has Ben referenced earlier, if we're looking outside of the top 25 markets, our aim is to own fiber that is supportive of the wireless carrier. That's our core business and that's what we're focused on. And so, when we look at opportunities for fiber, that's what we have in mind. What can we do with that fiber ultimately to drive yields on the capital invested and we think that yield is going to be primarily driven through investment by the wireless carriers and that's [indiscernible] with us or in some cases, fiber to the cell. There may be some acquisitions in the future albeit frankly, if we talked about when we did the Sunesys acquisition, we think that as it is really unique. It was dark fiber in major Metro markets in the U.S. And while we have found a few tuck-in acquisitions, like the one we did 2 years ago in the Baltimore-Washington area, those are relatively rare. So we're not thinking about this as getting in to per se the fiber business or expanding into the fiber business. Over time, we may find opportunities to add additional yield through recurring revenue sources across the fiber that we own, because of the location of the fiber, it's in urban areas where there's lots of density of population and so we may find opportunities to add additional revenue and drive return. But our focus both on the investment is always where we are focusing our sales efforts is around supporting our wireless carrier customers. That's what we really want do and what we want to be. And so that's where you are going to see us invest capital and focus over time both in the near term and what we believe currently has the the long-term strategy of the firm."

As you saw from our release yesterday, the fourth quarter was another great quarter, bringing 2015 to a strong close and positioning us to raise our full year 2016 outlook. For the full year 2015, AFFO per share of $4.30 was up 8% compared to 2014, and our increased midpoint for full year 2016 outlook for AFFO per share of $4.68 represents a 9% increase compared to 2015.
In addition to delivering great results and extending our track record of execution, 2015 was marked by several significant accomplishments. During 2015, we achieved an investment-grade credit rating from each of S&P and Fitch ratings. Also during the year, we redeployed capital from the divestiture of our former Australian subsidiary to further grow and strengthen our leadership position in wireless infrastructure in the U.S., which we believe is the most attractive market for wireless investments.
Today, with our portfolio of approximately 40,000 towers and 16,000 miles of fiber supporting small cell deployments, we are able to provide wireless carriers comprehensive solutions across the country as they continue to upgrade and enhance their networks to meet increasing consumer demand for mobile data.
Shifting to the fourth quarter results on Slide 4. Site rental revenue grew 9% year-over-year from $723 million to $785 million, an increase of $62 million. The $62 million increase is comprised of $49 million of organic site rental revenue growth, less $17 million in adjustments for straight-line accounting associated with contracted fixed-rate tenant escalation, plus $30 million in contributions from acquisitions, which primarily consisted of Sunesys and other adjustments. The organic site rental revenue growth of $49 Million represents growth of 7% year-over-year, comprised of approximately 10% growth from new leasing activity and cash escalations, net of approximately 3% from tenant nonrenewals.
Moving to Slide 5. Our fourth quarter results for site rental gross margin, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO exceeded the midpoint of our previously provided fourth quarter 2015 outlook.
Turning to investment activities, as shown on Slide 6. During the fourth quarter, we invested $251 million in capital expenditures, of which $29 million was sustaining capital expenditures and $222 million was discretionary investments. Including in -- included in our discretionary investments is approximately $23 million for land purchases. 
Our proactive approach to achieving long-term control of the ground beneath our sites is core to our business as we seek to control our largest operating expense and produce stable and growing cash flow over time. Today, 3/4 of our site rental gross margin is generated from towers on land we own or control for more than 20 years. Where we have ground leases, the average term remaining on our ground lease is approximately 30 years. 
Of the remaining discretionary investments, we invested $199 million in revenue-generating capital expenditures, consisting of $90 million on existing sites and $109 million on the construction of new sites, primarily small cell construction activity. Small cells continue to perform ahead of expectation and currently generate 12% of total site rental revenues and 11% of total site rental gross margin. Excluding the benefit from our recent acquisition of Sunesys, small cell site rental revenues grew approximately 30% year-over-year. 
Today, our small cell networks consist of approximately 17,000 nodes on air or under construction, supported by 16,000 miles of fiber. Of the 17,000 nodes, approximately 12,000 of the nodes are on air, with the other approximately 5,000 nodes under construction and expected to be completed over the next 12 to 24 months. 
Continuing on to financing activities. During the quarter, we paid a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.885 per share or $295 million in the aggregate. For the full year 2015, we paid quarterly common stock dividend in aggregate of $3.345 per common share. Additionally, in January, we closed on a $5.5 billion senior unsecured credit facility. Proceeds from the new facility, together with cash on hand, were used to repay our previous senior secured credit facilities. As of January 26, we had $1.6 billion of availability under our 5-year revolver. As a result of the refinancing, our senior unsecured notes were upgraded by S&P to investment grade.
Even more impactful than lowering the cost of debt, we believe that an investment-grade capital structure will ultimately drive down our cost of equity. Equally as important, we believe having access to a deeper pool of capital will result in a more stable long-term cash flow and increased flexibility to pursue discretionary growth opportunities.
Moving on to the full year 2016 on Slide 7. We have increased our expectations at the midpoint for site rental revenues by $10 million, site rental gross margin by $7 million and adjusted EBITDA by $12 million and AFFO by $11 million. The increase in the outlook reflects the strong results from the fourth quarter, our continuing belief that 2016 leasing activities will be similar to 2015 and the timing benefit related to tenant nonrenewals occurring later than previously expected.
It is important to note that our overall expectations for the number of tenant nonrenewals in aggregate has remained unchanged. For more detailed information regarding our current book of contracted tenant leases, including our expectations for nonrenewals, those are available in our supplemental information package.
At the AFFO per share line, the updated midpoint of our full year 2016 outlook results in 9% growth year-over-year compared to 2015, increasing from $4.30 per share to $4.68 per share.
Like 2015, 2016 is shaping up to be another great year. We believe the essential elements for long-term shareholder value creation are as attractive as they've ever been. We continue to see stable and consistent leasing activity from our carrier customers. We have a runway of attractive discretionary investment opportunities primarily in the form of small cells to enhance and grow our business. And we have an opportunity to manage the cost of debt and lower the cost of equity as we transition to an investment-grade balance sheet. All of this gives us confidence in maintaining our long-term goal of delivering AFFO per share and dividend per share growth of 6% to 7% on an annual basis.
Before turning the call over to Ben, I'd like to take just a moment to discuss the announced succession plan. I'm honored and excited to have the opportunity to lead Crown -- the Crown Castle team. I have had the privilege of working with Ben over the last 17 years, and he has been a great friend and mentor to me. Over the last 8 years, through Ben's leadership as CEO, we have grown the business significantly, increasing AFFO per share from $1.66 to $4.30 and have successfully doubled the size of our tower portfolio, established ourselves as the leader in small cells and strengthened our balance sheet, positioning us better than ever to capitalize on the tremendous opportunities that lie ahead. I will benefit greatly in my new role from being surrounded by a very talented and experienced executive team that has been instrumental in all of these accomplishments.
Together with the rest of the Crown Castle team, we are looking forward to continuing to execute on our strategy of driving long-term shareholder return through disciplined capital allocation, dividend growth and delivering for our customers. And with that, I'll turn it over to Ben."

I'll touch on our succession plan in a moment, but first, I'd like to comment on 2015 results and what lies ahead. In short, we had a great year, exceeding our expectations throughout the year and executing on strategic actions through the sale of our Australian subsidiary and the purchase of the Sunesys fiber assets that really sets us up well to win in the future. I want to thank my colleagues at Crown Castle for their hard work in delivering on our commitments in 2015. 
Now on to the future. As Jay just mentioned, we believe we have the essential elements for long-term shareholder value creation, and they are as attractive as ever. I'd like to spend a few minutes to further elaborate on Jay's comments regarding each of these elements. These include a continued healthy and sustained leasing environment over the next several years, a long runway of investment opportunities that we expect will drive high-quality long-term growth and all the while maintaining a strong balance sheet and managing risk appropriately to drive down the cost of capital. 
First, on leasing. We believe that we're in the midst of a multiyear wireless investment cycle that will result in a sustained level of leasing activity, similar to what we have experienced in 2014 and 2015. And that is what we expect to see in 2016.
For 2016, we're expecting approximately $170 million in new leasing activity, of which 150 -- $115 million will come from tower leasing. The $115 million in tower leasing represents a pace of adding approximately one tenant equivalent over a 10-year period on our 40,000 towers or 1/10 of a tenant per year per tower, which is approximately our average pace of annual leasing over the last 7 years. 
Importantly, through those 7 years, we've been through a number of different macroeconomic cycles and covered several different wireless investment cycles in terms of technology, level of engagement by carrier customers and different environments. Given the underlying long-term perspective of positive fundamentals, from the continued increase in mobile data consumption, we believe that this pace of leasing is a reasonable expectation for our future growth.
Industry research projects mobile data to increase sevenfold between 2014 and 2019, a compounded annual growth rate of 47%, while roughly doubling every 2 years. Recently, some of the wireless carriers have reported mobile data growth even higher in the range of 60% to 75% per year growth during 2015. Against this backdrop, we expect the carriers to continue to invest on a consistent basis to maintain and improve network quality, which is the competitive necessity as carriers seek to retain existing customers, attract new customers and monetize their networks through the deployment and development of new revenue streams, such as over-the-top video and telematics.
As a shared wireless infrastructure provider, Crown Castle stands ready to assist wireless carriers in this endeavor by providing them with quick and cost-effective access to wireless infrastructure as they seek to upgrade and enhance their networks.
With our tower portfolio and small cell expertise, we have the unique capability to deliver across all means of shared infrastructure to meet the network needs of our carrier customers. Additionally, the runway for our growth is further supported by the amount of spectrum that is expected to be deployed over the next several years, including a spectrum from last year's AWS3 auction, the spectrum from this year's anticipated broadcast incentive auction and the spectrum currently held by the carriers and others such as Dish and FirstNet. 
Turning to capital allocation. When we evaluate various investment alternatives we have, whether it's small cell, share purchases or acquisitions, our goal is to drive long-term growth in AFFO per share and dividend per share. By this measure, we are very excited by our recent and ongoing investment in small cells. To date, our $3 billion investment in small cells generates a yield of approximately 8%, inclusive of our initial $1 billion investment in NextG, the acquisition we did in 2012, with an initial yield of approximately 3% to 4%, and our continued greenfield investments.
We are underwriting new small cell builds with anticipated initial yields of 6% to 8% on the anchor tenant where we believe we have the opportunity to drive yields higher through co-location, with the second tenant expected to achieve low to mid-teens yields and the expectation of further yield accretion when we add a third and fourth tenant over time.
On this point, in addition to the anchor tenant, we are seeing strong co-location demand on our small cell networks. We have focused our small cell efforts in the top 25 markets and believe that these early systems will be some of the most attractive locations in the future given their franchise value. 
Just like towers, the need for network densification is driving small cell growth. Given the challenges that carriers face in bringing more capacity to many urban and suburban geographies, the need to get closer to the subscribers and focus on reusing spectrum more efficiently, carriers are turning to small cells as a critical tool to improve their networks. With a very similar business and economic model as our tower business, we see a long runway of attractive investment opportunities in small cells. 
Shifting to the balance sheet and risk profile. We view our dividend as a growing annuity paid to shareholders where we effectively pass through the cash flows we generate from providing U.S. wireless carriers with access to mission-critical infrastructure. Our goal is to protect and grow the dividend stream over time. 
Our dividend is supported by long-term recurring contracted leases that we have in place, which currently represent approximately $20 billion in future contracted rent payments plus future growth from contracted rent escalators and the continuing wireless investments being made that I previously mentioned. From this foundation, we are focused on managing financial and operating risk as we allocate capital and grow the business. 
On the balance sheet side, we believe maintaining an investment-grade balance sheet should provide us with access to a deeper and more stable pool of capital, reducing risks to our cash flows and providing us with an increased flexibility to pursue potential investment opportunities, both of which are supportive of the secure and growing dividend. This same perspective drives our capital allocations decisions as we continue to believe that the U.S. market provides us with the most attractive risk-adjusted return opportunities.
Bottom line. With the sustained level of leasing that we expect to continue over the next several years, the small cell opportunities we see ahead of us, the strength of our balance sheet and the quality of our business, we believe we can continue to deliver 6% to 7% AFFO per share and dividend growth per share. Further, we believe our expected growth rate, combined with our current dividend yield of approximately 4.3%, represents a very attractive long-term total return profile for shareholders.
Finally, I'd like to speak to our CEO succession plan that we announced last night. I began contemplating this and subsequently engaged the board in this conversation some time ago after reflecting on a number of considerations that led me to conclude that 2016 was the right time to begin this transition.
First, as we've discussed on this call, the company is incredibly well positioned for this transition, having accomplished a number of strategic objectives that I believe are important to set us up for the next generation of market leadership and value creation. Including on this list -- included on this list will be the assemblage of our unrivaled tower portfolio, the sale of our Australian business, the acquisition of Sunesys and leadership in the exciting small cell arena and the strength in the balance sheet with the achievement of the investment-grade rating late last year.
Second, Jay is ready, ready to step up. We worked together for 17 years since the early days of Crown Castle, and he has been an integral part of all we have accomplished. He has the trust and respect of the board, the executive team and the organization as well as the investment community.
I am very fortunate to have him as a successor and have absolute confidence that he is the right leader to lead the organization into this next chapter of success. Most importantly, though, Jay will be leading a team of seasoned professionals who are very good at executing for customers across all our assets of towers and small cells. 
Finally, on a personal level, it's been an unbelievable privilege to lead Crown as CEO these last 8 years. I have always found it valuable from time to time to push myself out of my comfort zone in search of new challenges. Many years ago, I lost my dad to a heart attack when he was only 47. In 2014, my wife had a breast cancer scare that fortunately was caught early and, through surgery, has resulted in a full recovery. With our kids out of the house now, our once-structured lives have changed. It is with all these considerations and the reminder that life is short that I sense that it is the right time to initiate this move out of my comfort zone. I look forward to pursuing many new challenges, some personal and some professional. I also look forward to my continuing investment and involvement with Crown Castle in this new capacity, ensuring leadership continuity as Executive Vice Chairman. 
I am proud of what we've accomplished, and through this succession plan, I'm highly confident this team will continue to reward shareholders, customers and employees for choosing Crown Castle.
Thank you to all of you on this call who have supported me and this management team over the years. I look forward to our continued association. 
With that, operator, we'd be happy to turn the call over for questions."

I'm looking forward to continuing to work with both of you guys. The -- kind of focusing on the business as we kind of look ahead, I guess I have got a couple of questions. One, just on the obvious, with respect to kind of all the noise coming out of Sprint, with respect to their network architecture, we don't have to talk about Sprint necessarily. Let's just say there's a carrier out there that's looking to explore new, more efficient ways to build the network, and it seems that they're looking to reevaluate their renewal schedule on tower leases as we go forward. And I was wondering if you could kind of talk about what, if anything, you see ahead for that strategy. And then second, Jay, a year ago, we were sitting here, and I think the outlook was for new site leasing activity of maybe 5%, and now we're sitting here looking at actually 6%, a better outlook for this year. Over the course of last year, that outlook actually went up by about a percentage point. So kind of what are the factors that you see maybe evolving in 2016 that could do to this year's guidance what happened to last year's guidance in terms of whacking it up the curve over the course of the year?"

This is Ben. First of all, without addressing Sprint specifically, what I'd like to talk about is the fact that 3 of the 4 carriers have reported thus far, and I think all of them in various ways have confirmed the need for macro sites being an integral part of their network now and in the future. And that shouldn't be surprising to any of us that are close to the business. Macro sites, i.e., towers, remain the most attractive and cost-effective way to cover a given geography with the spectrum that they own. That said, there are certainly hybrid sites and HetNet architectures that we participate in and many people do, that are going to augment the capacity of the networks going forward, and that's the whole small cell underlay approach and, frankly, sites that look like crosses between macro sites and small cells, dark fiber fed, and ultimately, that's sort of what C-RAN architecture starts to look like over time. When you think about our business fundamentally, it's a capital-intensive business. Those with the lowest cost of capital tend to win. And when you introduce on top of that the notion of shared economics, i.e., the carriers only pay for the proportion of the asset that they need, it's an incredibly compelling model, and it's one that I think is going to continue to work as it has for the last 20 years for the indefinite future. So when carriers work on new deployments and new architectures, with certainly an inappropriate view to save cost, we're going to be right there with them at every step of the way. And I can tell you that we're working with all 4 carriers in that regard to utilize our cost of capital and the sharing model to be a integral part of their solution going forward. And so I think it's been helpful for the last couple of weeks that 3 of the 4 carriers have confirmed that macro tower sites are an integral part of their model going forward. That's not surprising to us, but I think this hybrid-type network going forward is going to be very important, and we are incredibly well positioned with assets and capability to take advantage of that. But when you hear us talk about the cost of capital, it's not simply just to lower the cost on the balance sheet of our interest expense. It is very much to be the most competitive company out there that can deploy capital assets on behalf of these carriers and make it very efficient for them. And so that's something we're spending a lot of time on as an executive team and very comfortable with what we see in front of us."

And as we looked at our guidance for 2016, we held that elevated level of leasing activity throughout the full year -- full calendar year 2016 such that leasing activity, we think, this year will match that of 2015. As for a potential upside there, I'd point to the fact that typically, in the business, we have about 6 to 8 months of visibility when -- from the time we have an application come in from a carrier to the time it's actually revenue-producing. So we have a real good idea as to where new tenant leasing is going to be for at least the first half of the year and maybe a bit into the third quarter. So to the extent that there was additional leasing activity over the course of the year, that's honestly more likely to impact our run rate going into 2017 than it is to be that meaningful to results in 2016."

Our bonus level for -- or across the employee base for the full year 2015 would have been above kind of our targeted level as we raised the outlook throughout the course of the year and delivered and even exceeded it in the fourth quarter. I think if you look at calendar year 2016, we think the run rate is basically unchanged from full year 2015. So as we talked about on previous calls, we think that there's virtually no cost increase at the GAAP line on the tower side or on the SG&A side for calendar year 2016, and that would be based on the current level of activity that we've seen in small cells, et cetera. We'll obviously have some operating costs in small cells as we deploy brand-new systems. But for the most part, on the tower side, we think costs are flat, and on the SG&A side, we think those costs are flat in '16 to '15."

The rationale behind the 10,000 miles of fiber we acquired, metro fiber and great markets with Sunesys, was that it would give us a great head start on small cell deployments, and that's exactly what it is. But it's a head start. It's not a perfect footprint. And so as you referenced, we're constantly working to improve that network just as we do with existing Crown fiber where we get a new engagement, and maybe there's -- as I've described before, there's always overlap. So when you think of a tower co-location, which is a 100% co-location on an existing site, a co-location or an additional deployment on a Sunesys piece of fiber or Crown fiber is always a hybrid. So there's always a percentage of overlap and a percentage of new typically, but in examples, maybe otherwise like Manhattan where there was pretty full overlap. So that's working well. It drives our increasing sort of accretive yields on the asset. As I mentioned in my remarks, represent about 8% on the embedded capital like to date. And so as we're building additional -- either additional laterals or a combination of co-locations, it's essentially driving up that yield over time. Now we're going to have better metrics for you in the coming quarters because I know this has got a lot of moving parts to it, and we're going to come out with that for everyone to help their modeling later in the year. What we focus on as a management team is ultimately the yield on the investment capital. That cuts through all the metrics, whether it's tenants per node or nodes per mile or revenue per mile. And so we're going to help everybody with that later in the year so that we're -- we can all be clear. But that's why we're giving you these sort of run rate yields. It's validating for ourselves as well that we're continuing to see accretive investments in that space."

We bought 17,000 sites in the last, I guess, 3 years that are looking for more tenants. So those towers we acquired from AT&T and T-Mobile most recently are very attractive co-location candidates and probably -- not probably, absolutely represent the biggest value creation opportunity we have in the company, that is to co-locate on an existing tower. And we're quite happy with that going forward. The fact is that the carriers had essentially sold the vast majority of their site. There's some small portfolios out there, and it has been somewhat aggregated by the 3 large carrier -- tower companies. So I don't see anything large on the horizon out there. It's certainly not a requirement for us to create significant value, as I just mentioned. The organic growth is what drives value around here. But I would also highlight, back to 2001 and 2000 and 1999 when essentially, the carriers sold all their sites initially, and then we went through a whole another wave of that some 15 years later. So we do think there'll be a need for more tower sites over time as cell sites continue to shrink and density requirements continue to increase. There's nothing significant out there today, and we are certainly advancing our leadership position on this newer architecture around small cells, as we talked about. On the outdoor business for small cells, while we are about 90% focused in the top 25 markets, we're constantly looking at opportunities outside the 25 markets. And so your question, I think, as to sort of how big could this be, and the answer is we don't really know, but it looks like it could be sort of a whole another tower business. It's hard. It's expensive. It takes a long time to build these systems. But at the same time, we are focused on what we think are franchise locations in something of a landgrab that reminds us a lot of the early days of the tower business. And so we're focusing our efforts in these top 25 markets, but I don't think it's going to be limited to that. In fact, I know it's not because we're looking at opportunities occasionally outside these markets, and looks like it's got a long, long runway."

Where we choose to play, we've done a lot of sports arenas, things like that. I think over time, you're going to see multi-tenant office buildings, but there are alternative solutions available to landlords and tenants. When you get into a multi-tenant facility, they don't necessarily lend themselves to a neutral host owner like ourselves. A tenant in an office building can set up their own system or an office building can own their own system. There's a lot of different variations. And then there's a limitation in the marketplace still as to what the carriers will ultimately elect to pay for in terms of the rent. As we've said forever, and we all know this, there's more need in the market for densification in network than there are hours in the day or capital that the carriers can invest. So there's a rational prioritization going on. I think you're certainly seeing this extend to health care facilities now. And so we're certainly looking at the indoor business there when we find it attractive, and -- but it's -- I don't think it's as large as the outdoor business."

You're right, miles of fiber were relatively flat, and we added nodes against those fibers -- against that fiber mile, which is exactly co-location. I mean, that's the business that we're in and why we're interested in and like tower business and why we like small cell business. We have an asset investment against which you add additional recurring revenue, and that drives the long-term yield on that invested capital. And that's the model we're seeing play out. As Ben and I referenced in our comments, we've seen really attractive lease-up activity on the fiber that we own today, and that's driving additional nodes against the number of miles of fiber. We're going to continue to see that as well as continuing to make investment as we build new systems, and that's the driver of our activity at the moment. On the second question, the propagation characteristics of a small cell, there's no simple answer to that question or a one-size-fits-all answer to that question. It's designed based on what the carriers desire. And so you can go into a given area and find a small cell every 100, 200 yards where they're trying to really increase the density of their network. At other places, you'll see them spaced a little further than that. So there's no easy answer to say that the propagation of a small cell, it has to do with what spectrum they deploy across that small cell, how much power they use. So it can vary. I would say, in a typical urban environment, you're going to cover about a block to 2 blocks of area when you deploy -- when the carriers deploy small cells. And so we'll see them put up nodes about every other block would be a relatively normal deployment in a dense urban area. If you look across the entire portfolio on an outdoor basis, we're typically -- when we're building a new system for someone, we'll be somewhere between 2 and 2.5 nodes per mile of fiber on the initial deployment. So that gives you some idea of what we see. And obviously, there can be some pretty wide swings depending on whether or not we're doing the central business district or doing something a little bit outside of the most densely populated areas of the city."

A lot of these systems are conducted through an RFP process initially. But at the same time, what matters most to carriers obviously is the ability of the award winner to execute. And so we have seen opportunities come back to us on occasion where the awardee may have had some challenges in the market. What matters most to carriers if they have a need for small cells is execution, meeting your milestones, getting on the air so that they can accomplish the capacity enhancements that they're trying to do on their network.

I think we've been pretty specific in the past about the amount of consolidation churn and nonrenewals and what was driving that, and our underlying assumptions are basically intact. So that's that. The second question on the tower side, we're seeing carriers do all kinds of things on the macro side. There's densification activity. There's amendments. There's adding new technologies. There's deploying additional spectrum that we've seen. And the mix of those amendments and new cell -- and brand-new cell sites in '16 is pretty similar to what we saw in 2015. So we're not seeing any trends here that I would point to as changes from what we saw in '15."

Again, the first thing a carrier does to add densification is macro tower site. And everywhere we're building small cells, there are macro tower coverages already there. So if you were to stand on the street corner where we have a deployment, you would already have a macro site covering -- keyword: covering -- that geography. And so we're building small cell networks, essentially an underlay approach, in -- to add capacity to these networks. But certainly, the macro tower side is what happens first, and that's continuing to be what we see on the tower side."

On the first, you mentioned some of the upcoming spectrum that seems to be coming to market. I mean, obviously, there have been select carriers who've talked about the opportunity set in terms of providing additional bandwidth with the deployment of follow-on spectrum. But there have also been discussions about how networks are dense enough and have additional capacity. And I'm just trying to sort of triangulate in terms of the opportunity set for you folks, I mean, do see those types of carriers looking to densify their networks? How should we think about the potential amendment opportunities going forward with things like AWS3 in terms of providing support for that longer-term runway?"

I think what you're referring to, Amir, is the inherent trade-off, that is, between spectrum and densification, i.e., to the extent you have more spectrum, you can do more with your existing sites and would then delay the need to densify in a particular area if you otherwise didn't have spectrum. And that's true, and yet what we see is kind of all of the above. So as the carriers come in and launch new spectrum, to get maximum efficiency out of that very expensive spectrum, they're typically adding more equipment to the sites, to the existing sites. That just makes sense. The cost of that incremental amendment on a tower is nothing compared to getting the maximum value out of that spectrum in that particular geography. And that's what's driving a lot of our amendment activity across all of the carriers and has for years. I don't see that changing. But in addition to that, you're not going to cover the capacity requirements simply by adding spectrum to existing sites. It's just mathematically impossible. You can't get the capacity requirements that are required. And so what happens is in addition to adding that spectrum on the existing sites, you're then seeing small cells added in an underlay approach, which gives them multiples of that spectrum capacity because they're then reusing that spectrum in that geography and unloading, effectively unloading the capacity challenge on the macro side. So you're going to see both. It's what -- it's exactly what's driving our business today. The carriers are obviously being very rational about how do they prioritize their spend, and they're looking at spectrum auctions and having to pay for the spectrum upfront, and then how do they maximize that capacity over time. And then various carriers, they're in various stages of that today, whether that's cell site densification or macro site amendments. But all of that drives our business, and it's something that we think is going to continue for a long, long time."

I mean, there has been some chatter in the marketplace with folks discussing opportunities to densify their networks, going at it alone in terms of utilizing certain technologies or potentially possible rights of access or a microwave backhaul, however you want to look at the combination of different opportunities. How do you sort of compare and contrast the opportunity set that you folks have, utilizing assets such as Sunesys or some of this landgrab that you had mentioned, versus carriers looking to potentially densify their network via small cells on their own sort of strategy?"

And if you think about it, the wireless carriers essentially rebuilt the tower portfolio on their own balance sheet since we as an industry acquired them in the early 2000s and then elected to monetize it over time in the last 3 years. I think carriers will, from time to time, experiment with lots of different methods to add capacity to their network. That's not new. It goes back to the earlier comments, and there's a lot of different technology variations. I think it's generally accepted that fiber connectivity for small cells and towers ultimately through dark fiber connectivity provides the most flexibility and the most capacity for a given location. And so I think you're going to see over time that fiber, whether you're talking about fiber to the cell or fiber to the small cell, is a necessary element long term to accomplish what they need. And it goes back to the earlier comments on this call around cost of capital and the sharing model. Certainly, it's possible for carriers to work and build their own systems and certainly free to do that and operate under the same constraints that we do around permitting and zoning and rights of way and things like that. But to the extent they can avail themselves of a lower cost of capital, allow themselves to put their capital back to work in their primary business and we pass along some of that shared economics to them in that construct, that's going to make a lot of sense as it has for the last 20 years, and that's what we're pursuing."

On the first question, when we did the Sunesys acquisition, I know initially when we announced it, we weren't sure exactly what the timing of the closing was going to be. The revenue growth year-over-year is a couple of million dollars, so the guidance that we gave you was what we were expecting in 2016. And really, your 2 questions are fairly closely tied together. When we look at fiber in these markets and the opportunities that we're seeing more broadly than just Sunesys and whether that's expanding our portfolio on the top 25 market or, as Ben referenced earlier, if we're looking outside of the top 25 markets, our aim is to own fiber that is supportive of the wireless carriers. That's our core business, and that's what we're focused on. And so when we look at opportunities for fiber, that's what we have in mind. What can we do with that fiber ultimately to drive yields on the capital invested? And we think that yield is going to be primarily driven through investment by the wireless carriers, and that's adding nodes to those or, in some cases, doing fiber to the cell. There may be some acquisitions in the future, although frankly, as we talked about when we did the Sunesys acquisition, we think that asset is really unique. It was dark fiber in major metro markets in the U.S. And while we have found a few tuck-in acquisitions, like the one we did 2 years ago in the Baltimore/Washington area, those are relatively rare. So we're not thinking about this as getting into per se the fiber business or expanding into the fiber business. Over time, we may find opportunities to add additional yield through recurring revenue sources across the fiber that we own because of the location of the fiber, it's in urban areas where there's lots of density of population, and so we may find opportunities to add additional revenue and drive return. But our focus both on the investment side as well as where we're focusing our sales effort is around supporting our wireless carrier customers. That's what we really want to do and what we want to be. So that's where you're going to see us invest capital and focus our time and effort both in the near term and what we believe currently will be the long-term strategy of the firm."

As you saw from our release yesterday, the fourth quarter was another great quarter, bringing 2015 to a strong close and positioning us to raise our full year 2016 outlook. For the full year 2015, AFFO per share of $4.30 was up 8% compared to 2014, and our increased midpoint for full year 2016 outlook for AFFO per share of $4.68 represents a 9% increase compared to 2015.
In addition to delivering great results and extending our track record of execution, 2015 was marked by several significant accomplishments. During 2015, we achieved an investment-grade credit rating from each of S&P and Fitch ratings. Also during the year, we redeployed capital from the divestiture of our former Australian subsidiary to further grow and strengthen our leadership position in wireless infrastructure in the U.S., which we believe is the most attractive market for wireless investments.
Today, with our portfolio of approximately 40,000 towers and 16,000 miles of fiber supporting small cell deployments, we are able to provide wireless carriers comprehensive solutions across the country as they continue to upgrade and enhance their networks to meet increasing consumer demand for mobile data.
Shifting to the fourth quarter results on Slide 4. Site rental revenue grew 9% year-over-year from $723 million to $785 million, an increase of $62 million. The $62 million increase is comprised of $49 million of organic site rental revenue growth, less $17 million in adjustments for straight-line accounting associated with contracted fixed-rate tenant escalation, plus $30 million in contributions from acquisitions, which primarily consisted of Sunesys and other adjustments. The organic site rental revenue growth of $49 million represents growth of 7% year-over-year, comprised of approximately 10% growth from new leasing activity and cash escalations, net of approximately 3% from tenant nonrenewals.
Moving to Slide 5. Our fourth quarter results for site rental gross margin, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO exceeded the midpoint of our previously provided fourth quarter 2015 outlook.
Turning to investment activities, as shown on Slide 6. During the fourth quarter, we invested $251 million in capital expenditures, of which $29 million was sustaining capital expenditures and $222 million was discretionary investments. Including in -- included in our discretionary investments is approximately $23 million for land purchases. 
Our proactive approach to achieving long-term control of the ground beneath our sites is core to our business as we seek to control our largest operating expense and produce stable and growing cash flow over time. Today, 3/4 of our site rental gross margin is generated from towers on land we own or control for more than 20 years. Where we have ground leases, the average term remaining on our ground lease is approximately 30 years. 
Of the remaining discretionary investments, we invested $199 million in revenue-generating capital expenditures, consisting of $90 million on existing sites and $109 million on the construction of new sites, primarily small cell construction activity. Small cells continue to perform ahead of expectation and currently generate 12% of total site rental revenues and 11% of total site rental gross margin. Excluding the benefit from our recent acquisition of Sunesys, small cell site rental revenues grew approximately 30% year-over-year. 
Today, our small cell networks consist of approximately 17,000 nodes on air or under construction, supported by 16,000 miles of fiber. Of the 17,000 nodes, approximately 12,000 of the nodes are on air, with the other approximately 5,000 nodes under construction and expected to be completed over the next 12 to 24 months. 
Continuing on to financing activities. During the quarter, we paid a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.885 per share or $295 million in the aggregate. For the full year 2015, we paid quarterly common stock dividend in aggregate of $3.345 per common share. Additionally, in January, we closed on a $5.5 billion senior unsecured credit facility. Proceeds from the new facility, together with cash on hand, were used to repay our previous senior secured credit facilities. As of January 26, we had $1.6 billion of availability under our 5-year revolver. As a result of the refinancing, our senior unsecured notes were upgraded by S&P to investment grade.
Even more impactful than lowering the cost of debt, we believe that an investment-grade capital structure will ultimately drive down our cost of equity. Equally as important, we believe having access to a deeper pool of capital will result in a more stable long-term cash flow and increased flexibility to pursue discretionary growth opportunities.
Moving on to the full year 2016 on Slide 7. We have increased our expectations at the midpoint for site rental revenues by $10 million, site rental gross margin by $7 million and adjusted EBITDA by $12 million and AFFO by $11 million. The increase in the outlook reflects the strong results from the fourth quarter, our continuing belief that 2016 leasing activities will be similar to 2015 and the timing benefit related to tenant nonrenewals occurring later than previously expected.
It is important to note that our overall expectations for the number of tenant nonrenewals in aggregate has remained unchanged. For more detailed information regarding our current book of contracted tenant leases, including our expectations for nonrenewals, those are available in our supplemental information package.
At the AFFO per share line, the updated midpoint of our full year 2016 outlook results in 9% growth year-over-year compared to 2015, increasing from $4.30 per share to $4.68 per share.
Like 2015, 2016 is shaping up to be another great year. We believe the essential elements for long-term shareholder value creation are as attractive as they've ever been. We continue to see stable and consistent leasing activity from our carrier customers. We have a runway of attractive discretionary investment opportunities primarily in the form of small cells to enhance and grow our business. And we have an opportunity to manage the cost of debt and lower the cost of equity as we transition to an investment-grade balance sheet. All of this gives us confidence in maintaining our long-term goal of delivering AFFO per share and dividend per share growth of 6% to 7% on an annual basis.
Before turning the call over to Ben, I'd like to take just a moment to discuss the announced succession plan. I'm honored and excited to have the opportunity to lead Crown -- the Crown Castle team. I have had the privilege of working with Ben over the last 17 years, and he has been a great friend and mentor to me. Over the last 8 years, through Ben's leadership as CEO, we have grown the business significantly, increasing AFFO per share from $1.66 to $4.30 and have successfully doubled the size of our tower portfolio, established ourselves as the leader in small cells and strengthened our balance sheet, positioning us better than ever to capitalize on the tremendous opportunities that lie ahead. I will benefit greatly in my new role from being surrounded by a very talented and experienced executive team that has been instrumental in all of these accomplishments.
Together with the rest of the Crown Castle team, we are looking forward to continuing to execute on our strategy of driving long-term shareholder return through disciplined capital allocation, dividend growth and delivering for our customers. And with that, I'll turn it over to Ben."

(REIT), Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2016",2016-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Crown Castle Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jay, and thanks to all of you for joining us on the call this morning extra early.

I'll touch on our succession plan in a moment, but first, I'd like to comment on 2015 results and what lies ahead. In short, we had a great year, exceeding our expectations throughout the year and executing on strategic actions through the sale of our Australian subsidiary and the purchase of the Sunesys fiber assets that really sets us up well to win in the future. I want to thank my colleagues at Crown Castle for their hard work in delivering on our commitments in 2015. 
Now on to the future. As Jay just mentioned, we believe we have the essential elements for long-term shareholder value creation, and they are as attractive as ever. I'd like to spend a few minutes to further elaborate on Jay's comments regarding each of these elements. These include a continued healthy and sustained leasing environment over the next several years, a long runway of investment opportunities that we expect will drive high-quality long-term growth and all the while maintaining a strong balance sheet and managing risk appropriately to drive down the cost of capital. 
First, on leasing. We believe that we're in the midst of a multiyear wireless investment cycle that will result in a sustained level of leasing activity, similar to what we have experienced in 2014 and 2015. And that is what we expect to see in 2016.
For 2016, we're expecting approximately $170 million in new leasing activity, of which 150 -- $115 million will come from tower leasing. The $115 million in tower leasing represents a pace of adding approximately one tenant equivalent over a 10-year period on our 40,000 towers or 1/10 of a tenant per year per tower, which is approximately our average pace of annual leasing over the last 7 years. 
Importantly, through those 7 years, we've been through a number of different macroeconomic cycles and covered several different wireless investment cycles in terms of technology, level of engagement by carrier customers and different environments. Given the underlying long-term perspective of positive fundamentals, from the continued increase in mobile data consumption, we believe that this pace of leasing is a reasonable expectation for our future growth.
Industry research projects mobile data to increase sevenfold between 2014 and 2019, a compounded annual growth rate of 47%, while roughly doubling every 2 years. Recently, some of the wireless carriers have reported mobile data growth even higher in the range of 60% to 75% per year growth during 2015. Against this backdrop, we expect the carriers to continue to invest on a consistent basis to maintain and improve network quality, which is the competitive necessity as carriers seek to retain existing customers, attract new customers and monetize their networks through the deployment and development of new revenue streams, such as over-the-top video and telematics.
As a shared wireless infrastructure provider, Crown Castle stands ready to assist wireless carriers in this endeavor by providing them with quick and cost-effective access to wireless infrastructure as they seek to upgrade and enhance their networks.
With our tower portfolio and small cell expertise, we have the unique capability to deliver across all means of shared infrastructure to meet the network needs of our carrier customers. Additionally, the runway for our growth is further supported by the amount of spectrum that is expected to be deployed over the next several years, including a spectrum from last year's AWS3 auction, the spectrum from this year's anticipated broadcast incentive auction and the spectrum currently held by the carriers and others such as Dish and FirstNet. 
Turning to capital allocation. When we evaluate various investment alternatives we have, whether it's small cell, share purchases or acquisitions, our goal is to drive long-term growth in AFFO per share and dividend per share. By this measure, we are very excited by our recent and ongoing investment in small cells. To date, our $3 billion investment in small cells generates a yield of approximately 8%, inclusive of our initial $1 billion investment in NextG, the acquisition we did in 2012, with an initial yield of approximately 3% to 4%, and our continued greenfield investments.
We are underwriting new small cell builds with anticipated initial yields of 6% to 8% on the anchor tenant where we believe we have the opportunity to drive yields higher through co-location, with the second tenant expected to achieve low to mid-teens yields and the expectation of further yield accretion when we add a third and fourth tenant over time.
On this point, in addition to the anchor tenant, we are seeing strong co-location demand on our small cell networks. We have focused our small cell efforts in the top 25 markets and believe that these early systems will be some of the most attractive locations in the future, given their franchise value. 
Just like towers, the need for network densification is driving small cell growth. Given the challenges that carriers face in bringing more capacity to many urban and suburban geographies, the need to get closer to the subscribers and focus on reusing spectrum more efficiently, carriers are turning to small cells as a critical tool to improve their networks. With a very similar business and economic model as our tower business, we see a long runway of attractive investment opportunities in small cells. 
Shifting to the balance sheet and risk profile. We view our dividend as a growing annuity paid to shareholders where we effectively pass through the cash flows we generate from providing U.S. wireless carriers with access to mission-critical infrastructure. Our goal is to protect and grow the dividend stream over time. 
Our dividend is supported by long-term recurring contracted leases that we have in place, which currently represent approximately $20 billion in future contracted rent payments plus future growth from contracted rent escalators and the continuing wireless investments being made that I previously mentioned. From this foundation, we are focused on managing financial and operating risk as we allocate capital and grow the business. 
On the balance sheet side, we believe maintaining an investment-grade balance sheet should provide us with access to a deeper and more stable pool of capital, reducing risks to our cash flows and providing us with an increased flexibility to pursue potential investment opportunities, both of which are supportive of the secure and growing dividend. This same perspective drives our capital allocations decisions as we continue to believe that the U.S. market provides us with the most attractive risk-adjusted return opportunities.
Bottom line. With the sustained level of leasing that we expect to continue over the next several years, the small cell opportunities we see ahead of us, the strength of our balance sheet and the quality of our business, we believe we can continue to deliver 6% to 7% AFFO per share and dividend growth per share. Further, we believe our expected growth rate, combined with our current dividend yield of approximately 4.3%, represents a very attractive long-term total return profile for shareholders.
Finally, I'd like to speak to our CEO succession plan that we announced last night. I began contemplating this and subsequently engaged the board in this conversation some time ago after reflecting on a number of considerations that led me to conclude that 2016 was the right time to begin this transition.
First, as we've discussed on this call, the company is incredibly well positioned for this transition, having accomplished a number of strategic objectives that I believe are important to set us up for the next generation of market leadership and value creation. Including on this list -- included on this list will be the assemblage of our unrivaled tower portfolio, the sale of our Australian business, the acquisition of Sunesys and leadership in the exciting small cell arena and the strength in the balance sheet with the achievement of the investment-grade rating late last year.
Second, Jay is ready, ready to step up. We worked together for 17 years since the early days of Crown Castle, and he has been an integral part of all we have accomplished. He has the trust and respect of the board, the executive team and the organization as well as the investment community.
I am very fortunate to have him as a successor and have absolute confidence that he is the right leader to lead the organization into this next chapter of success. Most importantly, though, Jay will be leading a team of seasoned professionals who are very good at executing for customers across all our assets of towers and small cells. 
Finally, on a personal level, it's been an unbelievable privilege to lead Crown as CEO these last 8 years. I have always found it valuable from time to time to push myself out of my comfort zone in search of new challenges. Many years ago, I lost my dad to a heart attack when he was only 47. In 2014, my wife had a breast cancer scare that fortunately was caught early and, through surgery, has resulted in a full recovery. With our kids out of the house now, our once-structured lives have changed. It is with all these considerations and the reminder that life is short that I sense that it is the right time to initiate this move out of my comfort zone. I look forward to pursuing many new challenges, some personal and some professional. I also look forward to my continuing investment and involvement with Crown Castle in this new capacity, ensuring leadership continuity as Executive Vice Chairman. 
I am proud of what we've accomplished, and through this succession plan, I'm highly confident this team will continue to reward shareholders, customers and employees for choosing Crown Castle.
Thank you to all of you on this call who have supported me and this management team over the years. I look forward to our continued association. 
With that, operator, we'd be happy to turn the call over for questions."

I'm looking forward to continuing to work with both of you guys. The -- kind of focusing on the business as we kind of look ahead, I guess I have got a couple of questions. One, just on the obvious, with respect to kind of all the noise coming out of Sprint, with respect to their network architecture, we don't have to talk about Sprint necessarily. Let's just say there's a carrier out there that's looking to explore new, more efficient ways to build the network, and it seems that they're looking to reevaluate their renewal schedule on tower leases as we go forward. And I was wondering if you could kind of talk about what, if anything, you see ahead for that strategy. And then second, Jay, a year ago, we were sitting here, and I think the outlook was for new site leasing activity of maybe 5%, and now we're sitting here looking at actually 6%, a better outlook for this year. Over the course of last year, that outlook actually went up by about a percentage point. So kind of what are the factors that you see maybe evolving in 2016 that could do to this year's guidance what happened to last year's guidance in terms of walking [ph] it up the curve over the course of the year?"

This is Ben. First of all, without addressing Sprint specifically, what I'd like to talk about is the fact that 3 of the 4 carriers have reported thus far, and I think all of them, in various ways, have confirmed the need for macro sites being an integral part of their network now and in the future. And that shouldn't be surprising to any of us that are close to the business. Macro sites, i.e., towers, remain the most attractive and cost-effective way to cover a given geography with the spectrum that they own. That said, there are certainly hybrid sites and HetNet architectures that we participate in and many people do, that are going to augment the capacity of the networks going forward, and that's the whole small cell underlay approach and, frankly, sites that look like crosses between macro sites and small cells, dark fiber fed, and ultimately, that's sort of what C-RAN architecture starts to look like over time. When you think about our business fundamentally, it's a capital-intensive business. Those with the lowest cost of capital tend to win. And when you introduce on top of that the notion of shared economics, i.e., the carriers only pay for the proportion of the asset that they need, it's an incredibly compelling model, and it's one that I think is going to continue to work as it has for the last 20 years for the indefinite future. So when carriers work on new deployments and new architectures, with, certainly, an inappropriate view to save cost, we're going to be right there with them at every step of the way. And I can tell you that we're working with all 4 carriers in that regard to utilize our cost of capital and the sharing model to be an integral part of their solution going forward. And so I think it's been helpful for the last couple of weeks that 3 of the 4 carriers have confirmed that macro tower sites are an integral part of their model going forward. That's not surprising to us, but I think this hybrid-type network going forward is going to be very important, and we are incredibly well positioned with assets and capability to take advantage of that. But when you hear us talk about the cost of capital, it's not simply just to lower the cost on the balance sheet of our interest expense. It is very much to be the most competitive company out there that can deploy capital assets on behalf of these carriers and make it very efficient for them. And so that's something we're spending a lot of time on as an executive team and very comfortable with what we see in front of us."

And as we looked at our guide for 2016, we held that elevated level of leasing activity throughout the full year -- full calendar year 2016 such that leasing activity, we think, this year will match that of 2015. As for a potential upside there, I'd point to the fact that typically, in the business, we have about 6 to 8 months of visibility when -- from the time we have an application come in from a carrier to the time it's actually revenue-producing. So we have a real good idea as to where new tenant leasing is going to be for at least the first half of the year and maybe a bit into the third quarter. So to the extent that there was additional leasing activity over the course of the year, that's honestly more likely to impact our run rate going into 2017 than it is to be that meaningful to results in 2016."

The rationale behind the 10,000 miles of fiber we acquired, metro fiber and great markets with Sunesys, was that it would give us a great head start on small cell deployments, and that's exactly what it is. But it's a head start. It's not a perfect footprint. And so as you referenced, we're constantly working to improve that network just as we do with existing Crown fiber where we get a new engagement, and maybe there's -- as I've described before, there's always overlap. So when you think of a tower co-location, which is a 100% co-location on an existing site, a co-location or an additional deployment on a Sunesys piece of fiber or Crown fiber is always a hybrid. So there's always a percentage of overlap and a percentage of new typically, but in examples, maybe otherwise like Manhattan where there was pretty full overlap. So that's working well. It drives our increasing sort of accretive yields on the asset. As I mentioned in my remarks, represent about 8% on the embedded capital life to date. And so as we're building additional -- either additional laterals or accommodating co-locations, it's essentially driving up that yield over time. Now we're going to have better metrics for you in the coming quarters because I know this has got a lot of moving parts to it, and we're going to come out with that for everyone to help their modeling later in the year. What we focus on as a management team is ultimately the yield on the investment capital. That cuts through all the metrics, whether it's tenants per node or nodes per mile or revenue per mile. And so we're going to help everybody with that later in the year so that we're -- we can all be clear. But that's why we're giving you these sort of run rate yields. It's validating for ourselves as well that we're continuing to see accretive investments in that space."

We bought 17,000 sites in the last, I guess, 3 years that are looking for more tenants. So those towers we acquired from AT&T and T-Mobile most recently are very attractive co-location candidates and probably -- not probably, absolutely represent the biggest value creation opportunity we have in the company, that is to co-locate on an existing tower. And we're quite happy with that going forward. The fact is that the carriers had essentially sold the vast majority of their sites. There's some small portfolios out there, and it has been somewhat aggregated by the 3 large carrier -- tower companies. So I don't see anything large on the horizon out there. It's certainly not a requirement for us to create significant value, as I just mentioned. The organic growth is what drives value around here. But I would also highlight, back to 2001 and 2000 and 1999 when essentially, the carriers sold all their sites initially, and then we went through a whole another wave of that some 15 years later. So we do think there'll be a need for more tower sites over time as cell sites continue to shrink and density requirements continue to increase. There's nothing significant out there today, and we are certainly advancing our leadership position on this newer architecture around small cells, as we talked about. On the outdoor business for small cells, while we are about 90% focused in the top 25 markets, we're constantly looking at opportunities outside the 25 markets. And so your question, I think, as to sort of how big could this be, and the answer is we don't really know, but it looks like it could be sort of a whole 'nother tower business. It's hard. It's expensive. It takes a long time to build these systems. But at the same time, we are focused on what we think are franchise locations in something of a landgrab that reminds us a lot of the early days of the tower business. And so we're focusing our efforts in these top 25 markets, but I don't think it's going to be limited to that. In fact, I know it's not because we're looking at opportunities occasionally outside these markets, and looks like it's got a long, long runway."

Where we choose to play, we've done a lot of sports arenas, things like that. I think over time, you're going to see multi-tenant office buildings, but there are alternative solutions available to landlords and tenants. When you get into a multi-tenant facility, that don't necessarily lend themselves to a neutral host owner like ourselves. A tenant in an office building can set up their own system or an office building can own their own system. There's a lot of different variations. And then there's a limitation in the marketplace still as to what the carriers will ultimately elect to pay for in terms of the rent. As we've said forever, and we all know this, there's more need in the market for densification in network than there are hours in the day or capital that the carriers can invest. So there's a rational prioritization going on. I think you're certainly seeing this extend to health care facilities now. And so we're certainly looking at the indoor business there when we find it attractive, and -- but it's -- I don't think it's as large as the outdoor business."

You're right, miles of fiber were relatively flat, and we added nodes against those fibers -- against that fiber mile, which is exactly co-location. I mean, that's the business that we're in and why we're interested in and like tower business and why we like small cell business. We have an asset investment against which you add additional recurring revenue, and that drives the long-term yield on that invested capital. And that's the model we're seeing play out. As Ben and I referenced in our comments, we've seen really attractive lease-up activity on the fiber that we own today, and that's driving additional nodes against a set number of miles of fiber. We're going to continue to see that as well as continuing to make investment as we build new systems, and that's the driver of our activity at the moment. On the second question, the propagation characteristics of a small cell, there's no simple answer to that question or a one-size-fits-all answer to that question. It's designed based on what the carriers desire. And so you can go into a given area and find a small cell every 100, 200 yards where they're trying to really increase the density of their network. At other places, you'll see them spaced a little further than that. So there's no easy answer to say that the propagation of a small cell. It has to do with what spectrum they deploy across that small cell, how much power they use. So it can vary. I would say, in a typical urban environment, you're going to cover about a block to 2 blocks of area when you deploy -- when the carriers deploy small cells. And so we'll see them put up nodes about every other block would be a relatively normal deployment in a dense urban area. If you look across the entire portfolio on an outdoor basis, we're typically -- when we're building a new system for someone, we'll be somewhere between 2 and 2.5 nodes per mile of fiber on the initial deployment. So that gives you some idea of what we see. And obviously, there can be some pretty wide swings depending on whether or not we're doing the central business district or doing something a little bit outside of the most densely populated areas of the city."

It goes back to my original comments about cost of capital matters in this business, and so that's something we focus on. I'm not going to really get into the specifics around the market. A lot of these systems are conducted through an RFP process initially. But at the same time, what matters most to carriers obviously is the ability of the award winner to execute. And so we have seen opportunities come back to us on occasion where the awardee may have had some challenges in the market. What matters most to carriers if they have a need for small cells is execution, meeting your milestones, getting on the air so that they can accomplish the capacity enhancements that they're trying to do on their network. So I think that's probably all I'll say on that. It's a highly competitive market at this stage."

I mean, obviously, there have been select carriers who've talked about the opportunity set in terms of providing additional bandwidth with the deployment of fallow spectrum. But there have also been discussions about how networks are dense enough and have additional capacity. And I'm just trying to sort of triangulate in terms of the opportunity set for you folks, I mean, do see those types of carriers looking to densify their networks?

I think what you're referring to, Amir, is the inherent trade-off, that is, between spectrum and densification, i.e., to the extent you have more spectrum, you can do more with your existing sites and would then delay the need to densify in a particular area if you otherwise didn't have spectrum. And that's true, and yet what we see is kind of all of the above. So as the carriers come in and launch new spectrum, to get maximum efficiency out of that very expensive spectrum, they're typically adding more equipment to the sites, to the existing sites. That just makes sense. The cost of that incremental amendment on a tower is nothing compared to getting the maximum value out of that spectrum in that particular geography. And that's what's driving a lot of our amendment activity across all of the carriers and has for years. I don't see that changing. But in addition to that, you're not going to cover the capacity requirements simply by adding spectrum to existing sites. It's just mathematically impossible. You can't get the capacity requirements that are required. And so what happens is in addition to adding that spectrum on the existing sites, you're then seeing small cells added in an underlay [ph] approach, which gives them multiples of that spectrum capacity because they're then reusing that spectrum in that geography and unloading, effectively unloading the capacity challenge on the macro side. So you're going to see both. It's what -- it's exactly what's driving our business today. The carriers are obviously being very rational about how do they prioritize their spend, and they're looking at spectrum auctions and having to pay for the spectrum upfront, and then how do they maximize that capacity over time. And then various carriers, they're in various stages of that today, whether that's cell site densification or macro site amendments. But all of that drives our business, and it's something that we think is going to continue for a long, long time."

And if you think about it, the wireless carriers essentially rebuilt the tower portfolio on their own balance sheet since we as an industry acquired them in the early 2000s and then elected to monetize it over time in the last 3 years. I think carriers will, from time to time, experiment with lots of different methods to add capacity to their network. That's not new. It goes back to the earlier comments, and there's a lot of different technology variations. I think it's generally accepted that fiber connectivity for small cells and towers ultimately through dark fiber connectivity provides the most flexibility and the most capacity for a given location. And so I think you're going to see over time that fiber, whether you're talking about fiber to the cell or fiber to the small cell, is a necessary element long term to accomplish what they need. And it goes back to the earlier comments on this call around cost of capital and the sharing model. Certainly, it's possible for carriers to work and build their own systems and certainly free to do that and operate under the same constraints that we do around permitting and zoning and rights of way and things like that. But to the extent they can avail themselves of a lower cost of capital, allow themselves to put their capital back to work in their primary business and we pass along some of that shared economics to them in that construct, that's going to make a lot of sense as it has for the last 20 years, and that's what we're pursuing."

I appreciate that Sunesys contributed $42 million to you in 2015, but I'm just trying to get the year-over-year comparisons. And then just talking more about small cell, you mentioned your focus on 25 markets and obviously looking beyond that. In those 25 markets, roughly how many of those are you -- where you're comfortable with the amount of fiber that you have? And really, what I'm getting at is, what's the likelihood of you going and doing another Sunesys-like acquisition in 2016? How important is that when you think of strategy in areas you're focusing on for '16? And if that acquisition you were to do was to come with a larger percentage of enterprise or wholesale or, said differently, not small-cell-like business, in terms of how they're using that fiber, is that a business you're increasingly getting more comfortable getting into as we go forward so that you're no longer just a small cell fiber provider but really something much more broader than that?"

On the first question, when we did the Sunesys acquisition, I know initially when we announced it, we weren't sure exactly what the timing of the closing was going to be. The revenue growth year-over-year is a couple of million dollars, so the guidance that we gave you was what we were expecting in 2016. And really, your 2 questions are fairly closely tied together. When we look at fiber in these markets and the opportunities that we're seeing more broadly than just Sunesys and whether that's expanding our portfolio on the top 25 market or, as Ben referenced earlier, if we're looking outside of the top 25 markets, our aim is to own fiber that is supportive of the wireless carriers. That's our core business, and that's what we're focused on. And so when we look at opportunities for fiber, that's what we have in mind. What can we do with that fiber ultimately to drive yields on the capital invested? And we think that yield is going to be primarily driven through investment by the wireless carriers, and that's adding nodes to those or, in some cases, doing fiber to the cell. There may be some acquisitions in the future, although frankly, as we talked about when we did the Sunesys acquisition, we think that asset is really unique. It was dark fiber in major metro markets in the U.S. And while we have found a few tuck-in acquisitions, like the one we did 2 years ago in the Baltimore/Washington area, those are relatively rare. So we're not thinking about this as getting into per se the fiber business or expanding into the fiber business. Over time, we may find opportunities to add additional yield through recurring revenue sources across the fiber that we own because of the location of the fiber, it's in urban areas where there's lots of density of population, and so we may find opportunities to add additional revenue and drive return. But our focus both on the investment side as well as where we're focusing our sales effort is around supporting our wireless carrier customers. That's what we really want to do and what we want to be. So that's where you're going to see us invest capital and focus our time and effort both in the near term and what we believe currently will be the long-term strategy of the firm."

As highlighted on Slide 3, our first quarter results in exceeded the midpoint of our first quarter outlook and allowed us to raise our full year 2016 outlook.

As highlighted on Slide 3, our first quarter results in exceeded the midpoint of our first quarter outlook and allowed us to raise our full year 2016 outlook. Our increased midpoint for full year 2016 outlook for AFFO per share of $4.70 represents an increase of over 9% compared to 2015. During the quarter, we also strengthened our balance sheet by accessing the bond market with our inaugural investment-grade issuance. This was another successful step in our effort to lower our cost of debt and equity capital. Operationally, we continue to invest in both small cells and towers, which we believe will drive future growth. These continued investments, together with our portfolio of approximately 40,000 towers and 16,500 [ph] miles of fiber supporting small cell deployments, position us as leading U.S. wireless infrastructure provider with unique capabilities and aspects to provide network solution throughout the country and across a variety of different network architectures. 
Shifting to the first quarter results on Slide 4. Site rental revenue grew 9%. The organic site rental revenue growth of $55 million represents growth of 8% year-over-year comprised of approximately 7% growth from new leasing activity and 3% from cash escalations, net of approximately 2% from tenant nonrenewals. 
Moving to Slide 5. Our first quarter results for site rental gross margin, adjusted EBITDA, AFFO and AFFO per share exceeded the midpoint of our previously provided first quarter 2016 outlook. Site rental gross margin benefited from approximately $1 million of one-time items that were not expected in the previously provided outlook comprised of a benefit to site rental revenue of approximately $4 million and offset by an increase to site rental cost of operations of $3 million. Additionally, AFFO for the first quarter 2016 benefited from $10 million and lower-than-expected sustaining capital expenditures, which is due to timing at full year 2016 outlook for sustaining capital expenditures remains unchanged. Excluding the benefit of these nonrecurring timing items, we still would've exceeded the midpoint of our previously provided first quarter 2016 outlook for each of these metrics. 
Turning to the investment activities during the first quarter. We invested $193 million in capital expenditures, of which, $10 million was sustaining capital expenditures and $183 million was discretionary investment. Consistent with our proactive approach to producing stable and growing cash flow over time, we invested $21 million in land purchases to further strengthen our control of the ground interest underneath our towers. Today, nearly 80% of our tower site rental gross margin is generated from towers on land we own or control from more than 20 years. Additionally, the average term remaining on our ground leases is over 30 years. The balance of our discretionary investments were in revenue-generating capital expenditures. A significant portion of this investment was in our Small Cell business, which today consists of 16,500 miles of fiber supporting approximately $385 million in annualized site rental revenue or approximately 12% of our consolidated site rental revenues. We are as excited as we have ever been by the opportunities in small cell. 
Our small cell conversations with the carriers have increasingly become more positive with the passage of time, and we are seeing the business model of small cell play out very similarly to that of towers. To that end, we thought it would be helpful to walk through 2 case studies that illustrate the co-location economics of small cells as the fiber infrastructure is shared among multiple carriers over time. 
On Slide 6, we lay out one of our systems in Denver. The initial system consisted of 14 miles of fiber connecting 18 tenant nodes on 18 poles for the first carrier. On the slide, the lines represent fiber that we own and the circles represent tenant nodes. We define the node as a tenant location that generates revenue and a pole as a physical structure on which we install the carrier's broadcast equipment. The picture shows a representative physical structure, under which, tenant nodes have been installed. 
Since the initial buildout, we have successfully added 2 additional wireless carriers to the system, which now consists of 17 miles of fiber connecting 65 tenant nodes supported on 26 poles located in the public right-of-way. In aggregate, the system currently generates a yield of approximately 20% based on the recurring cash flows and the capital we invested in the system. As you can see with the system, we have been able to leverage the initial investment by co-locating additional tenant nodes on the fiber to drive our returns. 
Turning to Slide 7. This is a system we have in Las Vegas. This system consists of 36 miles of fiber supporting 77 tenant nodes deployed on 77 poles for 2 carriers, generating a yield of approximately 13%. In addition, we are currently working with a third carrier to co-locate nodes on this fiber network and anticipate adding that third [ph] carrier to this system in the next 6 months. Unlike the Denver example, where the majority of the co-location of tenant nodes occurred on the same pole as the first carrier, in this example, the co-location occurred at different pole locations along the existing fiber. Because the majority of the investment relates to deploying fiber, our yield increased by co-locating additional nodes on our fiber regardless of whether the co-location occurs on the same pole  or on another pole along the fiber. This is why we often describe the fiber as a tower laid on its side, upon which we're aiming to co-locate tenant nodes. 
As we look at our entire small cell business, co-location of our fiber network has driven a meaningful improvement to the yield initially generated on the systems we acquired or constructed over the last several years. Given the returns we are seeing from small cell, we believe our continued investments are consistent with our strategy of allocating capital to drive long-term growth and dividends per share. 
Returning to investments and financing activities. Subsequent to the quarter, and as previously announced, we acquired TDC for approximately $461 million in cash. The TDC portfolio consisted of 336 towers located in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. Based on TDC's run rate contribution, the transaction is immediately accretive to AFFO per share. Consistent with our long-term capital allocation philosophy, we intend to pursue discretionary investment opportunities such as TDC and small cell that we believe will drive long-term growth and dividends per share. 
Continuing with financing activities, during the quarter, we paid a quarterly common stock dividend of 88.5 cents per share or $298 million in the aggregate. 
In January, we've closed on our current $4.5 billion unsecured credit facility and issued $1.5 billion in unsecured notes. These attractive debt transactions highlight the appeal of Crown Castle's high-quality cash flows and strong business model. 
Moving on to our full year 2016 outlook on Slide 8. We have increased our expectations at the midpoint for site rental revenues by $45 million, site rental gross margin by $31 million, adjusted EBITDA by $25 million and AFFO by $24 million. The increase in our full year outlook reflects the strong results from the first quarter, the inclusion of our TDC acquisition and the timing benefit related to tenant nonrenewal occurring later than we previously expected. It is important to note that our overall expectations for the number of tenant nonrenewals in the aggregate remain unchanged. 
On a per-share basis, AFFO is expected to be $4.70 at the midpoint compared to $4.30 in 2015, representing an increase of over 9% year-over-year. As you will hear from Ben, we believe that we are well-positioned well positioned to capitalize on the long-term positive industry fundamentals that we expect will position us to achieve our stated goal of delivering compound annual growth of 6% to 7% in AFFO and dividends per share. 
Lastly, I'm excited to welcome Dan to the Crown Castle team. Dan will step into the Chief Financial Officer role on June 1. He is a great addition to the team with his unique combination of financial and operational experience. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Ben."

Thanks for everyone joining us on the call this morning. As Jay mentioned, we are ahead of plan to deliver on our stated goal of generating AFFO per share and dividends per share compound annual growth of 6% to 7% organically, which remains our long-term view. Our expectation is based on the intersection of 2 things: anticipated exponential growth and demand for wireless connectivity; and our unique portfolio of towers and small cells that can help carriers address their network needs. 
On this first point, according to Cisco, U.S. mobile data consumption grew 56% in 2015 compared to 2014. The year-over-year growth alone represents a staggering amount of data consumption. It is almost equivalent to all the mobile data that crossed the cellular networks in 2013. Importantly as we look out to the future, this growth is expected to continue. U.S. mobile data consumption is projected to increase sixfold between 2015 and 2020, a compound annual growth rate of 47% or roughly doubling every 2 years. Given these projections, and consistent with carrier commentary, we expect the carriers to continue to invest on a consistent basis to maintain and improve network quality. 
According to our recent survey conducted by consulting firm Accenture, 60% of residents were dissatisfied -- respondents were dissatisfied with their wireless connectivity and experience, while 71% of respondents would be willing to pay more for better connectivity. Against this backdrop, network quality is a competitive necessity as carriers seek to retain existing customers, attract new customers and drive further subscriber economics. 
Equally as important, network quality is a prerequisite as carriers seek to develop new revenue stream and used cases such as over-the-top video, machine-to-machine connection, smart city management and fixed wireless broadband. As we move beyond connecting people to connecting things, the reliability of networks become even more critical. The latency capacity and coverage required for connected cars or for smart cities that manage traffic and energy grids using mobile sensors for connections need to work everywhere all the time is much different than managing a network against dropped calls. A higher threshold of reliability and the corresponding need for network densification suggest that we're in the midst of a sustained investment cycle by the carriers. 
Across towers and small cells, we have a unique combination of assets and expertise that positions Crown Castle to assist wireless carriers in densifying their networks regardless of geography or network topology. As the leading U.S. shared wireless infrastructure provider, Crown Castle is assisting wireless carriers in this endeavor by providing them with speed to market and cost-effective access to wireless infrastructure. Our portfolio of approximately 40,000 towers with 72% located in the top 100 markets remains the first option in improving network quality, given towers efficiency and cost-effectiveness. With our existing base of over 80,000 tenant installations, we believe there's a long runway of growth opportunities via amendments as tenants add more capacity to their existing installations. Further, with an average tenancy of 2.2 tenants per tower, which effectively puts us at 40% to 50% occupancy, given the addressable market of the big 4 wireless carriers plus a host of other tenants opportunities, there are significant opportunities for new co-location as carriers work to increase network capacity by adding additional cell sites. 
We are further expanding the size of this opportunity by our investment in small cells, which is the natural extension of the carrier's network densification efforts needed to address network capacity. When presented with the challenge of providing continuous consistent high capacity, wireless broadband service across urban and suburban geographies, carriers are increasingly turning to small cells as an essential tool to improve their networks, as illustrated in the Denver and Las Vegas examples that Jay discussed. 
With small cells, we're investing in a business model that shares the same shared economic model of towers and we're encouraged by what we are seeing. Longer term, we believe we are well positioned to capture a significant share of this larger market opportunity. By focusing our investment in the top metro markets, we believe our fiber footprint of over 16,000 miles is in the right locations with the capacity necessary to support significant small cell deployment longer term. We believe this critical combination of location and capacity facilitates system deployments with time-to-market and economic advantages. To support the growth in small cells over the last several years, we have also built an organization that can execute at scale. Our team's deep RF fiber and real estate management skills and capabilities allow us to offer our customers a turnkey solution, a service level and value proposition that we believe is the best in the industry. 
While small cells are providing the much-needed additional network capacity, towers continue to play an important role in providing the first layer of coverage and capacity in an increasingly mobile world. In addition to bolstering network capacity through additional spectrum and cell sites, whether through towers or small cells, future networks are expected to add capacity by improving network architecture through increasing interconnectedness. As the only wireless infrastructure provider that can offer tower small cells solutions at scale, we believe we are in excellent position to capitalize on the future evolution of wireless networks through the extension of our shared infrastructure model, a model that continues to efficiently serve carrier needs and provide a compelling total return proposition of dividends and growth for shareholders. 
Before wrapping up, I'd like to extend my welcome to Dan Schlenker who's joining the team as CFO at June 1, as Jay mentioned, as we move forward with our announced succession plan with Jay Brown moving to CEO and my move to Executive vice Chairman. I am confident that our executive management team will continue to execute our business plan performing for customers and shareholders under Jay's leadership. 
Finally, I want to thank all my colleagues at Crown Castle who have worked so hard to achieve what we have accomplished. These men and women are true professionals. As their primary spokesman on these calls over the last 8 years, it has been my privilege to report to you their latest accomplishments every 90 days.

On the first question around the leasing environment, as we talked about over the last couple of calls, our view is that leasing activity in the full year '16 is going to be very similar to what we saw in 2015. And we continue to hold that view. The guide that we've provided was based upon how we outperformed in the first quarter along with our view that the tenant nonrenewals were going to occur later in the year, and that's really what changed in our outlook. So our view of activity is about the same. Similar to past years, the other thing I would note is that if you look at our total new leases that we would expect during the course of the year, and that would be a combination of new leases on towers as well as amendments to existing leases, that activity is about 40% in the first half of the year and about 60% in the second half of the year. So it's back-end loaded but in about the same way as we typically find in the business. On your second question about the nonrenewal, our view is that in total, from consolidation that we talked about over the last several years, in total, we think that amount is about the same as it was previously. So we've moved out portions of that. Some portion of that we moved to 2017 and the balance of it we moved to periods that are beyond 2017. So at the moment, our view would be the total nonrenewal stays about the same. We're just pushing it up right a little bit. There's more details in the supplement if people would like to see how we moved each of those in our view in each of the calendar years. But I would say, overall, we think it's about the same total amount of nonrenewal."

But on what you would think as overhead, primarily people and infrastructure, it looks to us like we're getting pretty close to a stabilized run rate at this current level of activity. Now I qualify that because to the extent the pipeline would grow materially over time, these are fantastic investments and we've seen productive growth and yield on that investment and it takes additional variable cost in the form of overhead and people. So I would tell you, for modeling purposes, we are pretty close as of the Q1 run rate and less volume changes dramatically."

One is, as we've discussed, the churn is basically offsetting a big portion of the new leasing activity that we're seeing. And then as you look at the GAAP revenue numbers and the segment for towers, you don't see in those GAAP numbers the benefit of the escalation, the contracted escalation that we have in the business as those are straight-lined over the term of the lease. So when you go bound to the AFFO metric, we get the benefit at the AFFO line of those cash escalations. The other component I would point out is, as we talked about last quarter around some of the fees that we received when tenant nonrenewals occur, we refer to those commonly as pay and walk fees that we received from carriers. Last year, there was about $30 million to $40 million of those pay and walk fees in our services business. We don't expect anywhere close to that scale of activity in calendar year '16 as we saw in '15. And so as we've guided down in services from the renewables, those kind of fees to the tune of about $30 million to $40 million year-over-year. And so if you're just looking at the tower segment and you're looking at adjusted EBITDA or the segment operating profit, you're going to see mostly impacted from those none -- what we would refer as noncore services activity."

As a part of -- if you look at the whole business, there's 2 things that affect that, back to my prior comment about the Sunesys acquisition, obviously, the incremental growth in revenues is going to be offset by the cost that come with an acquisition. So if we have acquisitions, that will impact the totality of the margins in that segment. But the other aspect to it is that we are deploying a meaningful amount of capital to build additional fiber and additional small cell networks. And as we put those systems on air, they're going to tend to mute the growth that we would have. There's a bit of a -- we often refer to it as like advantage analysis internally where we look at the system similar to those that we shared this morning in Denver and Las Vegas that we've had on air for a period of time, as we add those tenants the direct margins on those systems will look -- we believe will look at least if not better than what towers would. But as we look at the totality of segment, it's going to depend on how much investment opportunity we have there as to whether or not the full benefit of that co-location flows through to your margins, whether it's offset by the value of investing in future systems that come along at a lower margin level."

I think the simplest way, Dave, to look at where we are in the business is to annualize sort of the run rate margin in the segment so 61 times 4, call it, $240 [ph] million or against $3 billion of capital spend over time. And it's easier to remember the 3 because if you can remember, the 2 distinct to that was one was $1 billion for NextG at about a 4% yield and the Sunesys acquisition last year of $1 billion at about 6% yield. So you can see, obviously, the incremental modulation on that last $1 billion is very significant in the sort of double digits to drag the whole thing up. And that's illustrated -- that's a macro view and it's illustrated in Jay's 2 case studies we walked through. So it's a great question and it's one we look at. It's probably the #1 thing we watched, which is, are we dragging that overall yield up with that incremental contribution both from new systems and then the co-location that occurs. And as Jay said, it's a long raise because as you bring on new systems to single tenants, it's a land grab, not unlike the tower business has been. So you're bringing on somewhat lower yields and then I think grows over time. In terms of metrics, one of the things -- and we've given you a lot more detail realize around segment reporting, that will probably increase over time. One of the things that Jay was talking about was tenant nodes, and that's why we illustrated these 2 systems, where you can have tenant nodes locate by themselves on the common fiber. So if they have collocated themselves where you have 2 tenants on 1 pole or you can have 2 tenants on 2 poles. And so the node metric is somewhat confusing or lost and it's why I think it makes sense to go back to sort of financials. And then over time, there's various things that we made a slide to discuss would be revenue per fiber my, for example, obviously a key driver. The fiber is the vast majority where the capital goes, and so we're working to find some simple metrics [indiscernible] one like we have in the tower business it's not quite as simple, but hopefully, it's getting better."

So we put it into the business and we're not focusing on it as a separate business from our overall Small Cell business. So the contribution there -- frankly, we're much more focused on driving the return as Ben talked about on the full $3 billion and using that fiber to deploy additional small cells against it. With regards to the competitive environment that we're in, obviously, there are a number of folks who look at this business and see it as attractive and concurrent -- can obviously see the public comments with the wireless operators they're making about the importance of small cells and how they're necessary to improve their networks along the lines of what Ben's comments were and the necessity of small cells in order to accomplish the density of networks that are required to meet the consumer's expectation for devices. And so we do find competition -- sometimes that competition comes from more nationally based of fiber operators. And then in other times they were in certain markets, there may be a provider of fiber that's specific to a single market alone and so we'll run into them as we're going to the process of a request for proposal from the carriers, where a local provider may be in that process. So at the end of the day, we believe that our opportunity here is based upon our access to a cost of capital and a return on that capital that we think is very attractive given what we've seen over the long period of time that we've been in the tower business. We also believe that we're the best at it. So we have built, in terms of scale, I think unmatched scale and operating capabilities when compared to anyone. And certainly, as we talk to the wireless operators, we make that case. The last thing that I would say in terms of what we run into is the vast majority of the fiber and small cells are purpose-built. They need to be in specific locations, long routes where we can install on poles as we showed in some of the fixtures and illustrating some of the cases. And this fiber is very different than -- we believe it's very different than what we've seen historically deployed. And so as we go out and purpose-build this fiber, it really -- as we're in the process of working with the carriers, that's where the operational expertise and scale is helpful to us to win those next projects."

And we have not seen, as we've deployed -- as we talked about nearly $385 million of run rate revenue, we have not seen carriers come off of macro sites. In fact, we believe and from the comments the carriers have made, in our own experience, it actually enhances the value of their macro site. So this is a product that enhances their network. It's not a substitute. And the last point I would make about that is from a cost standpoint, if there's a macro site that solves the problem or the challenge or improves the network, the macro site is always preferable as a solution because it's much more cost effective to the carriers. So small cells are a solution when macro sites really can't solve the need. And then it becomes a necessary component of the network at that point."

We may come to a place where we have an operating metric that we think is helpful. Frankly, as we manage the business, what's a little different between small cells and towers is that I wouldn't describe the rent as much as a standard rent, as what you typically see in towers. The systems are priced and we provide them to the carriers based on a return. And so as we look at the business, we tend to go back to the financials and look at what's the net capital we're investing in the system against the recurring cash flows in those systems and then how do we price appropriately both the first tenant and then future tenants on the system. So we've talked about things like you remember back in the early days of the tower business where we have things like the DDEs, which is a broadband equivalent for towers and that was a revenue metric. We just want to make sure that as a focus kind of the next leg of disclosure the business have gotten larger that we described it in a way that is helpful. And so we may over time get to a place where we feel like some of those metrics are more helpful. But at the moment, we think probably the best way to focus the attention is around the segment reporting that we provided.

So while it's possible for someone to come in, we don't have exclusivity on -- somebody can come overbuild technically. Economically, it doesn't make any sense, and I would go back to the question of the addressable market and the competitive landscape. It is an enormous world out there obviously when you start looking at the world block by block. And I look at your in Houston, I look at Houston today, where there's 2 large systems getting built, one by ourselves and another by a competitor, and we don't overlap at all. And so that's the way these are working kind of all across the country where it makes sense. I think it's unrealistic on our part that I think carriers can give us 100% of their market share in a particular area. As much as we love that to happen, that's just not realistic. And so we have competitors. They're gaining in terms of their own capability and the economics around the transactions make it such that very much like towers, it just doesn't make any sense once you have the capacity in the market and you have 1 or 2 carriers already on that system to come in and essentially duplicate that infrastructure. It's not already there, I guess, is the point, and we're having largely build it or occasionally buy it like we did with Sunesys where some of you will recall when we bought Sunesys it was only 27% utilized on average in terms of strand count. So we have a lot of capacity in those metropolitan markets where Sunesys fiber was it's obviously the type of speed market advantage and efficiency around the cost, a lot cheaper to buy it with the run rate than build from scratch."

We don't want to get in front of them in terms of what their network architecture is, and that's really a question they should speak to, how they're thinking about equipment and installations on towers. I would tell you as we look at the activity in total on towers, we think that, that activity, which is going to come from a myriad of sources including the one you referenced, we think that's about the same level of new leasing activity this year as what we had last year. That's a bit elevated from the levels that we saw in 2014. And as we talk about our long-term target, that Ben and I both mentioned, that 6% to 7% growth in AFFO and dividend per share on an annual basis, what we've embedded in that is a leasing environment for towers that looks fairly similar to the environment we're currently in today. And our experience over a long period of time is that as the carriers either acquire additional spectrum or upgrade their technologies to the newest and latest technology, it's the sources of that revenue growth tend to move among the carriers among the technologies and among the spectrum band, but we see a relatively consistent amount of revenue growth year-to-year. In fact, as you go back over a multi-year period, you can find that the vast majority of the leasing activity in any given year is within a band of about 10% to 20% up or down. And so it gives us a lot of confidence in the business as we think about longer term, our 6% to 7% metric in AFFO growth that it would appear to us our assumption of that current level of leasing growth is a fairly well-placed assumption as we look at it through a different a number of different cycles over a long period of time. So we certainly spend some time watching and having conversations with the carrier about what they're doing specifically with certain technologies. But we'll let them to speak for that and we'll focus on what we think the impact kind of revenues are as they take those various actions over time."

And so we have a pipeline of those activities as well. What we're seeing in terms of the revenue growth in small cells this year of $55 million, those would've been projects that we started a number of years ago that are now into the run rate. So I would say, in small cells, we have a little bit more visibility about what the revenue growth is going to look like given the construction time frame, whether that's co-location or new system. So we do have a view for that. And back to my prior point, that's baked into our view of growth of 6% to 7% AFFO per share. So we're assuming that we continue to see the current level of activity over an extended period of time. To the extent that we have opportunity beyond that, then we have to revisit that growth rate.

In both cases, we assume that we would add about 1 tenant per tower per year over the first 10 years of ownership. And as we look at our consolidated results, that's about what we're seeing in terms of new leasing activity across the whole portfolio, and we're seeing it pretty consistently across many. On your second question about churn, we've obviously had discussions with the carriers but again, I'd like to be careful -- regarding some of those conversations. They've been pretty public about their desire to ramp those legacy networks down. We think the locations are obviously great. And at some point, we're picked specifically for the network. So there may be the opportunity over time for some of the sites to get reused.

I think it's probably a level of granularity that, at this point, we haven't disclosed around organic growth. You can obviously see from the 2 businesses that the growth on small cells is much higher on a percentage basis than that of towers, which, in part, comes from the fact that we're coming off a much lower base. And so if we add tenant nodes across the systems, that's going to result in higher percentage growth. With regards to the 6.8% moving down towards 6% over the course of the year, we look at the business and find it to be helpful to look at it much more on a year-over-year basis rather than taking into kind of quarter-to-quarter as there can be things, whether it's the timing of the non-tenants non-renewals or the timing of leasing, that impact that. And you brought up exactly the right point when you referenced my earlier comments to Simon about 40% in the first half of the year and 60% in the back half of the year. What happened in past years as 60% of the leasing activity went on the towers late in the balance of 2015, those come into the run rate obviously, it's reported numbers, whether that's GAAP numbers or the organic metrics that we have. Those won't show up until basically the first quarter in fulsome this year. So that has some impact to those numbers. And as we go over the course of the year the licenses and I was specifically referring to the new leases that we build with carriers over the course of the year, those leases that we signed in the fourth quarter this year will have very little to no impact to site rental revenue in this calendar year. Those will just be in the run rate as we go into the next calendar year. So there is some balancing over time that leads to those differences. The other thing I would point out is just -- you just got the law of large numbers. So as you move through this over time from a percentage basis, we're going to lose somewhere in the neighborhood of about 40 basis points assuming a constant level of activity, 40 to 50 basis points, on the revenue growth number from an activity standpoint and that's why we spend so much time talking about $115 million of nominal growth. And on the tower side, that's really the best indication of what the activity doing either up or down from kind of that baseline number. So the percentage change is a combination of looking at quarters and trying to figure out what does it look like period-to-period and then also the law of large numbers."

But yes, I'd love some -- I'd love to hear your thoughts on what's different and why you have agreed to it."

From time to time, we run across them. And in particular, your question center around the uniqueness of the fiber, it really goes to the capacity and the fact that all the cable plant, whether they dedicate it to either sort of cable or enterprise, is experiencing dramatic growth in bandwidth requirements across the universe. And as we look at what these small sales require in terms of typically a distributing them into the system architecture takes a pair of [indiscernible] for every node. That's a very -- essentially like a dark fiber connection. That's a very significant burden to put on existing plant in many markets. And so certainly, there are some, like we found Sunesys capacity. Obviously, we moved on that. But as a general matter, it's not uniform and it's not interchangeable, and so you're really have to look at it sort of almost block by block, city by city where we have an engagement and where we can take advantage of existing fiber either through leasing something occasionally or acquiring it, we will. But that's in the vast minority except for the footprint we acquired with Sunesys. So that's probably not as clear as we can be. Appreciate that bandwidth requirements for all connectivity is going up, not just wireless."

On the first question, the margins on small cells are impacted by 2 things. One was the Sunesys acquisitions that we did. So that makes the incremental margins in growth and revenue a little different than what we would typically see. It was just systems without the acquisition that we put into it. So that's part of the impact. The other thing is exactly what you said, which is we have systems that have been on air and are benefiting from co-location as well as we're putting meaningful amounts of capital investment in for systems that start with just 1 tenant. And so the combination of those 2 things, along with the co-location is what yields -- what [indiscernible] out the ultimate yield from that margin. Again, we're looking at 2 things. One is the underlying business, is co-location happening and how does that develop over time. And then the second thing is as we allocate capital, new capital on new systems, does that makes sense against the broader environment. We think on both fronts, we're growth our comfort in our business and encouragement and excitement about what could be in the small cell business as it develops a very similar to what we've seen over a longer period of time in towers. To your second question about straight line revenues, just taking the simple example of a 10-year lease in the first 5 years of that 10-year lease, the reported GAAP revenues would be above the cash received. And in the second 5 years of the 10-year contract, the cash received would be above the GAAP revenues. So as you note on that slide, we refer to that as the revenue eclipse that is occurring and we're nearly there. We believe without meaningful amount of extensions would likely be the case over the next several years is that we'll have cash receipts that are in excess of reporting GAAP revenues. And that's why we spend so much time focusing on AFFO per share because it removes that vagaries and focuses on the cash receipts from those lease contracts."

During the quarter, we also strengthened our balance sheet by accessing the bond market with our inaugural investment-grade issuance. This was another successful step in our effort to lower our cost of debt and equity capital. 
Operationally, we continued to invest in both small cells and towers, which we believe will drive future growth. These continued investments, together with our portfolio of approximately 40,000 towers and 16,500 miles of fiber supporting small cell deployments, position us as the leading U.S. wireless infrastructure provider with unique capabilities and aspects to provide network solutions throughout the country and across a variety of different network architectures. 
Shifting to the first quarter results on Slide 4. Site rental revenue grew 9%. The organic site rental revenue growth of $55 million represents growth of 8% year-over-year comprised of approximately 7% growth from new leasing activity and 3% from cash escalations net of approximately 2% from tenant nonrenewals. 
Moving to Slide 5. Our first quarter results for site rental gross margin, adjusted EBITDA, AFFO and AFFO per share exceeded the midpoint of our previously provided first quarter 2016 outlook. Site rental gross margin benefited from approximately $1 million of onetime items that were not expected in the previously provided outlook comprised of a benefit to site rental revenues of approximately $4 million and offset by an increase to site rental cost of operations of $3 million. Additionally, AFFO for the first quarter 2016 benefited from $10 million and lower-than-expected sustaining capital expenditures, which is due to timing as full year 2016 outlook for sustaining capital expenditures remains unchanged. Excluding the benefit of these nonrecurring and timing items, we still would have exceeded the midpoint of our previously provided first quarter 2016 outlook for each of these metrics. 
Turning to the investment activities during the first quarter. We invested $193 million in capital expenditures of which $10 million was sustaining capital expenditures and $183 million was discretionary investments. Consistent with our proactive approach to producing stable and growing cash flow over time, we invested $21 million in land purchases to further strengthen our control of the ground interest underneath our towers. Today, nearly 80% of our tower site rental gross margin is generated from towers on land we own or control for more than 20 years. Additionally, the average term remaining on our ground leases is over 30 years. 
The balance of our discretionary investments were in revenue-generating capital expenditures. A significant portion of this investment was in our Small Cell business, which, today, consists of 16,500 miles of fiber supporting approximately $385 million in annualized site rental revenues or approximately 12% of our consolidated site rental revenues. We are as excited as we have ever been by the opportunities in small cell. 
Our small cell conversations with the carriers have increasingly become more positive with the passage of time, and we are seeing the business model of small cells play out very similarly to that of towers. To that end, we thought it would be helpful to walk through 2 case studies that illustrate the co-location economics of small cells as the fiber infrastructure is shared among multiple carriers over time. 
On Slide 6, we lay out one of our systems in Denver. The initial system consisted of 14 miles of fiber connecting 18 tenant nodes on 18 poles for the first carrier. On the slide, the lines represent fiber that we own and the circles represent tenant nodes. We define a node as a tenant location that generates revenue and a pole as a physical structure on which we install the carrier's broadcast equipment. The picture shows a representative physical structure under which tenant nodes have been installed. 
Since the initial build-out, we have successfully added 2 additional wireless carriers to the system, which now consists of 17 miles of fiber connecting 65 tenant nodes supported on 26 poles located in the public right-of-way. In aggregate, the system currently generates a yield of approximately 20% based on the recurring cash flows and the capital we invested in the system. As you can see with the system, we have been able to leverage the initial investment by co-locating additional tenant nodes on the fiber to drive our returns. 
Turning to Slide 7. This is a system we have in Las Vegas. This system consists of 36 miles of fiber supporting 77 tenant nodes deployed on 77 poles for 2 carriers, generating a yield of approximately 13%. In addition, we are currently working with a third carrier to co-locate nodes on this fiber network and anticipate adding that third carrier to this system in the next 6 months. Unlike the Denver example where the majority of the co-location of tenant nodes occurred on the same pole as the first carrier, in this example, the co-location occurred at different pole locations along the existing fiber. Because the majority of the investment relates to deploying fiber, our yield increased by co-locating additional nodes on our fiber regardless of whether the co-location occurs on the same pole  or on another pole along the fiber. This is why we often describe the fiber as a tower laid on its side, upon which we're aiming to co-locate tenant nodes. 
As we look at our entire Small Cell business, co-location of our fiber networks has driven a meaningful improvement to the yield initially generated on the systems we acquired or constructed over the last several years. Given the returns we are seeing from small cells, we believe our continued investments are consistent with our strategy of allocating capital to drive long-term growth and dividends per share. 
Returning to investments and financing activities. Subsequent to the quarter, and as previously announced, we acquired TDC for approximately $461 million in cash. The TDC portfolio consisted of 336 towers located in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. Based on TDC's run rate contribution, the transaction is immediately accretive to AFFO per share. Consistent with our long-held capital allocation philosophy, we intend to pursue discretionary investment opportunities such as TDC and small cells that we believe will drive long-term growth and dividends per share. 
Continuing with financing activities. During the quarter, we paid a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.885 per share or $298 million in the aggregate. 
In January, we closed on our current $4.5 billion (sic) [ $5.5 billion ] unsecured credit facility and issued $1.5 billion in unsecured notes. These attractive debt transactions highlight the appeal of Crown Castle's high-quality cash flows and strong business model. 
Moving on to our full year 2016 outlook on Slide 8. We have increased our expectations at the midpoint for site rental revenues by $45 million, site rental gross margin by $31 million, adjusted EBITDA by $25 million and AFFO by $24 million. The increase in our full year outlook reflects the strong results from the first quarter, the inclusion of our TDC acquisition and the timing benefit related to tenant nonrenewals occurring later than we previously expected. It is important to note that our overall expectations for the number of tenant nonrenewals in the aggregate remain unchanged. 
On a per-share basis, AFFO is expected to be $4.70 at the midpoint compared to $4.30 in 2015, representing an increase of over 9% year-over-year. 
As you will hear from Ben, we believe that we are well-positioned well positioned to capitalize on the long-term positive industry fundamentals that we expect will position us to achieve our stated goal of delivering compound annual growth of 6% to 7% in AFFO and dividends per share. 
Lastly, I'm excited to welcome Dan Schlanger to the Crown Castle team. Dan will step into the Chief Financial Officer role on June 1. He is a great addition to the team with his unique combination of financial and operational experience. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Ben."

As Jay mentioned, we are ahead of plan to deliver on our stated goal of generating AFFO per share and dividends per share compound annual growth of 6% to 7% organically, which remains o",1049,"Thanks, Jay. Thanks for everyone joining us on the call this morning. As Jay mentioned, we are ahead of plan to deliver on our stated goal of generating AFFO per share and dividends per share compound annual growth of 6% to 7% organically, which remains our long-term view. Our expectation is based on the intersection of 2 things: anticipated exponential growth and demand for wireless connectivity and our unique portfolio of towers and small cells that can help carriers address their network needs. 
On this first point. According to Cisco, U.S. mobile data consumption grew 56% in 2015 compared to 2014. The year-over-year growth alone represents a staggering amount of data consumption. It is almost equivalent to all the mobile data that crossed the cellular networks in 2013. Importantly, as we look out to the future, this growth is expected to continue. U.S. mobile data consumption is projected to increase sixfold between 2015 and 2020, a compound annual growth rate of 47% or roughly doubling every 2 years. Given these projections, and consistent with carrier commentary, we expect the carriers to continue to invest on a consistent basis to maintain and improve network quality. 
According to our recent survey conducted by consulting firm, Accenture, 60% of residents were dissatisfied -- respondents were dissatisfied with their wireless connectivity and experience while 71% of respondents would be willing to pay more for better connectivity. Against this backdrop, network quality is a competitive necessity as carriers seek to retain existing customers, attract new customers and drive further subscriber economics. 
Equally as important, network quality is a prerequisite as carriers seek to develop new revenue streams and use cases such as over-the-top video, machine-to-machine connection, smart city management and fixed wireless broadband. 
As we move beyond connecting people to connecting things, the reliability of networks become even more critical. The latency, capacity and coverage required for connected cars or for smart cities that manage traffic and energy grids using mobile sensors for connections need to work everywhere all the time is much different than managing a network against dropped calls. A higher threshold of reliability and the corresponding need for network densification suggest that we are in the midst of a sustained investment cycle by the carriers. 
Across towers and small cells, we have a unique combination of assets and expertise that positions Crown Castle to assist the wireless carriers in densifying their networks regardless of geography or network topology. As the leading U.S. shared wireless infrastructure provider, Crown Castle is assisting wireless carriers in this endeavor by providing them with speed to market and cost-effective access to wireless infrastructure. Our portfolio of approximately 40,000 towers with 72% located in the top 100 markets remains the first option in improving network quality given towers' efficiency and cost effectiveness. With our existing base of over 80,000 tenant installations, we believe there's a long runway of growth opportunities via amendments as tenants add more capacity to their existing installations. 
Further, with an average tenancy of 2.2 tenants per tower, which effectively puts us at 40% to 50% occupancy given the addressable market of the Big 4 wireless carriers plus a host of other tenant opportunities, there are significant opportunities for new co-locations as carriers work to increase network capacity by adding additional cell sites. 
We are further expanding the size of this opportunity by our investment in small cells, which is the natural extension of the carrier's network densification efforts needed to address network capacity. When presented with the challenge of providing continuous, consistent, high-capacity wireless broadband service across urban and suburban geographies, carriers are increasingly turning to small cells as an essential tool to improve their networks, as illustrated in the Denver and Las Vegas examples that Jay discussed. With small cells, we're investing in a business model that shares the same shared economic model with towers and we're encouraged by what we are seeing. 
Longer term, we believe we are well positioned to capture a significant share of this larger market opportunity. By focusing our investment in the top metro markets, we believe our fiber footprint of over 16,000 miles is in the right locations with the capacity necessary to support significant small cell deployment longer term. We believe this critical combination of location and capacity facilitates system deployments with time-to-market and economic advantages. 
To support the growth in small cells over the last several years, we have also built an organization that can execute at scale. Our team's deep RF fiber and real estate management skills and capabilities allow us to offer our customers a turnkey solution, a service level and value proposition that we believe is the best in the industry. 
While small cells are providing the much-needed additional network capacity, towers continue to play an important role in providing the first layer of coverage and capacity in an increasingly mobile world. In addition to bolstering network capacity through additional spectrum and cell sites, whether through towers or small cells, future networks are expected to add capacity by improving network architecture through increasing interconnectedness. As the only wireless infrastructure provider that can offer tower and small cells solutions at scale, we believe we are in excellent position to capitalize on the future evolution of wireless networks through the extension of our shared infrastructure model, a model that continues to efficiently serve carrier needs and provide a compelling total return proposition of dividends and growth for shareholders. 
Before wrapping up, I'd like to extend my welcome to Dan Schlanger who's joining the team as CFO at June 1, as Jay mentioned, as we move forward with our announced succession plan with Jay Brown moving to CEO and my move to Executive vice Chairman. I am confident that our executive management team will continue to execute our business plan performing for customers and shareholders under Jay's leadership. 
Finally, I want to thank all my colleagues at Crown Castle who have worked so hard to achieve what we have accomplished. These men and women are true professionals. As their primary spokesman on these calls over the last 8 years, it has been my privilege to report to you their latest accomplishments every 90 days. I am confident there are many more accomplishments to come. 
With that, operator, we'll be pleased to address some questions."

I wonder if you could just talk about the overall leasing environment. We did see Verizon's CapEx in wireless down 9.5%, although they did comment about keeping the full year sort of back end-loaded.

On the first question around the leasing environment, as we talked about over the last couple of calls, our view is that leasing activity in the full year '16 is going to be very similar to what we saw in 2015 and we continue to hold that view. The guide that we've provided was based upon how we outperformed in the first quarter along with our view that the tenant nonrenewals were going to occur later in the year, and that's really what changed in our outlook. So our view of activity is about the same. Similar to past years, the other thing I would note is that if you look at our total new leases that we would expect during the course of the year, and that would be a combination of new leases on towers as well as amendments to existing leases, that activity is about 40% in the first half of the year and about 60% in the second half of the year. So it's back end-loaded, but in about the same way as we typically find in the business. On your second question about the nonrenewal, our view is that, in total, from consolidation churn that we've talked about over the last several years, in total, we think that amount is about the same as it was previously. So we've moved out portions of that. Some portion of that we moved to 2017 and the balance of it we moved to the periods that are beyond 2017. So at the moment, our view would be the total nonrenewal stays about the same, we're just pushing it out to the right a little bit. There's more details in the supplement if people would like to see how we moved each of those in our view in each of the calendar years. But I would say, overall, we think it's about the same total amount of nonrenewals."

If you're looking at the incremental margins, the incremental margins are not going to look as high as what we typically see when we're constructing new small cell systems, so I think that would be one thing I would raise. And then if you look at the total cost structure for the full year, as we talked about last quarter, the G&A in the fourth quarter -- third and fourth quarter of last year is about what we expect for the full year 2016. So by time we exit the year, if you look at it on a full year basis, it starts to stabilize but you're still feeling the effects if you do Q1 '15 over Q1 '16 as the costs grew throughout calendar year [indiscernible]."

So when you go down to the AFFO metric, we get the benefit at the AFFO line of those cash escalations. The other component I would point out is, as we've talked about last quarter around some of the fees that we received when tenant nonrenewals occur, we refer to those commonly as pay and walk fees that we receive from carriers. Last year, there was about $30 million to $40 million of those pay and walk fees in our services business. We don't expect anywhere close to that scale of activity in calendar year '16 as we saw in '15. And so as we guided to services, we guided down in services from the removal of those kind of fees to the tune of about $30 million to $40 million year-over-year.

As a part of -- as you look at the whole business, though, there's 2 things that affect that, back to my prior comment about the Sunesys acquisition, obviously the incremental growth in revenues is going to be offset by the costs that come with an acquisition. So if we have acquisitions, that will impact the totality of the margins in that segment. But the other aspect to it is that we are deploying a meaningful amount of capital to build additional fiber and additional small cell networks. And as we put those systems on air, they're going to tend to mute the growth that we would have. So there's a bit of a -- we often refer to it as like a vintage analysis internally where we look at the systems similar to those that we showed this morning in Denver and Las Vegas that we've had on air for a period of time. As we add those tenants, the direct margins on those systems will look -- we believe will look at least as good or if not better than what Towers would. But as we look at the totality of segment, it's going to depend on how much investment opportunity we have there as to whether or not the full benefit of that co-location flows through to your margins or whether it's offset by the value of investing in future systems that come on at a lower margin level."

If you could kind of bring us up to speed on the total capital investment to this point in time kind of as a starting point for 1Q '16, that would be kind of a helpful beginning so we can kind of see how that's evolving. And then, second, these slides on the system developments are super helpful, I think, in part because they give us some granular node and pole detail, which I think would be super helpful to have for the totality of the Small Cell business, which I notice is not part of the disclosures anymore. So could you kind of give us an update on some of the metrics that go along with these new revenue numbers, it'd be great."

I think the simplest way, Dave, to look at where we are in the business is to annualize sort of the run rate margin in the segment so 61 times 4, call it, $240 million or so against $3 billion of capital spent over time. And it's easier to remember",400,"Sure. I think the simplest way, Dave, to look at where we are in the business is to annualize sort of the run rate margin in the segment so 61 times 4, call it, $240 million or so against $3 billion of capital spent over time. And it's easier to remember the 3 because we can remember the 2 distinct events, one was $1 billion for NextG at about a 4% yield and the Sunesys acquisition last year of $1 billion at about 6% yield. So you can see obviously the incremental contribution on that last $1 billion then is very significant, gets in the sort of double digits to drag the whole thing up. And that's illustrated -- that's a macro view and then it's illustrated obviously in Jay's 2 case studies we walked through. So it's a great question and it's one we look at. It's probably the #1 thing we watch, it's just are we dragging that overall yield up with that incremental contribution both from new systems and then the co-location that occurs. And as Jay said, it's a long race because as you bring on new systems with single tenants, it's a land grab not unlike the Tower business has been. So you're bringing on somewhat lower yields and then I think grows over time. In terms of metrics, one of the things that we're -- and we've now given you a lot more detail, we realize, around segment reporting, that'll probably increase over time. One of the things that Jay was talking about was tenant nodes, and that's why we illustrated these 2 systems where you can have tenant nodes locate by themselves on the common fiber. So you can either have them collocated themselves where you have 2 tenants on 1 pole or you can have 2 tenants on 2 poles. And so the node metric is somewhat confusing or lost and it's why I think it makes sense to go back to sort of the financials. And then over time, there's various things that we made a slide to discuss would be revenue per fiber mile, for example, obviously a key driver. The fiber is the vast majority of where the capital goes and so we're working to find some simple metrics for everyone like we had in the Tower business. It's just not quite as simple, but hopefully it's getting better."

So we threw it -- we put it into the business and we're not focusing on it as a separate business from our overall Small Cell business. So the contribution there, frankly, we're much more focused on driving the return, as Ben talked about it, on the full $3 billion and using that fiber to deploy additional small cells against it. With regards to the competitive environment that we're in, obviously there are a number of folks who look at this business and see it as attractive and can currently -- can obviously see the public comments that the wireless operators are making about the importance of small cells and how they're necessary to improve their networks along the lines what Ben's comments were and the necessity of small cells in order to accomplish the density of networks that are required to meet the consumer's expectation for devices. And so we do find competition. Sometimes that competition comes from more nationally based fiber operators. And then at other times, as we're in certain markets, there may be a provider of fiber that's specific to a single market alone and so we'll run into them as we're going through the process of a request for proposal from the carriers where a local provider may be in that process. So at the end of the day, we believe that our opportunity here is based upon our access to a cost of capital and a return on that capital that we think is very attractive given what we've seen over the long period of time that we've been in the Tower business. We also believe that we're the best at it. So we have built, in terms of scale, I think, unmatched scale and operating capabilities when compared to anyone. And certainly, as we talk to the wireless operators, we make that case. The last thing that I would say in terms of what we run into is the vast majority of these fiber and small cells are purpose-built. They need to be in specific locations along routes where we can install on poles, as we showed in some of the pictures and illustrated in some of the cases. And this fiber is very different than -- we believe is very different than what we've seen historically deployed. And so as we go out and purpose-build this fiber, it really -- as we're in the process of working with the carriers, that's where the operational expertise and scale is helpful to us to win those next projects."

In both cases, there are -- as you can see from the map, there are locations there that would obviously make sense for towers to be located and there are, and those carriers have macro coverage in both Las Vegas and Denver in those areas. Small cells are large an opportunity for the carriers to offload some of the data traffic off of the macro site onto a small cell, which improves and enhances the value of the macro site to cover a larger geography. And we have not seen, as we've deployed -- as we talked about, nearly $385 million of run rate revenue, we have not seen carriers come off of macro sites. In fact, we believe and from the comments the carriers have made and our own experience, that it actually enhances the value of their macro sites. So this is a product that enhances their network, it's not a substitute. And the last point I would make about that is from a cost standpoint, if there's a macro site that solves the problem or the challenge or improves the network, the macro site is always preferable as a solution because it's much more cost effective to the carriers. So small cells are a solution when macro sites really can't solve the need and then it becomes a necessary component of the network at that point."

We may come to a place where we have an operating metric that we think is helpful. Frankly, as we manage the business, what's little different between Small Cells and Towers is that I wouldn't describe the rent as much as a standard rent as what you typically see in towers. The systems are priced and we provide them to the carriers based on a return. And so as we look at the business, we tend to go back to the financials and look at what's the net capital we're investing in the systems against the recurring cash flows in those systems and then how do we price appropriately both the first tenant and then future tenants on those systems. So we've talked about things like, you remember back in the early days of the Tower business where we have things like the BBEs, which was a broadband equivalent for towers and that was a revenue metric. We just want to make sure that as we focus kind of the next leg of disclosure as the business has gotten larger, that we described it in a way that is helpful and so we may, over time, get to a place where we feel like some of those metrics are more helpful. But at the moment, we think probably the best way to focus the attention is around the segment reporting that we've provided. And then some of these case studies may be helpful to start to understand operationally how they're deployed, how the carriers think about them and how we're investing capital in the fiber against which we're trying to co-locate as many nodes as possible."

So while it's possible for someone to come in, we don't have exclusivity -- obviously somebody can come overbuild technically. Economically, it doesn't make any sense, and I would go back to the question of the addressable market and the competitive landscape. It is an enormous world out there obviously when you start looking at the world block by block. And I look at -- we're in Houston and I look in Houston today where there's 2 large systems getting built, one by ourselves and another by a competitor, and we don't overlap at all. And so that's the way these are working kind of all across the country where it makes sense. I think it's unrealistic on our part to think a carrier's going to give us 100% of their market share in a particular area. As much as we love that to happen, that's just not realistic. And so we have competitors, they're gaining in terms of their own capability and the economics around the transactions make it such that very much like towers, it just doesn't make any sense once you have the capacity in the market and you have 1 or 2 carriers already on that system to come in and essentially duplicate that infrastructure. It's not already there, I guess, is the point and we're having to largely build it or occasionally buy it like we did with Sunesys where some of you will recall when we bought Sunesys it was only 27% utilized on average in terms of strand count, so we have a lot of capacity in those metropolitan markets where Sunesys fiber was and obviously that's a speed-to-market advantage and an efficiency around costs.

But I would tell you and it has to pass the filter of -- we're supporting wireless infrastructure, first and foremost. We're supporting the wireless sort of broadband capacity build-out that's happening on the small cell networks. And so that takes us to these top 25 Metros typically, which is an enormous geography to cover when you start thinking about it that way, again at the block-by-block level. So there's just not that many in the universe of sort of addressable targets. We may do a few more, but I wouldn't say there's anything on the horizon right now that looks like Sunesys."

I would tell you, as we look at the activity in total on towers, we think that, that activity, which is going to come from a myriad of sources including the one you referenced, we think that's about the same level of new leasing activity this year as what we had last year. That's a bit elevated from the levels that we saw in 2014. And as we talk about our long-term target that Ben and I both mentioned, that 6% to 7% growth in AFFO and dividend per share on an annual basis, what we've embedded in that is a leasing environment for towers that looks fairly similar to what we're -- what -- the environment we're currently in today. And our experience over a long period of time is that as the carriers either acquire additional spectrum or upgrade their technologies to the newest and latest technology, it's the sources of that revenue growth tend to move among the carriers among the technologies and among the spectrum band, but we see a relatively consistent amount of revenue growth year-to-year. In fact, as you go back over a multiyear period, you can find that the vast majority of the leasing activity in any given year is within a band of about 10% to 20% up or down. And so it gives us a lot of confidence in the business as we think about longer term our 6% to 7% metric in AFFO growth that it would appear to us our assumption of that current level of leasing growth is a fairly well-placed assumption as we look at it through a different a number of different cycles over a long period of time. So we certainly spend some time watching and having conversations with the carrier about what they're doing specifically with certain technologies, but we'll let them to speak for that and we'll focus on what we think the impact to kind of revenues are as they take those various actions over time."

For new tenants, when they're -- as they're co-locating on existing systems, that process can take anywhere between 9 and 18 months depending on the dynamics in the market, and so we have a pipeline of those activities as well. What we're seeing in terms of the revenue growth in Small Cells this year of $55 million, those would have been projects that we started a number of years ago that are now into the run rate. So I would say, in Small Cells, we have a little bit more visibility about what the revenue growth is going to look like given the construction time frame whether that's co-location or new system. So we do have a view for that. And back to my prior point, that's baked into our view of growth of 6% to 7% AFFO per share. So we're assuming that we continue to see the current level of activity over an extended period of time. To the extent that we have opportunities beyond that, then we have to revisit that growth rate. That -- our working assumption is that we both invest and see activity that's in and around the same levels we're currently seeing."

On the AT&T and T-Mobile acquisitions that we did, those towers in terms of their new revenue growth are performing in line with the rest of our towers. So we haven't seen any meaningful difference in leasing, which was our underwriting assumption going into those acquisitions. In both cases, we assume that we would add about 1 tenant per tower per year over the first 10 years of ownership. And as we look at our consolidated results, that's about what we're seeing in terms of new leasing activity across the whole portfolio and we're seeing it pretty consistently across many. On your second question about churn, we've obviously had discussions with the carriers, but again, I'd like to be careful about guarding some of those conversations. They've been pretty public about their desire to ramp those legacy networks down. We think the locations are obviously great, and at some point, we're picked specifically for those networks. So there may be the opportunity over time for some of those sites to get reused. But right now, based on what the carriers have both said publicly and indicated to us, we think the best long-term assumption is to say that those sites will eventually not be renewed and so we've baked that into our outlook."

On the first question, I think it's probably a level of granularity that, at this point, we haven't disclosed around organic growth. You can obviously see from the 2 businesses that the growth on Small Cells is much higher on a percentage basis than that of Towers, which, in part, comes from the fact that we're coming off of a much lower base. And so as we add tenant nodes across the systems, that's going to result in higher percentage growth. With regards to the 6.8% moving down towards 6% over the course of the year, we look at the business and find it to be helpful to look at it much more on a year-over-year basis rather than digging into kind of quarter-to-quarter as there can be things, whether it's the timing of the non -- tenant nonrenewals or the timing of leasing that impacts that. And you brought up exactly the right point when you referenced my earlier comments to Simon about 40% in the first half of the year and 60% in the back half of the year. What happened in past years as 60% of the leasing activity went on the towers late in the balance of 2015, those come into the run rate obviously some reported numbers, whether that's GAAP numbers or the organic metrics that we have, those won't show up until basically the first quarter in fulsome this year, so that has some impact to those numbers. And as we go over the course of the year the licenses, and I was specifically referring to the new leases that we would do with carriers over the course of the year, those leases that we signed in the fourth quarter this year will have very little to no impact to site rental revenue in this calendar year. Those will just be in the run rate as we go into next calendar year. So there is some balancing over time that leads to those differences. The other thing I would point out is just -- you just got the law of large numbers also. So as you move through the -- over time, from a percentage basis, we're going to lose somewhere in the neighborhood of about 40 basis points assuming a constant level of activity, 40 to 50 basis points, on the revenue growth number from an activity standpoint and that's why we spend so much time talking about $115 million of nominal growth and on the Tower side is that's really the best indication of what is activity doing either up or down from kind of that baseline number. So the percentage change is a combination of looking at quarters and trying to figure out what does it look like period-to-period and then also a law of large numbers."

The cable companies in various markets would be in the list of competitors. From time to time, we run across them. And in particular, your question, Spencer, around the uniqueness of the fiber, it really goes to the capacity and the fact that all the cable plant whether they dedicate it to either sort of cable or enterprise is experiencing dramatic growth in bandwidth requirements across the universe. And as we look at what these small sales require in terms of typically a distributing antenna system architecture takes a pair of strands for every node, that's a very -- essentially like a dark fiber connection. That's a very significant burden to put on existing plant in many markets. And so certainly, there are some like we found Sunesys that had capacity. Obviously, we moved on that. But as a general matter, it's not uniform and it's not interchangeable and so you're really have to look at it almost block by block, city by city where we have an engagement and where we can take advantage of existing fiber either through leasing something occasionally or acquiring it, we will. But that's in the vast minority except for the footprint we acquired with Sunesys. So that's probably not as clear as we can be.

On the first question, the margins on small cells are impacted by 2 things, one was the Sunesys acquisitions that we did so that makes the incremental margins in growth in revenue look a little different than what we would typically see if it was just systems without the acquisition that we put into it. So that's part of the impact. The other thing is exactly what you said, which is we have systems that have been on air and are benefiting from co-location as well as we're putting meaningful amounts of capital investment in for systems that start with just one tenant. And so the combination of those two things, along with the co-location, is what yields -- what meets out the ultimate margin. Again, we're looking at 2 things: one is the underlying business and is co-location happening and how does that develop over time; and then the second thing is, as we allocate capital, new capital on new systems, does that makes sense against the broader environment. And we think on both fronts, we're growing in our comfort in the business and encouragement and excitement about what could be in the Small Cell business as it develops very similar to what we've seen over a longer period of time with Towers. To your second question about straight-line revenues, just taking the simple example of a 10-year lease in the first 5 years of that 10-year lease, the reported GAAP revenues would be above the cash received. And in the second 5 years of the 10-year contract, the cash received would be above the GAAP revenues. So as you note on that slide there, we refer to that as the revenue eclipse that is occurring and we're nearly there. So we believe without meaningful amount of extensions would likely be the case over the next several years is that we'll have cash receipts that are in excess of reporting GAAP revenues. And that's why we spend so much time focusing on AFFO per share because it removes that vagaries and focuses on the cash receipts from those lease contracts."

As highlighted on Slide 3, our first quarter results exceeded the midpoint of our first quarter outlook and allowed us to raise our full year 2016 outlook.

As highlighted on Slide 3, our first quarter results exceeded the midpoint of our first quarter outlook and allowed us to raise our full year 2016 outlook. Our increased midpoint for full year 2016 outlook for AFFO per share of $4.70 represents an increase of over 9% compared to 2015. 
During the quarter, we also strengthened our balance sheet by accessing the bond market with our inaugural investment-grade issuance. This was another successful step in our effort to lower our cost of debt and equity capital. 
Operationally, we continued to invest in both small cells and towers, which we believe will drive future growth. These continued investments, together with our portfolio of approximately 40,000 towers and 16,500 miles of fiber supporting small cell deployments, position us as the leading U.S. wireless infrastructure provider with unique capabilities and assets to provide network solutions throughout the country and across a variety of different network architectures. 
Shifting to the first quarter results on Slide 4. Site rental revenue grew 9%. The organic site rental revenue growth of $55 million represents growth of 8% year-over-year comprised of approximately 7% growth from new leasing activity and 3% from cash escalations net of approximately 2% from tenant nonrenewals. 
Moving to Slide 5. Our first quarter results for site rental gross margin, adjusted EBITDA, AFFO and AFFO per share exceeded the midpoint of our previously provided first quarter 2016 outlook. Site rental gross margin benefited from approximately $1 million of onetime items that were not expected in the previously provided outlook comprised of a benefit to site rental revenues of approximately $4 million and offset by an increase to site rental cost of operations of $3 million. Additionally, AFFO for the first quarter 2016 benefited from $10 million and lower-than-expected sustaining capital expenditures, which is due to timing as full year 2016 outlook for sustaining capital expenditures remains unchanged. Excluding the benefit of these nonrecurring and timing items, we still would have exceeded the midpoint of our previously provided first quarter 2016 outlook for each of these metrics. 
Turning to the investment activities during the first quarter. We invested $193 million in capital expenditures of which $10 million was sustaining capital expenditures and $183 million was discretionary investments. Consistent with our proactive approach to producing stable and growing cash flow over time, we invested $21 million in land purchases to further strengthen our control of the ground interest underneath our towers. Today, nearly 80% of our tower site rental gross margin is generated from towers on land we own or control for more than 20 years. Additionally, the average term remaining on our ground leases is over 30 years. 
The balance of our discretionary investments were in revenue-generating capital expenditures. A significant portion of this investment was in our Small Cell business, which, today, consists of 16,500 miles of fiber supporting approximately $385 million in annualized site rental revenues or approximately 12% of our consolidated site rental revenues. We are as excited as we have ever been by the opportunities in small cell. 
Our small cell conversations with the carriers have increasingly become more positive with the passage of time, and we are seeing the business model of small cells play out very similarly to that of towers. To that end, we thought it would be helpful to walk through 2 case studies that illustrate the co-location economics of small cells as the fiber infrastructure is shared among multiple carriers over time. 
On Slide 6, we lay out one of our systems in Denver. The initial system consisted of 14 miles of fiber connecting 18 tenant nodes on 18 poles for the first carrier. On the slide, the lines represent fiber that we own and the circles represent tenant nodes. We define a node as a tenant location that generates revenue and a pole as a physical structure on which we install the carrier's broadcast equipment. The picture shows a representative physical structure onto which tenant nodes have been installed. 
Since the initial build-out, we have successfully added 2 additional wireless carriers to the system, which now consists of 17 miles of fiber connecting 65 tenant nodes supported on 26 poles located in the public right-of-way. In aggregate, the system currently generates a yield of approximately 20% based on the recurring cash flows and the capital we invested in the system. As you can see with the system, we have been able to leverage the initial investment by co-locating additional tenant nodes on the fiber to drive our returns. 
Turning to Slide 7. This is a system we have in Las Vegas. This system consists of 36 miles of fiber supporting 77 tenant nodes deployed on 77 poles for 2 carriers, generating a yield of approximately 13%. In addition, we are currently working with a third carrier to co-locate nodes on this fiber network and anticipate adding that third carrier to this system in the next 6 months. Unlike the Denver example where the majority of the co-location of tenant nodes occurred on the same pole as the first carrier, in this example, the co-location occurred at different pole locations along the existing fiber. Because the majority of the investment relates to deploying fiber, our yield increased by co-locating additional nodes on our fiber regardless of whether the co-location occurs on the same pole  or on another pole along the fiber. This is why we often describe the fiber as a tower laid on its side, upon which we're aiming to co-locate tenant nodes. 
As we look at our entire Small Cell business, co-location of our fiber networks has driven a meaningful improvement to the yield initially generated on the systems we acquired or constructed over the last several years. Given the returns we are seeing from small cells, we believe our continued investments are consistent with our strategy of allocating capital to drive long-term growth and dividends per share. 
Returning to investments and financing activities. Subsequent to the quarter, and as previously announced, we acquired TDC for approximately $461 million in cash. The TDC portfolio consisted of 336 towers located in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. Based on TDC's run rate contribution, the transaction is immediately accretive to AFFO per share. Consistent with our long-held capital allocation philosophy, we intend to pursue discretionary investment opportunities such as TDC and small cells that we believe will drive long-term growth and dividends per share. 
Continuing with financing activities. During the quarter, we paid a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.885 per share or $298 million in the aggregate. 
In January, we closed on our current $4.5 billion (sic) [ $5.5 billion ] unsecured credit facility and issued $1.5 billion in unsecured notes. These attractive debt transactions highlight the appeal of Crown Castle's high-quality cash flows and strong business model. 
Moving on to our full year 2016 outlook on Slide 8. We have increased our expectations at the midpoint for site rental revenues by $45 million, site rental gross margin by $31 million, adjusted EBITDA by $25 million and AFFO by $24 million. The increase in our full year outlook reflects the strong results from the first quarter, the inclusion of our TDC acquisition and the timing benefit related to tenant nonrenewals occurring later than we previously expected. It is important to note that our overall expectations for the number of tenant nonrenewals in the aggregate remain unchanged. 
On a per-share basis, AFFO is expected to be $4.70 at the midpoint compared to $4.30 in 2015, representing an increase of over 9% year-over-year. 
As you will hear from Ben, we believe that we are well-positioned to capitalize on the long-term positive industry fundamentals that we expect will position us to achieve our stated goal of delivering compound annual growth of 6% to 7% in AFFO and dividends per share. 
Lastly, I'm excited to welcome Dan Schlanger to the Crown Castle team. Dan will step into the Chief Financial Officer role on June 1. He is a great addition to the team with his unique combination of financial and operational experience. 
And with that, I'll turn it over to Ben."

As Jay mentioned, we are ahead of plan to deliver on our stated goal of generating AFFO per share and dividends per share compound annual growth of 6% to 7% organically, which remains o",1049,"Thanks, Jay. Thanks for everyone joining us on the call this morning. As Jay mentioned, we are ahead of plan to deliver on our stated goal of generating AFFO per share and dividends per share compound annual growth of 6% to 7% organically, which remains our long-term view. Our expectation is based on the intersection of 2 things: anticipated exponential growth and demand for wireless connectivity and our unique portfolio of towers and small cells that can help carriers address their network needs. 
On this first point. According to Cisco, U.S. mobile data consumption grew 56% in 2015 compared to 2014. The year-over-year growth alone represents a staggering amount of data consumption. It is almost equivalent to all the mobile data that crossed the cellular networks in 2013. Importantly, as we look out to the future, this growth is expected to continue. U.S. mobile data consumption is projected to increase sixfold between 2015 and 2020, a compound annual growth rate of 47% or roughly doubling every 2 years. Given these projections, and consistent with carrier commentary, we expect the carriers to continue to invest on a consistent basis to maintain and improve network quality. 
According to our recent survey conducted by consulting firm, Accenture, 60% of residents were dissatisfied -- of respondents were dissatisfied with their wireless connectivity and experience, while 71% of respondents would be willing to pay more for better connectivity. Against this backdrop, network quality is a competitive necessity as carriers seek to retain existing customers, attract new customers and drive further subscriber economics. 
Equally as important, network quality is a prerequisite as carriers seek to develop new revenue streams and use cases such as over-the-top video, machine-to-machine connections, smart city management and fixed wireless broadband. 
As we move beyond connecting people to connecting things, the reliability of networks become even more critical. The latency, capacity and coverage required for connected cars or for smart cities that manage traffic and energy grids using mobile sensors for connections need to work everywhere all the time is much different than managing a network against dropped calls. A higher threshold of reliability and the corresponding need for network densification suggest that we are in the midst of a sustained investment cycle by the carriers. 
Across towers and small cells, we have a unique combination of assets and expertise that positions Crown Castle to assist the wireless carriers in densifying their networks regardless of geography or network topology. As the leading U.S. shared wireless infrastructure provider, Crown Castle is assisting wireless carriers in this endeavor by providing them with speed to market and cost-effective access to wireless infrastructure. Our portfolio of approximately 40,000 towers with 72% located in the top 100 markets remains the first option in improving network quality given towers' efficiency and cost effectiveness. With our existing base of over 80,000 tenant installations, we believe there's a long runway of growth opportunities via amendments as tenants add more capacity to their existing installations. 
Further, with an average tenancy of 2.2 tenants per tower, which effectively puts us at 40% to 50% occupancy given the addressable market of the Big 4 wireless carriers plus a host of other tenant opportunities, there are significant opportunities for new co-locations as carriers work to increase network capacity by adding additional cell sites. 
We are further expanding the size of this opportunity by our investment in small cells, which is the natural extension of the carrier's network densification efforts needed to address network capacity. When presented with the challenge of providing continuous, consistent, high-capacity wireless broadband service across urban and suburban geographies, carriers are increasingly turning to small cells as an essential tool to improve their networks, as illustrated in the Denver and Las Vegas examples that Jay discussed. With small cells, we're investing in a business model that shares the same shared economic model with towers and we're encouraged by what we are seeing. 
Longer term, we believe we are well positioned to capture a significant share of this larger market opportunity. By focusing our investment in the top metro markets, we believe our fiber footprint of over 16,000 miles is in the right locations with the capacity necessary to support significant small cell deployment longer term. We believe this critical combination of location and capacity facilitates system deployments with time-to-market and economic advantages. 
To support the growth in small cells over the last several years, we have also built an organization that can execute at scale. Our team's deep RF fiber and real estate management skills and capabilities allow us to offer our customers a turnkey solution, a service level and value proposition that we believe is the best in the industry. 
While small cells are providing the much-needed additional network capacity, towers continue to play an important role in providing the first layer of coverage and capacity in an increasingly mobile world. In addition to bolstering network capacity through additional spectrum and cell sites, whether through towers or small cells, future networks are expected to add capacity by improving network architecture through increasing interconnectedness. As the only wireless infrastructure provider that can offer tower and small cells solutions at scale, we believe we are in excellent position to capitalize on the future evolution of wireless networks through the extension of our shared infrastructure model, a model that continues to efficiently serve carrier needs and provide a compelling total return proposition of dividends and growth for shareholders. 
Before wrapping up, I'd like to extend my welcome to Dan Schlanger, who's joining the team as CFO, June 1, as Jay mentioned. As we move forward with our announced succession plan with Jay Brown moving to CEO and my move to Executive Vice Chairman, I am confident that our executive management team will continue to execute our business plan performing for customers and shareholders under Jay's leadership. 
Finally, I want to thank all my colleagues at Crown Castle who have worked so hard to achieve what we have accomplished. These men and women are true professionals. As their primary spokesman on these calls over the last 8 years, it has been my privilege to report to you their latest accomplishments every 90 days. I am confident there are many more accomplishments to come. 
With that, operator, we'll be pleased to address some questions."

I wonder if you could just talk about the overall leasing environment. We did see Verizon's CapEx in wireless down 9.5%, although they did comment about keeping the full year sort of back end-loaded. Is that what you're seeing here from the carriers broadly? And related to that, on the tenant nonrenewals, do you have clarity now about the timing of those disconnects? Or is it still possible that there will be further pushing out of this?"

On the first question around the leasing environment, as we talked about over the last couple of calls, our view is that leasing activity in the full year '16 is going to be very similar to what we saw in 2015 and we continue to hold that view. The guide that we've provided was based upon how we outperformed in the first quarter along with our view that the tenant nonrenewals were going to occur a little later in the year, and that's really what changed in our outlook. So our view of activity is about the same. Similar to past years, the other thing I would note is that if you look at our total new leases that we would expect during the course of the year, and that would be a combination of new leases on towers as well as amendments to existing leases, that activity is about 40% in the first half of the year and about 60% in the second half of the year. So it's back end-loaded, but in about the same way as we typically find in the business. On your second question about the nonrenewal, our view is that, in total, from consolidation churn that we've talked about over the last several years, in total, we think that amount is about the same as it was previously. So we've moved out portions of that. Some portion of that we moved to 2017 and the balance of it we moved to the periods that are beyond 2017. So at the moment, our view would be the total nonrenewal stays about the same, we're just pushing it out to the right a little bit. There's more details in the supplement if people would like to see how we moved each of those in our view in each of the calendar years. But I would say, overall, we think it's about the same total amount of nonrenewals."

One is, as we've discussed, the churn is basically offsetting a big portion of the new leasing activity that we're seeing. And then as you look at the GAAP revenue numbers and the segment for Towers, you don't see in those GAAP numbers the benefit of the escalation, the contracted escalations, that we have in the business as those are straight-lined over the term of the lease. So when you go down to the AFFO metric, we get the benefit at the AFFO line of those cash escalations. The other component I would point out is, as we've talked about last quarter around some of the fees that we received when tenant nonrenewals occur, we refer to those commonly as pay and walk fees that we receive from the carriers. Last year, there was about $30 million to $40 million of those pay and walk fees in our services business. We don't expect anywhere close to that scale of activity in calendar year '16 as we saw in '15. And so as we guided to services, we guided down in services from the removal of those kinds of fees to the tune of about $30 million to $40 million year-over-year. And so if you're just looking at the Towers segment and you're looking at adjusted EBITDA or the segment operating profit, you're going to see mostly impacted from the loss of those non -- what we would refer as noncore services activity."

As a part of -- as you look at the whole business, though, there's 2 things that affect that, back to my prior comment about the Sunesys acquisition, obviously the incremental growth in revenues is going to be offset by the costs that come with an acquisition. So if we have acquisitions, that will impact the totality of the margins in that segment. But the other aspect to it is that we are deploying a meaningful amount of capital to build additional fiber and additional small cell networks. And as we put those systems on air, they're going to tend to mute the growth that we would have. So there's a bit of a -- we often refer to it as like a vintage analysis internally where we look at the systems similar to those that we showed this morning in Denver and Las Vegas that we've had on air for a period of time. As we add those tenants, the direct margins on those systems will look -- we believe will look at least as good or if not better than what Towers would. But as we look at the totality of the segment, it's going to depend on how much investment opportunity we have there as to whether or not the full benefit of that co-location flows through to your margins or whether it's offset by the value of investing in future systems that come on at a lower margin level."

I think the simplest way, Dave, to look at where we are in the business is to annualize sort of the run rate margin in the segment, so 61 times 4, call it, $240 million or so against $3 billion of capital spent over time. And it's easier to remember the 3 because we can remember the 2 distinct events, one was $1 billion for NextG at about a 4% yield and the Sunesys acquisition last year of $1 billion at about a 6% yield. So you can see that obviously the incremental contribution on that last $1 billion then is very significant, gets in the sort of double digits to drag the whole thing up. And that's illustrated -- that's a macro view and then it's illustrated obviously in Jay's 2 case studies we walked through. So it's a great question and it's one we look at. It's probably the #1 thing we watch, it's just are we dragging that overall yield up with that incremental contribution both from new systems and then the co-location that occurs. And as Jay said, it's a long race because as you bring on new systems with single tenants, it's a land grab not unlike the Tower business has been. So you're bringing on somewhat lower yields and then I think grows over time. In terms of metrics, one of the things that we're -- and we've now given you a lot more detail, we realize, around segment reporting, that'll probably increase over time. One of the things that Jay was talking about was tenant nodes, and that's why we illustrated these 2 systems where you can have tenant nodes locate by themselves on the common fiber. So you can either have them collocated themselves where you have 2 tenants on 1 pole or you can have 2 tenants on 2 poles. And so the node metric is somewhat confusing or lost and it's why I think it makes sense to go back to sort of the financials. And then over time, there's various things that we made a slide to discuss would be revenue per fiber mile, for example, obviously a key driver. The fiber is the vast majority of where the capital goes and so we're working to find some simple metrics for everyone like we had in the Tower business. It's just not quite as simple, but hopefully it's getting better."

So we threw it -- we put it into the business and we're not focusing on it as a separate business from our overall Small Cell business. So the contribution there, frankly, we're much more focused on driving the return, as Ben talked about it, on the full $3 billion and using that fiber to deploy additional small cells against it. With regards to the competitive environment that we're in, obviously there are a number of folks who look at this business and see it as attractive and can currently -- can obviously see the public comments that the wireless operators are making about the importance of small cells and how they're necessary to improve their networks along the lines of what Ben's comments were and the necessity of small cells in order to accomplish the density of networks that are required to meet the consumer's expectation for devices. And so we do find competition. Sometimes that competition comes from more nationally based fiber operators. And then at other times, as we're in certain markets, there may be a provider of fiber that's specific to a single market alone and so we'll run into them as we're going through the process of a request for proposal from the carriers where a local provider may be in that process. So at the end of the day, we believe that our opportunity here is based upon our access to a cost of capital and a return on that capital that we think is very attractive given what we've seen over the long period of time that we've been in the Tower business. We also believe that we're the best at it. So we have built, in terms of scale, I think, unmatched scale and operating capabilities when compared to anyone. And certainly, as we talk to the wireless operators, we make that case. The last thing that I would say in terms of what we run into is the vast majority of this fiber and small cells are purpose-built. They need to be in specific locations along routes where we can install on poles, as we showed in some of the pictures and illustrated in some of the cases. And this fiber is very different than -- we believe is very different than what we've seen historically deployed. And so as we go out and purpose-build this fiber, it really -- as we're in the process of working with the carriers, that's where the operational expertise and scale is helpful to us to win those next projects."

In both cases, there are -- as you can see from the map, there are locations there that would obviously make sense for towers to be located and there are, and those carriers have macro coverage in both Las Vegas and Denver in those areas. Small cells are largely an opportunity for the carriers to offload some of the data traffic off of the macro site onto a small cell, which improves and enhances the value of the macro site to cover a larger geography. And we have not seen, as we've deployed -- as we talked about, nearly $385 million of run rate revenue, we have not seen carriers come off of macro sites. In fact, we believe and from the comments that the carriers have made and our own experience, that it actually enhances the value of their macro sites. So this is a product that enhances their network, it's not a substitute. And the last point I would make about that is from a cost standpoint, if there's a macro site that solves the problem or the challenge or improves the network, the macro site is always preferable as a solution because it's much more cost effective to the carriers. So small cells are a solution when macro sites really can't solve the need and then it becomes a necessary component of the network at that point."

We may come to a place where we have an operating metric that we think is helpful. Frankly, as we manage the business, what's a little different between Small Cells and Towers is that I wouldn't describe the rent as much as a standard rent as what you typically see in towers. The systems are priced and we provide them to the carriers based on a return. And so as we look at the business, we tend to go back to the financials and look at what's the net capital we're investing in the systems against the recurring cash flows in those systems and then how do we price appropriately both the first tenant and then future tenants on those systems. So we've talked about things like, you remember back in the early days of the Tower business where we had things like BBEs, which was a broadband equivalent for towers and that was a revenue metric. We just want to make sure that as we focus kind of the next leg of disclosure as the business has gotten larger, that we described it in a way that is helpful and so we may, over time, get to a place where we feel like some of those metrics are more helpful. But at the moment, we think probably the best way to focus the attention is around the segment reporting that we've provided. And then some of these case studies may be helpful as you start to understand operationally how they're deployed, how the carriers think about them and how we're investing capital into fiber against which we're trying to co-locate as many nodes as possible."

So while it's possible for someone to come in, we don't have exclusivity -- obviously somebody can come overbuild technically. Economically, it doesn't make any sense, and I would go back to the question of the addressable market and the competitive landscape. It is an enormous world out there obviously when you start looking at the world block by block. And I look at -- well, we're in Houston and I look in Houston today where there's 2 large systems getting built, one by ourselves and another by a competitor, and we don't overlap at all. And so that's the way these are working kind of all across the country where it makes sense. I think it's unrealistic on our part to think that a carrier's going to give us 100% of their market share in a particular area. As much as we love that to happen, that's just not realistic. And so we have competitors, they're gaining in terms of their own capability and the economics around the transactions make it such that very much like towers, it just doesn't make any sense once you have the capacity in the market and you have 1 or 2 carriers already on that system to come in and essentially duplicate that infrastructure. It's not already there, I guess, is the point and we're having to largely build it or occasionally buy it like we did with Sunesys where some of you will recall when we bought Sunesys it was only 27% utilized on average in terms of strand count, so we have a lot of capacity in those metropolitan markets where Sunesys fiber was and obviously that's a speed-to-market advantage and an efficiency around costs. A lot cheaper to buy it with a run rate than to build it scratch."

I would tell you, as we look at the activity in total on towers, we think that, that activity, which is going to come from a myriad of sources including the one you referenced, we think that's about the same level of new leasing activity this year as what we had last year. That's a bit elevated from the levels that we saw in 2014. And as we talk about our long-term target that Ben and I both mentioned, of 6% to 7% growth in AFFO and dividend per share on an annual basis, what we've embedded in that is a leasing environment for towers that looks fairly similar to what we're -- what -- the environment we're currently in today. And our experience over a long period of time is that as the carriers either acquire additional spectrum or upgrade their technologies to the newest and latest technology, is the sources of that revenue growth tend to move among the carriers, among the technologies and among the spectrum band, but we see a relatively consistent amount of revenue growth year-to-year. In fact, as you go back over a multiyear period, you can find that the vast majority of the leasing activity in any given year is within a band of about 10% to 20% up or down. And so it gives us a lot of confidence in the business as we think about longer term our 6% to 7% metric in AFFO growth that it would appear to us our assumption of that current level of leasing growth is a fairly well-placed assumption as we look at it through a number of different cycles over a long period of time. So we certainly spend some time watching and having conversations with the carrier about what they're doing specifically with certain technologies, but we'll let them speak for that and we'll focus on what we think the impact to kind of revenues are as they take those various actions over time."

What we're seeing in terms of the revenue growth in Small Cells this year of $55 million, those would have been projects that we started a number of years ago that are now into the run rate. So I would say, in Small Cells, we have a little bit more visibility about what the revenue growth is going to look like given the construction time frame whether that's co-location or new system. So we do have a view for that. And back to my prior point, that's baked into our view of growth of 6% to 7% AFFO per share. So we're assuming that we continue to see the current level of activity over an extended period of time. To the extent that we have opportunities beyond that, then we'd have to revisit that growth rate.

So we haven't seen any meaningful difference in leasing, which was our underwriting assumption going into those acquisitions. In both cases, we assume that we would add about 1 tenant per tower per year over the first 10 years of ownership. And as we look at our consolidated results, that's about what we're seeing in terms of new leasing activity across the whole portfolio and we're seeing it pretty consistently across many. On your second question about churn, we've obviously had discussions with the carriers, but again, I'd like to be careful about guarding some of those conversations. They've been pretty public about their desire to ramp those legacy networks down. We think the locations are obviously great, and at some point, we're picked specifically for those networks. So there may be the opportunity over time for some of those sites to get reused. But right now, based on what the carriers have both said publicly and indicated to us, we think the best long-term assumption is to say that those sites will eventually not be renewed and so we've baked that into our outlook."

First, now that you're breaking out small cells versus the macros, I'm wondering if you can tell us, I guess, the proximity of organic growth for each of those 2 businesses that get us to that 8% that you did in the first quarter? And then also when I look at that 8%, as part of that you did 6.8% growth in new leasing activity but when I look at your guidance for the year you're assuming it's just 6%. So obviously, at some point between the next 3 quarters you're assuming that goes below that number. And when I listened to your response to I think it was Simon's question, you mentioned that you're still expecting 60% of activity in the back half of the year versus 40% in the first half. So I'm trying to understand why we'll be going below 6% over the next 3 quarters to get you to your guidance versus the 6.8% you just did in the first quarter."

On the first question, I think it's probably a level of granularity that, at this point, we haven't disclosed around organic growth. You can obviously see from the 2 businesses that the growth on Small Cells is much higher on a percentage basis than that of Towers, which, in part, comes from the fact that we're coming off of a much lower base. And so as we add tenant nodes across the systems, that's going to result in higher percentage growth. With regards to the 6.8% moving down towards 6% over the course of the year, we look at the business and find it to be helpful to look at it much more on a year-over-year basis rather than digging into kind of quarter-to-quarter as there can be things, whether it's the timing of the non -- tenant nonrenewals or the timing of leasing that impacts that. And you brought up exactly the right point when you referenced my earlier comment to Simon about 40% in the first half of the year and 60% in the back half of the year. What happens in past years as 60% of the leasing activity went on the towers late in the balance of 2015, those come into the run rates obviously from reported numbers, whether that's GAAP numbers or the organic metrics that we have, those won't show up until basically the first quarter in fulsome this year, so that has some impact to those numbers. And as we go over the course of the year, the licenses, and I was specifically referring to the new leases that we would do with carriers over the course of the year, those leases that we signed in the fourth quarter of this year will have very little to no impact to site rental revenue in this calendar year. Those will just be in the run rate as we go into next calendar year. So there is some balancing over time that leads to those differences. The other thing I would point out is just -- you just got the law of large numbers also. So as you move through the -- over time, from a percentage basis, we're going to lose somewhere in the neighborhood of about 40 basis points assuming a constant level of activity, 40 to 50 basis points, on the revenue growth number from an activity standpoint and that's why we spend so much time talking about $115 million of nominal growth and on the Tower side is that's really the best indication of what is activity doing either up or down from kind of that baseline number. So the percentage change is a combination of looking at quarters and trying to figure out what does it look like period-to-period and then also law of large numbers."

The cable companies in various markets would be in the list of competitors. From time to time, we run across them. And in particular, your question, Spencer, around the uniqueness of the fiber, it really goes to the capacity and the fact that all the cable plant whether they dedicate it to either sort of cable or enterprise is experiencing dramatic growth in bandwidth requirements across the universe. And as we look at what these small sales require in terms of typically a distributing antenna system architecture takes a pair of strands for every node, that's a very -- essentially like a dark fiber connection. That's a very significant burden to put on existing plant in many markets. And so certainly, there are some like we found Sunesys that had capacity. Obviously, we moved on that. But as a general matter, it's not uniform and it's not interchangeable and so you're really have to look at it almost block by block, city by city where we have an engagement and where we can take advantage of existing fiber either through leasing something occasionally or acquiring it, we will. But that's in the vast minority except for the footprint we acquired with Sunesys. So that's probably not as clear as we can be. Appreciate that bandwidth requirements for all connectivity is going up, not just wireless."

On the first question, the margins on small cells are impacted by 2 things, one was the Sunesys acquisition that we did, so that makes the incremental margins in growth in revenue look a little different than what we would typically see if it was just systems without the acquisition that we put into it. So that's part of the impact. The other thing is exactly what you said, which is we have systems that have been on air and are benefiting from co-location as well as we're putting meaningful amounts of capital investment in for systems that start with just one tenant. And so the combination of those two things, along with the co-location, is what yields -- what meets out the ultimate margin. Again, we're looking at 2 things: one is the underlying business and is co-location happening and how does that develop over time; and then the second thing is, as we allocate capital, new capital and new systems, does that make sense against the broader environment. And we think on both fronts, we're growing in our comfort in the business and encouragement and excitement about what could be in the Small Cell business as it develops very similar to what we've seen over a long period of time with Towers. To your second question about straight-line revenues, just taking a simple example of a 10-year lease in the first 5 years of that 10-year lease, the reported GAAP revenues would be above the cash received. And in the second 5 years of the 10-year contract, the cash received would be above the GAAP revenues. So as you note on that slide there, we refer to that as the revenue eclipse that is occurring and we're nearly there. So we believe without meaningful amounts of extensions would likely be the case over the next several years is that we'll have cash receipts that are in excess of reporting GAAP revenues. And that's why we spend so much time focusing on AFFO per share because it removes that vagaries and focuses on the cash receipts from those lease contracts."

As you saw from our earnings release last night, we had another quarter of great performance, meaning, we're exceeding the midpoint of our previously provided second quarter outlook and allowing us to increase our full year 2016 outlook. The results reflect our continued focus on creating shareholder value through solid execution, disciplined capital allocation and strong balance sheet management, all of which positions us to achieve our goal of delivering long-term annual dividend growth of 6% to 7%. 
What I'd like to do this morning in my prepared remarks is spend just a few minutes providing a bit more detail on each of the key focus areas that underpin our ability to drive our 6% to 7% per year dividend growth and then hand the call over to Dan to talk about our financial results for the quarter. The first point I'll touch on is our long-term track record of execution. We have a highly motivated very talented team of people who are dedicated to delivering strong results. They have developed the systems and processes necessary to operate and manage our business to generate strong cash flow through a variety of business cycles. Additionally, we've been able to grow through both organically and acquisitions including integrating those acquisitions effectively. The solid execution has resulted in very good financial performance. Since 2007, we have grown AFFO per share from $1.33 to our current expectation of $4.71 for the full year 2016, representing 15% compounded annual growth per share. Additionally, since 2014, we have returned approximately $7 per share in dividends, further enhancing the returns for our shareholders. The combination of our track record of execution, the quality of the portfolio of assets that we have accumulated, the secular tailwinds of increasing demand for wireless connectivity and the strength of our business model position us well to capitalize on the positive industry trends we are seeing coming our way, which is the second topic I want to highlight. 
As we look to the future, we believe wireless carriers will continue to invest in their network infrastructure as they take advantage of what many expect to be a multi-fold increase in mobile data usage between now and 2020. Specifically, we believe our runway of growth is supported by the amount of spectrum that is expected to be deployed over the next several years including spectrum from last year's AWS-3 auction, the spectrum currently held by the carriers and other sues as DISH and FirstNet that have yet to be deployed and spectrum from future expected auction. Further out on the horizon, we expect the deployment of 5G will drive growth on both our tower and small cell assets as the carriers look to densify their networks to provide the coverage, capacity and speed needed to support mobile video, the Internet of Things, fixed wireless broadband and other developing used cases. 
Given these expected developments, and consistent with carrier commentary, we expect the carriers to continue to invest over the long term to maintain and improve network quality. As the leading U.S. provider of towers and small cells, we have the opportunity to lease our assets and capture significant organic growth by providing the wireless carriers with a comprehensive offering of wireless infrastructure solutions. 
In addition to the organic growth we see in our business, we have also had a tremendous opportunity to invest capital to drive attractive returns, which is the third key area I would like to focus on. From a capital allocation standpoint, we are particularly excited about the small cell opportunities that we see ahead of us. Because small cells are deployed closer to the end-user and in more dense array such as on traffic lights or telephone poles, they represent the natural progression of network densification acquired to provide continuous, consistent high capacity and low-latency connectivity. This is important as consumers are increasingly looking to utilize their wireless devices for high usage application including on-demand video, virtual reality and the Internet of Things. As these demands continue to increase, wireless carriers are increasingly turning to small cells to provide wireless connectivity across urban and suburban geographies, where [indiscernible] are not available or cannot solve the network needs alone. 
To get a better understanding of how we think about the small cell investments, we would encourage you to think of fiber as a tower. Fiber is the critical shareable element in small cells, much as the tower structure is the shareable element in macro sites. Similar to towers, the majority of the capital for small cells is invested initially with the first wireless carrier deployment. This initial investment relates primarily to the buildout of fiber. And again similar to towers, we expect to increase the yields on our investments over time by co-locating additional carrier customers on the fiber we constructed for the first carrier. We are seeing this increase in yield from small cells play out at the pace we expected. Importantly, in both our tower and small cell businesses, this model is constructing an asset that can be utilized by multiple carriers and other customers, reduces the cost for our customers compared to what they would otherwise have to spend to build the assets for themselves. We believe our fiber footprint of 17,000 miles in top metro markets, combined with the capabilities that we have acquired and developed over time, give us time to market and economic advantages that should allow us to capture a significant share of this large opportunity. 
Finally, the last aspect I wanted to address is how we think about financing our business. Our revenues are primarily derived from long-term leases that deliver a stable growing and high-quality cash flow string, which is the underpinning of our dividends to shareholders. And our investment in small cells represents a significant growth opportunity to further enhance our long-term dividend growth. Against this backdrop, our goal is to match the quality of our business with a strong balance sheet. We believe that maintaining an investment grade balance sheet provides us with access to a deep, stable and low cost of capital, reducing risk to our cash flows and providing us with increased flexibility to pursue potential investment opportunities that we believe will increase our dividends in the future. 
In summary, how we operate, manage and finance our business is focused around growing the dividend. I believe that increasing our dividend consistently over time is the best way to create value for our shareholders. Given the leasing potential of our portfolio of assets, the long runway of expected network activity and our opportunities to invest capital at attractive returns, I believe we are well positioned to do just that, by delivering upon our stated goal of growing dividends per share at 6% to 7% annually over the next 7 -- several years. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Dan to discuss our financial results for the quarter"

When I joined the company, I was enthusiastic and optimistic about the business, the company and the people. As I've spent time meeting with employees, learning about the industry and developing an appreciation for how the company operates, all of my expectations have been exceeded. As I have learned more, I'm starting to really understand how the combination of steady high-quality cash flows, secular growth trends and Crown's solid execution is a hard one to beat. What I did not realize is how talented and genuinely nice the people who work here. So I want to thank everyone who's made my transition so smooth. It truly is a great place and I appreciate the opportunity to be a part of it. 
With that, I'll now turn to discussing our second quarter. As Jay mentioned, we delivered another strong quarter of financial results, meeting or exceeding the midpoint of our previously provided quarterly outlook. In addition, through the solid first half results we have generated, combined with what we believe will continue to be a steady leasing environment, we have raised our full year 2016 outlook. 
Turning to second quarter results on Slide 4. Site rental revenues grew 9% [ph] year-over-year from $737 million to $805 million inclusive of approximately 7% growth derived from organic contribution to site rental revenues. The 7% or $49 million growth from organic contribution of site rental revenues consist of approximately 9.5% growth from new leasing activity and cash escalations net of approximately 2.5% from tenant nonrenewals. 
Going to Slide 5. Our second quarter results for site rental gross margin, adjusted EBITDA, AFFO and AFFO per share each met or exceeded the midpoint of our previously provided second quarter 2016 outlook reflecting the overall healthy leasing environment. 
Moving on to investment activities. During the second quarter, we invested approximately $200 million in capital expenditures, of which $19 million were sustaining capital expenditures and $180 million were discretionary investments. Included in these discretionary investments is approximately $19 million of land purchases we completed to further strengthen our control on the ground beneath our towers. Today, nearly 80% of our site rental gross margin generated from towers is on land we own or control for more than 20 years. Additionally, the average term remaining on our ground leases is over 30 years. The proactive approach we take to managing the ground beneath our towers is core to our focus of producing stable growing high-quality cash flows. 
The balance of our discretionary investments was in revenue-regenerating capital expenditures that we believe strengthen our portfolio of assets, extended our leadership position in shared wireless infrastructure and enhanced our ability to deliver strong long-term growth in dividends per share. 
Moving on to financing activity. During the quarter, we continue to proactively manage our balance sheet while returning significant capital to our shareholders through our quarterly common stock dividend of $0.885 per share which was 8% higher than in the same period of 2015. As part of our balance sheet management, in April, we issued $1 billion of unsecured notes to refinance debt maturities coming due in 2017 in borrowings under our credit facilities. This offering represented the culmination of our long-standing goal of reaching an investment-grade credit rating at each of the 3 major rating agencies. We believe this credit profile underscores the stability and quality of our long-term cash flows and it lowers our overall cost of capital which we believe is an advantage in our business of providing a shared wireless infrastructure. Following this offering, the only debt maturity we have prior to 2020 is a $500 million tranche of notes due at the end of 2017. 
Shifting to full year 2016 outlook on Slide 6. We have increased the midpoint of our guidance by $3 million for site rental revenues, $3 million for site rental gross margin, $9 million for adjusted EBITDA and $7 million for AFFO. Our AFFO per share basis compared to 2015, our updated midpoint for full year 2016 outlook of $4.71 represents an increase of approximately 10%. The increase in our full year outlook reflects the strong results from the first half of the year, our expectations at the level of leasing activity from our carrier customers will remain steady, and the increase in expected contribution from network services gross margin for the remainder of the year and the timing benefit related to tenant nonrenewals occurring later than previously expected. It is important to note that our expectations for tenant nonrenewals associated with the decommissioning of portions of the Clearwire, Metro PCS and lead networks remain unchanged in the aggregate. Looking beyond 2016, we believe we are in a multi-year cycle of network upgrades and enhancements as carriers focus on meeting significantly increasing demand for wireless connectivity which we believe will benefit both our tower and small cell businesses. Given this backdrop, and combined with our leading portfolio of wireless infrastructure across both towers and small cells, we believe that we are well positioned to achieve our stated long-term goal of delivering compound annual growth of 6% to 7% in AFFO and dividends per share. 
With that Vicky, I'd like to open the call up to questions."

I'm assuming it has mostly to do with your inclusion of the small cell revenues in the organic growth number. But if you could kind of map that out for us, it would be helpful. And then second, Jay, I'm sure you know that there's a big conversation out there about the AT&T tower RFP, comments from T-Mobile about trying to find ""competitors"" for towers that are getting too expensive. Could you kind of opine a little bit about that RFP and talk a little bit about your portfolio in terms of what you might sense as the percentage of towers that have a combination of expiring leases and very expensive leases coming up for renewal where there might be substitutes near you? It's a topic we're addressing in and it would be great to hear your thoughts on it."

We're not going to get into, obviously, specific conversations that we're having with each of the carriers. But as we look at the business, we haven't seen the dynamic change from what it's been like in a long period of time. The towers that we provide to the wireless operators provide them with a very cost-effective solution. And over time, obviously, tower rents have escalated. But the main cost of that escalation is the underlying cost of that asset, and we've done a good job over a long period of time of extending ground leases, as Dan mentioned in his comments, and investing capital there in order to own the ground underneath those assets. And unlike any other real estate asset over time, there's an appreciation in that overall cost. And so we feel comfortable about where we are positioned relative to all of the carriers and the provision of where rent is relative to the space that they're using and the underlying cost of the asset. And while this topic I think over the last 6 to 9 months has maybe gotten more conversational than when it has over the last couple of years, it's not really a new conversation. We've had this conversation all the way dating back to kind of the 1999 period and it comes up from time to time. And the value equation and the provision of that value to the carriers today is about a 2.5% to 3% cost of lease against the overall cost of the asset. And we believe that's a very attractive cost provision as we share the asset across multiple carriers and that provides them with a really low cost alternative, and frankly, we don't see that -- the pricing dynamic in the business or the overall structure or arrangements that we have with the carriers, we just don't see that changing."

And so the early part of the year here in this year looks like there's more growth. And as the activity is again a little back-end loaded this year, we won't see that until '17.

Thanks for the question. On the first question around the leasing environment, we're expecting, as we have been through the course of the whole year, about $170 million of revenue growth, organic revenue growth comprised of about $115 million on the tower side and then about $55 million of growth on the small cell side. That was really our expectation going into calendar year '16 and it's held throughout the year, and we see that holding through the balance of the year which is why our expectation is unchanged. That is very similar to the long-term expectation that we have in the business that underwrite or underpins our 6% to 7% dividend growth in the comments that I made. So we view that as a very healthy environment. We're seeing activity across the spectrum from  the carriers on both small cells and towers and feel good about what that's going to look like for the balance of the year. On your second question, this is certainly gotten some play I think in the [indiscernible] recently around some of the difficulties of sighting small cells as you referenced. And our experience has been that they are difficult to sight and to locate. And in essence, that underpins the big component of what we think about the business. So one would say the same thing about towers, about how difficult they are to get sited and put into municipalities, the great barrier to entry. And as we look at small cell, we will say the same thing about small cells that they are operationally difficult in terms of moving through municipalities and local restrictions around planning and zoning. They take a long time to do. Generally, our experience has been 18- to 24-month process in order to work through that. And on top of that, it's very challenging from an RF design standpoint. So it takes an enormous amount of skill and expertise in order to deploy these. And both the combination of the high barrier to entry that's created by the local municipality as well as the operational expertise required in order to navigate both the RF side as well as the municipalities we think is core strength for us and is supported of the business long term. And frankly, the more difficult it is, we think it really separates us from our competitors and shows how skillful the team really is. So we are seeing it but I wouldn't fully describe it as worse than what it's been in the past. And frankly, I think it's supportive of the value of the business."

I would point out and there has been in a number of questions over the last couple of years around items that have been things that such as pay and walk fees and other things that we have benefited our services business. Our expectation of growth here is really what we would describe as core services related to installing tenants on the towers or doing amendments and that's what's driving our increased expectation in the back half of the year."

By way of example, if you will dock the business, and look at what would it in kind of the 1999, 2000 era, we were building 1,000 to 2,000 towers a year back then because the returns were attractive to the business relative to the cost of capital and what we thought we could drive in terms of shareholder value. Today, we build less than 50 on an annual basis. And the reason for that is because we just don't see the incremental returns as high enough. So if you roll this forward, I would certainly hold out the possibility that there would be competitors in the space and that there would be a change in the pricing environment. And if the returns weren't attractive to us, then we would stop making investments as we're making them. We haven't seen that. To be clear, though, today, what we're seeing very attractive returns and an opportunity to invest capital that we think will further our growth rate over time. And similar to the comment that I made about building towers or building new fiber, the assets that we already have today we would expect over the long period of time to continue to see lease up, which will drive those incremental yields and incremental returns. So I think it's really [indiscernible] we're choosing today to invest in and build immature assets because we believe there will be an environment over time that will fill those assets up and increase the yield over time. And then as we get in the future periods, frankly, we'll just have to make the right capital allocation decision and ensure all along the way that every time we make the investment, we're doing so because we believe that we'll increase our dividend growth over the long term."

And at this point, as we're talking about guiding and thinking about our expectation of investment, we really don't see that at the current level, but there may be opportunities in the future that would lead to that. And again, I would point you back to how the discipline that we've shown over a long period of time that we would expect to show in the future as we look at those investments. There are obviously opportunities that would make sense to pursue and they include some equity associated with it. But you can be sure if that were the case, we're looking at this on a real cost of capital associated with that and then going back to does it really at the end of the day drive the dividend. Now one thing I would point out is don't miss the gross margin EBITDA that we got generating the business. And then the aim here is to run the balance sheet at about 5x debt to EBITDA. And so over time, we're creating leverage capacity even as we go towards our target of 5x debt to EBITDA. And at this point, we think that's sufficient to cover the investment that we're making in small cells as well as covering the dividend. We see that maybe real quick look at just look at the cash flow statement. For 6 months, we've got about $900 million of cash flow from operations, $600 million of dividends and we've got about $392 million of CapEx. So there's about 200 -- year-to-date there's about $90 million, $92 million or so of CapEx that [indiscernible] of the cash flow.

It was $170 million in our prior outlook and it's $170 million now. I think one of the things that we're noticing is we give ranges with these things, which is the approximation we put in those charts. And I guess they'd be too precise. And so I would not extrapolate that to say that our new leasing activity is any different. As Jay pointed out, it's what we thought it was it going to be at the beginning of the year that's held through this year, 115 from towers and 55 from small cell. And then in terms of the small cell gross margins, those will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter. But generally, what we see is that we look at this more like Jay was talking about the returns that we get in these projects and kind of the overall margins we get may fluctuate depending on how the deal is structured and what happens and when things come on. So it's not going to fluctuate terribly from where it is now, but I wouldn't focus on that sa the driver how do we think about the incremental investment in these projects."

And our expectation would be that as we go through the balance of this year and into '17, it's going to continue to be a component that's embedded in our $170 million of increased leasing activity that we would expect. 5G, it's important I think whenever we talk about kind of longer term what we think the growth rate in the business, the thing that we like to point out to investors around future opportunities is the level of activity that we see from the carriers over a long period of time is inside of a relatively close band of activity. And so we will look at 5G, for instance, or additional spectrum that we think we'll get auctioned off for FirstNet and we would look at all of those opportunities as likely to extend the runway of growth in the business. And so at the moment or in the near term, we may see more benefit from an AWS-3 like deployment or additional carriers being added across the towers for various reasons and today. And then over the longer term, we would look at it and say, we will probably see activity from things like the deployment of 5G and FirstNet and other spectrum that's not currently being used by the carriers. So I would describe that as extending the runway of growth is probably the best way to think about it."

That remains to be the case today. And then over time, we have a couple of things happen. The case study we talked about last time on the call I think are instructive and helpful there. In both cases, we saw a couple of things happen. One is that over time we see the initial carrier come back and add additional nodes across a given geography of fiber and in essence increases the density. And that looks if you're making a comparison to the tower model, that looks like an amendment to the base business where that first tenant, the yield associated with that first tenant in essence increases the cost of fiber. The second thing that we see is that as additional carriers come, they co-locate on the fiber that we built for the first carrier. And then they also at times want to extend the fiber into new places. We describe that typically as laterals across that base system. And so as we have co-locations over time it's a combination of extending the plant as well as co-locating in the same -- across the same fiber that was built for that initial tenant. And generally speaking, we find the yield this [indiscernible] co-location, we find the yield as we move into the second tenant into the team and then as we get to the third tenant as we showed you last quarter we'll be plus 20% off in time [indiscernible] by the time we get to the third tenant. Some of that mix depends on how many co-locations go there, the density with which they go across a given geography of fiber and then how many laterals do we put in, are we extending the fiber mix. Really the value proposition there as we think about it to the carriers is that the shared infrastructure just like we do with towers and then provide a very cost effective way for them to deploy across that fiber. And then once the fiber is in the ground, it becomes a speed to market advantage that we have because we're able to install them on the fiber that we've already deployed for the first carrier."

Some have really seen the dynamics of that change in the market over the last couple of years. Big picture today, we're probably somewhere in the neighborhood of about half of the activity that gets put out by the carriers. We're winning about half of that business. The pie is growing quickly as multiple providers are now focused on this. But the ballpark, I would tell you, we're about 50% of the market. The other 50% would be a combination of self performed by the carriers and then other providers winning [indiscernible] RFPs. And we obviously don't have to have a 50% win rate in order for the business to be interesting to us. It's really around where we have infrastructure and what's the incremental returns from there. Again, back to the earlier conversation, which I think is very important, as we think about this business and compare it to towers is, we believe that a shared solution is the lowest cost solution for the carriers. And we provide that solution for the carriers that have costs lower than what they can do themselves. A combination of that is our own low-cost access to capital which we have the expertise which we have so we can get it done faster and more cost effectively just in terms of the cost of the deployment. And then by sharing it with multiple parties, the entire return and justification for that investment doesn't have to be driven by one carrier. And that model has held out very well in towers and we see the same dynamics in small cells and believe it will continue."

I think best case scenario, this is the late 2017, early 2018 before it starts to affect our revenues based on all the public commentary. But I frankly don't have any insight based on -- or beyond what you would read. And now I think we continue to believe that over time, there will be a First Responder Network that's constructed, whether that's at the federal level or at the local level. The legacy systems are aging and there's a real need for it, and that we believe the deployment of that system and any of the constructs that are currently being talked about and are possibilities, any of those constructs would be good for the tower industry and for us particularly. On the second question, cost did tick up a little bit sequentially there in small cells. And I think when you get to that level of granularity, I wouldn't necessarily point to anything that's indicative of what's going on in the business, which you're going to find over time, as we build new anchor systems and there's mix of anchor and co-locations, you may see a little bit of volatility up and down sort of quarter-to-quarter. But in total, the economics in there are as we expected. On the G&A comment, I will go back to my prior bigger picture comments. First quarter G&A looks to us like it's going to be the run rate for the balance of the year, and we're not seeing really any meaningful movements there. Back to the more bigger picture comments that were asked around what the opportunity is around small cells, obviously, if we were to find more opportunity to ramp up the investment that we're making in that space, then we would need to increase the G&A. But that G&A would come with returns that we've seen in the past. So it will be a faction of the activity that we see and the opportunity to invest capital. 
So with that, maybe I'll wrap up the call. Thank you, everyone, for joining this morning. As you heard on the call, the story is the same as it's been for a long period of time.

As you saw from our earnings release last night, we had another quarter of great performance, meaning, we're exceeding the midpoint of our previously provided second quarter outlook and allowing us to increase our full year 2016 outlook. The results reflect our continued focus on creating shareholder value through solid execution, disciplined capital allocation and strong balance sheet management, all of which positions us to achieve our goal of delivering long-term annual dividend growth of 6% to 7%. 
What I'd like to do this morning in my prepared remarks is spend just a few minutes providing a bit more detail on each of the key focus areas that underpin our ability to drive our 6% to 7% per year dividend growth and then hand the call over to Dan to talk about our financial results for the quarter. 
The first point I'll touch on is our long-term track record of execution. We have a highly motivated very talented team of people who are dedicated to delivering strong results. They have developed the systems and processes necessary to operate and manage our business to generate strong cash flow through a variety of business cycles. Additionally, we've been able to grow through both organically and acquisitions, including integrating those acquisitions effectively. This solid execution has resulted in very good financial performance. Since 2007, we have grown AFFO per share from $1.33 to our current expectation of $4.71 for the full year 2016, representing 15% compounded annual growth per share. Additionally, since 2014, we have returned approximately $7 per share in dividends, further enhancing the returns for our shareholders. The combination of our track record of execution, the quality of the portfolio of assets that we have accumulated, the secular tailwinds of increasing demand for wireless connectivity and the strength of our business model position us to -- well to capitalize on the positive industry trends we are seeing coming our way, which is the second topic I want to highlight. 
As we look to the future, we believe wireless carriers will continue to invest in their network infrastructure as they take advantage of what many expect to be a multi-fold increase in mobile data usage between now and 2020. Specifically, we believe our runway of growth is supported by the amount of spectrum that is expected to be deployed over the next several years, including spectrum from last year's AWS-3 auction, the spectrum currently held by the carriers and other sues as DISH and FirstNet that have yet to be deployed and spectrum from future expected auction. 
Further out on the horizon, we expect the deployment of 5G will drive growth on both our tower and small cell assets as the carriers look to densify their networks to provide the coverage, capacity and speed needed to support mobile video, the Internet of Things, fixed wireless broadband and other developing used cases. 
Given these expected developments, and consistent with carrier commentary, we expect the carriers to continue to invest over the long term to maintain and improve network quality. As the leading U.S. provider of towers and small cells, we have the opportunity to lease our assets and capture significant organic growth by providing the wireless carriers with a comprehensive offering of wireless infrastructure solutions. 
In addition to the organic growth we see in our business, we have also had a tremendous opportunity to invest capital to drive attractive returns, which is the third key area I would like to focus on. 
From a capital allocation standpoint, we are particularly excited about the small cell opportunities that we see ahead of us. Because small cells are deployed closer to the end-user and in more dense array, such as on traffic lights or telephone poles, they represent the natural progression of network densification required to provide continuous, consistent high capacity and low-latency connectivity. This is important as consumers are increasingly looking to utilize their wireless devices for high usage application including on-demand video, virtual reality and the Internet of Things. As these demands continue to increase, wireless carriers are increasingly turning to small cells to provide wireless connectivity across urban and suburban geographies, where towers are not available or cannot solve the network needs alone. 
To get a better understanding of how we think about the small cell investments, we would encourage you to think of fiber as a top -- as a tower. Fiber is the critical shareable element in small cells. Much of the tower structure is the shareable element in macro sites. Similar to towers, the majority of the capital for small cells is invested initially with the first wireless carrier deployment. This initial investment relates primarily to the buildout of fiber. And again, similar to towers, we expect to increase the yields on our investments over time by co-locating additional carrier customers on the fiber we constructed for the first carrier. We are seeing this increase in yield from small cells play out at the pace we expected. 
Importantly, in both our tower and small cell businesses, this model is constructing an asset that can be utilized by multiple carriers and other customers, reduces the cost for our customers compared to what they would otherwise have to spend to build the assets for themselves. We believe our fiber footprint of 17,000 miles in top metro markets, combined with the capabilities that we have acquired and developed over time, give us time to market and economic advantages that should allow us to capture a significant share of this large opportunity. 
Finally, the last aspect I wanted to address is how we think about financing our business. Our revenues are primarily derived from long-term leases that deliver a stable, growing and high-quality cash flow stream, which is the underpinning of our dividends to shareholders. And our investment in small cells represents a significant growth opportunity to further enhance our long-term dividend growth. Against this backdrop, our goal is to match the quality of our business with a strong balance sheet. We believe that maintaining an investment grade balance sheet provides us with access to a deep, stable and low cost of capital, reducing risk to our cash flows and providing us with increased flexibility to pursue potential investment opportunities that we believe will increase our dividends in the future. 
In summary, how we operate, manage and finance our business is focused around growing the dividend. I believe that increasing our dividend consistently over time is the best way to create value for our shareholders. Given the leasing potential of our portfolio of assets, the long runway of expected network activity and our opportunities to invest capital at attractive returns, I believe we are well positioned to do just that by delivering upon our stated goal of growing dividends per share, 6% to 7% annually, over the next 7 -- several years. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Dan to discuss our financial results for the quarter"

(REIT), Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 22, 2016",2016-07-22,"Earnings Calls","Crown Castle Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jay, and good morning, everyone. Before I get our results, I wanted to talk briefly about my first few months at Crown. When I joined the company, I was enthusiastic and optimistic about the business, the company and the people. As I've spent time",884,"Thanks, Jay, and good morning, everyone. Before I get our results, I wanted to talk briefly about my first few months at Crown. When I joined the company, I was enthusiastic and optimistic about the business, the company and the people. As I've spent time meeting with employees, learning about the industry and developing an appreciation for how the company operates, all of my expectations have been exceeded. As I have learned more, I'm starting to really understand how the combination of steady, high-quality cash flows, secular growth trends, and Crown's solid execution is a hard one to beat. What I did not realize is how talented and genuinely nice the people who work here. So I want to thank everyone who's made my transition so smooth. It truly is a great place, and I appreciate the opportunity to be a part of it. 
With that, I'll now turn to discussing our second quarter. As Jay mentioned, we delivered another strong quarter of financial results, meeting or exceeding the midpoint of our previously provided quarterly outlook. In addition, through the solid first half results we have generated, combined with what we believe will continue to be a steady leasing environment, we have raised our full year 2016 outlook. 
Turning to second quarter results on Slide 4. Site rental revenues grew 9% year-over-year from $737 million to $805 million, inclusive of approximately 7% growth derived from organic contribution to site rental revenues. The 7% or $49 million growth from organic contribution of site rental revenues consist of approximately 9.5% growth from new leasing activity and cash escalations net of approximately 2.5% from tenant nonrenewals. 
Moving to Slide 5. Our second quarter results for site rental gross margin, adjusted EBITDA, AFFO and AFFO per share each met or exceeded the midpoint of our previously provided second quarter 2016 outlook, reflecting the overall healthy leasing environment. 
Moving on to investment activities. During the second quarter, we invested approximately $200 million in capital expenditures, of which $19 million were sustaining capital expenditures and $180 million were discretionary investments. Included in these discretionary investments is approximately $19 million of land purchases we completed to further strengthen our control of the ground beneath our towers. 
Today, nearly 80% of our site rental gross margin generated from towers is on land we own or control for more than 20 years. Additionally, the average term remaining on our ground leases is over 30 years. The proactive approach we take to managing the ground beneath our towers is core to our focus of producing stable, growing, high-quality cash flows. 
The balance of our discretionary investments was in revenue-regenerating capital expenditures that we believe strengthen our portfolio of assets, extended our leadership position in shared wireless infrastructure and enhanced our ability to deliver strong long-term growth in dividends per share. 
Moving on to financing activities. During the quarter, we continue to proactively manage our balance sheet while returning significant capital to our shareholders through our quarterly common stock dividend of $0.885 per share, which was 8% higher than in the same period of 2015. As part of our balance sheet management, in April, we issued $1 billion of unsecured notes to refinance debt maturities coming due in 2017 in borrowings under our credit facilities. This offering represented the culmination of our long-standing goal of reaching an investment-grade credit rating at each of the 3 major rating agencies. We believe this credit profile underscores the stability and quality of our long-term cash flows, and it lowers our overall cost of capital, which we believe is an advantage in our business of providing shared wireless infrastructure. Following this offering, the only debt maturity we have prior to 2020 is a $500 million tranche of notes due at the end of 2017. 
Shifting to full year 2016 outlook on Slide 6. We have increased the midpoint of our guidance by $3 million for site rental revenues, $3 million for site rental gross margin, $9 million for adjusted EBITDA and $7 million for AFFO. Our AFFO per share basis compared to 2015, our updated midpoint for full year 2016 outlook of $4.71 represents an increase of approximately 10%. The increase in our full year outlook reflects the strong results from the first half of the year, our expectations at the level of leasing activity from our carrier customers will remain steady, and the increase in expected contribution from network services gross margin for the remainder of the year and the timing benefit related to tenant nonrenewals occurring later than previously expected. It is important to note that our expectations for tenant nonrenewals associated with the decommissioning of portions of the Clearwire, Metro PCS and lead networks remain unchanged in the aggregate. Looking beyond 2016, we believe we are in a multiyear cycle of network upgrades and enhancements as carriers focus on meeting significantly increasing demand for wireless connectivity, which we believe will benefit both our tower and small cell businesses. 
Given this backdrop, and combined with our leading portfolio of wireless infrastructure across both towers and small cells, we believe that we are well positioned to achieve our stated long-term goal of delivering compound annual growth of 6% to 7% in AFFO and dividends per share. 
With that, Vicky, I'd like to open the call up to questions."

I'm assuming it has mostly to do with your inclusion of the small cell revenues in the organic growth number. But if you could kind of map that out for us, it would be helpful. 
And then second, Jay, I'm sure you know that there's a big conversation out there about the AT&T tower RFP, comments from T-Mobile about trying to find ""competitors"" for towers that are getting too expensive. Could you kind of opine a little bit about that RFP and talk a little bit about your portfolio in terms of what you might sense as the percentage of towers that have a combination of expiring leases and very expensive leases coming up for renewal where there might be substitutes near you? It's a topic we're addressing and it would be great to hear your thoughts on it."

Maybe I'll take the second question first, and then Dave -- Dan can go through the first question there. We're not going to get into, obviously, specific conversations that we're having with each of the carriers. But as we look at the business, we haven't seen the dynamic change from what it's been like in a long period of time. The towers that we provide to the wireless operators provide them with a very cost-effective solution. And over time, obviously, tower rents have escalated. But the main cost of that escalation is the underlying cost of that asset, and we have done a good job over a long period of time of extending ground leases, as Dan mentioned in his comments, and investing capital there in order to own the ground underneath those assets. And like any other real estate asset over time, there's an appreciation in that overall cost. And so we feel comfortable about where we are positioned relative to the all of the carriers and the provision of where rent is relative to the space that they're using and the underlying cost of the asset. And while this topic, I think, over the last 6 to 9 months has maybe gotten more conversation than what it has over the last couple of years, it's not really a new conversation. And we've had this conversation all the way dating back to kind of the 1999 period, and it comes up from time to time. And the value equation and the provision of that value to the carriers today is about a 2.5% to 3% cost of lease against the overall cost of the asset. And we believe that's a very attractive cost position as we share the asset across multiple carriers, and that provides them with a really low-cost alternative. And frankly, we don't see that -- the pricing dynamic in the business or the overall structure or arrangements that we have with the carriers, we just don't see that changing."

And so the early part of the year here this year looks like there's more growth. And as the activity is again a little back half -- back-end loaded this year, we won't see that until '17. And we really think of it as a year-over-year basis as opposed to quarter-over-quarter. So the way I would say it is it depends on when the timing of the activity comes in but it's really more of a quarter-to-quarter anomaly more than anything else.

Thanks for the questions. On the first question around the leasing environment, we're expecting, as we have been through the course of the whole year, about $170 million of revenue growth, organic revenue growth comprised of about $115 million on the tower side and then about $55 million growth on the small cell side, that was really our expectation going into the calendar year '16, and it's held throughout the year, and we see that holding through the balance of the year, which is why our expectation is unchanged. That is very similar to the long-term expectation that we have in the business that underwrites or underpins our 6% to 7% dividend growth in the comments that I made. So we view that as a very healthy environment. We're seeing activity across the spectrum from the carriers on both small cells and towers and feel good about what that's going to look like for the balance of the year. 
On your second question, that's -- this has certainly gotten some play, I think, in the news recently around some of the difficulties of sighting small cells, as you referenced. And our experience has been that they are difficult to sight and to locate. And in essence, that underpins a big component of what we think about the business. So one would say the same thing about towers, about how difficult they are to get sited and to get -- put into municipalities, the great barrier to entry. And as we look at small cells, we would say the same thing about small cells that they are operationally difficult in terms of moving through municipalities and local restrictions around planning and zoning. They take a long time to do. Generally, our experience has been that it's an 18- to 24-month process in order to work through that. And on top of that, it's very challenging from an RF design standpoint. So it takes an enormous amount of skill and expertise in order to deploy these. And both the combination of the high barrier to entry that's created by the local municipality as well as the operational expertise required in order to navigate both the RF side as well as the municipalities, we think, is core strength for us and is supported by the business long term. And frankly, the more difficult it is, we think it really separates us from our competitors and shows how skillful the team really is. So we are seeing it, but I wouldn't necessarily describe it as worse than what it's been in the past. And frankly, I think it's supported by the value of the business."

In the macro business, which is really the more relevant component given how small, small cells is in services, we have seen and, as reflected in our expectation for the balance of the year, we're assuming a bit higher capture rate on activity in the back half of the year than what we had previously expected.

And there's -- we're not undertaking any obligation, or we're not signing up for capital investment in an environment that, in later years, may have lower returns on it than what they do today. By way of example, if you will dock the business and look at what would it in kind of the 1999, 2000 era, we were building 1,000 to 2,000 towers a year back then because the returns were attractive to the business relative to the cost of capital and what we thought we could drive in terms of shareholder value. Today, we build less than 50 on an annual basis. And the reason for that is because we just don't see the incremental returns as high enough. 
So if you roll this forward, I would certainly hold out the possibility that there would be competitors in the space and that there would be a change in the pricing environment. And if the returns weren't attractive to us, then we would stop making investments as we're making them. We haven't seen that, to be clear, though. Today, what we're seeing is very attractive returns and an opportunity to invest capital that we think will further our growth rate over time. 
And similar to the comments that I made about building towers or building new fiber, the assets that we already have today, we would expect, over the long period of time, to continue to see lease-up, which will drive those incremental yields and incremental returns. 
So I think of it really as, we're choosing today to invest in and build immature assets because we believe there will be an environment over time that will fill those assets up and increase the yield over time. And then as we get into future periods, frankly, we'll just have to make the right capital allocation decision and ensure all along the way that every time we make the investment, we're doing so because we believe it will increase our dividend growth over the long term."

And at this point, as we're talking about guiding and thinking about our expectation of investment, we really don't see that at the current level, but there may be opportunities in the future that would lead to that. And again, I would point you back to how the discipline that we've shown over a long period of time and would expect to show in the future as we look at those investments. There are obviously opportunities that would make sense to pursue, and they include some equity associated with it. But you can be sure if that were the case, we're looking at this on a real cost of capital associated with that and then going back to does it really, at the end of the day, drive the dividend. Now one thing I would point out is don't miss the growth in EBITDA that we've got generating in the business. And the aim here is to run the balance sheet at about 5x debt to EBITDA. And so over time, we're creating leverage capacity even as we go towards our target of 5 terms debt to EBITDA. And at this point, we think that's sufficient to cover the investment that we're making in small cells as well as covering the dividend. You can see that -- maybe a real quick look is just look at the cash flow statement. For 6 months, we've got about $900 million of cash flow from operations, $600 million of dividends and we've got about $392 million of CapEx. So there's about -- there's -- year-to-date, there's about $90 million, $92 million or so of CapEx in excess of the cash flow. Obviously, that's well within our ability to handle by drawing under the revolver given the growth in EBITDA."

So maybe a simple item would just be to take that 10%, make it 8% with the acquisition. And it very well may be that over time we find opportunities like that, that are attractive, accretive acquisitions, but we're not going to bake that into our base forecast."

It was $170 million in our prior outlook, and it's $170 million now. I think one of the things that we're noticing is we give ranges with these things, which is the approximations we put in those charts, and it gets to be too precise. And so I would not extrapolate that to say that our new leasing activity is any different. As Jay pointed out, it's what we thought it was going to be at the beginning of the year. It has held through this year, $115 million from towers and $55 million from small cells. And then in terms of the small cell gross margins, those will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter. But generally, what we see is that we look at this more like Jay was talking about on the returns that we get in these projects and the kind of the overall margins we get may fluctuate depending on how the deal is structured and what happens and when things come on. So it's probably not going to fluctuate terribly from where it is now, but I wouldn't focus on that as the driver of how we would think about the incremental investment in that -- in these projects."

The thing that we like to point out to investors around future opportunities is the level of activity that we've seen from the carriers over a long period of time is inside of a relatively close band of activity. And so we would look at 5G, for instance, or additional spectrum that we think will get auctioned off or for FirstNet, and we would look at all of those opportunities as likely to extend the runway of growth in the business. And so at the moment or in the near term, we may see more benefit from an AWS-3-like deployment or additional carriers being added across the towers for various reasons. And today and then over the longer term, we would look at it and say we will probably see activity from things like the deployment of 5G and FirstNet and other spectrum that's not currently being used by the carriers. So I would describe that as extending the runway of growth is probably the best way to think about it."

Most of the capital is invested up front as we build the fiber. That remains to be the case today. And then over time, you have a couple of things happen. The case studies we talked about last time on the call I think are instructive and helpful there. In both cases, we saw a couple of things happen. One is that, over time, we see the initial carrier come back and add additional nodes across a given geography of fiber that in essence increases the density. And that looks -- if you're making a comparison to the tower model, that looks like amendments to the base business where that first tenant, the yield associated with that first tenant, in essence, increases across the fiber. The second thing that we see is that as additional carriers come, they co-locate on the fiber that we built for the first carrier. And then they also, at times, want to extend the fiber into new places. We describe that typically as laterals across that base system. And so as we have co-locations over time, it's a combination of extending the plant as well as co-locating in the same -- across the same fiber that was built for that initial tenant. And generally speaking, we find the yield that's a pure co-location, we'll find the yield as we move into the second tenant into the team. And then as we get to the third tenant, as we showed you last quarter, we'll be plus 20% off in times by the time we get to the third tenant. Some of that mix depends on how many co-locations go there, the density with which they go across a given geography of fiber and then how many laterals do we put in, are we extending the fiber mix. So really, the value proposition there as we think about it to the carriers is that the shared infrastructure just like we do with towers, and it provides a very cost-effective ways for them to deploy across that fiber. And then once the fiber is in the ground, it becomes a speed-to-market advantage that we have because we're able to install them on the fiber that we've already deployed for the first carrier."

So haven't really seen the dynamics of that change in the market over the last couple of years. Big picture today, we're probably somewhere in the neighborhood of about half of the activity that gets put out by the carriers. We're winning about half of that business. The pie is growing quickly as multiple providers are now focused on this. So -- but the ballpark I would tell you, we're about 50% of the market. The other 50% would be a combination of self-performed by the carriers, and then other providers winning RFPs. And we obviously don't have to have a 50% win rate in order for this -- the business to be interesting to us. It's really around where do you have infrastructure and then what's the incremental returns from there. Again, back to the earlier conversation, which I think is really important, as we think about this business and compare it to towers is we believe that a shared solution is the lowest cost solution for the carriers. And we provide that solution for the carriers at a cost lower than what they could do themselves. A combination of that is our own low-cost of access to capital, which we have the expertise that we -- which we have, so we can get it done faster and more cost effectively just in terms of cost of the deployment. And then by sharing it with multiple party, the entire return and justification for that investment doesn't have to be driven by one carrier. And that model has held out very well in towers and we see the same dynamics in small cells and believe it will continue."

I think best-case scenario, this is the late 2017, early 2018 before it starts to affect our revenues based on all of the public commentary. But I frankly don't have any inside baseball beyond which you would read and know. I think we continue to believe that, over time, there will be a First Responder Network that's constructed, whether that's at the federal level or at the local level. The legacy systems are aging, and there's a real need for it. And that we believe the deployment of that system and any of the constructs that are currently being talked about and are possibilities, any of those constructs would be good for the tower industry and for us particularly. On the second question, cost did tick up a little bit sequentially there in small cells. And I think when you get to that level of granularity, I wouldn't necessarily point to anything that's indicative of what's going on in the business, which you're going to find over time as we build new anchor systems, and there's mix of anchor and co-locations. You may see a little bit of volatility up and down sort of quarter-to-quarter. But in total, the economics are hanging there as we expected. On the G&A comment, I would go back to my prior bigger-picture comments. First quarter G&A looks to us like it's going to be the run rate for the balance of the year, and we're not seeing really any meaningful movements there. Back to the more bigger-picture comments that were asked around what the opportunity is around small cells, obviously if we were to find more opportunities or ramp up the investment that we're making in that space, then we would need to increase the G&A. But that G&A would come with returns that we've seen in the past. So it will be a function of the activity that we see and the opportunity to invest capital. 
So with that, maybe I'll wrap up the call. Thank you, everyone, for joining this morning. As you heard on the call, the story is the same as it's been for a long period of time. We're focused on growing cash flows in the business and growing the dividend, and we'll get back to work and look forward to talking to you next quarter about the results. Talk to you soon."

As you saw from our earnings release last night, we had another quarter of great performance, meeting or exceeding the midpoint of our previously provided second quarter outlook and allowing us to increase our full year 2016 outlook. The results reflect our continued focus on creating shareholder value through solid execution, disciplined capital allocation and strong balance sheet management, all of which positions us to achieve our goal of delivering long-term annual dividend growth of 6% to 7%. 
What I'd like to do this morning in my prepared remarks is spend just a few minutes providing a bit more detail on each of the key focus areas that underpin our ability to drive our 6% to 7% per year dividend growth and then hand the call over to Dan to talk about our financial results for the quarter. 
The first point I'll touch on is our long-term track record of execution. We have a highly motivated very talented team of people who are dedicated to delivering strong results. They have developed the systems and processes necessary to operate and manage our business to generate strong cash flow through a variety of business cycles. Additionally, we've been able to grow through both organically and acquisitions, including integrating those acquisitions effectively. This solid execution has resulted in very good financial performance. Since 2007, we have grown AFFO per share from $1.33 to our current expectation of $4.71 for the full year 2016, representing 15% compounded annual growth per share. Additionally, since 2014, we have returned approximately $7 per share in dividends, further enhancing the returns for our shareholders. The combination of our track record of execution, the quality of the portfolio of assets that we have accumulated, the secular tailwinds of increasing demand for wireless connectivity and the strength of our business model position us to -- well to capitalize on the positive industry trends we are seeing coming our way, which is the second topic I want to highlight. 
As we look to the future, we believe wireless carriers will continue to invest in their network infrastructure as they take advantage of what many expect to be a multi-fold increase in mobile data usage between now and 2020. Specifically, we believe our runway of growth is supported by the amount of spectrum that is expected to be deployed over the next several years, including spectrum from last year's AWS-3 auction, the spectrum currently held by the carriers and other sues as DISH and FirstNet that have yet to be deployed and spectrum from future expected auctions. 
Further out on the horizon, we expect the deployment of 5G will drive growth on both our tower and small cell assets as the carriers look to densify their networks to provide the coverage, capacity and speed needed to support mobile video, the Internet of Things, fixed wireless broadband and other developing use cases. 
Given these expected developments, and consistent with carrier commentary, we expect the carriers to continue to invest over the long term to maintain and improve network quality. As the leading U.S. provider of towers and small cells, we have the opportunity to lease our assets and capture significant organic growth by providing the wireless carriers with a comprehensive offering of wireless infrastructure solutions. 
In addition to the organic growth we see in our business, we have also had a tremendous opportunity to invest capital to drive attractive returns, which is the third key area I would like to focus on. 
From a capital allocation standpoint, we are particularly excited about the small cell opportunities that we see ahead of us. Because small cells are deployed closer to the end-user and in more dense arrays, such as on traffic lights or telephone poles, they represent the natural progression of network densification required to provide continuous, consistent high capacity and low-latency connectivity. This is important as consumers are increasingly looking to utilize their wireless devices for high usage application including on-demand video, virtual reality and the Internet of Things. As these demands continue to increase, wireless carriers are increasingly turning to small cells to provide wireless connectivity across urban and suburban geographies, where towers are not available or cannot solve the network needs alone. 
To get a better understanding of how we think about the small cell investments, we would encourage you to think of fiber as a top -- as a tower. Fiber is the critical shareable element in small cells. Much of the tower structure is the shareable element in macro sites. Similar to towers, the majority of the capital for small cells is invested initially with the first wireless carrier deployment. This initial investment relates primarily to the buildout of fiber. And again, similar to towers, we expect to increase the yields on our investments over time by co-locating additional carrier customers on the fiber we constructed for the first carrier. We are seeing this increase in yield from small cells play out at the pace we expected. 
Importantly, in both our tower and small cell businesses, this model is constructing an asset that can be utilized by multiple carriers and other customers, reduces the cost for our customers compared to what they would otherwise have to spend to build the assets for themselves. We believe our fiber footprint of 17,000 miles in top metro markets, combined with the capabilities that we have acquired and developed over time, give us time to market and economic advantages that should allow us to capture a significant share of this large opportunity. 
Finally, the last aspect I wanted to address is how we think about financing our business. Our revenues are primarily derived from long-term leases that deliver a stable, growing and high-quality cash flow stream, which is the underpinning of our dividends to shareholders. And our investment in small cells represents a significant growth opportunity to further enhance our long-term dividend growth. Against this backdrop, our goal is to match the quality of our business with a strong balance sheet. We believe that maintaining an investment grade balance sheet provides us with access to a deep, stable and low cost of capital, reducing risk to our cash flows and providing us with increased flexibility to pursue potential investment opportunities that we believe will increase our dividends in the future. 
In summary, how we operate, manage and finance our business is focused around growing the dividend. I believe that increasing our dividend consistently over time is the best way to create value for our shareholders. Given the leasing potential of our portfolio of assets, the long runway of expected network activity and our opportunities to invest capital at attractive returns, I believe we are well positioned to do just that by delivering upon our stated goal of growing dividends per share, 6% to 7% annually, over the next 7 -- several years. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Dan to discuss our financial results for the quarter"

When I joined the company, I was enthusiastic and optimistic about the business, the company and the people. As I have spent time meeting with employees, learning about the industry and developing an appreciation for how the company operates, all of my expectations have been exceeded. As I have learned more, I'm starting to really understand how the combination of steady, high-quality cash flows, secular growth trends, and Crown's solid execution is a hard one to beat. What I did not realize is how talented and genuinely nice the people who work here. So I want to thank everyone who's made my transition so smooth. It truly is a great place, and I appreciate the opportunity to be a part of it. 
With that, I'll now turn to discussing our second quarter. As Jay mentioned, we delivered another strong quarter of financial results, meeting or exceeding the midpoint of our previously provided quarterly outlook. In addition, through the solid first half results we have generated, combined with what we believe will continue to be a steady leasing environment, we have raised our full year 2016 outlook. 
Turning to second quarter results on Slide 4. Site rental revenues grew 9% year-over-year from $737 million to $805 million, inclusive of approximately 7% growth derived from organic contribution to site rental revenues. The 7% or $49 million growth from organic contribution of site rental revenues consist of approximately 9.5% growth from new leasing activity and cash escalations net of approximately 2.5% from tenant nonrenewals. 
Moving to Slide 5. Our second quarter results for site rental gross margin, adjusted EBITDA, AFFO and AFFO per share each met or exceeded the midpoint of our previously provided second quarter 2016 outlook, reflecting the overall healthy leasing environment. 
Moving on to investment activities. During the second quarter, we invested approximately $200 million in capital expenditures, of which $19 million were sustaining capital expenditures and $180 million were discretionary investments. Included in these discretionary investments is approximately $19 million of land purchases we completed to further strengthen our control of the ground beneath our towers. 
Today, nearly 80% of our site rental gross margin generated from towers is on land we own or control for more than 20 years. Additionally, the average term remaining on our ground leases is over 30 years. The proactive approach we take to managing the ground beneath our towers is core to our focus of producing stable, growing, high-quality cash flows. 
The balance of our discretionary investments was in revenue-regenerating capital expenditures that we believe strengthen our portfolio of assets, extended our leadership position in shared wireless infrastructure and enhanced our ability to deliver strong long-term growth in dividends per share. 
Moving on to financing activities. During the quarter, we continue to proactively manage our balance sheet while returning significant capital to our shareholders through our quarterly common stock dividend of $0.885 per share, which was 8% higher than in the same period of 2015. As part of our balance sheet management, in April, we issued $1 billion of unsecured notes to refinance debt maturities coming due in 2017 on borrowings under our credit facilities. This offering represented the culmination of our long-standing goal of reaching an investment-grade credit rating at each of the 3 major rating agencies. We believe this credit profile underscores the stability and quality of our long-term cash flows, and it lowers our overall cost of capital, which we believe is an advantage in our business of providing shared wireless infrastructure. Following this offering, the only debt maturity we have prior to 2020 is a $500 million tranche of notes due at the end of 2017. 
Shifting to full year 2016 outlook on Slide 6. We have increased the midpoint of our guidance by $3 million for site rental revenues, $3 million for site rental gross margin, $9 million for adjusted EBITDA and $7 million for AFFO. On an AFFO per share basis compared to 2015, our updated midpoint for full year 2016 outlook of $4.71 represents an increase of approximately 10%. The increase in our full year outlook reflects the strong results from the first half of the year, our expectations at the level of leasing activity from our carrier customers will remain steady, and the increase in expected contribution from network services gross margin for the remainder of the year and the timing benefit related to tenant nonrenewals occurring later than previously expected. It is important to note that our expectations for tenant nonrenewals associated with the decommissioning of portions of the Clearwire, Metro PCS and Leap networks remain unchanged in the aggregate. Looking beyond 2016, we believe we are in a multiyear cycle of network upgrades and enhancements as carriers focus on meeting significantly increasing demand for wireless connectivity, which we believe will benefit both our tower and small cell businesses. 
Given this backdrop, and combined with our leading portfolio of wireless infrastructure across both towers and small cells, we believe that we are well positioned to achieve our stated long-term goal of delivering compound annual growth of 6% to 7% in AFFO and dividends per share. 
With that, Vicky, I'd like to open the call up to questions."

Could you kind of waterfall the contributing factors to that deceleration? I'm assuming it has mostly to do with your inclusion of the small cell revenues in the organic growth number. But if you could kind of map that out for us, it would be helpful. 
And then second, Jay, I'm sure you know that there's a big conversation out there about the AT&T tower RFP, comments from T-Mobile about trying to find ""competitors"" for towers that are getting too expensive. Could you kind of opine a little bit about that RFP and talk a little bit about your portfolio in terms of what you might sense as the percentage of towers that have a combination of expiring leases and very expensive leases coming up for renewal where there might be substitutes near you? It's a topic we're addressing and it would be great to hear your thoughts on it."

Maybe I'll take the second question first and then, Dave, Dan can go through the first question there. We're not going to get into, obviously, specific conversations that we're having with each of the carriers. But as we look at the business, we haven't seen the dynamic change from what it's been like in a long period of time. The towers that we provide to the wireless operators provide them with a very cost-effective solution. And over time, obviously, tower rents have escalated. But the main cause of that escalation is the underlying cost of that asset, and we have done a good job over a long period of time of extending ground leases, as Dan mentioned in his comments, and investing capital there in order to own the ground underneath those assets. And like any other real estate asset over time, there's an appreciation in that overall cost. And so we feel comfortable about where we are positioned relative to the -- all of the carriers and the provision of where rent is relative to the space that they're using and the underlying cost of the asset. And while this topic, I think, over the last 6 to 9 months has maybe gotten more conversation than what it has over the last couple of years, it's not really a new conversation. And we've had this conversation all the way dating back to kind of the 1999 period, and it comes up from time to time. And the value equation and the provision of that value to the carriers today is about a 2.5% to 3% cost of lease against the overall cost of the asset. And we believe that's a very attractive cost position as we share the asset across multiple carriers and, in essence, provides them with a really low-cost alternative. And frankly, we don't see that -- the pricing dynamic in the business or the overall structure or arrangements that we have with the carriers, we just don't see that changing."

And we really think of it as a year-over-year basis as opposed to quarter-over-quarter. So the way I would say it is it depends on when the timing of the activity comes in but it's really more of a quarter-to-quarter anomaly more than anything else.

Thanks for the questions. On the first question around the leasing environment, we're expecting, as we have been through the course of the whole year, about $170 million of revenue growth, organic revenue growth comprised of about $115 million on the tower side and then about $55 million in growth on the small cell side, that was really our expectation going into the calendar year '16, and it's held throughout the year, and we see that holding through the balance of the year, which is why our expectation is unchanged. That is very similar to the long-term expectation that we have in the business that underwrites or underpins our 6% to 7% dividend growth in the comments that I made. So we view that as a very healthy environment. We're seeing activity across the spectrum from the carriers on both small cells and towers and feel good about what that's going to look like for the balance of the year. 
On your second question, that's -- this has certainly gotten some play, I think, in the news recently around some of the difficulties of siting small cells, as you referenced. And our experience has been that they are difficult to site and to locate. And in essence, that underpins a big component of what we think about the business. So one would say the same thing about towers, about how difficult they are to get sited and to get -- put into municipalities, it's a great barrier to entry. And as we look at small cells, we would say the same thing about small cells that they are operationally difficult in terms of moving through municipalities and local restrictions around planning and zoning. They take a long time to do. Generally, our experience has been that it's an 18- to 24-month process in order to work through that. And on top of that, it's very challenging from an RF design standpoint. So it takes an enormous amount of skill and expertise in order to deploy these. And both the combination of the high barrier to entry that's created by the local municipality as well as the operational expertise required in order to navigate both the RF side as well as the municipalities, we think, is core strength for us and is supported by the business long term. And frankly, the more difficult it is, we think it really separates us from our competitors and shows how skillful the team really is. So we are seeing it, but I wouldn't necessarily describe it as worse than what it's been in the past. And frankly, I think it's supported by the value of the business."

And there's -- we're not undertaking any obligation, or we're not signing up for capital investment in an environment that, in later years, may have lower returns on it than what they do today. By way of example, if you rolled back the business and look at what would it in kind of the 1999, 2000 era, we were building 1,000 to 2,000 towers a year back then because the returns were attractive to the business relative to the cost of capital and what we thought we could drive in terms of shareholder value. Today, we build less than 50 on an annual basis. And the reason for that is because we just don't see the incremental returns as high enough. 
So if you roll this forward, I would certainly hold out the possibility that there would be competitors in the space and that there would be a change in the pricing environment. And if the returns weren't attractive to us, then we would stop making the investments as we're making them. We haven't seen that, to be clear, though. Today, what we're seeing is very attractive returns and an opportunity to invest capital that we think will further our growth rate over time. 
And similar to the comments that I made about building towers or building new fiber, the assets that we already have today, we would expect, over the long period of time, to continue to see lease-up, which will drive those incremental yields and incremental returns. 
So I think of this really as, we're choosing today to invest in and build immature assets because we believe there will be an environment over time that will fill those assets up and increase the yields over time. And then as we get into future periods, frankly, we'll just have to make the right capital allocation decision and ensure all along the way that every time we make the investment, we're doing so because we believe it will increase our dividend growth over the long term."

And at this point as we're talking about guiding and thinking about our expectation of investment, we really don't see that at the current level, but there may be opportunities in the future that would lead to that. And again, I would point you back to how the discipline that we've shown over a long period of time and would expect to show in the future as we look at those investments. There are obviously opportunities that would make sense to pursue, and may include some equity associated with it. But you can be sure if that were the case, we're looking at this on a real cost of capital associated with that and then going back to does it really, at the end of the day, drive the dividend. Now one thing I would point out is don't miss the growth in EBITDA that we've got generating in the business. And the aim here is to run the balance sheet at about 5x debt to EBITDA. And so over time, we're creating leverage capacity even as we go towards our target of 5 turns debt to EBITDA. And at this point, we think that's sufficient to cover the investment that we're making in small cells as well as covering the dividend. You can see that -- maybe a real quick look is just look at the cash flow statement. For 6 months, we've got about $900 million of cash flow from operations, $600 million of dividends and we've got about $392 million of CapEx. So there's about -- there's -- year-to-date, there's about $90 million, $92 million or so of CapEx in excess of the cash flow.

But when I think of the tower business, I think of it, at this point, a very well-defined and structured business, there's not much variability from one build to another in terms of getting a required initial yield. And you guys talked about with the small cell business getting on average typically 6% to 7% initial yields when you deploy for an anchor customer. And I guess my question is how standardized is that? I mean, does that vary quite a bit? I mean, are there some small cell deals where you're doing right now, and it's actually something below that and there's others that are well above that, and it's really averaging that 6% to 7%. Are you seeing that pretty consistently deal by deal? 
And then my second question, you guys have talked about 6% to 7% AFFO and dividend growth over the long term. You've mentioned it again on today's call. But when I look at the growth that you're doing right now, the 10% AFFO growth, the 8% dividend growth, I appreciate you have the converts, I appreciate the law of large numbers. But is there anything else there that we should be aware of that would explain why we could see a few hundred basis points reduction in growth perhaps as we go into next year?"

On your first question, there are obviously, and you would expect there would be anytime you're investing the amount of capital that we're investing -- I'm sure we could find you a couple of examples that would be outside of that normal range. But t",258,"Sure. On your first question, there are obviously, and you would expect there would be anytime you're investing the amount of capital that we're investing -- I'm sure we could find you a couple of examples that would be outside of that normal range. But the vast majority of the investments that we're making in small cells would come in right around the average that we're giving you in terms of return. And you're correctly pointing out that's the way we would think about it. So it really depends on market dynamics and other things around where the exact dollars are, so we're really pricing this to yield, and we're seeing the vast majority of them fall within the range that we're giving you around at initial investments for an anchor carrier. 
On your second question on the target, maybe an easy way to think about it is in this calendar year, the 10% is benefited by about 200 basis points from acquisitions that we made that were immediately accretive. And so that would take it down to kind of the 8% range. And then from there, you correctly point out the convert, preferred that we have coming due at the balance of -- at the end of this year. So maybe a simple item would just be to take that 10%, make it 8% with the acquisition. And it very well may be that over time we find opportunities like that, that are attractive, accretive acquisitions, but we're not going to bake that into our base forecast."

It was $170 million in our prior outlook, and it's $170 million now. I think one of the things that we're noticing is we give ranges of these things, which is the approximations we put in those charts, and it gets to be too precise. And so I would not extrapolate that to say that our new leasing activity is any different. As Jay pointed out, it's what we thought it was -- what we thought it was going to be at the beginning of the year has held through this year. $115 million from towers and $55 million from small cells. And then in terms of the small cell gross margins, those will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter. But generally, what we see is that we look at this more like Jay was talking about on the returns that we get in these projects and the kind of the overall margins we get may fluctuate depending on how the deal is structured and what happens and when things come on. So it's probably not going to fluctuate terribly from where it is now, but I wouldn't focus on that as the driver of how we would think about the incremental investment in that -- in those projects."

5G, it's important, I think, whenever we talk about kind of longer term, what do we think the growth rate in the business. The thing that we like to point out to investors around future opportunities is the level of activity that we've seen from the carriers over a long period of time is inside of a relatively close band of activity. And so we would look at 5G, for instance, or additional spectrum that we think will get auctioned off, or FirstNet and we would look at all of those opportunities as likely to extend the runway of growth in the business. And so at the moment or in the near term, we may see more benefit from an AWS-3-like deployment or additional carriers being added across the towers for various reasons. And today and then over the longer term, we would look at it and say we will probably see activity from things like the deployment of 5G and FirstNet and other spectrum that's not currently being used by the carriers. So I would describe that as extending the runway of growth is probably the best way to think about it."

If you could give us a little color on sort of where the tenancy is.

Most of the capital is invested up front as we build the fiber. That remains to be the case today. And then over time, you have a couple of things happen. The case studies we talked about last time on the call I think are instructive and helpful there. In both cases, we saw a couple of things happen. One is that, over time, we see the initial carrier come back and add additional nodes across a given geography of fiber that in essence increases the density. And that looks -- if you're making a comparison to the tower model, that looks like amendment to the base business where that first tenant, the yield associated with that first tenant, in essence, increases across the fiber. The second thing that we see is that as additional carriers come, they co-locate on the fiber that we built for the first carrier. And then they also, at times, want to extend the fiber into new places. We describe that typically as laterals across that base system. And so as we have co-locations over time, it's a combination of extending the plant as well as co-locating in the same -- across the same fiber that was built for that initial tenant. And generally speaking, we find the yield that's a pure co-location, we'll find the yield as we move into the second tenant into the teens. And then as we get to the third tenant, as we showed you last quarter, we'll be plus 20% off in times by the time we get to the third tenant. Some of that mix depends on how many co-locations go there, the density with which they go across a given geography of fiber and then how many laterals do we put in, are we extending the fiber mix. So really, the value proposition there as we think about it to the carriers is it's a shared infrastructure just like we do with towers, and it provides a very cost-effective way for them to deploy across that fiber. And then once the fiber is in the ground, it becomes a speed-to-market advantage that we have because we're able to install them on the fiber that we've already deployed for the first carrier."

And I think some of it was confusion around the nomenclature of what does a node mean. And so we've tried to focus the conversation much more on revenues and yields to show the return. I wouldn't dismiss the idea that at some point over time, maybe we do come up with a way to show that in a way that makes sense. But what we found when we were disclosing it was it actually was not very helpful for people in building their models and frankly caused people to draw conclusions that we weren't consistent with kind of the financial returns. And so that was the reason why we stopped doing it. Over time, maybe the nomenclature becomes a little more settled and maybe there is a way to help with that. But I think in the short term, you'll see us continuing to focus on talking about this in terms of financial returns. And then what you can see, as Dan mentioned in his earlier comments, by looking at the numbers on a sequential basis, you can see with the mix of co-locations and anchor builds, you can see those incremental returns being driven."

So haven't really seen the dynamics of that change in the market over the last couple of years. Big picture today, we're probably somewhere in the neighborhood of about half of the activity that gets put out by the carriers. We're winning about half of that business. The pie is growing quickly as multiple providers are now focused on this. So -- but the ballpark I would tell you, we're about 50% of the market. The other 50% would be a combination of self-performed by the carriers, and then other providers winning RFPs. And we obviously don't have to have a 50% win rate in order for the business to be interesting to us. It's really around where do you have infrastructure and then what's the incremental returns from there. Again, back to the earlier conversation, which I think is really important, as we think about this business and compare it to towers is we believe that a shared solution is the lowest cost solution for the carriers. And we provide that solution for the carriers at a cost lower than what they could do themselves. A combination of that is our own low-cost of access to capital which we have, the expertise that we -- which we have, so we can get it done faster and more cost effectively just in terms of cost of the deployment. And then by sharing it with multiple parties, the entire return and justification for that investment doesn't have to be driven by one carrier. And that model has held out very well in towers and we see the same dynamics in small cells and believe it will continue."

I think best-case scenario, this is a late 2017, early 2018 before it starts to affect our revenues based on all of the public commentary. But I frankly don't have any inside baseball beyond which you would read and know. I think we continue to believe that, over time, there will be a First Responder Network that's constructed, whether that's at the federal level or at the local level. The legacy systems are aging, and there's a real need for it. And that we believe the deployment of that system and any of the constructs that are currently being talked about and are possibilities, any of those constructs would be good for the tower industry and for us particularly. 
On the second question, cost did tick up a little bit sequentially there in small cells. And I think when you get to that level of granularity, I wouldn't necessarily point to anything that's indicative of what's going on in the business, which you're going to find over time as we build new anchor systems, and there's mix of anchor and co-locations. You may see a little bit of volatility up and down sort of quarter-to-quarter. But in total, the economics are hanging there as we expected. 
On the G&A comment, I would go back to my prior bigger-picture comments. First quarter G&A looks to us like it's going to be the run rate for the balance of the year, and we're not seeing really any meaningful movements there. Back to the more bigger-picture comments that were asked around what the opportunity is around small cells, obviously if we were to find more opportunities or ramp up the investment that we're making in that space, then we would need to increase the G&A. But that G&A would come with returns as we've seen in the past. So it will be a function of the activity that we see and the opportunity to invest capital. 
So with that, maybe I'll wrap up the call. Thank you, everyone, for joining this morning. As you heard on the call, the story is the same as it's been for a long period of time.

As you saw from our earnings release last night, we had another quarter of great performance, meeting or exceeding the midpoint of our previously provided second quarter outlook and allowing us to increase our full",1162,"Thanks, Son, and good morning, everyone. As you saw from our earnings release last night, we had another quarter of great performance, meeting or exceeding the midpoint of our previously provided second quarter outlook and allowing us to increase our full year 2016 outlook. The results reflect our continued focus on creating shareholder value through solid execution, disciplined capital allocation and strong balance sheet management, all of which positions us to achieve our goal of delivering long-term annual dividend growth of 6% to 7%. 
What I'd like to do this morning in my prepared remarks is spend just a few minutes providing a bit more detail on each of the key focus areas that underpin our ability to drive our 6% to 7% per year dividend growth and then hand the call over to Dan to talk about our financial results for the quarter. 
The first point I'll touch on is our long-term track record of execution. We have a highly motivated very talented team of people who are dedicated to delivering strong results. They have developed the systems and processes necessary to operate and manage our business to generate strong cash flow through a variety of business cycles. Additionally, we've been able to grow through both organically and acquisitions, including integrating those acquisitions effectively. This solid execution has resulted in very good financial performance. Since 2007, we have grown AFFO per share from $1.33 to our current expectation of $4.71 for the full year 2016, representing 15% compounded annual growth per share. Additionally, since 2014, we have returned approximately $7 per share in dividends, further enhancing the returns for our shareholders. The combination of our track record of execution, the quality of the portfolio of assets that we have accumulated, the secular tailwinds of increasing demand for wireless connectivity and the strength of our business model position us to -- well to capitalize on the positive industry trends we are seeing coming our way, which is the second topic I want to highlight. 
As we look to the future, we believe wireless carriers will continue to invest in their network infrastructure as they take advantage of what many expect to be a multi-fold increase in mobile data usage between now and 2020. Specifically, we believe our runway of growth is supported by the amount of spectrum that is expected to be deployed over the next several years, including spectrum from last year's AWS-3 auction, the spectrum currently held by the carriers and other sues as DISH and FirstNet that have yet to be deployed and spectrum from future expected auctions. 
Further out on the horizon, we expect the deployment of 5G will drive growth on both our tower and small cell assets as the carriers look to densify their networks to provide the coverage, capacity and speed needed to support mobile video, the Internet of Things, fixed wireless broadband and other developing use cases. 
Given these expected developments, and consistent with carrier commentary, we expect the carriers to continue to invest over the long term to maintain and improve network quality. As the leading U.S. provider of towers and small cells, we have the opportunity to lease our assets and capture significant organic growth by providing the wireless carriers with a comprehensive offering of wireless infrastructure solutions. 
In addition to the organic growth we see in our business, we have also had a tremendous opportunity to invest capital to drive attractive returns, which is the third key area I would like to focus on. 
From a capital allocation standpoint, we are particularly excited about the small cell opportunities that we see ahead of us. Because small cells are deployed closer to the end-user and in more dense arrays, such as on traffic lights or telephone poles, they represent the natural progression of network densification required to provide continuous, consistent high capacity and low-latency connectivity. This is important as consumers are increasingly looking to utilize their wireless devices for high usage application including on-demand video, virtual reality and the Internet of Things. As these demands continue to increase, wireless carriers are increasingly turning to small cells to provide wireless connectivity across urban and suburban geographies, where towers are not available or cannot solve the network needs alone. 
To get a better understanding of how we think about the small cell investments, we would encourage you to think of fiber as a top -- as a tower. Fiber is the critical shareable element in small cells. Much of the tower structure is the shareable element in macro sites. Similar to towers, the majority of the capital for small cells is invested initially with the first wireless carrier deployment. This initial investment relates primarily to the buildout of fiber. And again, similar to towers, we expect to increase the yields on our investments over time by co-locating additional carrier customers on the fiber we constructed for the first carrier. We are seeing this increase in yield from small cells play out at the pace we expected. 
Importantly, in both our tower and small cell businesses, this model is constructing an asset that can be utilized by multiple carriers and other customers, reduces the cost for our customers compared to what they would otherwise have to spend to build the assets for themselves. We believe our fiber footprint of 17,000 miles in top metro markets, combined with the capabilities that we have acquired and developed over time, give us time to market and economic advantages that should allow us to capture a significant share of this large opportunity. 
Finally, the last aspect I wanted to address is how we think about financing our business. Our revenues are primarily derived from long-term leases that deliver a stable, growing and high-quality cash flow stream, which is the underpinning of our dividends to shareholders. And our investment in small cells represents a significant growth opportunity to further enhance our long-term dividend growth. Against this backdrop, our goal is to match the quality of our business with a strong balance sheet. We believe that maintaining an investment grade balance sheet provides us with access to a deep, stable and low cost of capital, reducing risk to our cash flows and providing us with increased flexibility to pursue potential investment opportunities that we believe will increase our dividends in the future. 
In summary, how we operate, manage and finance our business is focused around growing the dividend. I believe that increasing our dividend consistently over time is the best way to create value for our shareholders. Given the leasing potential of our portfolio of assets, the long runway of expected network activity and our opportunities to invest capital at attractive returns, I believe we are well positioned to do just that by delivering upon our stated goal of growing dividends per share, 6% to 7% annually, over the next 7 -- several years. 
With that, I'll turn the call over to Dan to discuss our financial results for the quarter"

When I joined the company, I was enthusiastic and optimistic about the business, the company and the people. As I have spent time meeting with employees, learning about the industry and developing an appreciation for how the company operates, all of my expectations have been exceeded. As I have learned more, I'm starting to really understand how the combination of steady, high-quality cash flows, secular growth trends, and Crown's solid execution is a hard one to beat. What I did not realize is how talented and genuinely nice the people who work here. So I want to thank everyone who's made my transition so smooth. It truly is a great place, and I appreciate the opportunity to be a part of it. 
With that, I'll now turn to discussing our second quarter. As Jay mentioned, we delivered another strong quarter of financial results, meeting or exceeding the midpoint of our previously provided quarterly outlook. In addition, through the solid first half results we have generated, combined with what we believe will continue to be a steady leasing environment, we have raised our full year 2016 outlook. 
Turning to second quarter results on Slide 4. Site rental revenues grew 9% year-over-year from $737 million to $805 million, inclusive of approximately 7% growth derived from organic contribution to site rental revenues. The 7% or $49 million growth from organic contribution of site rental revenues consist of approximately 9.5% growth from new leasing activity and cash escalations net of approximately 2.5% from tenant nonrenewals. 
Moving to Slide 5. Our second quarter results for site rental gross margin, adjusted EBITDA, AFFO and AFFO per share each met or exceeded the midpoint of our previously provided second quarter 2016 outlook, reflecting the overall healthy leasing environment. 
Moving on to investment activities. During the second quarter, we invested approximately $200 million in capital expenditures, of which $19 million were sustaining capital expenditures and $180 million were discretionary investments. Included in these discretionary investments is approximately $19 million of land purchases we completed to further strengthen our control of the ground beneath our towers. 
Today, nearly 80% of our site rental gross margin generated from towers is on land we own or control for more than 20 years. Additionally, the average term remaining on our ground leases is over 30 years. The proactive approach we take to managing the ground beneath our towers is core to our focus of producing stable, growing, high-quality cash flows. 
The balance of our discretionary investments was in revenue-regenerating capital expenditures that we believe strengthen our portfolio of assets, extended our leadership position in shared wireless infrastructure and enhanced our ability to deliver strong long-term growth in dividends per share. 
Moving on to financing activities. During the quarter, we continue to proactively manage our balance sheet while returning significant capital to our shareholders through our quarterly common stock dividend of $0.885 per share, which was 8% higher than in the same period of 2015. As part of our balance sheet management, in April, we issued $1 billion of unsecured notes to refinance debt maturities coming due in 2017 on borrowings under our credit facilities. This offering represented the culmination of our long-standing goal of reaching an investment-grade credit rating at each of the 3 major rating agencies. We believe this credit profile underscores the stability and quality of our long-term cash flows, and it lowers our overall cost of capital, which we believe is an advantage in our business of providing shared wireless infrastructure. Following this offering, the only debt maturity we have prior to 2020 is a $500 million tranche of notes due at the end of 2017. 
Shifting to full year 2016 outlook on Slide 6. We have increased the midpoint of our guidance by $3 million for site rental revenues, $3 million for site rental gross margin, $9 million for adjusted EBITDA and $7 million for AFFO. On an AFFO per share basis compared to 2015, our updated midpoint for full year 2016 outlook of $4.71 represents an increase of approximately 10%. The increase in our full year outlook reflects the strong results from the first half of the year, our expectations at the level of leasing activity from our carrier customers will remain steady, and the increase in expected contribution from network services gross margin for the remainder of the year and the timing benefit related to tenant nonrenewals occurring later than previously expected. It is important to note that our expectations for tenant nonrenewals associated with the decommissioning of portions of the Clearwire, Metro PCS and Leap networks remain unchanged in the aggregate. Looking beyond 2016, we believe we are in a multiyear cycle of network upgrades and enhancements as carriers focus on meeting significantly increasing demand for wireless connectivity, which we believe will benefit both our tower and small cell businesses. 
Given this backdrop, and combined with our leading portfolio of wireless infrastructure across both towers and small cells, we believe that we are well positioned to achieve our stated long-term goal of delivering compound annual growth of 6% to 7% in AFFO and dividends per share. 
With that, Vicky, I'd like to open the call up to questions."

Could you kind of waterfall the contributing factors to that deceleration? I'm assuming it has mostly to do with your inclusion of the small cell revenues in the organic growth number. But if you could kind of map that out for us, it would be helpful. 
And then second, Jay, I'm sure you know that there's a big conversation out there about the AT&T tower RFP, comments from T-Mobile about trying to find ""competitors"" for towers that are getting too expensive. Could you kind of opine a little bit about that RFP and talk a little bit about your portfolio in terms of what you might sense as the percentage of towers that have a combination of expiring leases and very expensive leases coming up for renewal where there might be substitutes near you? It's a topic we're addressing and it would be great to hear your thoughts on it."

Maybe I'll take the second question first and then, Dave, Dan can go through the first question there. We're not going to get into, obviously, specific conversations that we're having with each of the carriers. But as we look at the business, we haven't seen the dynamic change from what it's been like in a long period of time. The towers that we provide to the wireless operators provide them with a very cost-effective solution. And over time, obviously, tower rents have escalated. But the main cause of that escalation is the underlying cost of that asset, and we have done a good job over a long period of time of extending ground leases, as Dan mentioned in his comments, and investing capital there in order to own the ground underneath those assets. And like any other real estate asset over time, there's an appreciation in that overall cost. And so we feel comfortable about where we are positioned relative to the -- all of the carriers and the provision of where rent is relative to the space that they're using and the underlying cost of the asset. And while this topic, I think, over the last 6 to 9 months has maybe gotten more conversation than what it has over the last couple of years, it's not really a new conversation. And we've had this conversation all the way dating back to kind of the 1999 period, and it comes up from time to time. And the value equation and the provision of that value to the carriers today is about a 2.5% to 3% cost of lease against the overall cost of the asset. And we believe that's a very attractive cost position as we share the asset across multiple carriers and, in essence, provides them with a really low-cost alternative. And frankly, we don't see that -- the pricing dynamic in the business or the overall structure or arrangements that we have with the carriers, we just don't see that changing."

Perhaps you could just characterize a little bit more around that. I think that Dan was just talking about second half loaded. So what is the level of activity that you're seeing right now versus, say, last quarter and versus your expectation? And I think you've said before maybe 60% of activity in the second half of the year. 
And then there's been a number of press reports just about the challenges of siting small cells with municipalities, et cetera, and particularly for some of the carriers who are not going your route. But can you just talk about where you are in terms of getting what you need from the municipalities, being able to deliver on time and on budget for your carrier customers?"

Thanks for the questions. On the first question around the leasing environment, we're expecting, as we have been through the course of the whole year, about $170 million of revenue growth, organic revenue growth comprised of about $115 million on the tower side and then about $55 million in growth on the small cell side, that was really our expectation going into the calendar year '16, and it's held throughout the year, and we see that holding through the balance of the year, which is why our expectation is unchanged. That is very similar to the long-term expectation that we have in the business that underwrites or underpins our 6% to 7% dividend growth in the comments that I made. So we view that as a very healthy environment. We're seeing activity across the spectrum from the carriers on both small cells and towers and feel good about what that's going to look like for the balance of the year. 
On your second question, that's -- this has certainly gotten some play, I think, in the news recently around some of the difficulties of siting small cells, as you referenced. And our experience has been that they are difficult to site and to locate. And in essence, that underpins a big component of what we think about the business. So one would say the same thing about towers, about how difficult they are to get sited and to get -- put into municipalities, it's a great barrier to entry. And as we look at small cells, we would say the same thing about small cells that they are operationally difficult in terms of moving through municipalities and local restrictions around planning and zoning. They take a long time to do. Generally, our experience has been that it's an 18- to 24-month process in order to work through that. And on top of that, it's very challenging from an RF design standpoint. So it takes an enormous amount of skill and expertise in order to deploy these. And both the combination of the high barrier to entry that's created by the local municipality as well as the operational expertise required in order to navigate both the RF side as well as the municipalities, we think, is core strength for us and is supported by the business long term. And frankly, the more difficult it is, we think it really separates us from our competitors and shows how skillful the team really is. So we are seeing it, but I wouldn't necessarily describe it as worse than what it's been in the past. And frankly, I think it's supported by the value of the business."

And there's -- we're not undertaking any obligation, or we're not signing up for capital investment in an environment that, in later years, may have lower returns on it than what they do today. By way of example, if you rolled back the business and look at what would it in kind of the 1999, 2000 era, we were building 1,000 to 2,000 towers a year back then because the returns were attractive to the business relative to the cost of capital and what we thought we could drive in terms of shareholder value. Today, we build less than 50 on an annual basis. And the reason for that is because we just don't see the incremental returns as high enough. 
So if you roll this forward, I would certainly hold out the possibility that there would be competitors in the space and that there would be a change in the pricing environment. And if the returns weren't attractive to us, then we would stop making the investments as we're making them. We haven't seen that, to be clear, though. Today, what we're seeing is very attractive returns and an opportunity to invest capital that we think will further our growth rate over time. 
And similar to the comments that I made about building towers or building new fiber, the assets that we already have today, we would expect, over the long period of time, to continue to see lease-up, which will drive those incremental yields and incremental returns. 
So I think of this really as, we're choosing today to invest in and build immature assets because we believe there will be an environment over time that will fill those assets up and increase the yields over time. And then as we get into future periods, frankly, we'll just have to make the right capital allocation decision and ensure all along the way that every time we make the investment, we're doing so because we believe it will increase our dividend growth over the long term."

And at this point as we're talking about guiding and thinking about our expectation of investment, we really don't see that at the current level, but there may be opportunities in the future that would lead to that. And again, I would point you back to how the discipline that we've shown over a long period of time and would expect to show in the future as we look at those investments. There are obviously opportunities that would make sense to pursue, and may include some equity associated with it. But you can be sure if that were the case, we're looking at this on a real cost of capital associated with that and then going back to does it really, at the end of the day, drive the dividend. Now one thing I would point out is don't miss the growth in EBITDA that we've got generating in the business. And the aim here is to run the balance sheet at about 5x debt to EBITDA. And so over time, we're creating leverage capacity even as we go towards our target of 5 turns debt to EBITDA. And at this point, we think that's sufficient to cover the investment that we're making in small cells as well as covering the dividend. You can see that -- maybe a real quick look is just look at the cash flow statement. For 6 months, we've got about $900 million of cash flow from operations, $600 million of dividends and we've got about $392 million of CapEx. So there's about -- there's -- year-to-date, there's about $90 million, $92 million or so of CapEx in excess of the cash flow.

Some of it is the -- another component of it is our outperformance for full year 2016, or expected outperformance against our original plan, drives some increase in our expected employee bonuses. And then I would also point out that as we look at the year, moving up the bottom end of the guide as we did in the -- in this quarter and as we did prior quarters, that doesn't migrate to the cost structure towards a little higher end, so some of -- a lot of that is honestly just narrowing the range. In terms of expectation, which is frankly probably more helpful, if you think about modeling the business, from the Q1 level of G&A, we basically think it runs flat for the whole year. So we had previously been assuming based on the guide that there was going to be some costs that were going to come out, and we're forecasting that to basically be flat for the balance of the year for the reasons that I gave you."

But when I think of the tower business, I think of it, at this point, a very well-defined and structured business, there's not much variability from one build to another in terms of getting a required initial yield. And you guys talked about with the small cell business getting on average typically 6% to 7% initial yields when you deploy for an anchor customer. And I guess my question is how standardized is that? I mean, does that vary quite a bit? I mean, are there some small cell deals where you're doing right now, and it's actually something below that and there's others that are well above that, and it's really averaging that 6% to 7%. Are you seeing that pretty consistently deal by deal? 
And then my second question, you guys have talked about 6% to 7% AFFO and dividend growth over the long term. You've mentioned it again on today's call. But when I look at the growth that you're doing right now, the 10% AFFO growth, the 8% dividend growth, I appreciate you have the converts, I appreciate the law of large numbers. But is there anything else there that we should be aware of that would explain why we could see a few hundred basis points reduction in growth perhaps as we go into next year?"

On your first question, there are obviously, and you would expect there would be anytime you're investing the amount of capital that we're investing -- I'm sure we could find you a couple of examples that would be outside of that normal range. But the vast majority of the investments that we're making in small cells would come in right around the average that we're giving you in terms of return. And you're correctly pointing out that's the way we would think about it. So it really depends on market dynamics and other things around where the exact dollars are, so we're really pricing this to yield, and we're seeing the vast majority of them fall within the range that we're giving you around at initial investments for an anchor carrier. 
On your second question on the target, maybe an easy way to think about it is in this calendar year, the 10% is benefited by about 200 basis points from acquisitions that we made that were immediately accretive. And so that would take it down to kind of the 8% range. And then from there, you correctly point out the convert, preferred that we have coming due at the balance of -- at the end of this year. So maybe a simple item would just be to take that 10%, make it 8% with the acquisition. And it very well may be that over time we find opportunities like that, that are attractive, accretive acquisitions, but we're not going to bake that into our base forecast."

I think one of the things that we're noticing is we give ranges of these things, which is the approximations we put in those charts, and it gets to be too precise. And so I would not extrapolate that to say that our new leasing activity is any different. As Jay pointed out, it's what we thought it was -- what we thought it was going to be at the beginning of the year has held through this year. $115 million from towers and $55 million from small cells. And then in terms of the small cell gross margins, those will fluctuate quarter-to-quarter. But generally, what we see is that we look at this more like Jay was talking about on the returns that we get in these projects and the kind of the overall margins we get may fluctuate depending on how the deal is structured and what happens and when things come on. So it's probably not going to fluctuate terribly from where it is now, but I wouldn't focus on that as the driver of how we would think about the incremental investment in that -- in those projects."

5G, it's important, I think, whenever we talk about kind of longer term, what do we think the growth rate in the business. The thing that we like to point out to investors around future opportunities is the level of activity that we've seen from the carriers over a long period of time is inside of a relatively close band of activity. And so we would look at 5G, for instance, or additional spectrum that we think will get auctioned off, or FirstNet and we would look at all of those opportunities as likely to extend the runway of growth in the business. And so at the moment or in the near term, we may see more benefit from an AWS-3-like deployment or additional carriers being added across the towers for various reasons. And today and then over the longer term, we would look at it and say we will probably see activity from things like the deployment of 5G and FirstNet and other spectrum that's not currently being used by the carriers. So I would describe that as extending the runway of growth is probably the best way to think about it."

Most of the capital is invested up front as we build the fiber. That remains to be the case today. And then over time, you have a couple of things happen. The case studies we talked about last time on the call I think are instructive and helpful there. In both cases, we saw a couple of things happen. One is that, over time, we see the initial carrier come back and add additional nodes across a given geography of fiber that in essence increases the density. And that looks -- if you're making a comparison to the tower model, that looks like amendment to the base business where that first tenant, the yield associated with that first tenant, in essence, increases across the fiber. The second thing that we see is that as additional carriers come, they co-locate on the fiber that we built for the first carrier. And then they also, at times, want to extend the fiber into new places. We describe that typically as laterals across that base system. And so as we have co-locations over time, it's a combination of extending the plant as well as co-locating in the same -- across the same fiber that was built for that initial tenant. And generally speaking, we find the yield that's a pure co-location, we'll find the yield as we move into the second tenant into the teens. And then as we get to the third tenant, as we showed you last quarter, we'll be plus 20% off in times by the time we get to the third tenant. Some of that mix depends on how many co-locations go there, the density with which they go across a given geography of fiber and then how many laterals do we put in, are we extending the fiber mix. So really, the value proposition there as we think about it to the carriers is it's a shared infrastructure just like we do with towers, and it provides a very cost-effective way for them to deploy across that fiber. And then once the fiber is in the ground, it becomes a speed-to-market advantage that we have because we're able to install them on the fiber that we've already deployed for the first carrier."

So haven't really seen the dynamics of that change in the market over the last couple of years. Big picture today, we're probably somewhere in the neighborhood of about half of the activity that gets put out by the carriers. We're winning about half of that business. The pie is growing quickly as multiple providers are now focused on this. So -- but the ballpark I would tell you, we're about 50% of the market. The other 50% would be a combination of self-performed by the carriers, and then other providers winning RFPs. And we obviously don't have to have a 50% win rate in order for the business to be interesting to us. It's really around where do you have infrastructure and then what's the incremental returns from there. Again, back to the earlier conversation, which I think is really important, as we think about this business and compare it to towers is we believe that a shared solution is the lowest cost solution for the carriers. And we provide that solution for the carriers at a cost lower than what they could do themselves. A combination of that is our own low-cost of access to capital which we have, the expertise that we -- which we have, so we can get it done faster and more cost effectively just in terms of cost of the deployment. And then by sharing it with multiple parties, the entire return and justification for that investment doesn't have to be driven by one carrier. And that model has held out very well in towers and we see the same dynamics in small cells and believe it will continue."

But I frankly don't have any inside baseball beyond which you would read and know. I think we continue to believe that, over time, there will be a First Responder Network that's constructed, whether that's at the federal level or at the local level. The legacy systems are aging, and there's a real need for it. And that we believe the deployment of that system and any of the constructs that are currently being talked about and are possibilities, any of those constructs would be good for the tower industry and for us particularly. 
On the second question, cost did tick up a little bit sequentially there in small cells. And I think when you get to that level of granularity, I wouldn't necessarily point to anything that's indicative of what's going on in the business, which you're going to find over time as we build new anchor systems, and there's mix of anchor and co-locations. You may see a little bit of volatility up and down sort of quarter-to-quarter. But in total, the economics are hanging there as we expected. 
On the G&A comment, I would go back to my prior bigger-picture comments. First quarter G&A looks to us like it's going to be the run rate for the balance of the year, and we're not seeing really any meaningful movements there. Back to the more bigger-picture comments that were asked around what the opportunity is around small cells, obviously if we were to find more opportunities or ramp up the investment that we're making in that space, then we would need to increase the G&A. But that G&A would come with returns as we've seen in the past. So it will be a function of the activity that we see and the opportunity to invest capital. 
So with that, maybe I'll wrap up the call. Thank you, everyone, for joining this morning. As you heard on the call, the story is the same as it's been for a long period of time.

Appreciate you joining the call this morning. As you saw from our earnings release yesterday, we delivered another great quarter of financial results that exceeded our expectations as the leasing environment continues at a healthy pace across both towers and small cells, allowing us to once again increase our outlook for full year 2016. We also increased our dividend by 7%, reflecting our expectations of continued growth in 2017 and consistent with our goal of increasing dividend 6% to 7% per year. 
As we'll discuss further on this call, we believe the healthy leasing environment will continue into 2017. Specifically, our 2017 outlook assumes higher growth of approximately $15 million from small cells and similar growth from towers as compared to 2016. The growth we see in our business is fundamentally driven by the strong growth in demand for mobile data, which we believe will continue given the continued adoption of data-intensive applications, such as video streaming, the increasing number of devices that are being connected with the growing importance of the Internet of Things and the potential for new applications to be deployed in the years ahead that will rely heavily on mobile networks such as fixed wireless broadband, autonomous cars and augmented reality, just to name a few. With this expected growth and demand for mobile data, we believe the wireless carriers will invest steadily in their network, including leasing our infrastructure in the coming years, much like they have historically, to serve the growing and unmet demand for wireless connectivity.
As we have seen over the last 2 decades, our approximately 40,000 towers are the first option in network deployment given their efficiency and cost effectiveness. More recently, the carriers have looked to small cells to add to their capacity in their networks. Therefore, over the last few years, we've begun to invest more significantly in this area of our business. This investment has been based on 3 fundamental characteristics that we believe makes small cells very similar to that of towers. First, the shared economic model of small cells drives down our carrier's cost of deployment. Second, our margins and returns increase over time as the carriers lease more tenant nodes across our fiber. And third, the total addressable market is very sizable.
To illustrate these points, I'd like to walk you through our experience in Chicago using Slide 4. In 2013, we had approximately 300 tenant nodes on-air on approximately 100 miles of fiber or approximately 3 tenant nodes per mile of fiber. Of these 300 nodes, approximately 90% are focused in the downtown area. Fast-forward to today, we have approximately 1,100 nodes on-air and under construction on 250 miles of fiber, with the tenant nodes density at approximately 5 tenant nodes per mile. This results in a yield on our investment in Chicago of about 10%.
Importantly, more than half of these nodes are situated outside of the central business district, which demonstrates both the expansion beyond the central business district and, at the same time, the densification in the central business district that has occurred over that time. The expansion beyond the central business district into the surrounding Chicago suburbs is an example of why we believe the total addressable market for small cells will be so significant. Chicago is representative of what we're seeing throughout major U.S. metro markets, which is why we remain still [ph] bullish on the opportunities we see in small cells. We believe this growth opportunity from small cells, combined with the growth from our towers, uniquely positions us to capitalize on the evolution of wireless networks through the extension of our shared infrastructure model that continues to efficiently and cost effectively serve carrier needs.
The strength of our business model, the underlying strong fundamentals driving wireless investments and the uniqueness of our assets gives us confidence in our ability to continue to deliver 6% to 7% growth in dividends per share annually. We believe this expected growth, combined with our current dividend yield of approximately 4%, provides a very attractive total return opportunity.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Dan to go through a few more details around our financial results."

(REIT), Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2016",2016-10-21,"Earnings Calls","Crown Castle Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jay, and good morning, everyone. As Jay mentioned, we have a lot of good things to discuss on the call today. We exceeded our third quarter guidance range and raised our full year 2016 outlook, reflecting the continuation of the strong operating p",1325,"Thanks, Jay, and good morning, everyone. As Jay mentioned, we have a lot of good things to discuss on the call today. We exceeded our third quarter guidance range and raised our full year 2016 outlook, reflecting the continuation of the strong operating performance our team has driven throughout the year and the healthy leasing environment we continue to see. At the midpoint, our updated full year 2016 outlook for AFFO per share of $4.73 is up 10% compared to 2015. This growth includes approximately 200 basis points of benefit from acquisitions.
We also provided our outlook for full year 2017 results, which, at the midpoint, calls for AFFO per share of $5.01, up 6% over our updated 2016 outlook. Additionally, we increased our dividend by 7% from an annualized $3.54 per share to an annualized $3.80 per share, demonstrating our strong belief in the growth and [ph] the cash flows we will be able to generate from our high-quality asset portfolio.
Turning to Slide 5. Our third quarter results for site rental revenues, site rental gross margin, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO each exceeded the high end of our previously provided third quarter 2016 outlook, reflecting the continued strength of the overall operating environment. For AFFO, the quarter benefited from $7 million in lower-than-expected sustaining capital expenditures. To be clear, this benefit was due to timing, and we expect that capital will now be spent during the fourth quarter. Adjusting for the timing benefit and lower sustaining capital expenditures, we still would have exceeded the high end of our third quarter outlook for AFFO and AFFO per share.
Moving on to investment activities. During the quarter, we invested approximately $220 million in capital expenditures, consisting of $19 million of sustaining capital expenditures and approximately $200 million for discretionary investment opportunities. Included in the discretionary investments is approximately $17 million of land purchases we completed to further strengthen our control of the ground beneath our towers, which aligns with our central focus of securing long-term high-quality cash flows. The remaining discretionary investments were focused on opportunities to expand our unique portfolio of shared wireless infrastructure assets and position us to capture more future growth opportunities as our carrier customers continue to invest in our wireless networks.
We believe these net investments will generate compelling long-term returns and enhance our ability to deliver long-term growth and dividends per share. As an example of the compelling returns we generate, I wanted to highlight the investments we have made in our small cell business. To date, we have invested $2.6 billion on a net basis in small cells. These investments have resulted in that business now generating over $400 million per year of site rental revenues and a recurring yield of 6% to 7%.
In broad terms, this yield is comprised of 3 major investments. First, in 2012, we invested $1 billion for NextG, which provided us with an industry-leading platform and significant first mover's advantage that we see the benefit of on a daily basis. This investment made [ph] an initial yield of 3%.
Second, in 2015, we invested about $1 billion to purchase Sunesys, which provided us with an attractive dense [ph] metro fiber footprint in top markets where significant small cell deployments are occurring. This investment made [ph] an initial yield of 6% to 7%.
Lastly, we have made $600 million of net investments outside of these 2 acquisitions, which give us an expanding asset base on which to deploy additional small cells. These investments are generating a yield of low double digits, demonstrating the higher margins and returns we are driving through co-location. As Jay mentioned, these results reinforce our view that small cells exhibit similar shared economics with towers and provide us with attractive growth opportunities in the future.
Moving on to financing activities. During the quarter, we once again accessed the investment-grade bond market to proactively manage our balance sheet, issuing $700 million of unsecured notes to refinance debt maturities coming due in 2017 in [ph] borrowings under our credit facilities. With this successful refinancing, our balance sheet remains in great shape, with no significant maturities between now and 2020, ample liquidity under our credit facilities and approximately 80% fixed-rate debt. Additionally, during the quarter, we returned significant capital to our shareholders through our quarterly common stock dividend of $299 million in the aggregate or $0.885 per share.
Turning to our 2017 outlook on Slide 7. Focusing on the midpoint and going from left to right, our expectations for growth in site rental revenues of approximately $100 million includes approximately $155 million from organic contribution to site rental revenues, which is comprised of the following: anticipated new leasing activity of approximately $160 million, which assumes approximately $15 million of higher growth from small cells and a level of growth in towers consistent with the healthy levels we are seeing in 2016. All of this is offset by approximately $25 million less growth from the amortization of deferred credits, which we commonly refer to as prepaid rent, as compared to the growth we saw in 2016. Importantly, we expect to collect a similar level of prepaid rent in 2017 as we are collecting in 2016.
In addition to new leasing activity, our organic growth is also supported by annual contracted tenant escalators, which we expect will contribute approximately $80 million to $85 million in growth during 2017. Growth from new leasing activity and tenant escalations is expected to be offset by tenant nonrenewals of approximately $85 million to arrive at organic growth of approximately $155 million or 5% growth year-over-year. The change in the [ph] straight line, which is an adjustment for GAAP purposes related to our fixed rate escalators, and contributions from acquisitions made during 2016, which the [ph] remaining amounts will arrive at expected site rental revenue growth of around $100 million.
Turning to Slide 8. I want to spend a minute walking you through the approximately $145 million expected growth in AFFO at the midpoint of our outlook. Picking up where we left off on the prior slide, with organic contribution to site rental revenues, the $155 million of growth is partially offset by a $35 million increase in normal ongoing operating and G&A expenses as well as a $10 million reduction in services gross margin from 2016 to 2017. Additionally, with the conversion of our mandatory preferred stock, AFFO increases by $44 million, representing the amount of annual preferred dividends we paid in 2016 that we're no longer obligated to pay in 2017. And finally, 2017 AFFO growth is expected to be negatively impacted by approximately $10 million on a net basis from other items, including cash interest expense, sustaining capital expenditures and the contribution from acquisitions that have occurred in 2016 [ph]. The growth of $145 million at the midpoint in AFFO represents an approximately -- an approximate 9% increase from 2016. On a per share basis, AFFO growth is expected to be 6%, including about 100 basis point headwind from the preferreds that will convert into approximately 11.6 million additional common shares on November 1 of this year. Based on our expectations for 2017 and our outperformance in 2016 compared to our initial outlook, we have increased our quarterly dividend by 7% per share, further adding to our track record of growing our dividend. 
As Jay mentioned, we remain confident in our portfolio of shared wireless infrastructure assets, uniquely positions Crown Castle to meet our carrier customers' needs as they continue to build out and enhance their wireless networks to meet the rapid growth and demand for wireless connectivity. These fundamentals give us confidence in our ability to increase our AFFO and dividends per share by 6% to 7% per year over the coming years, which when combined with our current dividend and yield of approximately 4%, we believe, provides a very attractive total return profile.
With that, Vicki, I'd like to open up the call to questions."

On the first question, obviously, one of the great benefits of our business, both on the towers side and the small cells side, is that there are very high barriers to entry in the business. And so we're accustomed to working through the various local municipalities and with the zoning regulation to know who the [ph] municipalities are. And over time, we've worked with Washington to put in what we believe are some smart federal legislation that creates a path that gets to a timely answer from the local municipalities and communities. And we've continued to see the impact of conversations with the local municipalities as we deploy small cells, and I don't think that's going to come to an end anytime soon. But I would also tell you that, that really demonstrates some of the capabilities and expertise that we have in the business that we're used to dealing with that and can get our carriers deployed on time frames that are reasonable. And so it's not in any way inhibiting our ability to deploy these networks on a reasonable time frame and -- but it certainly gives us an opportunity to set ourselves apart from some of the competition in the market. On your second question, in Chicago, it's a combination of both lease-up on the existing fiber as well as continuing to deploy additional fiber as we've expanded our fiber footprint around Chicago. As you can see from that slide, in the picture, we've increased the number of nodes per mile on that first 100 miles of fiber that we had in the central business district of Chicago. So a lot of that would be lease-up, if you will, or co-location on that base of fiber. And then at the same time, we've built out a number of miles, about 150 miles, beyond that central business district out into the suburbs. And while we were building that initially for one carrier, we've seen additional co-location beyond that sort of initial build. And it's reflective -- the Chicago market is reflective of really what's happening across the whole country. We're seeing co-location, which we've talked a lot about, in the neighborhood of about 3/4 of the activity that we're doing is related to expanding the fiber footprint and building new systems for carriers. And then about 1/4 of our activity, roughly, is coming from the co-location tenants on to existing fiber plan [ph]. And the Chicago example shows kind of that same thing as you look at one individual market and how that works."

Yes. Thanks, David. On the escalators, I think the best way to think about that one is we have about 85% of our contracts that have fixed rate escalators at 3% and the other 15% are on the CPI range. So with CPI being as low as it is right now, the average is that 2.6% or 2.7% that we're seeing and what we had in our guidance for 2017. On what you call straight-line amortization, the second question you asked, I think you're mixing concepts a little bit. What you asked was really on the prepaid rent, which is different than the straight-line amortization. So on the prepaid rent amortization, what it is, is as we get reimbursed for capital upfront, we do amortize that over the life of the contract. So as you think about it, we have about 6 or 7 years remaining on the contract. That's probably not a bad way to model it going forward is over that amortization line. And where that's coming from is both towers and small cells. But the reason that it's reducing and the $25 million is lower growth in 2017 than it has been in 2015 is that as the tower business has a similar level of activity from year-over-year, the growth in prepaid rent that we are collecting is slowing [ph] down to be very similar to where it has been year-over-year, which is what we think is happening in 2017. And therefore, the growth in amortization on the towers is slowing down. Whereas on small cells, as we're building more and more systems, we're still growing the prepaid rent we're collecting, and therefore, the prepaid amortization based on the activity that we're seeing in small cells"

And so those were embedded in the escalations on those contracts. As you'll recall, for virtually all of 2016, we've been back on a -- as they did amendments, they would pay for each individual and then -- and so we saw our last step during calendar year 2016.

Small cells are a means by which the carriers can make the macro sites most efficient and effective in terms of utilizing the spectrum on that particular site. As I mentioned in my comments, and we can see this in the Chicago deployment or we could take it to kind of any U.S. major market where we deploy small cells, and show you a similar trend from the carriers, they're using the macro sites because they're cost effective and efficient. So if you could solve those challenges with macro sites, they would end up co-locating equipment on another macro site. But most of the time, these small cells are being put in and around and very close to existing macro sites in order to reuse the spectrum and create additional capacity. And what happens when they do that is it frees up the tower to provide a bit of an umbrella, if you could think of it that way, an umbrella of coverage over an area and enables the user to have a more ubiquitous and uniform experience with their mobile device. From a practical standpoint, the way all of this users often see this is, we have 4 or 5 bars on our phones and yet we can't connect and experience a reasonable data session. The reason for that is that you're receiving or you're seeing the spectrum and signal at your handset device but there's not enough capacity in the spectrum to provide that. So by putting a small cell in the general vicinity of where there's an existing macro site, you're offloading some of that capacity without changing the coverage or the necessity of the macro site to deliver the data experience to the consumer. And so they're using small cells, in essence, underneath these macro sites which both improves the consumer experience as well as frees up the macro site to be as efficient and as effective as it was originally designed. If we were to go in this example and blow it up to anything greater detail than what we're showing on the slide there, what you would see is macro sites right in the very areas that we're putting in small cells but we don't believe, based on the conversations we have with the carriers, their continued desire to both lease towers, as we talked about on this call at the same pace that they're doing throughout 2016 and that continuing into 2017, we don't see any slowdown in the activity around towers, nor do we see them using small cells as a replacement.

The simple answer to your question is, we're expecting more activity around small cells in 2017 than what we're seeing in 2016, and that's the driver of the $15 million of additional growth, increased growth in '17 as compared to '16. That's the result that we've expanded the asset base. We're seeing co-locations and continuing to invest in the areas where we're expanding that fiber footprint. As stepping back from kind of the specifics of the year-over-year change, we have a view that, over the next decade, there's going to be a significant expansion of small cells utilized by all of the carriers to improve the data experience that consumers enjoy. And as we look across the business that we have today and the $3 billion of capital that we've invested, we think we've barely scratched the surface on what the opportunity is there. In the near term, given the amount of time it takes to build these projects in the neighborhood of 12 to 18 months, we have a lot of visibility around what we think that revenue growth does which we're providing in our 2017 outlook. But beyond that, we think there is potential for additional upside as both we invest and expand these systems and at the same time co-locate additional tenant nodes on the systems that have already been built. And the other thing I would say about this is this entire strategy really comes back to sort of the core driver of everything that we think around the business. We're investing capital with the goal of increasing our dividend over the long term. And so the opportunities that we see in small cells and the returns that we're talking about, we're excited about them because of their potential for continuing to drive the dividends over the long period of time and potentially even increase the growth rate of that dividend growth over a long period of time. And everything that we're seeing, as we talked about the business as a whole and you look at the sequential change or the year-over-year change in small cells, we're seeing growth in incremental margins and we're seeing expansion of the revenue, that certainly tells the story. And if we go all the way down to a single market area, we see that thesis that we've had for several -- is really playing out as we expected and we're pretty excited about what it could mean for us over the long term."

The real issue is the geographic coverage of small cells as compared to a tower. A tower is going to cover anywhere between an 8.5 mile of geography around a given macro site and a small cell is going to cover a couple of hundred feet. And so if you were trying to replicate the small cells, the coverage of towers, the quantity of those would probably be well in excess of 15, 20, 25, maybe 30-plus small cells in order to get any more close to the capacity of the macro -- a single macro site. And the economics of a small cell are about 1/3 of that of tower. So from a cost standpoint, it just doesn't ever make sense to use, to utilize small cells as a replacement for macro sites, which is why we don't see that happening. But where they do, do it, is, as I mentioned in the comments, Rick, earlier to Brett, where they are doing it is in places where it make that macro site more efficient. So I just don't -- we're not concerned at all that small cells are going to cannibalize macro sites and the demand for macro sites because of the cost element of that. And if you look at what is the main driver of that cost, it's the cost to construct and build fiber which makes up the vast majority of the cost of small cell nodes, and that cost is not going to come down over time. That's a construction cost. It's likely an escalating cost over time rather than a cost that would decline with the reduction of -- for the cost of technology. So I think the economics, if you look at it on a comparison basis, would suggest macro sites are definitely the preferable approach for the carriers when it will solve the problem."

In terms of the activity that we see, we're not seeing any slowdown in the activity and we think the level of '16 continues into 2017. So it's really around the timing of churn."

You can see that in the supplement, where some of the consolidation churn that we expected to happen in '16 were now pushed out to '17. So what that does is twofold. It increases the '15 base and decreases what could happen in '17, so that's baked in. And the second is what Jay talked about as part of the prepared remarks is that, we do see $15 million of incremental growth on small cells. So we talked about historically that being about $55 million of growth in small cell revenues in '16 and we're looking for something in the $70 million neighborhood going into '17. And then from macro towers, we see similar growth from '16 going into '17. So no real slowdown at all and a pickup in the small cells, which, when you put all that together, gets to the growth we've shown. It's just -- unfortunately, it's offset by this prepaid rent that we talked about a bit of the call today that's coming down in growth by $25 million. It reduces the growth rate a fair amount. So we see on kind of the core activity for small cells increasing and towers staying the same and the noncash portion coming down from a growth perspective. And just to expand a bit on that on the prepaid, it's really related to prior year more than this year because it's the amortization over a longer downtime. And so really at the leveling off the curse [ph] , like I mentioned earlier, the business that's what's driving the lower growth as opposed to anything that's impacting this year's activity."

I think one of this -- and these questions, obviously, come up a number of times over the last few quarters, one of the benefits of the supplement, I would say, is that you can see clearly and go back over time and see that there hasn't been any change in that escalator. It's set right in where we expected it to several years ago. So we've not seen any change in our pricing constructs with our tenants and don't expect that we're going to see any change in that pricing construct. Ultimately, the conversation around price goes to the very attractive value proposition that we have with the carriers. We're sharing the infrastructure across multiple carriers and the cost of their leasing of these sites or use of these sites is the cost at sub 3%. So when and they look at -- including the effects of all of the amendments that they've done over time and adding additional equipment on the site and were to upgrade through multiple technologies, we're still providing that infrastructure at a very attractive cost proposition to them. And so when there is conversations around the construct and the lease arrangements between us and the carriers which there have been dating all the way back to 1999 when we first leased these assets, the conversation always went right to, what is the value proposition, what are they receiving in exchange for what the cost otherwise would've been, and that value proposition remains intact and we think it remains very attractive. The last point I'll make about this is the underlying cost of this real estate, as Simon referenced earlier, around municipalities and zoning and other things, has driven the cost of the real estate up faster than the carriers' cost to share that infrastructure over time. And so the underlying cost of the real estate is very supportive of what we're able to achieve on the escalation side, and we see that remaining intact. And we haven't seen, nor do I expect we'll see, a real change in the pricing construct."

The first one, I'm just curious if you're finding that having both a macro portfolio as well as small cells is helping one another, so having small cells has helped your macro business or having macro in a given area has helped you win small cell deals that were otherwise, I guess, being competitively bid. And then my second question has to do with the cost of small cells, so at CTIA, one of the takeaways I had was that the carriers are pushing that. If we're going to build out hundreds of thousands if not millions of these over a period of time versus today, that a typical carrier has, I don't know, 40,000 or 60,000 or 70,000 macro cell sites out there, the cost has to come down significantly. And there's talk about is $500 a node or $200 a node the right price. And one of the was I thought about it is that you could actually, as a fiber provider, go in and share that cost, not just across various wireless carriers, but across other industry vertical that might be interested in fiber such as health care or cloud companies or financial services or education et cetera. How big of a focus is that for you? And do you see yourself splitting the cost or sharing the cost of fiber and small cells with those other verticals? And does that become an increasing area of focus for you as you go forward?"

On your first question related to having small cells help the macro tower business, I would start by just affirming if we've done multiple times in the call is how our business is a phenomenal business. And whether you're in the small cell business or not, we think there's tremendous value that have been created in the tower business obviously. But we also believe there's a tremendous amount of value that is going to be created in the tower business, and we don't view being in the small cell business as a requirement to be successful, a continued success around the tower business and the growth opportunity there. So I don't think you want to be in the small cell business. The opportunity that we've seen in small cells, we're there because we believe that will increase and drive dividend growth over a long period of time. So we believe it's the smart allocation of capital that continues to further the growth model, but don't view it as a necessity to be in. There's certainly incrementally at senior level [indiscernible] carriers. It enables a broader conversation about how to be thinking about network deployment. We think that's helpful and informative to us as we think about the long term as we can have a broader conversation. But depending on the returns, there may be a day when we choose not to invest heavily in small cells. So it's really a returns-driven analysis for us, but would it [indiscernible] som e incremental value to the conversation with the carriers. On the second point and your question around costs coming down, again, just like in towers, small cells are shared infrastructure assets, the economics of which a far more attractive to the carriers as the result of us sharing among multiple parties than they would be if they were self performed or only built for only one carrier. So the cost effectively are coming down by us being a third-party provider and an initial carrier not bearing the full cost of the deployment and on the ongoing operating costs. We're going to share that across multiple operators. As we think about the potential growth drivers of revenue and cash flow over time, as we think about that as a shareable asset, our primary focus remains on the wireless carrier. And so using this fiber deployment for small cells, we think, is the vast majority of the economic driver for both growth and the opportunity that we see. We have -- as you know from our Sunesys acquisition and in certain geographies, we've used our fiber to provide things like K-12 which is providing broadband to schools. Those are long-term contracts that have provisions that are very similar to towers and that of small cells, and that, obviously, puts fiber in areas where people are located in whether it's a density of population. So we found over time those -- there are some real synergies of revenues around using that fiber for both schools and then ultimately small cells or small cells and then secondarily to schools. So there may be, over time, ways for us to continue to select the assets. That's not our primary driver at this point, but we do look -- have some specific cases where we see opportunities for us to expand the revenue and the cash flow."

We would expect a normal course just the cost of living adjustment to be about 3% increases year-over-year, and we're well inside of that on towers basically holding everything roughly flat year-over-year. So that drives incremental margins that are extremely high, well over 80%. About 90% would be our expectation, if we think about 2017 on the towers side. On the small cell side, we got a combination of 2 things going on. On the systems where we're co-locating, we're seeing very high incremental returns which expand the margins on the systems where we're seeing co-location. As we put you systems on air, those margin the margins of those new systems are in the neighborhood of about 60% for a new system. So those immature assets, if you want to think about them that way, the immature assets with slightly lower margin than the overall average basically the average down, and we don't see the full benefit of the incremental margins that we're seeing on small cells from a co-location standpoint. And how that progresses over time will largely be a function of how many opportunities do we have in front of us, how much do we invest on the deployment of additional systems and then the margins will fall out from there. If you fast forward all the way to the end of this when the market becomes more saturated in terms of the deployment of those systems, what we see on individual systems is margins that expand at paces that are in line than what we've seen historically for towers. And so moving forward to a very long view of small cells, I think you continue to see the margins expand and approaching levels that we've enjoyed in the tower business."

Why not move the impact of prepaid rent amortization from the organic conversation over to the way that you look at straight line and acquisitions?

So it is part of the economics we enter into. And if we haven't gotten the rent up front, we'd be putting it in new leasing activity revenue. But if we don't put it there or take credit for it from the capital side, it gets lost in that. So we think of it as tied to leasing activity. The reason why it's growing less isn't necessarily reflective of the current activity in '16 or '17 because the current activity in '16 we said it's about flat from '15 and it's about flat to '17. That's why it is actually plateauing and the growth and prepaid rent amortization is coming down. So what it's speaking to, and specifically on the tower side, is that growth is the same year-over-year, which is why you're not seeing incremental prepaid amortization, whereas on the small cell side, you are because we're continuing to invest in that business, grow it and get prepaid rent that we're collecting on that business."

And then on the small cell side, it's up 15, so it's gone from about 55 to about 70. So if you thought about it and you wanted to exclude kind of the prepaid conversation from that analysis, then the growth is up about 100, about 100 basis points if you were to take it -- if you were saying take a portion of that graph and move it kind of over to the right hand side.

These systems and just to take you back to kind of how we're thinking about underwriting Chicago and how we did think about underwriting Chicago, we would look at return based on the cost of deployment of the fiber. So obviously, in the central business district, as you would expect, the cost of deploying that fiber would be significantly greater than as we move out to suburb and, generally speaking, in a metro market. And so the number of nodes required to get to an acceptable IRR or yield on that investment is going to differ based on the cost. What I would tell you, generally, Walter, is that the pace of leasing on small cells has been about twice the pace of that of towers that we've seen historically. And the returns, to kind of your last question, the returns track that. So we're 3 years in on the Chicago system roughly from 2013 to 2016 and then some of that under construction this 2017, so call it 3 to 4 years a snapshot there. And the yield is in the double-digit area, around 10%. That took us over a decade in the tower -- on the tower side. And that kind of yield on invested capital is well in excess of our cost of capital and provides a terrific return. Now we certainly don't think we're done in Chicago. We're early days on this.

27198,403874583,1058880,"Crown Castle International Corp.

Appreciate you joining the call this morning. As you saw from our earnings release yesterday, we delivered another great quarter of financial results that exceeded our expectations as the leasing environment continues at a healthy pace across both towers and small cells, allowing us to once again increase our outlook for full year 2016. We also increased our dividend by 7%, reflecting our expectations of continued growth in 2017 and consistent with our goal of increasing dividend 6% to 7% per year. 
As we'll discuss further on this call, we believe the healthy leasing environment will continue into 2017. Specifically, our 2017 outlook assumes higher growth of approximately $15 million from small cells and similar growth from towers as compared to 2016. The growth we see in our business is fundamentally driven by the strong growth in demand for mobile data, which we believe will continue given the continued adoption of data-intensive applications, such as video streaming, the increasing number of devices that are being connected with the growing importance of the Internet of Things and the potential for new applications to be deployed in the years ahead that will rely heavily on mobile networks such as fixed wireless broadband, autonomous cars and augmented reality, just to name a few. With this expected growth and demand for mobile data, we believe the wireless carriers will invest steadily in their network, including leasing our infrastructure in the coming years, much like they have historically, to serve the growing and unmet demand for wireless connectivity.
As we have seen over the last 2 decades, our approximately 40,000 towers are the first option in network deployment given their efficiency and cost effectiveness. More recently, the carriers have looked to small cells to add to their capacity in their networks. Therefore, over the last few years, we've begun to invest more significantly in this area of our business. This investment has been based on 3 fundamental characteristics that we believe makes small cells very similar to that of towers. First, the shared economic model of small cells drives down our carrier's cost of deployment. Second, our margins and returns increase over time as the carriers lease more tenant nodes across our fiber. And third, the total addressable market is very sizable.
To illustrate these points, I'd like to walk you through our experience in Chicago using Slide 4. In 2013, we had approximately 300 tenant nodes on-air on approximately 100 miles of fiber or approximately 3 tenant nodes per mile of fiber. Of these 300 nodes, approximately 90% are focused in the downtown area. Fast-forward to today, we have approximately 1,100 nodes on-air and under construction on 250 miles of fiber, with the tenant nodes density at approximately 5 tenant nodes per mile. This results in a yield on our investment in Chicago of about 10%.
Importantly, more than half of these nodes are situated outside of the central business district, which demonstrates both the expansion beyond the central business district and, at the same time, the densification in the central business district that has occurred over that time. The expansion beyond the central business district into the surrounding Chicago suburbs is an example of why we believe the total addressable market for small cells will be so significant. Chicago is representative of what we're seeing throughout major U.S. metro markets, which is why we remain still bullish on the opportunities we see in small cells. We believe this growth opportunity from small cells, combined with the growth from our towers, uniquely positions us to capitalize on the evolution of wireless networks through the extension of our shared infrastructure model that continues to efficiently and cost effectively serve carrier needs.
The strength of our business model, the underlying strong fundamentals driving wireless investments and the uniqueness of our assets gives us confidence in our ability to continue to deliver 6% to 7% growth in dividends per share annually. We believe this expected growth, combined with our current dividend yield of approximately 4%, provides a very attractive total return opportunity.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Dan to go through a few more details around our financial results."

(REIT), Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2016",2016-10-21,"Earnings Calls","Crown Castle Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jay, and good morning, everyone. As Jay mentioned, we have a lot of good things to discuss on the call today.

As Jay mentioned, we have a lot of good things to discuss on the call today. We exceeded our third quarter guidance range and raised our full year 2016 outlook, reflecting the continuation of the strong operating performance our team has driven throughout the year and the healthy leasing environment we continue to see. At the midpoint, our updated full year 2016 outlook for AFFO per share of $4.73 is up 10% compared to 2015. This growth includes approximately 200 basis points of benefit from acquisitions.
We also provided our outlook for full year 2017 results, which, at the midpoint, calls for AFFO per share of $5.01, up 6% over our updated 2016 outlook. Additionally, we increased our dividend by 7% from an annualized $3.54 per share to an annualized $3.80 per share, demonstrating our strong belief in the growth and the cash flows we will be able to generate from our high-quality asset portfolio.
Turning to Slide 5. Our third quarter results for site rental revenues, site rental gross margin, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO each exceeded the high end of our previously provided third quarter 2016 outlook, reflecting the continued strength of the overall operating environment. For AFFO, the quarter benefited from $7 million in lower-than-expected sustaining capital expenditures. To be clear, this benefit was due to timing, and we expect that capital will now be spent during the fourth quarter. Adjusting for the timing benefit and lower sustaining capital expenditures, we still would have exceeded the high end of our third quarter outlook for AFFO and AFFO per share.
Moving on to investment activities. During the quarter, we invested approximately $220 million in capital expenditures, consisting of $19 million of sustaining capital expenditures and approximately $200 million for discretionary investment opportunities. Included in the discretionary investments is approximately $17 million of land purchases we completed to further strengthen our control of the ground beneath our towers, which aligns with our central focus of securing long-term high-quality cash flows. The remaining discretionary investments were focused on opportunities to expand our unique portfolio of shared wireless infrastructure assets and position us to capture more future growth opportunities as our carrier customers continue to invest in our wireless networks.
We believe these net investments will generate compelling long-term returns and enhance our ability to deliver long-term growth and dividends per share. As an example of the compelling returns we generate, I wanted to highlight the investments we have made in our small cell business. To date, we have invested $2.6 billion on a net basis in small cells. These investments have resulted in that business now generating over $400 million per year of site rental revenues and a recurring yield of 6% to 7%.
In broad terms, this yield is comprised of 3 major investments. First, in 2012, we invested $1 billion for NextG, which provided us with an industry-leading platform and significant first mover's advantage that we see the benefit of on a daily basis. This investment was made at an initial yield of 3%.
Second, in 2015, we invested about $1 billion to purchase Sunesys, which provided us with an attractive dense, smart metro fiber footprint in top markets where significant small cell deployments are occurring. This investment was made at an initial yield of 6% to 7%.
Lastly, we have made $600 million of net investments outside of these 2 acquisitions, which give us an expanding asset base on which to deploy additional small cells. These investments are generating a yield of low double digits, demonstrating the higher margins and returns we are driving through co-location. As Jay mentioned, these results reinforce our view that small cells exhibit similar shared economics with towers and provide us with attractive growth opportunities in the future.
Moving on to financing activities. During the quarter, we once again accessed the investment-grade bond market to proactively manage our balance sheet, issuing $700 million of unsecured notes to refinance debt maturities coming due in 2017 and borrowings under our credit facilities. With this successful refinancing, our balance sheet remains in great shape, with no significant maturities between now and 2020, ample liquidity under our credit facilities and approximately 80% fixed-rate debt. Additionally, during the quarter, we returned significant capital to our shareholders through our quarterly common stock dividend of $299 million in the aggregate or $0.885 per share.
Turning to our 2017 outlook on Slide 7. Focusing on the midpoint and going from left to right, our expectations for growth in site rental revenues of approximately $100 million includes approximately $155 million from organic contribution to site rental revenues, which is comprised of the following: anticipated new leasing activity of approximately $160 million, which assumes approximately $15 million of higher growth from small cells and a level of growth in towers consistent with the healthy levels we are seeing in 2016. All of this is offset by approximately $25 million less growth from the amortization of deferred credits, which we commonly refer to as prepaid rent, as compared to the growth we saw in 2016. Importantly, we expect to collect a similar level of prepaid rent in 2017 as we are collecting in 2016.
In addition to new leasing activity, our organic growth is also supported by annual contracted tenant escalators, which we expect will contribute approximately $80 million to $85 million in growth during 2017. Growth from new leasing activity and tenant escalations is expected to be offset by tenant nonrenewals of approximately $85 million to arrive at organic growth of approximately $155 million or 5% growth year-over-year. The change in the straight line, which is an adjustment for GAAP purposes related to our fixed rate escalators, and contributions from acquisitions made during 2016 bridge the remaining amount to arrive at expected site rental revenue growth of around $100 million.
Turning to Slide 8. I want to spend a minute walking you through the approximately $145 million expected growth in AFFO at the midpoint of our outlook. Picking up where we left off on the prior slide, with organic contribution to site rental revenues, the $155 million of growth is partially offset by a $35 million increase in normal ongoing operating and G&A expenses as well as a $10 million reduction in services gross margin from 2016 to 2017. Additionally, with the conversion of our mandatory preferred stock, AFFO increases by $44 million, representing the amount of annual preferred dividends we paid in 2016 that we're no longer obligated to pay in 2017. And finally, 2017 AFFO growth is expected to be negatively impacted by approximately $10 million on a net basis from other items, including cash interest expense, sustaining capital expenditures and the contribution from acquisitions that have occurred in 2016. The growth of $145 million at the midpoint in AFFO represents an approximately -- an approximate 9% increase from 2016. On a per share basis, AFFO growth is expected to be 6%, including about 100 basis point headwind from the preferreds that will convert into approximately 11.6 million additional common shares on November 1 of this year. Based on our expectations for 2017 and our outperformance in 2016 compared to our initial outlook, we have increased our quarterly dividend by 7% per share, further adding to our track record of growing our dividend. 
As Jay mentioned, we remain confident in our portfolio of shared wireless infrastructure assets, uniquely positions Crown Castle to meet our carrier customers' needs as they continue to build out and enhance their wireless networks to meet the rapid growth and demand for wireless connectivity. These fundamentals give us confidence in our ability to increase our AFFO and dividends per share by 6% to 7% per year over the coming years, which when combined with our current dividend and yield of approximately 4%, we believe, provides a very attractive total return profile.
With that, Vicki, I'd like to open up the call to questions."

On the first question, obviously, one of the great benefits of our business, both on the tower side and the small cell side, is that there are very high barriers to entry in the business. And so we're accustomed to working through the various local municipalities and what the zoning regulations in those municipalities are. And over time, we've worked with Washington to put in what we believe are some smart federal legislation that creates a path that gets to a timely answer from the local municipalities and communities. And we've continued to see the impact of conversations with the local municipalities as we deploy small cells, and I don't think that's going to come to an end anytime soon. But I would also tell you that, that really demonstrates some of the capabilities and expertise that we have in the business that we're used to dealing with that and can get our carriers deployed on time frames that are reasonable. And so it's not in any way inhibiting our ability to deploy these networks on a reasonable time frame and -- but it certainly gives us an opportunity to set ourselves apart from some of the competition in the market. On your second question, in Chicago, it's a combination of both lease-up on the existing fiber as well as continuing to deploy additional fiber as we've expanded our fiber footprint around Chicago. As you can see from that slide, in the picture, we've increased the number of nodes per mile on that first 100 miles of fiber that we had in the central business district of Chicago. So a lot of that would be lease-up, if you will, or co-location on that base of fiber. And then at the same time, we've built out a number of miles, about 150 miles, beyond that central business district out into the suburbs. And while we were building that initially for one carrier, we've seen additional co-location beyond that sort of initial build. And it's reflective -- the Chicago market is reflective of really what's happening across the whole country. We're seeing co-location, which we've talked a lot about, in the neighborhood of about 3/4 of the activity that we're doing is related to expanding the fiber footprint and building new systems for carriers. And then about 1/4 of our activity, roughly, is coming from the co-location tenants on to existing fiber plant. And the Chicago example shows kind of that same thing as you look at one individual market and how that works."

So if you can kind of talk about why the escalators are moving around like that, that would be helpful. And then the second part was just on the straight-line amortization piece of it. I was wondering if you could kind of maybe elaborate a little bit more on kind of as new prepaid rents are getting paid, I think you said it would be flat in '17 versus '16. How are you amortizing those? So we could kind of model those in. And then second, where are they coming from? Is it mostly the prepaid rents for the small cell builds? Or is it macro?

On the escalators, I think the best way to think about that one is we have about 85% of our contracts that have fixed rate escalators at 3% and the other 15% are on the CPI range. So with CPI being as low as it is right now, the average is that 2.6% or 2.7% that we're seeing and what we had in our guidance for 2017. On what you call straight-line amortization, the second question you asked, I think you're mixing concepts a little bit. What you asked was really on the prepaid rent, which is different than the straight-line amortization. So on the prepaid rent amortization, what it is, is as we get reimbursed for capital upfront, we do amortize that over the life of the contract. So as you think about it, we have about 6 or 7 years remaining on the contract. That's probably not a bad way to model it going forward is over that amortization line. And where that's coming from is both towers and small cells. But the reason that it's reducing and the $25 million is lower growth in 2017 than it has been in 2016 is that as the tower business has a similar level of activity from year-over-year, the growth in prepaid rent that we are collecting is slowing down to be very similar to where it has been year-over-year, which is what we think is happening in 2017. And therefore, the growth in amortization on the towers is slowing down. Whereas on small cells, as we're building more and more systems, we're still growing the prepaid rent we're collecting, and therefore, the prepaid amortization based on the activity that we're seeing in small cells"

I think if you -- Dave, if you look at it over time -- and this is where the supplement, I think, is really helpful, where we played out in the supplement over many years, what we expect the escalation on those contracts to be. You'll recall a number of years ago where we went down the path with some of the carriers and made prepaid for rent, and that was often in the form of increased steps in their contracts as they paid for the right to amend the sites rather than doing it one at a time. And so those were embedded in the escalations on those contracts. As you'll recall, for virtually all of 2016, we've been back on a -- as they did amendments, they would pay for each individual and then -- and so we saw our last step during calendar year 2016. So that accounts for most of the movement downward. But in terms of looking at what it will look like kind of over time, I think the best place to go is look at the supplement as we've modeled out your contractual steps into the future so that you can get your model right."

Small cells are a means by which the carriers can make the macro sites most efficient and effective in terms of utilizing the spectrum on that particular site. As I mentioned in my comments, and we can see this in the Chicago deployment or we could take it to kind of any major U.S. market where we deploy small cells and show you a similar trend from the carriers, they're using the macro sites because they're cost effective and efficient. So if you could solve those challenges with macro sites, they would end up co-locating equipment on another macro site. But most of the time, these small cells are being put in and around and very close to existing macro sites in order to reuse the spectrum and create additional capacity. And what happens when they do that is it frees up the tower to provide a bit of an umbrella, if you can think of it that way, an umbrella of coverage over an area and enables the user to have a more ubiquitous and uniform experience with their mobile device. From a practical standpoint, the way all of us as users often see this is we'll have 4 or 5 bars on our phone and yet we can't connect and experience a reasonable data session. The reason for that is that you're receiving -- you're seeing the spectrum and the signal at your handset device, but there's not enough capacity in the spectrum to provide that. So by putting a small cell in the general vicinity of where there's an existing macro site, you're offloading some of that capacity without changing the coverage or the necessity of the macro site to deliver the data experience to the consumer. And so they're using small cells, in essence, underneath these macro sites, which both improves the consumer experience as well as frees up the macro site to be as efficient and as effective as it was originally designed. If you were to go -- if we were to go into that -- this example and blow it up to an even greater detail than what we're showing on the slide there, what you would see is macro sites right in the very areas that we're putting in small cells. But we don't believe, based on the conversations we had with the carriers, their continued desire to both lease towers, as we've talked about on this call, at the same pace that they're doing throughout 2016 and that continuing into 2017, we don't see any slowdown in the activity around towers nor do we see them using small cells as a replacement.

The simple answer to your question is we're expecting more activity around small cells in 2017 than what we're seeing in 2016, and that's the driver of the $15 million of additional growth, increased growth in '17 as compared to '16. That's the result of as we've expanded the asset base, we're seeing co-location and continuing to invest in areas where we're expanding that fiber footprint. Stepping back from kind of the specifics of the year-over-year change, we have a view that, over the next decade, there's going to be a significant expansion of small cells utilized by all of the carriers to improve the data experience that consumers enjoy. And as we look across the business that we have today and the $3 billion of capital that we've invested, we think we've barely scratched the surface on what the opportunity is there. In the near term, given the amount of time that it takes to build these projects in the neighborhood of 12 to 18 months, we have a lot of visibility around what we think that revenue growth is, which we're providing in our 2017 outlook. But beyond that, we think there is potential for additional upside as both we invest and expand these systems and, at the same time, co-locate additional tenant nodes on the systems that have already been built. And the other thing I would say about this is this entire strategy really comes back to sort of the core driver of everything that we think around the business. We're investing capital with the goal of increasing our dividend over the long term. And so the opportunities that we see in small cells and the returns that we're talking about, we're excited about them because of their potential to continue to drive the dividend over the long period of time and potentially even increase the growth rate of that dividend growth over a long period of time. And everything that we're seeing, as we've talked about the business as a whole and you look at the sequential change or the year-over-year change in small cells, we're seeing growth in incremental margins and we're seeing expansion of the revenue, that certainly tells the story. And then if we go all the way down to a single market area, we see that thesis that we've had for several years is really playing out as we expected. And we're pretty excited about what it could mean for us over the long term."

The real issue is the geographic coverage of the small cells as compared to a tower. A tower is going to cover anywhere between an 8.5 mile of geography around a given macro site, and a small cell is going to cover a couple of hundred feet. And so if you were trying to replicate with small cells the coverage of towers, the quantity of those would probably be well in excess of 15, 20, 25, maybe 30-plus small cells in order to get anywhere close to the capacity of a macro -- a single macro site. And the economics of a small cell are about 1/3 of that of tower. So from a cost standpoint, it just doesn't ever make sense utilize small cells as a replacement for macro sites, which is why we don't see that happening. But where they do, do it is, as I mentioned in the comments, Rick, earlier to Brett, where they are doing it is in places where it makes that macro site more efficient. So I just don't -- we're not concerned at all that small cells are going to cannibalize macro sites and the demand for macro sites because of the cost element of that. And if you look at what is the main driver of that cost, it's the cost to construct and build the fiber, which makes up the vast majority of the cost of small cell nodes. And that cost is not going to come down over time. That's a construction cost. It's likely an escalating cost over time rather than a cost that would decline, say, with the reduction of the cost of technology. So I think the economics, if you look at it on a comparison basis, would suggest macro sites are definitely the preferable approach for the carriers when it will solve the problem."

So on your second question on what we're building in the 5% growth for 2017, we've talked about the pushout of churn from '16 into '17.

You can see that in the supplement, where some of the consolidation churn that we expected to happen in '16, we now pushed out to '17. So what that does is twofold: it increases the '16 base and decreases what could happen in '17. So that's baked in. And the second is what Jay talked about as part of the prepared remarks is that we do see $15 million of incremental growth on small cells. So we've talked about it historically, that being about $55 million of growth in small cell revenues in '16 and we're looking for something in the $70 million neighborhood going into '17. And then from macro towers, we see similar growth from '16 going into '17. So no real slowdown at all and a pickup in the small cells, which when you put all that together gets to the growth we've shown. It's just -- unfortunately, it's offset by this prepaid rent that we've talked about a bit on the call today. That's coming down in growth by $25 million. It reduces the growth rate a fair amount. So we see on kind of the core activity growth, small cells increasing and towers staying the same and the noncash portion coming down from a growth perspective. And just to expand a bit on that on the prepaid, it's really related to prior year more than this year because it's the amortization over a long period of time. And so really as the leveling off occurs, like I mentioned earlier, the Tower business, that's what's driving the lower growth as opposed to anything that's impacting this year's activity."

I think one of the -- and these questions, obviously, come up a number of times over the last few quarters. One of the benefits of the supplement, I would say, is that you can see clearly and go back over time and see that there hasn't been any change in that escalator. It's set right in where we expected it to several years ago. So we've not seen any change in our pricing constructs with our tenants and don't expect that we're going to see any change in that pricing construct. Ultimately, the conversation around price goes to the very attractive value proposition that we have with the carriers. We're sharing the infrastructure across multiple carriers, and the cost of their leasing of these sites or use of these sites is a cost that's sub-3%. So when they look at -- including the effects of all of the amendments that they've done over time and adding additional equipment on the site and were to upgrade through multiple technologies, we're still providing that infrastructure at a very attractive cost proposition to them. And so when there is conversations around the construct and the lease arrangement between us and the carriers, which there have been dating all the way back to 1999 when we first leased these assets, the conversation always went right to what is the value proposition, what are they receiving in exchange for what the cost otherwise would have been. And that value proposition remains intact, and we think it remains very attractive. The last point I'll make about this is the underlying cost of this real estate, as Simon referenced earlier, around municipalities and zoning and other things has driven the cost of the real estate up faster than the carrier's cost to share that infrastructure over time. And so the underlying cost of the real estate is very supportive of what we're able to achieve on the escalation side, and we see that remaining intact. And we haven't seen nor do I expect we'll see a real change in the pricing construct."

The first one, I'm just curious if you're finding that having both a macro portfolio as well as small cells is helping one another, so having small cells has helped your macro business or having macro in a given area has helped you win small cell deals that were otherwise, I guess, being competitively bid. And then my second question has to do with the cost of small cells. So at CTIA, one of the takeaways I had was that the carriers are pushing that if we're going to build out hundreds of thousands if not millions of these over a period of time versus today that a typical carrier has, I don't know, 40,000 or 60,000 or 70,000 macro cell sites out there, the cost has to come down significantly. And there's talk about is $500 a node or $200 a node the right price. And one of the ways I thought about it is that you could actually, as a fiber provider, go in and share that cost not just across various wireless carriers, but across other industry vertical that might be interested in fiber, such as health care or cloud companies or financial services or education, et cetera. How big of a focus is that for you? And do you see yourself splitting the cost or sharing the cost of fiber in small cells with those other verticals? And does that become an increasing area of focus for you as we go forward?"

On your first question related to does having small cells help the macro tower business, I would start by just affirming, as we've done multiple times in the call, the Tower business is a phenomenal business. And whether you're in the small cell business or not, we think there's tremendous value that has been created in the Tower business, obviously. But we also believe there's a tremendous amount of value that's going to be created in the Tower business. And we don't view being in the small cell business as a requirement to be successful -- continued success around the Tower business and the growth opportunity there. So I don't think you have to be in the small cell business. The opportunity that we see in small cells, we're there because we believe that will increase and drive dividend growth over a long period of time. So we believe it's a smart allocation of capital that continues to further the growth model, but don't view it as a necessity to be in. There's certainly incrementally -- at senior levels of the carriers, it enables a broader conversation about how to be thinking about network deployment. We think that's helpful and informative to us as we think about the long term as we can have a broader conversation. But depending on the returns, there may be a day when we choose not to invest as heavily in small cells. So it's really a return-driven analysis for us. But with it, that there is some incremental value around the conversation with the carriers. On the second point and your question around the cost need to come down, again, just like in towers, small cells are shared infrastructure asset that the economics of which are far more attractive to the carriers as a result of us sharing among multiple parties than they would be if they were self-performed or built for only one carrier. So the cost effectively are coming down by us being a third-party provider and the initial carrier not bearing the full cost of the deployment and on the ongoing operating cost. We're going to share that across multiple operators. As we think about the potential growth drivers of revenue and cash flow over time, as we think about that as a shareable asset, our primary focus remains on the wireless carriers. And so using this fiber deployment for small cells, we think, is the vast majority of the economic driver for both growth and the opportunity that we see. We have -- as you know from our Sunesys acquisition and in certain geographies, we've used our fiber to provide things like K-12, which is providing broadband to schools. Those are long-term contracts that have provisions that are very similar to towers and that of small cells. And that obviously puts fiber in the areas where people are located and where there's a density of population. And so we found over time those -- there are some real synergies of revenues around using that fiber for both schools and then ultimately small cells or small cells and then secondarily to schools. So there may be, over time, ways for us to continue to select [ph] the assets. That's not our primary driver at this point, but we do look -- have some specific cases where we see opportunities for us to expand the revenue and the cash flow."

And then on the tower side, if we build a new tower, that goes over in tower builds and acquisition. So your assumption is accurate. We do that because we find it very difficult to allocate both capital and revenue and cash flows as we'll build laterals on existing systems, at what point is the lateral a new system versus a part of the existing system. And so for ease-of-use, we've just combined those. And again, 3/4-plus of the activity at this point continues to be the deployment of new system."

We think that will continue for the markets that we've been in, where the vast majority of the activity has been, in and around the top 10 markets in the U.S. We see that expanding outside of the top 10 markets.

On the tower side, when you look at the cost structure, both at the direct operating expense side and at the G&A side, we're holding cost effectively flat. We would expect a normal course, just the cost of living adjustment to be about 3% increases year-over-year. And we're well inside of that on towers, basically holding everything roughly flat year-over-year. So that drives incremental margins that are extremely high, well over 80%. About 90% would be our expectation  as we think about 2017 on the tower side. On the small cell side, we've got a combination of 2 things going on. On the systems where we're co-locating, we're seeing very high incremental returns which expand the margins on the systems where we're seeing co-location. As we put new systems on air, those -- the margins on those new systems are in the neighborhood of about 60% for a new system. So those immature assets, if you want to think about them that way, those immature assets with slightly lower margins than the overall average basically hold the average down. And we don't see the full benefit of the incremental margins that we're seeing on small cells from a co-location standpoint. And how that progresses over time will largely be a function of how many opportunities do we have in front of us, how much do we invest on the deployment of additional systems, and then the margins will fall out from there. If you fast-forward all the way to the end of this, when the market becomes more saturated in terms of the deployment of those systems, what we see on individual systems is margins that expand at paces that are in line with what we've seen historically for towers. And so rolling forward to a very long view of small cells, I think you'd continue to see the margins expand and approaching levels that we've enjoyed in the tower business."

So the [indiscernible] is because prepaid rent really is an economic decision that our customers and we are making together.

So it is part of the economics we enter into. And if we hadn't gotten the rent upfront, we'd be putting it in new leasing activity revenue. But if we don't put it there or take credit for it from the capital side, it gets lost in that. So we think of it as tied to leasing activity. The reason why it's growing less isn't necessarily reflective of the current activity in '16 or '17 because the current -- the activity in '16, we said, is about flat from '15 and it's about flat to '17. That's why it is actually plateauing and the growth and prepaid rent amortization is coming down. So what it's speaking to, and specifically on the tower side, is the growth is the same year-over-year, which is why you're not seeing incremental prepaid amortization. Whereas on the small cell side, you are because we're continuing to invest in that business, grow it and get more prepaid rent that we're collecting on that business."

These systems -- and just to take you back to kind of how we would think about underwriting Chicago and how we did think about underwriting Chicago, we would look at return based on the cost of deployment of the fiber. So obviously, in a central business district, as you would expect, the cost of deploying that fiber would be significantly greater than as we move out to suburb, generally speaking in a metro market. And so the number of nodes required to get to an acceptable IRR or yield on that investment is going to differ based on the cost. What I would tell you generally, Walter, is that the pace of leasing on small cells has been about twice the pace of that of towers that we've seen historically. And the returns, to kind of your last question, the returns track that. So we're 3 years in on the Chicago system, roughly from 2013 to 2016 and then some of that under construction this 2017, so call it 3 to 4 years of snapshot there. And the yield is in the double-digit area, around 10%. That took us over a decade in the tower -- on the tower side.

Appreciate you joining the call this morning. As you saw from our earnings release yesterday, we delivered another great quarter of financial results that exceeded our expectations as the leasing environment continues at a healthy pace across both towers and small cells, allowing us to once again increase our outlook for full year 2016. We also increased our dividend by 7%, reflecting our expectations of continued growth in 2017 and consistent with our goal of increasing dividends 6% to 7% per year. 
As we discuss further on this call, we believe the healthy leasing environment will continue into 2017. Specifically, our 2017 outlook assumes higher growth of approximately $15 million from small cells and similar growth from towers as compared to 2016. The growth we see in our business is fundamentally driven by the strong growth in demand for mobile data, which we believe will continue given the continued adoption of data-intensive applications such as video streaming; the increasing number of devices that are being connected with the growing importance of the Internet of Things; and the potential for new applications to be deployed in the years ahead that will rely heavily on mobile networks such as fixed wireless broadband, autonomous cars and augmented reality, just to name a few. With this expected growth in demand for mobile data, we believe the wireless carriers will invest steadily in their networks, including leasing our infrastructure in the coming years, much like they have historically, to serve the growing and unmet demand for wireless connectivity.
As we have seen over the last 2 decades, our approximately 40,000 towers are the first option in network deployment given their efficiency and cost effectiveness. More recently, the carriers have looked to small cells to add to their capacity in their networks. Therefore, over the last few years, we've begun to invest more significantly in this area of our business. This investment has been based on 3 fundamental characteristics that we believe make small cells very similar to that of towers. First, the shared economic model of small cells drives down our carrier's cost of deployment. Second, our margins and returns increase over time as the carriers lease more tenant nodes across our fiber. And third, the total addressable market is very sizable.
To illustrate these points, I'd like to walk you through our experience in Chicago using Slide 4. In 2013, we had approximately 300 tenant nodes on-air on approximately 100 miles of fiber or approximately 3 tenant nodes per mile of fiber. Of these 300 nodes, approximately 90% were focused in the downtown area. Fast-forward to today, we have approximately 1,100 nodes on-air and under construction on 250 miles of fiber, with the tenant nodes density at approximately 5 tenant nodes per mile. This results in a yield on our investment in Chicago of about 10%.
Importantly, more than half of these nodes are situated outside of the central business district, which demonstrates both the expansion beyond the central business district and, at the same time, the densification in the central business district that has occurred over that time. The expansion beyond the central business district into the surrounding Chicago suburbs is an example of why we believe the total addressable market for small cells will be so significant. Chicago is representative of what we're seeing throughout major U.S. metro markets, which is why we remain so bullish on the opportunities we see in small cells. We believe this growth opportunity from small cells, combined with the growth from our towers, uniquely positions us to capitalize on the evolution of wireless networks through the extension of our shared infrastructure model that continues to efficiently and cost effectively serve carrier needs.
The strength of our business model, the underlying strong fundamentals driving wireless investment and the uniqueness of our assets gives us confidence in our ability to continue to deliver 6% to 7% growth in dividends per share annually. We believe this expected growth, combined with our current dividend yield of approximately 4%, provides a very attractive total return opportunity.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Dan to go through a few more details around our financial results."

(REIT), Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2016",2016-10-21,"Earnings Calls","Crown Castle Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jay, and good morning, everyone. As Jay mentioned, we have a lot of good things to discuss on the call today.

As Jay mentioned, we have a lot of good things to discuss on the call today. We exceeded our third quarter guidance range and raised our full year 2016 outlook, reflecting the continuation of the strong operating performance our team has driven throughout the year and the healthy leasing environment we continue to see. At the midpoint, our updated full year 2016 outlook for AFFO per share of $4.73 is up 10% compared to 2015. This growth includes approximately 200 basis points of benefit from acquisitions.
We also provided our outlook for full year 2017 results, which, at the midpoint, calls for AFFO per share of $5.01, up 6% over our updated 2016 outlook. Additionally, we increased our dividend by 7% from an annualized $3.54 per share to an annualized $3.80 per share, demonstrating our strong belief in the growth in the cash flows we will be able to generate from our high-quality asset portfolio.
Turning to Slide 5. Our third quarter results for site rental revenues, site rental gross margin, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO each exceeded the high end of our previously provided third quarter 2016 outlook, reflecting the continued strength of the overall operating environment. For AFFO, the quarter benefited from $7 million in lower-than-expected sustaining capital expenditures. To be clear, this benefit was due to timing, and we expect that capital will now be spent during the fourth quarter. Adjusting for the timing benefit and lower sustaining capital expenditures, we still would have exceeded the high end of our third quarter outlook for AFFO and AFFO per share.
Moving on to investment activities. During the quarter, we invested approximately $220 million in capital expenditures, consisting of $19 million in sustaining capital expenditures and approximately $200 million for discretionary investment opportunities. Included in the discretionary investments is approximately $17 million of land purchases we completed to further strengthen our control of the ground beneath our towers, which aligns with our central focus of securing long-term high-quality cash flows. The remaining discretionary investments were focused on opportunities to expand our unique portfolio of shared wireless infrastructure assets and position us to capture more future growth opportunities as our carrier customers continue to invest in their wireless networks.
We believe these net investments will generate compelling long-term returns and enhance our ability to deliver long-term growth and dividends per share. As an example of the compelling returns we generate, I wanted to highlight the investments we have made in our small cell business. To date, we have invested $2.6 billion on a net basis in small cells. These investments have resulted in that business now generating over $400 million per year of site rental revenues and a recurring yield of 6% to 7%.
In broad terms, this yield is comprised of 3 major investments. First, in 2012, we invested $1 billion for NextG, which provided us with an industry-leading platform and significant first mover's advantage that we see the benefits of on a daily basis. This investment was made at an initial yield of 3%.
Second, in 2015, we invested about $1 billion to purchase Sunesys, which provided us with an attractive dense, dark metro fiber footprint in top markets where significant small cell deployments are occurring. This investment was made at an initial yield of 6% to 7%.
Lastly, we have made $600 million of net investments outside of these 2 acquisitions, which give us an expanding asset base on which to deploy additional small cells. These investments are generating a yield of low double digits, demonstrating the higher margins and returns we are driving through co-location. As Jay mentioned, these results reinforce our view that small cells exhibit similar shared economics as towers and provide us with attractive growth opportunities in the future.
Moving on to financing activities. During the quarter, we once again accessed the investment-grade bond market to proactively manage our balance sheet, issuing $700 million of unsecured notes to refinance debt maturities coming due in 2017 and borrowings under our credit facilities. With this successful refinancing, our balance sheet remains in great shape, with no significant maturities between now and 2020, ample liquidity under our credit facilities and approximately 80% fixed-rate debt. Additionally, during the quarter, we returned significant capital to our shareholders through our quarterly common stock dividend of $299 million in the aggregate or $0.885 per share.
Turning to our 2017 outlook on Slide 7. Focusing on the midpoint and going from left to right, our expectations for growth in site rental revenues of approximately $100 million includes approximately $155 million from organic contribution to site rental revenues, which is comprised of the following: anticipated new leasing activity of approximately $160 million, which assumes approximately $15 million of higher growth from small cells and a level of growth in towers consistent with the healthy levels we are seeing in 2016. All of this is offset by approximately $25 million less growth from the amortization of deferred credits, which we commonly refer to as prepaid rent, as compared to the growth we saw in 2016. Importantly, we expect to collect a similar level of prepaid rent in 2017 as we are collecting in 2016.
In addition to new leasing activity, our organic growth is also supported by annual contracted tenant escalators, which we expect will contribute approximately $80 million to $85 million in growth during 2017. Growth from new leasing activity and tenant escalations is expected to be offset by tenant nonrenewals of approximately $85 million to arrive at organic growth of approximately $155 million or 5% growth year-over-year. The change in straight line, which is an adjustment for GAAP purposes related to our fixed rate escalators, and contributions from acquisitions made during 2016 bridge the remaining amount to arrive at expected site rental revenue growth of around $100 million.
Turning to Slide 8. I want to spend a moment walking you through the approximately $145 million expected growth in AFFO at the midpoint of our outlook. Picking up where we left off on the prior slide, with organic contribution to site rental revenues, the $155 million of growth is partially offset by a $35 million increase in normal ongoing operating and G&A expenses as well as a $10 million reduction in services gross margin from 2016 to 2017. Additionally, with the conversion of our mandatory preferred stock, AFFO increases by $44 million, representing the amount of annual preferred dividends we paid in 2016 that we're no longer obligated to pay in 2017. And finally, 2017 AFFO growth is expected to be negatively impacted by approximately $10 million on a net basis from other items, including cash interest expense, sustaining capital expenditures and the contribution from acquisitions that occurred in 2016. The growth of $145 million at the midpoint in AFFO represents an approximately -- an approximate 9% increase over 2016. On a per share basis, AFFO growth is expected to be 6%, including about 100 basis point headwind from the preferreds that will convert into approximately 11.6 million additional common shares on November 1 of this year. Based on our expectations for 2017 and our outperformance in 2016 compared to our initial outlook, we have increased our quarterly dividend by 7% per share, further adding to our track record of growing our dividend. 
As Jay mentioned, we remain confident in our portfolio of shared wireless infrastructure -- assets uniquely positions Crown Castle to meet our carrier customers' needs as they continue to build out and enhance their wireless networks to meet the rapid growth in demand for wireless connectivity. These fundamentals give us confidence in our ability to increase our AFFO and dividends per share by 6% to 7% per year over the coming years, which when combined with our current dividend yield of approximately 4%, we believe provides a very attractive total return profile.
With that, Vicki, I'd like to open up the call to questions."

On the first question, obviously, one of the great benefits of our business, both on the tower side and the small cell side, is that there are very high barriers to entry in the business. And so we're accustomed to working through the various local municipalities and what the zoning regulations in those municipalities are. And over time, we've worked with Washington to put in what we believe is some smart federal legislation that creates a path that gets to a timely answer from the local municipalities and communities. And we've continued to see the impact of conversations with the local municipalities as we deploy small cells, and I don't think that's going to come to an end anytime soon. But I would also tell you that, that really demonstrates some of the capabilities and expertise that we have in the business that we're used to dealing with that and can get our carriers deployed on time frames that are reasonable. And so it's not in any way inhibiting our ability to deploy these networks on a reasonable time frame and -- but it certainly gives us an opportunity to set ourselves apart from some of the competition in the market. On your second question, in Chicago, it's a combination of both lease-up on the existing fiber as well as us continuing to deploy additional fiber as we've expanded our fiber footprint around Chicago. As you can see from that slide, in the picture, we've increased the number of nodes per mile on that first 100 miles of fiber that we had in the central business district of Chicago. So a lot of that would be lease-up, if you will, or co-location on that base of fiber. And then at the same time, we've built out a number of miles, about 150 miles, beyond that central business district out into the suburbs. And while we were building that initially for one carrier, we've seen additional co-location beyond that sort of initial build. And it's reflective -- the Chicago market is reflective of really what's happening across the whole country. We're seeing co-location, which we've talked about, about in the neighborhood of about 3/4 of the activity that we're doing is related to expanding the fiber footprint and building new systems for carriers. And then about 1/4 of our activity, roughly, is coming from the co-location of tenants on to existing fiber plant. And the Chicago example shows kind of that same thing as you look at one individual market and how that works."

So if you could kind of talk about why the escalators are moving around like that, that would be helpful. And then the second part was just on the straight-line amortization piece of it. I was wondering if you could kind of maybe elaborate a little bit more on kind of as new prepaid rents are getting paid, I think you said it would be flat in '17 versus '16, how you're amortizing those? So we could kind of model those in. And then second, where they're coming from? Is it mostly the prepaid rents for the small cell builds? Or is it macro? Or is it some mix?

On the escalators, I think the best way to think about that one is we have about 85% of our contracts that have fixed rate escalators at 3%, and the other 15% are in the CPI range. So with CPI being as low as it is right now, the average is that 2.6% or 2.7% that we're seeing and what we had in our guidance for 2017. On what you call straight-line amortization, the second question you asked, I think you're mixing concepts a little bit. What you asked was really on the prepaid rent, which is different than straight-line amortization. So on the prepaid rent amortization, what it is, is as we get reimbursed for capital upfront, we do amortize that over the life of the contract. So as you think about it, we have about 6 or 7 years remaining on the contract. That's probably not a bad way to model it going forward is over that amortization line. And where that's coming from is both towers and small cells. But the reason that it's reducing, in that $25 million is lower growth in 2017 than it has been in 2016, is that as the tower business has a similar level of activity from year-over-year, the growth in prepaid rent that we are collecting is slowing down to be very similar to where it has been year-over-year, which is what we think is happening in 2017. And therefore, the growth in amortization on the towers is slowing down. Whereas on small cells, as we're building more and more systems, we're still growing the prepaid rent we're collecting, and therefore, the prepaid amortization based on the activity that we're seeing in small cells"

And that was often in the form of increased steps in their contracts as they paid for the right to amend the sites rather than doing it one at a time. And so those were embedded in the escalations on those contracts. As you'll recall, for virtually all of 2016, we've been back on a -- as they did amendments, they would pay for each individual and then -- and so we saw our last step during calendar year 2016. So that accounts for most of the movement downward. But in terms of looking at what it will look like kind of over time, I think the best place to go is look at the supplement as we've modeled out your contractual steps into the future so that you can get your model right."

If I look at the slide, it certainly is supportive of the bullish view you've had on the addressable market for small cells. But if you could flip it around, and you look at it from someone who's purely interested in tower space and say it confirms worst fears that small cells might be cannibalizing towers. Because it would seem like from that map that some of those new areas would be traditionally tower areas. And so I was hoping you could just give us a little bit more color as to the capacity and coverage problems that these small-cell deployments outside the urban core were solving and why was it that towers weren't being used in those circumstances."

Small cells are a means by which the carriers can make the macro sites most efficient and effective in terms of utilizing the spectrum on that particular site. As I mentioned in my comments, and we can see this in the Chicago deployment or we could take you to kind of any major U.S. market where we've deployed small cells and show you a similar trend from the carriers. They're using the macro sites because they're cost effective and efficient. So if you could solve those challenges with macro sites, they would end up co-locating equipment on another macro site. But most of the time, these small cells are being put in and around and very close to existing macro sites in order to reuse the spectrum and create additional capacity. And what happens when they do that is it frees up the tower to provide a bit of an umbrella, if you can think of it that way, an umbrella of coverage over an area and enables the user to have a more ubiquitous and uniform experience with their mobile device. From a practical standpoint, the way all of us as users often see this is we'll have 4 or 5 bars on our phone and yet we can't connect and experience a reasonable data session. The reason for that is that you're receiving, you're seeing the spectrum and the signal at your handset device, but there's not enough capacity in the spectrum to provide that. So by putting a small cell in the general vicinity of where there's an existing macro site, you're offloading some of that capacity without changing the coverage or the necessity at the macro site to deliver the data experience to the consumer. And so they're using small cells, in essence, underneath these macro sites, which both improves the consumer experience as well as frees up the macro site to be as efficient and as effective as it was originally designed. If you were to go -- if we were to go into that -- this example and blow it up to an even greater detail than what we're showing on the slide there, what you would see is macro sites right in the very areas that we're putting in small cells. But we don't believe, based on the conversations we've had with the carriers, their continued desire to both lease towers, as we've talked about on this call, at the same pace that they're doing throughout 2016 and that continuing into 2017, we don't see any slowdown in the activity around towers nor do we see them using small cells as a replacement.

The simple answer to your question is we're expecting more activity around small cells in 2017 than what we're seeing in 2016, and that's the driver of the $15 million of additional growth, increased growth in '17 as compared to '16. That's the result of as we've expanded the asset base, we're seeing co-location and continuing to invest in areas where we're expanding that fiber footprint. Stepping back from kind of the specifics of the year-over-year change, we have a view that, over the next decade, there's going to be a significant expansion of small cells utilized by all of the carriers to improve the data experience that consumers enjoy. And as we look across the business that we have today and the $3 billion of capital that we've invested, we think we've barely scratched the surface on what the opportunity is there. In the near term, given the amount of time that it takes to build these projects in the neighborhood of 12 to 18 months, we have a lot of visibility around what we think that revenue growth is, which we're providing in our 2017 outlook. But beyond that, we think there is potential for additional upside as both we invest and expand these systems and, at the same time, co-locate additional tenant nodes on the systems that have already been built. And the other thing I would say about this is this entire strategy really comes back to sort of the core driver of everything that we think around the business. We're investing capital with the goal of increasing our dividend over the long term. And so the opportunities that we see in small cells and the returns that we're talking about, we're excited about them because of their potential to continue to drive the dividend over the long period of time and potentially even increase the growth rate of that dividend growth over a long period of time. And everything that we're seeing, as we've talked about the business as a whole, as you look at the sequential change or the year-over-year change in small cells, we're seeing growth in incremental margins and we're seeing expansion of the revenue. That certainly tells the story. And then if we go all the way down to a single market area, we see that thesis that we've had for several years really playing out as we expected. And we're pretty excited about what it could mean for us over the long term."

The real issue is the geographic coverage of small cells as compared to a tower. A tower is going to cover anywhere between 0.125 and 0.5 a mile of geography around a given macro site, and a small cell is going to cover a couple hundred feet. And so if you were trying to replicate with small cells the coverage of towers, the quantity of those would probably be well in excess of 15, 20, 25, maybe 30-plus small cells in order to get anywhere close to the capacity of a macro -- a single macro site. And the economics of a small cell are about 1/3 of that of towers. So from a cost standpoint, it just doesn't ever make sense utilize small cells as a replacement for macro sites, which is why we don't see that happening. But where they do, do it is, as I mentioned in the comments, Rick, earlier to Brett, where they are doing it is in places where it makes that macro site more efficient. So I just don't -- we're not concerned at all that small cells are going to cannibalize macro sites and the demand for macro sites because of the cost element of that. And if you look at what is the main driver of that cost, it's the cost to construct and build the fiber, which makes up the vast majority of the cost of small cell nodes. And that cost is not going to come down over time. That's a construction cost. It's likely an escalating cost over time rather than a cost that would decline, say, with the reduction of the cost of technology. So I think the economics, if you look at it on a comparison basis, would suggest macro sites are definitely the preferable approach for the carriers when it will solve the problem."

So what that does is twofold: it increases the '16 base and decreases what could happen in '17. So that's baked in. And the second is what Jay talked about as part of the prepared remarks is that we do see $15 million of incremental growth on small cells. So we've talked about, historically, that being about $55 million of growth in small cell revenues in '16. And we're looking for something in the $70 million neighborhood going into '17. And then from macro towers, we see similar growth from '16 going into '17. So no real slowdown at all and a pickup in the small cells, which when you put all that together gets to the growth we've shown. It's just -- unfortunately, it's offset by this prepaid rent that we've talked about a bit on the call today. That's coming down in growth by $25 million, which reduces the growth rate a fair amount. So we see on kind of the core activity growth, small cells increasing and towers staying the same and the noncash portion coming down from a growth perspective. And just to expand a bit on that on the prepaid, it's really related to prior year more than this year because it's the amortization over a long period of time. And so really as the leveling off occurs, like I mentioned earlier, the Tower business, that's what's driving the lower growth as opposed to anything that's impacting this year's activity."

One of the benefits of the supplement, I would say, is that you can see clearly and go back over time and see that there hasn't been any change in that escalator. It's set right in where we expected it to several years ago. So we've not seen any change in our pricing constructs with our tenants and don't expect that we're going to see any change in that pricing construct. Ultimately, the conversation around price goes to the very attractive value proposition that we have with the carriers. We're sharing the infrastructure across multiple carriers, and the cost of their leasing of these sites or use of these sites is a cost that's sub-3%. So when they look at -- including the effects of all of the amendments that they've done over time and adding additional equipment on the site in order to upgrade through multiple technologies, we're still providing that infrastructure at a very attractive cost proposition to them. And so when there is conversations around the construct and the lease arrangement between us and the carriers, which there have been dating all the way back to 1999 when we first leased these assets, the conversation always went right to what is the value proposition? What are they receiving in exchange for what the cost otherwise would have been? And that value proposition remains intact, and we think it remains very attractive. The last point I'll make about this is the underlying cost of this real estate, as Simon referenced earlier, around municipalities and zoning and other things has driven the cost of the real estate up faster than the carrier's cost to share that infrastructure over time. And so the underlying cost of the real estate is very supportive of what we're able to achieve on the escalation side, and we see that remaining intact. And we haven't seen and nor do I expect we'll see a real change in the pricing construct."

The first one, I'm just curious if you're finding that having both a macro portfolio as well as small cells is helping one another? So having small cells has helped your macro business or having macro in a given area has helped you win small cell deals that were otherwise, I guess, being competitively bid. And then my second question has to do with the cost of small cells. So at CTIA, one of the takeaways I had was that the carriers are pushing that if we're going to build out hundreds of thousands if not millions of these over a period of time, versus today the typical carrier has, I don't know, 40,000 or 60,000 or 70,000 macro cell sites out there, the cost has to come down significantly. And there's talk about is $500 a node or $200 a node the right price. And one of the ways I've thought about it is that you could actually, as a fiber provider, go and share that cost not just across various wireless carriers, but across other industry vertical that might be interested in fiber, such as health care or cloud companies or financial services or education, et cetera. How big of a focus is that for you? And do you see yourself splitting the cost or sharing the cost of fiber in small cells with those other verticals? And does that become an increasing area of focus for you as we go forward?"

On your first question related to does having small cells help the macro tower business, I would start by just affirming, as we've done multiple times on the call, the tower business is a phenomenal business. And whether you're in the small cell business or not, we think there's tremendous value that has been created in the tower business, obviously. But we also believe there's a tremendous amount of value that's going to be created in the tower business. And we don't view being in the small cell business as a requirement to be successful -- continued success around the tower business and the growth opportunity there. So I don't think you have to be in the small cell business. The opportunity that we see in small cells, we're there because we believe that will increase and drive dividend growth over a long period of time. So we believe it's a smart allocation of capital that continues to further the growth model but don't view it as a necessity to be in. There's certainly incrementally -- at senior levels of the carriers, it enables a broader conversation about how they're thinking about network deployment. We think that's helpful and informative to us as we think about the long term as we can have a broader conversation. But depending on the returns, there may be a day when we choose not to invest as heavily in small cells. So it's really a return-driven analysis for us but would admit there is some incremental value around the conversation with the carriers. On the second point and your question around the costs need to come down. Again, just like in tower, small cells are shared infrastructure asset that the economics of which are far more attractive to the carriers as a result of us sharing among multiple parties than they would be if they were self-performed or built for only one carrier. So the costs, effectively, are coming down by us being a third-party provider and the initial carrier not bearing the full cost of the deployment and on the ongoing operating cost. We're going to share that across multiple operators. As we think about the potential growth drivers of revenue and cash flow over time, if we think about that as a shareable asset, our primary focus remains on the wireless carriers. And so using this fiber deployment for small cells, we think, is the vast majority of the economic driver for both growth and the opportunity that we see. We have -- as you know from our Sunesys acquisition and in certain geographies, we've used our fiber to provide things like K-12, which is providing broadband to schools. Those are long-term contracts that have provisions that are very similar to towers and that of small cells. And that obviously puts fiber in the areas where people are located and where there's a density of population. And so we've found over time those -- there are some real synergies of revenues around using that fiber for both schools and then, ultimately, small cells or small cells and then secondarily to schools. So there may be, over time, ways for us to continue to sweat the assets. That's not our primary driver at this point, but we do look at some specific cases where we see opportunities for us to expand the revenue and the cash flow."

On the tower side, when you look at the cost structure, both at the direct operating expense side and at the G&A side, we're holding costs, effectively, flat. We would expect in normal course, just the cost of living adjustment to be about 3% increases year-over-year. And we're well inside of that on towers, basically holding everything roughly flat year-over-year. So that drives incremental margins that are extremely high, well over 80%. About 90% would be our expectation  as we think about 2017 on the tower side. On the small cell side, we've got a combination of 2 things going on. On the systems where we're co-locating, we're seeing very high incremental returns which expand the margins on the systems where we're seeing co-location. As we put new systems on air, those -- the margins on those new systems are in the neighborhood of about 60% for a new system. So those immature assets, if you want to think about them that way, those immature assets with slightly lower margins than the overall average basically hold the average down. And we don't see the full benefit of the incremental margins that we're seeing on small cells from a co-location standpoint. And how that progresses over time will largely be a function of how many opportunities do we have in front of us, how much do we invest on the deployment of additional systems, and then the margins will fall out from there. If you fast-forward all the way to the end of this, when the market becomes more saturated in terms of the deployment of those systems, what we see on individual systems is margins that expand at paces that are in line with what we've seen historically for towers. And so rolling forward to a very long view of small cells, I think you'll continue to see the margins expand and approaching levels that we've enjoyed in the tower business."

So it is part of the economics we enter into. And if we hadn't gotten the rent upfront, we'd be putting it in new leasing activity revenue. But if we don't put it there or take credit for it from the capital side, it gets lost in that. So we think of it as tied to leasing activity. The reason why it's growing less isn't necessarily reflective of the current activity in '16 or '17 because the current -- the activity in '16, we said, is about flat from '15 and is about flat to '17. That's why it is actually plateauing, and the growth and prepaid rent amortization is coming down. So what it's speaking to is, specifically on the tower side, is the growth is the same year-over-year, which is why you're not seeing incremental prepaid amortization.

These systems -- and just to take you back to kind of how we would think about underwriting Chicago and how we did think about underwriting Chicago, we would look at return based on the cost of deployment of the fiber. So obviously, in a central business district, as you would expect, the cost of deploying that fiber would be significantly greater than as we move out to suburb, generally speaking in a metro market. And so the number of nodes required to get to an acceptable IRR or yield on that investment is going to differ based on the cost. What I would tell you generally, Walter, is that the pace of leasing on small cells has been about twice the pace of that of towers that we've seen historically. And the returns, to kind of your last question, the returns track that. So we're 3 years in on the Chicago system, roughly from 2013 to 2016 and then some of that under construction in this 2017, so call it 3 to 4 years of snapshot there. And the yield is in the double-digit area, around 10%. That took us over a decade in the tower -- on the tower side. And that kind of yield on invested capital is well in excess of our cost of capital and provides a terrific return. Now we certainly don't think we're done in Chicago. We're early days on this. And so we think the yields and returns continue to expand well beyond what we underwrote when we invested that capital."

On your second question -- again, this goes back to existing fiber and the capacity of that fiber to provide this kind of solution. It takes a lot of capacity of fiber.

27198,403874583,1059157,"Crown Castle International Corp.

Appreciate you joining the call this morning. As you saw from our earnings release yesterday, we delivered another great quarter of financial results that exceeded our expectations as the leasing environment continues at a healthy pace across both towers and small cells, allowing us to once again increase our outlook for full year 2016. We also increased our dividend by 7%, reflecting our expectations of continued growth in 2017 and consistent with our goal of increasing dividends 6% to 7% per year. 
As we discuss further on this call, we believe the healthy leasing environment will continue into 2017. Specifically, our 2017 outlook assumes higher growth of approximately $15 million from small cells and similar growth from towers as compared to 2016. The growth we see in our business is fundamentally driven by the strong growth in demand for mobile data, which we believe will continue given the continued adoption of data-intensive applications such as video streaming; the increasing number of devices that are being connected with the growing importance of the Internet of Things; and the potential for new applications to be deployed in the years ahead that will rely heavily on mobile networks such as fixed wireless broadband, autonomous cars and augmented reality, just to name a few. With this expected growth in demand for mobile data, we believe the wireless carriers will invest steadily in their networks, including leasing our infrastructure in the coming years, much like they have historically, to serve the growing and unmet demand for wireless connectivity.
As we have seen over the last 2 decades, our approximately 40,000 towers are the first option in network deployment given their efficiency and cost effectiveness. More recently, the carriers have looked to small cells to add to their capacity in their networks. Therefore, over the last few years, we've begun to invest more significantly in this area of our business. This investment has been based on 3 fundamental characteristics that we believe make small cells very similar to that of towers. First, the shared economic model of small cells drives down our carrier's cost of deployment. Second, our margins and returns increase over time as the carriers lease more tenant nodes across our fiber. And third, the total addressable market is very sizable.
To illustrate these points, I'd like to walk you through our experience in Chicago using Slide 4. In 2013, we had approximately 300 tenant nodes on-air on approximately 100 miles of fiber or approximately 3 tenant nodes per mile of fiber. Of these 300 nodes, approximately 90% were focused in the downtown area. Fast-forward to today, we have approximately 1,100 nodes on-air and under construction on 250 miles of fiber, with the tenant nodes density at approximately 5 tenant nodes per mile. This results in a yield on our investment in Chicago of about 10%.
Importantly, more than half of these nodes are situated outside of the central business district, which demonstrates both the expansion beyond the central business district and, at the same time, the densification in the central business district that has occurred over that time. The expansion beyond the central business district into the surrounding Chicago suburbs is an example of why we believe the total addressable market for small cells will be so significant. Chicago is representative of what we're seeing throughout major U.S. metro markets, which is why we remain so bullish on the opportunities we see in small cells. We believe this growth opportunity from small cells, combined with the growth from our towers, uniquely positions us to capitalize on the evolution of wireless networks through the extension of our shared infrastructure model that continues to efficiently and cost effectively serve carrier needs.
The strength of our business model, the underlying strong fundamentals driving wireless investment and the uniqueness of our assets gives us confidence in our ability to continue to deliver 6% to 7% growth in dividends per share annually. We believe this expected growth, combined with our current dividend yield of approximately 4%, provides a very attractive total return opportunity.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Dan to go through a few more details around our financial results."
27198,403874583,1059157,"Crown Castle International Corp. (REIT), Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 21, 2016",2016-10-21,"Earnings Calls","Crown Castle Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Jay, and good morning, everyone. As Jay mentioned, we have a lot of good things to discuss on the call today. We exceeded our third quarter guidance range and raised our full year 2016 outlook, reflecting the continuation of the strong operating p",1320,"Thanks, Jay, and good morning, everyone. As Jay mentioned, we have a lot of good things to discuss on the call today. We exceeded our third quarter guidance range and raised our full year 2016 outlook, reflecting the continuation of the strong operating performance our team has driven throughout the year and the healthy leasing environment we continue to see. At the midpoint, our updated full year 2016 outlook for AFFO per share of $4.73 is up 10% compared to 2015. This growth includes approximately 200 basis points of benefit from acquisitions.
We also provided our outlook for full year 2017 results, which, at the midpoint, calls for AFFO per share of $5.01, up 6% over our updated 2016 outlook. Additionally, we increased our dividend by 7% from an annualized $3.54 per share to an annualized $3.80 per share, demonstrating our strong belief in the growth in the cash flows we will be able to generate from our high-quality asset portfolio.
Turning to Slide 5. Our third quarter results for site rental revenues, site rental gross margin, adjusted EBITDA and AFFO each exceeded the high end of our previously provided third quarter 2016 outlook, reflecting the continued strength of the overall operating environment. For AFFO, the quarter benefited from $7 million in lower-than-expected sustaining capital expenditures. To be clear, this benefit was due to timing, and we expect that capital will now be spent during the fourth quarter. Adjusting for the timing benefit and lower sustaining capital expenditures, we still would have exceeded the high end of our third quarter outlook for AFFO and AFFO per share.
Moving on to investment activities. During the quarter, we invested approximately $220 million in capital expenditures, consisting of $19 million in sustaining capital expenditures and approximately $200 million for discretionary investment opportunities. Included in the discretionary investments is approximately $17 million of land purchases we completed to further strengthen our control of the ground beneath our towers, which aligns with our central focus of securing long-term high-quality cash flows. The remaining discretionary investments were focused on opportunities to expand our unique portfolio of shared wireless infrastructure assets and position us to capture more future growth opportunities as our carrier customers continue to invest in their wireless networks.
We believe these net investments will generate compelling long-term returns and enhance our ability to deliver long-term growth and dividends per share. As an example of the compelling returns we generate, I wanted to highlight the investments we have made in our small cell business. To date, we have invested $2.6 billion on a net basis in small cells. These investments have resulted in that business now generating over $400 million per year of site rental revenues and a recurring yield of 6% to 7%.
In broad terms, this yield is comprised of 3 major investments. First, in 2012, we invested $1 billion for NextG, which provided us with an industry-leading platform and significant first mover's advantage that we see the benefits of on a daily basis. This investment was made at an initial yield of 3%.
Second, in 2015, we invested about $1 billion to purchase Sunesys, which provided us with an attractive dense, dark metro fiber footprint in top markets where significant small cell deployments are occurring. This investment was made at an initial yield of 6% to 7%.
Lastly, we have made $600 million of net investments outside of these 2 acquisitions, which give us an expanding asset base on which to deploy additional small cells. These investments are generating a yield of low double digits, demonstrating the higher margins and returns we are driving through co-location. As Jay mentioned, these results reinforce our view that small cells exhibit similar shared economics as towers and provide us with attractive growth opportunities in the future.
Moving on to financing activities. During the quarter, we once again accessed the investment-grade bond market to proactively manage our balance sheet, issuing $700 million of unsecured notes to refinance debt maturities coming due in 2017 and borrowings under our credit facilities. With this successful refinancing, our balance sheet remains in great shape, with no significant maturities between now and 2020, ample liquidity under our credit facilities and approximately 80% fixed-rate debt. Additionally, during the quarter, we returned significant capital to our shareholders through our quarterly common stock dividend of $299 million in the aggregate or $0.885 per share.
Turning to our 2017 outlook on Slide 7. Focusing on the midpoint and going from left to right, our expectations for growth in site rental revenues of approximately $100 million includes approximately $155 million from organic contribution to site rental revenues, which is comprised of the following: anticipated new leasing activity of approximately $160 million, which assumes approximately $15 million of higher growth from small cells and a level of growth in towers consistent with the healthy levels we are seeing in 2016. All of this is offset by approximately $25 million less growth from the amortization of deferred credits, which we commonly refer to as prepaid rent, as compared to the growth we saw in 2016. Importantly, we expect to collect a similar level of prepaid rent in 2017 as we are collecting in 2016.
In addition to new leasing activity, our organic growth is also supported by annual contracted tenant escalators, which we expect will contribute approximately $80 million to $85 million in growth during 2017. Growth from new leasing activity and tenant escalations is expected to be offset by tenant nonrenewals of approximately $85 million to arrive at organic growth of approximately $155 million or 5% growth year-over-year. The change in straight line, which is an adjustment for GAAP purposes related to our fixed rate escalators, and contributions from acquisitions made during 2016 bridge the remaining amount to arrive at expected site rental revenue growth of around $100 million.
Turning to Slide 8. I want to spend a moment walking you through the approximately $145 million expected growth in AFFO at the midpoint of our outlook. Picking up where we left off on the prior slide, with organic contribution to site rental revenues, the $155 million of growth is partially offset by a $35 million increase in normal ongoing operating and G&A expenses as well as a $10 million reduction in services gross margin from 2016 to 2017. Additionally, with the conversion of our mandatory preferred stock, AFFO increases by $44 million, representing the amount of annual preferred dividends we paid in 2016 that we're no longer obligated to pay in 2017. And finally, 2017 AFFO growth is expected to be negatively impacted by approximately $10 million on a net basis from other items, including cash interest expense, sustaining capital expenditures and the contribution from acquisitions that occurred in 2016. The growth of $145 million at the midpoint in AFFO represents an approximately -- an approximate 9% increase over 2016. On a per share basis, AFFO growth is expected to be 6%, including about 100 basis point headwind from the preferreds that will convert into approximately 11.6 million additional common shares on November 1 of this year. Based on our expectations for 2017 and our outperformance in 2016 compared to our initial outlook, we have increased our quarterly dividend by 7% per share, further adding to our track record of growing our dividend. 
As Jay mentioned, we remain confident in our portfolio of shared wireless infrastructure -- assets uniquely positions Crown Castle to meet our carrier customers' needs as they continue to build out and enhance their wireless networks to meet the rapid growth in demand for wireless connectivity. These fundamentals give us confidence in our ability to increase our AFFO and dividends per share by 6% to 7% per year over the coming years, which when combined with our current dividend yield of approximately 4%, we believe provides a very attractive total return profile.
With that, Vicki, I'd like to open up the call to questions."

On the first question, obviously, one of the great benefits of our business, both on the tower side and the small cell side, is that there are very high barriers to entry in the business. And so we're accustomed to working through the various local municipalities and what the zoning regulations in those municipalities are. And over time, we've worked with Washington to put in what we believe is some smart federal legislation that creates a path that gets to a timely answer from the local municipalities and communities. And we've continued to see the impact of conversations with the local municipalities as we deploy small cells, and I don't think that's going to come to an end anytime soon. But I would also tell you that, that really demonstrates some of the capabilities and expertise that we have in the business that we're used to dealing with that and can get our carriers deployed on time frames that are reasonable. And so it's not in any way inhibiting our ability to deploy these networks on a reasonable time frame and -- but it certainly gives us an opportunity to set ourselves apart from some of the competition in the market. On your second question, in Chicago, it's a combination of both lease-up on the existing fiber as well as us continuing to deploy additional fiber as we've expanded our fiber footprint around Chicago. As you can see from that slide, in the picture, we've increased the number of nodes per mile on that first 100 miles of fiber that we had in the central business district of Chicago. So a lot of that would be lease-up, if you will, or co-location on that base of fiber. And then at the same time, we've built out a number of miles, about 150 miles, beyond that central business district out into the suburbs. And while we were building that initially for one carrier, we've seen additional co-location beyond that sort of initial build. And it's reflective -- the Chicago market is reflective of really what's happening across the whole country. We're seeing co-location, which we've talked about, about in the neighborhood of about 3/4 of the activity that we're doing is related to expanding the fiber footprint and building new systems for carriers. And then about 1/4 of our activity, roughly, is coming from the co-location of tenants on to existing fiber plant. And the Chicago example shows kind of that same thing as you look at one individual market and how that works."

I was wondering if you could kind of maybe elaborate a little bit more on kind of as new prepaid rents are getting paid, I think you said it would be flat in '17 versus '16, how you're amortizing those?

On the escalators, I think the best way to think about that one is we have about 85% of our contracts that have fixed rate escalators at 3%, and the other 15% are in the CPI range. So with CPI being as low as it is right now, the average is that 2.6% or 2.7% that we're seeing and what we had in our guidance for 2017. On what you call straight-line amortization, the second question you asked, I think you're mixing concepts a little bit. What you asked was really on the prepaid rent, which is different than straight-line amortization. So on the prepaid rent amortization, what it is, is as we get reimbursed for capital upfront, we do amortize that over the life of the contract. So as you think about it, we have about 6 or 7 years remaining on the contract. That's probably not a bad way to model it going forward is over that amortization line. And where that's coming from is both towers and small cells. But the reason that it's reducing, in that $25 million is lower growth in 2017 than it has been in 2016, is that as the tower business has a similar level of activity from year-over-year, the growth in prepaid rent that we are collecting is slowing down to be very similar to where it has been year-over-year, which is what we think is happening in 2017. And therefore, the growth in amortization on the towers is slowing down. Whereas on small cells, as we're building more and more systems, we're still growing the prepaid rent we're collecting, and therefore, the prepaid amortization based on the activity that we're seeing in small cells"

You'll recall a number of years ago where we went down the path with some of the carriers, and they prepaid for rent. And that was often in the form of increased steps in their contracts as they paid for the right to amend the sites rather than doing it one at a time. And so those were embedded in the escalations on those contracts. As you'll recall, for virtually all of 2016, we've been back on a -- as they did amendments, they would pay for each individual and then -- and so we saw our last step during calendar year 2016. So that accounts for most of the movement downward.

Small cells are a means by which the carriers can make the macro sites most efficient and effective in terms of utilizing the spectrum on that particular site. As I mentioned in my comments, and we can see this in the Chicago deployment or we could take you to kind of any major U.S. market where we've deployed small cells and show you a similar trend from the carriers. They're using the macro sites because they're cost effective and efficient. So if you could solve those challenges with macro sites, they would end up co-locating equipment on another macro site. But most of the time, these small cells are being put in and around and very close to existing macro sites in order to reuse the spectrum and create additional capacity. And what happens when they do that is it frees up the tower to provide a bit of an umbrella, if you can think of it that way, an umbrella of coverage over an area and enables the user to have a more ubiquitous and uniform experience with their mobile device. From a practical standpoint, the way all of us as users often see this is we'll have 4 or 5 bars on our phone and yet we can't connect and experience a reasonable data session. The reason for that is that you're receiving, you're seeing the spectrum and the signal at your handset device, but there's not enough capacity in the spectrum to provide that. So by putting a small cell in the general vicinity of where there's an existing macro site, you're offloading some of that capacity without changing the coverage or the necessity at the macro site to deliver the data experience to the consumer. And so they're using small cells, in essence, underneath these macro sites, which both improves the consumer experience as well as frees up the macro site to be as efficient and as effective as it was originally designed. If you were to go -- if we were to go into that -- this example and blow it up to an even greater detail than what we're showing on the slide there, what you would see is macro sites right in the very areas that we're putting in small cells. But we don't believe, based on the conversations we've had with the carriers, their continued desire to both lease towers, as we've talked about on this call, at the same pace that they're doing throughout 2016 and that continuing into 2017, we don't see any slowdown in the activity around towers nor do we see them using small cells as a replacement.

The simple answer to your question is we're expecting more activity around small cells in 2017 than what we're seeing in 2016, and that's the driver of the $15 million of additional growth, increased growth in '17 as compared to '16. That's the result of as we've expanded the asset base, we're seeing co-location and continuing to invest in areas where we're expanding that fiber footprint. Stepping back from kind of the specifics of the year-over-year change, we have a view that, over the next decade, there's going to be a significant expansion of small cells utilized by all of the carriers to improve the data experience that consumers enjoy. And as we look across the business that we have today and the $3 billion of capital that we've invested, we think we've barely scratched the surface on what the opportunity is there. In the near term, given the amount of time that it takes to build these projects in the neighborhood of 12 to 18 months, we have a lot of visibility around what we think that revenue growth is, which we're providing in our 2017 outlook. But beyond that, we think there is potential for additional upside as both we invest and expand these systems and, at the same time, co-locate additional tenant nodes on the systems that have already been built. And the other thing I would say about this is this entire strategy really comes back to sort of the core driver of everything that we think around the business. We're investing capital with the goal of increasing our dividend over the long term. And so the opportunities that we see in small cells and the returns that we're talking about, we're excited about them because of their potential to continue to drive the dividend over the long period of time and potentially even increase the growth rate of that dividend growth over a long period of time. And everything that we're seeing, as we've talked about the business as a whole, as you look at the sequential change or the year-over-year change in small cells, we're seeing growth in incremental margins and we're seeing expansion of the revenue. That certainly tells the story. And then if we go all the way down to a single market area, we see that thesis that we've had for several years really playing out as we expected. And we're pretty excited about what it could mean for us over the long term."

The real issue is the geographic coverage of small cells as compared to a tower. A tower is going to cover anywhere between 0.125 and 0.5 a mile of geography around a given macro site, and a small cell is going to cover a couple hundred feet. And so if you were trying to replicate with small cells the coverage of towers, the quantity of those would probably be well in excess of 15, 20, 25, maybe 30-plus small cells in order to get anywhere close to the capacity of a macro -- a single macro site. And the economics of a small cell are about 1/3 of that of towers. So from a cost standpoint, it just doesn't ever make sense utilize small cells as a replacement for macro sites, which is why we don't see that happening. But where they do, do it is, as I mentioned in the comments, Rick, earlier to Brett, where they are doing it is in places where it makes that macro site more efficient. So I just don't -- we're not concerned at all that small cells are going to cannibalize macro sites and the demand for macro sites because of the cost element of that. And if you look at what is the main driver of that cost, it's the cost to construct and build the fiber, which makes up the vast majority of the cost of small cell nodes. And that cost is not going to come down over time. That's a construction cost. It's likely an escalating cost over time rather than a cost that would decline, say, with the reduction of the cost of technology. So I think the economics, if you look at it on a comparison basis, would suggest macro sites are definitely the preferable approach for the carriers when it will solve the problem."

So on your second question on what we're building in the 5% growth for 2017, we've talked about the pushout of churn from '16 into '17. You can see that in the supplement, where some of the consolidation churn that we expected to happen in '16, we've now pushed out to '17. So what that does is twofold: it increases the '16 base and decreases what could happen in '17. So that's baked in. And the second is what Jay talked about as part of the prepared remarks is that we do see $15 million of incremental growth on small cells. So we've talked about, historically, that being about $55 million of growth in small cell revenues in '16. And we're looking for something in the $70 million neighborhood going into '17. And then from macro towers, we see similar growth from '16 going into '17. So no real slowdown at all and a pickup in the small cells, which when you put all that together gets to the growth we've shown. It's just -- unfortunately, it's offset by this prepaid rent that we've talked about a bit on the call today. That's coming down in growth by $25 million, which reduces the growth rate a fair amount. So we see on kind of the core activity growth, small cells increasing and towers staying the same and the noncash portion coming down from a growth perspective. And just to expand a bit on that on the prepaid, it's really related to prior year more than this year because it's the amortization over a long period of time. And so really as the leveling off occurs, like I mentioned earlier, the Tower business, that's what's driving the lower growth as opposed to anything that's impacting this year's activity."

I think one of the -- and this question's, obviously, come up a number of times over the last few quarters. One of the benefits of the supplement, I would say, is that you can see clearly and go back over time and see that there hasn't been any change in that escalator. It's set right in where we expected it to several years ago. So we've not seen any change in our pricing constructs with our tenants and don't expect that we're going to see any change in that pricing construct. Ultimately, the conversation around price goes to the very attractive value proposition that we have with the carriers. We're sharing the infrastructure across multiple carriers, and the cost of their leasing of these sites or use of these sites is a cost that's sub-3%. So when they look at -- including the effects of all of the amendments that they've done over time and adding additional equipment on the site in order to upgrade through multiple technologies, we're still providing that infrastructure at a very attractive cost proposition to them. And so when there is conversations around the construct and the lease arrangement between us and the carriers, which there have been dating all the way back to 1999 when we first leased these assets, the conversation always went right to what is the value proposition? What are they receiving in exchange for what the cost otherwise would have been? And that value proposition remains intact, and we think it remains very attractive. The last point I'll make about this is the underlying cost of this real estate, as Simon referenced earlier, around municipalities and zoning and other things has driven the cost of the real estate up faster than the carrier's cost to share that infrastructure over time. And so the underlying cost of the real estate is very supportive of what we're able to achieve on the escalation side, and we see that remaining intact. And we haven't seen and nor do I expect we'll see a real change in the pricing construct."

The first one, I'm just curious if you're finding that having both a macro portfolio as well as small cells is helping one another? So having small cells has helped your macro business or having macro in a given area has helped you win small cell deals that were otherwise, I guess, being competitively bid. And then my second question has to do with the cost of small cells. So at CTIA, one of the takeaways I had was that the carriers are pushing that if we're going to build out hundreds of thousands if not millions of these over a period of time, versus today the typical carrier has, I don't know, 40,000 or 60,000 or 70,000 macro cell sites out there, the cost has to come down significantly. And there's talk about is $500 a node or $200 a node the right price. And one of the ways I've thought about it is that you could actually, as a fiber provider, go and share that cost not just across various wireless carriers, but across other industry vertical that might be interested in fiber, such as health care or cloud companies or financial services or education, et cetera. How big of a focus is that for you? And do you see yourself splitting the cost or sharing the cost of fiber in small cells with those other verticals? And does that become an increasing area of focus for you as we go forward?"

On your first question related to does having small cells help the macro tower business, I would start by just affirming, as we've done multiple times on the call, the tower business is a phenomenal business. And whether you're in the small cell business or not, we think there's tremendous value that has been created in the tower business, obviously. But we also believe there's a tremendous amount of value that's going to be created in the tower business. And we don't view being in the small cell business as a requirement to be successful -- continued success around the tower business and the growth opportunity there. So I don't think you have to be in the small cell business. The opportunity that we see in small cells, we're there because we believe that will increase and drive dividend growth over a long period of time. So we believe it's a smart allocation of capital that continues to further the growth model but don't view it as a necessity to be in. There's certainly incrementally -- at senior levels of the carriers, it enables a broader conversation about how they're thinking about network deployment. We think that's helpful and informative to us as we think about the long term as we can have a broader conversation. But depending on the returns, there may be a day when we choose not to invest as heavily in small cells. So it's really a return-driven analysis for us but would admit there is some incremental value around the conversation with the carriers. On the second point and your question around the costs need to come down. Again, just like in tower, small cells are shared infrastructure asset that the economics of which are far more attractive to the carriers as a result of us sharing among multiple parties than they would be if they were self-performed or built for only one carrier. So the costs, effectively, are coming down by us being a third-party provider and the initial carrier not bearing the full cost of the deployment and on the ongoing operating cost. We're going to share that across multiple operators. As we think about the potential growth drivers of revenue and cash flow over time, if we think about that as a shareable asset, our primary focus remains on the wireless carriers. And so using this fiber deployment for small cells, we think, is the vast majority of the economic driver for both growth and the opportunity that we see. We have -- as you know from our Sunesys acquisition and in certain geographies, we've used our fiber to provide things like K-12, which is providing broadband to schools. Those are long-term contracts that have provisions that are very similar to towers and that of small cells. And that obviously puts fiber in the areas where people are located and where there's a density of population. And so we've found over time those -- there are some real synergies of revenues around using that fiber for both schools and then, ultimately, small cells or small cells and then secondarily to schools. So there may be, over time, ways for us to continue to sweat the assets. That's not our primary driver at this point, but we do look at some specific cases where we see opportunities for us to expand the revenue and the cash flow."

On the tower side, when you look at the cost structure, both at the direct operating expense side and at the G&A side, we're holding costs, effectively, flat. We would expect in normal course, just the cost of living adjustment to be about 3% increases year-over-year. And we're well inside of that on towers, basically holding everything roughly flat year-over-year. So that drives incremental margins that are extremely high, well over 80%. About 90% would be our expectation  as we think about 2017 on the tower side. On the small cell side, we've got a combination of 2 things going on. On the systems where we're co-locating, we're seeing very high incremental returns which expand the margins on the systems where we're seeing co-location. As we put new systems on air, those -- the margins on those new systems are in the neighborhood of about 60% for a new system. So those immature assets, if you want to think about them that way, those immature assets with slightly lower margins than the overall average basically hold the average down. And we don't see the full benefit of the incremental margins that we're seeing on small cells from a co-location standpoint. And how that progresses over time will largely be a function of how many opportunities do we have in front of us, how much do we invest on the deployment of additional systems, and then the margins will fall out from there. If you fast-forward all the way to the end of this, when the market becomes more saturated in terms of the deployment of those systems, what we see on individual systems is margins that expand at paces that are in line with what we've seen historically for towers. And so rolling forward to a very long view of small cells, I think you'll continue to see the margins expand and approaching levels that we've enjoyed in the tower business."

So the [indiscernible] is because prepaid rent really is an economic decision that our customers and we are making together. And we're getting that rent either upfront or as part of the ongoing operation of the business. So it is really tied in some -- on some levels to the new leasing activity. So it is part of the economics we enter into. And if we hadn't gotten the rent upfront, we'd be putting it in new leasing activity revenue. But if we don't put it there or take credit for it from the capital side, it gets lost in that. So we think of it as tied to leasing activity. The reason why it's growing less isn't necessarily reflective of the current activity in '16 or '17 because the current -- the activity in '16, we said, is about flat from '15 and is about flat to '17. That's why it is actually plateauing, and the growth and prepaid rent amortization is coming down. So what it's speaking to is, specifically on the tower side, is the growth is the same year-over-year, which is why you're not seeing incremental prepaid amortization. Whereas on the small cell side, you are because we're continuing to invest in that business, grow it and get more prepaid rent that we're collecting on that business."

These systems -- and just to take you back to kind of how we would think about underwriting Chicago and how we did think about underwriting Chicago, we would look at return based on the cost of deployment of the fiber. So obviously, in a central business district, as you would expect, the cost of deploying that fiber would be significantly greater than as we move out to suburb, generally speaking in a metro market. And so the number of nodes required to get to an acceptable IRR or yield on that investment is going to differ based on the cost. What I would tell you generally, Walter, is that the pace of leasing on small cells has been about twice the pace of that of towers that we've seen historically. And the returns, to kind of your last question, the returns track that. So we're 3 years in on the Chicago system, roughly from 2013 to 2016 and then some of that under construction in this 2017, so call it 3 to 4 years of snapshot there. And the yield is in the double-digit area, around 10%. That took us over a decade in the tower -- on the tower side. And that kind of yield on invested capital is well in excess of our cost of capital and provides a terrific return. Now we certainly don't think we're done in Chicago. We're early days on this.

We're excited about how the business is performing and what we're seeing, and look forward to catching up with you early in the New Year to talk about fourth quarter results."
