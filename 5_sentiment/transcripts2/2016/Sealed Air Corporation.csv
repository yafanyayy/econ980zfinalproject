I'm proud report on behalf of all Sealed Air employees that for the third consecutive year, we executed on our commitments and delivered financial and operational improvements. We stay focused on ou",2529,"Well, thank you, Lori, and thank good morning, everyone. I'm proud report on behalf of all Sealed Air employees that for the third consecutive year, we executed on our commitments and delivered financial and operational improvements. We stay focused on our objectives, and our 3 divisions and functions performed extremely well. For the full year, 2015, we delivered 3% organic sales growth, with favorable price/mix in every division command in every region. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by 230 basis points. Our productivity metric, which is the ratio between our operating expenses to our gross profit improved from 65% in 2014 to 60% in 2015.
And if you look at our operational results, excluding FX and the impact of 2015 divestitures, our net sales increased $217 million, and our EBITDA increased by $212 million. That is impressive and something to be proud of.
Our free cash flow in 2015 was $595 million, which excluded $184 million in CapEx, which included sorry, $184 million in CapEx and $98 million in restructuring. And we returned $802 million to shareholders through share repurchases, and still have $884 million, remaining under our current authorization.
Our get fit and change the game strategy is well underway, and you can see the financial benefit from ""Get Fit"" programs over the last few years. Some of our ""Get Fit"" successes include a tight cultural and strategic alignment, pricing discipline, targeted R&D investments, gross margin expansion, productivity improvements, and working capital management and there is still a lot to be done.
In supply chain for example, our ""Get Fit"" efforts are changing and simplifying how we or how and where very operate to deliver improvements in cost of goods sold, cash management and service. Over the last 24 months, we have consolidated 9% of our total facilities with another planned incremental reduction of 5% over the next 12 to 18 months. We have reduced our total active SKUs by 30% since 2013. And we will continue to optimize SKUs going forward.
In the past 2 years, we have been able to cut our cash conversion cycle by a 1/3, largely to better management of payables and receivables. We have clear targets and will continue making progress in 2016 and beyond with a more consorted effort on inventory management.
Our ongoing commitments to continuos improvement will ensure that we are consistently realizing operational efficiencies. This is the power of being and staying focused. And believe me, our ""Get Fit"" program has many more good days ahead.
At our Analyst Day back in June 2015, we provided a detailed investment plan for ""Change the Game."" Our early successes the long-term potential of this growth opportunities. In Food Care for example, demand for in Europe has exceeded our expectation and in North America is off to a very solid start. Our recently introduced value technology is also seeing similar market acceptance in Europe, and there is already meaningful interest globally.
In diversicare, the acquisition of Intellibot has given us first mover advantage in the robotics carry equipment market. We are also delivering on our commitment to bring new sustainable solutions to the hygiene industry with our 100% value degradable plant-based sure solutions. And there are more solutions like this under development.
And in Product Care, our automated solutions including B+ and Flow Rap are gaining traction and positioning us, as our customers' trusted consumable and equipment partner.
We will execute in 2016 with the same mindset as in 2015. We will deliver profitable growth and maximize free cash flow by focusing on the execution, and operational excellence.  We will stay disciplined on our value-added selling approach and we will continue investing in next generation disruptive technologies.
And before I get into the details of our results, I want to highlight something that I'm very passionate about. And that is sustainability being at the service of financial performance. Companies with sustainability at the forefront of what they do, every day are long-term financial winners in tomorrow's world. At Sealed Air, sustainability is at the very core of what we do. How we innovate, and how we invest. As such, following the top 21 agreements in mid-December in Paris, we joined the group of companies who clearly, wanted to commit. We pledge to disclose both the total financial impact and the environmental benefit of all new product introductions to our customers.
Proving our leadership, we were recognized for the second consecutive year by CDP for our sustainability efforts and has been awarded the position in CDP's climate indices, which puts us in the top 10% of global S&P companies. We were listed in CDP's supplier a list and received a 100% disclosure score compared to an average of 84% for the other companies reporting.
With that said, let me turn to our fourth quarter and year-end results by region and by division, and then, I will pass the call over to Carol for more details on our financials, including our outlook for 2016.
On Slide 4, we present our performance by region for the fourth quarter. Net sales of $1.75 billion were up 2% on an organic basis, which excludes currency and the Food Care divestitures in North America, and in Europe. Let's start with EMEA. We delivered 3% organic growth in the quarter with favorable trends in some of our largest Western European countries, and continued growth in Russia and Turkey.
These results were achieved despite anemic GDP growth throughout Europe and the slowdown in emerging market. Our performance in the EMEA is a direct result of our pragmatic decision to realign our organizational structure enabling our divisions to be well positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities.
In North America, organic sales were relatively flat with 5% growth in Diversey Care, and a slight increase in Food Care upset by a decline in Product Care.
Asia Pacific was also relatively flat compared to last year. We experienced 2% to 3% constant dollar growth in Australia and New Zealand, which was offset by some softness in China, and other Asian countries. Australia and New Zealand combined account for approximately 6% of our net sales and China approximately 3%.
Latin America was hit the hardest with currency devaluation, declining 18% on an as-reported basis, and increasing 7% in constant dollars. Constant dollar growth in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil were attributable to increased demand in our Food Care business. These 3 countries combined, account for at about 7% of our total net sales.
And, as presented on Slide 5, the trends we experienced for the full year are consistent with the comments, I just provided for the fourth quarter. We delivered $7 billion in net sales an increased of 3% on an organic basis with growth in every region.
On Slide 6, we have learned our price/mix volume and sales trends on a constant dollar and organic basis.
We have favorable price/mix in every region throughout the year with the exception of North America in the fourth quarter. We are pleased with this performance given the decline in region, and our formula pricing structure in our Food Care business.
Our results demonstrate the rate of adoption of our advanced portfolio and how our customers are clearly, valuing our offering. At Sealed Air, everything we do and everything we bring to market, not only meets the highest criteria for sustainability requirements, but is designed with the most advanced technologies to help our customers improve productivity and save costs. That is an attractive value proposition in today's global economy.
Turning to our performance by division on Slide 7. Food Care sales increased 3% on an organic basis in the fourth quarter, driven by a combination of favorable price/mix and higher volumes. By region, we delivered 2% and 1% organic growth in EMEA and North America, respectively. Latin America was up 12% in constant dollars, and Asia Pacific was slightly up. Adjusted EBITDA increased 8% on an organic basis, margins of 18.7% expanded 120 basis points compared to last year. Throughout 2015 in every quarter, in every region, we delivered positive organic growth and outpaced our end markets.
In addition to what I highlighted earlier on the we are seeing increased demand for ready meals and our fluid-based solutions. We have 3 effective systems operating in 3 regions around the world, and heading into year end, equipment sales were strong. This is a strong indication of the strength underlying our Food Care packaging business. 
Our hygiene business, our direct hygiene business, our direct food contact chemical solution is designed to improve food safety and is really gaining traction with with our key customers. This quarter, our team in Asia Pacific was awarded the Darfresh Vacuum Scheme Packaging or VSP contract for red meat, poultry and seafood with a large supermarket chain. These breakthrough solutions increases operational efficiencies, extend shelf life, reduces food waste and differentiate this customer from their competition to brand building. This is the first introduction of Doughfresh VSP in this region.
Before I highlight our full year results and 2016 outlook for Food Care, let me briefly provide you with an update on what we're seeing in the North America these markets, which was the down approximately 5% in the fourth quarter and also 5% for the full year 2015.
Industry data points suggest that we are at the bottom in North America, and there is evidence that the market is on track to turn positive in the second half of 2016. Going forward, we are well positioned to continue outperforming the capital market in North America, as production increases, and we continue to penetrate existing and new customers with our advanced portfolio across all proteins and adjacent markets.
For the full year, Food Care's net sales declined 11%, as reported, but increased 4% on an organic basis. Adjusted EBITDA margins of 20.3% expanded 280 basis points. And, as on a reported basis, adjusted EBITDA increased 3%, excluding unfavorable currency and divestitures, adjusted EBITDA increased 18% on an organic basis for the full year. In 2016, we expect Food Care to deliver net sales and adjusted EBITDA growth on an organic basis hence margin expansion.  We expect volume trends in the second half to be stronger, as we reap the benefit of the business cycle turning positive in North America.
Slide 8 highlights the results from our Diversey Care division. Diversey Care net sales on a constant dollar basis were positive 3% up in the fourth quarter. We have favorable price/mix in every region and volume growth in EMEA, North America, and Asia Pacific.
Adjusted EBITDA margins of 11.2% increased 9% on constant dollar basis. Across all regions in Diversey Care, even in Latin America, where the volume is the most challenging, we have improved the overall quality of the operations. We are investing in disruptive technologies and have reshaped our product portfolio with a keen focus on sustainability, productivity, and the integration of chemicals tooling and machinery. 
We have focused our sales and marketing efforts on our core vertical markets, including hospitality, healthcare, facility management, food services and retail. This approach is enabling us to grow our core business and consistently win new customers. In fact, we recently had strategy wins in North American facilities management, as a result of our focus on total cost of ownership and strength in our solutions offering.
You can see the result of our efforts in the performance of North America and EMEA regions. Both of which have delivered constant dollar growth throughout 2015 after years of decline in sales.
And in the fourth quarter, North America was up 5% and EMEA was up 3% in constant dollars. Asia Pacific, where we have solid footing continued to have favorable performance and delivered 2.5% constant dollar growth in the fourth quarter.
Our pipeline for our Intellibot machines continue to grow, and we have over 200 machines operating today in the fields.
We are integrating the advanced robotics capabilities of the Intellibot into our leading by flow care equipment. I can assure you that we have learned a lot about robotics from that acquisition.
We also continue to see strong demand in healthcare for our accelerated hydroge peroxide or AHP technology, with products like For the full year, Diversey Care net sales increased 3% in constant dollar, also on an as-reported basis, declined 8%. This division was hit the hardest by currency devaluations.
We continued our commitment to support our core growth and ""Change the Game"" initiatives by making substantial targeted investments in sales, marketing, and R&D, including the acquisition of Intellibot. Even with this increased investments, we did delivered 10% adjusted EBITDA growth in constant dollars and margins of 11.6%. And going forward in '16, we expect favorable sales and EBITDA trend in Diversey Care on a constant dollar basis and margin expansion. We will continue to focus on profitable growth opportunities, and manage our cost structure to help offset currency headwinds.
Let me now turn to Product Care results on Slide 9. Product Care net sales declined 3% in constant dollars in the quarter, and 1% for the full year. As you know, rationalization efforts have been ongoing over the last 12 months.
Our efforts in Latin America for the most parts are behind us and we look forward to rebuilding our business in that region. In North America, effective in January of this year, we divested another $15 million -- another $15 million of a product line. In EMEA, our rationalization efforts are still underway and are expected to be completed in the first half of 2016. 
If you look at our Product Care business on a global basis, excluding rationalization, it is performing well ahead of our expectations. Throughout 2015, we experienced double-digit growth in e-commerce and third-party logistics, and significantly, improved our profitability in general packaging. We change leadership in both Asia Pacific and Latin America, and are already seeing the benefits of our new go-to-market approach.
It is worth noting that across all of our end markets including the industry segment, which as been relatively soft, we have strong equipment placements heading into year end. This is an indication of future growth and we look forward to capturing that opportunity, as the year progresses.
Our adjusted EBITDA performance really tells the 2015 story for Product Care. In the quarter, Product Care delivered margins of 21.5%, a 360 basis points improvement compared to last year. For this full year, adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 310 basis points to nearly 21%. And on an constant dollar basis, adjusted EBITDA increased 16% in the quarter and for the full year. While some of this growth and margin expansion is the result of lower input costs, more of the improvements came from our rationalization efforts, pricing discipline, and an increasing mix of Global Performance Packaging solutions.
In 2016, we expect volume growth to improve throughout the year, as we complete our rationalization efforts and continue increasing our penetration into the rapidly growing fullfillment markets. For adjusted EBITDA, we expect continued constant dollar growth and margin expansion.
And know, let me pass the call back to Carol, to review our net sales and EBITDA which cash flow and outlook. Carol?"

Turning to Slide 10 and 11, let me walk you through our net sales bridge and adjusted EBITDA performance for the quarter and for the year.  Starting with net sales on Slide 10. We delivered $1.75 billion in sales in the fourth quarter",1341,"Thank you, Jerome. Turning to Slide 10 and 11, let me walk you through our net sales bridge and adjusted EBITDA performance for the quarter and for the year.  Starting with net sales on Slide 10. 
We delivered $1.75 billion in sales in the fourth quarter and $7 billion for the year. On an organic basis, sales increased approximately 2% in the quarter and 3% for the full year. Sales growth was attributable to favorable price mix, which was 1.6% or $32 million in the quarter and 2.3% or $176 million for the full year.
Volume was essentially unchanged in both periods. Unfavorable currency translation was $190 million in the quarter and $764 million for the full year. In 2015, approximately 18% of our total sales were exposed to the euro.  In the quarter and for the full year, divestitures impacted net sales $64 million and $172 million, respectively. 
Turning to Slide 11. For the quarter, adjusted EBITDA of $282 million or 16.1% off net sales was essentially unchanged on an as-reported basis compared to our performance in the fourth quarter of 2014. And favorable currency translation was $30 million, and the impact from divestitures was $11 million.
On an organic basis, adjusted EBITDA increased 15%. This increase was largely due to favorable mix and price/cost spread of $40 million, and restructuring savings of $16 million. We are pleased to have delivered a 190 basis points improvement in adjusted gross margin and 180 basis points improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin compared to last year.
For the full year, adjusted EBITDA increased 5% year-over-year to $1.17 billion or 16.7% of net sales. Unfavorable currency was $126 million, and the impact from divestitures was a negative $33 million. On an organic basis, adjusted EBITDA increased 19%. This increase was primarily due to favorable mix, and price/cost spread of $185 million, as well as restructuring savings of $60 million.
The increase in SG&A and other expenses of $44 million was primarily related to higher nonmaterial inflation costs. We delivered a 230 basis was improvement and adjusted EBITDA margin compared to last year. For the full year, medical and corporate expenses, which is categorized as other in our adjusted EBITDA financial tables was a net expense of approximately $69 million as compared to a net expense of $90 million in 2014. The year-over-year improvement was driven by the strong performance in our medical business. 
Adjusted earnings per share was $0.76 in the fourth quarter and $2.59 for the full year 2015. Currency negatively impacted adjusted EPS by $0.11 for the quarter and $0.38 for the year. Unfavorable FX was offset by higher earnings from operations, lower interest expense, our lower adjusted tax rate and share repurchases.
The adjusted tax rate for Q4 2015 was 8%, as compared with 9% for Q4 2014. For the full year, our adjusted tax rate was 20%, as compared with 22% for 2014. Contributing approximately $0.06 to the that year-over-year EPS improvement. In the fourth quarter 2015, we recorded foreign tax credit that previously were considered not recognizable. In 2015, we repurchased 16.1 million shares for a total value of $802 million. For the full year, average diluted shares outstanding where 207 million compared to 214 million shares in the same period a year ago. Our share buyback had a favorable impact of $0.09 from 2015 adjusted EPS, as compared to 2014.
We have $884 million remaining on our share repurchase program. We ended the year towards the low end of our target leverage ratio of 3.5x to 4x. We believe this leverage range is optimal, given our solid and recurring free cash flow.
Turning to Slide 12. Free cash flow was a source of $595 million in 2015, excluding the tax refund associated with the settlement agreement. Cash interest payments were $224 million, and CapEx was $184 million. Working capital and other assets and liabilities were a source of $50 million in 2015.
We have made meaningful progress over the last few years achieving our operating working capital target of 15% of net sales based on a 13-month average. This is a 200 basis points improvement, as compared to the same period a year ago. And as Jerome noted, there is still opportunity for us to improve inventory management.
Turning to Slide 13. We present our outlook for 2016. We expect net sales to be approximately $6.8 billion, a 3.5% increase on an organic basis. On an as-reported basis, unfavorable currency is expected to be $400 million. We anticipate approximately $250 million of this unfavorable currency in the first half of the year. The impact from the divestitures on 2016 net sales is $102 million, off which $67 million impacted the first quarter. Based on these assumptions, we anticipate net sales in the first quarter to be approximately $1.6 billion. Adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2016 is expected to be in the range of approximately $1.17 billion to $1.19 billion. An increase of 7% to 9% on an organic basis.
On an as-reported basis, we are estimating FX to have a negative impact on adjusted EBITDA of approximately $55 million. We anticipate nearly $40 million of this unfavorable FX in the first half of the year. The impact from divestitures on the 2016 EBITDA is $21 million, off which $14 million impacts the first quarter. Keep in mind that we will have our toughest year-over-year comparison for Food Care in the first quarter 2016, due to currency headwinds, the impact on the divestitures and formula pricing.
On an organic basis, we anticipate adjusted EBITDA to be down slightly. We expect sequentially improvement for the remainder of the year. For the full year, we expect Food Care to deliver organic EBITDA growth and margin expansion. Our medical and corporate expenses are expected to be a net expense of $100 million for the full year 2016, as we continue to invest in our next-generation technology, including sensing, data analytics, and our digital platform. And make further progress on our global ERP rollout.
Our adjusted EBITDA in Q1 is estimated to be approximately $245 million. We expect EBITDA to improve sequentially for the remainder of the year. Our interest expense for 2016 is estimated at $225 million. Depreciation and amortization is forecast to be approximately $285 million. Adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $2.52 to $2.60. The adjusted EPS of unfavorable impact from currency is expected to be approximately $0.18.
Our adjusted EPS outlook for 2016 is based on an adjusted tax rate of 24%. Our free cash flow in 2016 is estimated to be $550 million. CapEx is expected to be $275 million, which is in line with estimate that we provided at our Analyst Day in June. Included in the $275 million is approximately $100 million related to the investments we are making in our Charlotte campus, and $40 million is associated with other capital restructuring activity. Excluding these items, maintenance and growth CapEx combined is estimated at $135 million.
Cash restructuring payments are expected to be $110 million. We expect to realize restructuring savings of approximately $30 million in 2016, and will have a higher savings in 2017. Cash interest payments are expected to be $220 million and cash tax payments are estimated at $125 million. We anticipate working capital to be a source of cash of approximately $100 million.
In closing, we are confident that we are investing in the right market and in the right regions, where there are great opportunities for Sealed Air. We are not ignoring the global environment around us, and we will continue to implement continuous improvement processes to ensure we realize further operational efficiencies.
Our focus on new product adoption and investments in disruptive technologies will drive sustainable and profitable growth in the years to come.

Our Product Care has suffered from top line growth in 2015, as we said earlier, we've divested from a little business in North America effective January 1, we are likely to conclude something else in Europe, which is not a quality business later in the first half. But our value proposition, the acquisition of B Plus, the launch of our Flow Wrap solutions, our new offering are making me really confident.

And then, once again, you have cattle, but you also pork, chicken, et cetera. And we are fairly positive for the other parts of the world with regards to pork production and chicken production.
In the U.S., we believe that in the second half, given the fact that you have a lot of cattle to move the feed block, instead of all designs are out there it's going to be a strong leader for protein. So that comes in market side.
We have grown in a negative environment. We have grown in the U.S. in a minus 5% capital environment in 2015. And this is by adding solutions, a value add solutions to our customers. And therefore, we are very optimistic about what's going to happen in the second half '16."

I'm proud to report on behalf of all Sealed Air employees that for the third consecutive year, we executed on our commitments and delivered financial and operational improvements. We stayed focused",2544,"Well, thank you, Lori, and thank good morning, everyone. I'm proud to report on behalf of all Sealed Air employees that for the third consecutive year, we executed on our commitments and delivered financial and operational improvements. We stayed focused on our objectives, and our 3 divisions and functions performed extremely well. For the full year, 2015, we delivered 3% organic sales growth, with favorable price/mix in every division and in every region. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by 230 basis points. Our productivity metric, which is the ratio between our operating expenses to our gross profit improved from 65% in 2014 to 60% in 2015.
And if you look at our operational results, excluding FX and the impact of 2015 divestitures, our net sales increased $217 million, and our EBITDA increased by $212 million. That is impressive and something to be proud of.
Our free cash flow in 2015 was $595 million, which excluded $184 million in CapEx -- which included sorry, $184 million in CapEx and $98 million in restructuring. And we returned $802 million to shareholders through share repurchases, and still have $884 million, remaining under our current authorization.
Our Get Fit and Change the Game strategy is well underway, and you can see the financial benefit from Get Fit programs over the last few years. Some of our Get Fit successes include a tight cultural and strategic alignment, pricing discipline, targeted R&D investments, gross margin expansion, productivity improvements, and working capital management and there is still a lot to be done.
In supply chain for example, our Get Fit efforts are changing and simplifying how we or how and where we operate to deliver improvements in cost of goods sold, cash management and service. Over the last 24 months, we have consolidated 9% of our total facilities with another planned incremental reduction of 5% over the next 12 to 18 months. We have reduced our total active SKUs by 30% since 2013. And we will continue to optimize SKUs going forward.
In the past 2 years, we have been able to cut our cash conversion cycle by a 1/3, largely to better management of payables and receivables. We have clear targets and will continue making progress in 2016 and beyond with a more consorted effort on inventory management.
Our ongoing commitments to continuos improvement will ensure that we are consistently realizing operational efficiencies. This is the power of being and staying focused. And believe me, our Get Fit program has many more good days ahead.
At our Analyst Day back in June 2015, we provided a detailed investment plan for Change the Game. Our early successes validate the long-term potential of these growth opportunities. In Food Care for example, demand for Darfresh On Tray in Europe has exceeded our expectations and our rollout in North America is off to a very solid start. Our recently introduced barrier technology, Optidur is also seeing similar market acceptance in Europe, and there is already meaningful interest globally.
In Diversey Care, the acquisition of Intellibot has given us first mover advantage in the robotic flow carry equipment market. We are also delivering on our commitment to bring in sustainable solutions to the hygiene industry with our 100% biodegradable plant-based SURE solutions. And there are more solutions like this under development.
And in Product Care, our automated solutions including B+ and FloWrap are gaining traction and positioning us, as our customers' trusted consumable and equipment partner.
We will execute in 2016 with the same mindset as in 2015. We will deliver profitable growth and maximize free cash flow by focusing on the execution, and operational excellence. We will stay disciplined on our value-added selling approach, and we will continue investing in next generation disruptive technologies.
And before I get into the details of our results, I want to highlight something that I'm very passionate about. And that is sustainability being at the service of financial performance. Companies with sustainability at the forefront of what they do everyday are long-term financial winners in tomorrow's world. At Sealed Air, sustainability is at the very core of what we do, how we innovate, and how we invest. As such, following the COP21 agreement in mid-December in Paris, we joined the group of companies who clearly wanted to commit. We pledged to disclose both the total financial impact and the environmental benefits of all new product introductions to our customers.
Proving our leadership, we were recognized for the second consecutive year by CDP for our sustainability efforts and have been awarded the position in CDP's climate indices, which puts us in the top 10% of global S&P companies. We were listed in CDP's Supplier A list and received a 100% disclosure score compared to an average of 84% for the other companies reporting.
With that said, let me turn to our fourth quarter and year-end results by region and by division, and then I will pass the call to Carol for more details on our financials, including our outlook for 2016.
On Slide 4, we present our performance by region for the fourth quarter. Net sales of $1.75 billion were up 2% on an organic basis, which excludes currency and the Food Care divestitures in North America and in Europe. 
Let's start with EMEA. We delivered 3% organic growth in the quarter with favorable trends in some of our largest Western European countries and continued growth in Russia and Turkey. These results were achieved despite anemic GDP growth throughout Europe and the slowdown in emerging markets. Our performance in the EMEA is a direct result of our pragmatic decision to realign our organizational structure enabling our divisions to be well positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities.
In North America, organic sales were relatively flat with 5% growth in Diversey Care, and a slight increase in Food Care upset by a decline in Product Care.
Asia Pacific was also relatively flat compared to last year. We experienced 2% to 3% constant dollar growth in Australia and New Zealand, which was offset by some softness in China and other Asian countries. Australia and New Zealand combined account for approximately 6% of our net sales and China approximately 3%.
Latin America was hit the hardest with currency devaluation, declining 18% on an as-reported basis and increasing 7% in constant dollars. Constant dollar growth in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil were attributable to increased demand in our Food Care business. These 3 countries combined account for about 7% of our total net sales.
And as presented on Slide 5, the trends we experienced for the full year are consistent with the comments I just provided for the fourth quarter. We delivered $7 billion in net sales, an increase of 3% on an organic basis with growth in every region.
On Slide 6, we have learned our price/mix volume and sales trends on a constant dollar and organic basis. We have favorable price/mix in every region throughout the year with the exception of North America in the fourth quarter. We are pleased with this performance given the declines in resin and our formula pricing structure in our Food Care business.
Our results demonstrate the rate of adoption of our advanced portfolio and how our customers are clearly valuing our offering. At Sealed Air, everything we do and everything we bring to market, not only meets the highest criteria for sustainability requirements but is designed with the most advanced technologies to help our customers improve productivity and save cost. That is an attractive value proposition in today's global economy.
Turning to our performance by division. On Slide 7, Food Care sales increased 3% on an organic basis in the fourth quarter, driven by a combination of favorable price/mix and higher volumes. By region, we delivered 2% and 1% organic growth in EMEA and North America, respectively. Latin America was up 12% in constant dollars, and Asia Pacific was slightly up. Adjusted EBITDA increased 8% on an organic basis, margins of 18.7% expanded 120 basis points compared to last year. Throughout 2015, in every quarter, in every region, we delivered positive organic growth and outpaced our end markets.
In addition to what I highlighted earlier on Darfresh On Tray and Optidur, we're seeing increased demand for ready meals and our fluid-based solutions. We have 3 effective systems operating in 3 regions around the world and heading into year end, equipment sales were strong. This is a strong indication of the strength underlying our Food Care packaging business. 
Our hygiene business -- our direct inhygiene business, our direct food contact chemical solution designed to improve food safety and extend shelf life is really gaining traction with our key customers. This quarter, our team in Asia Pacific was awarded the Darfresh Vacuum Scheme Packaging or VSP contract for red meat, poultry and seafood with a large supermarket chain. These breakthrough solution increases operational efficiencies, extend shelf life, reduces food waste and differentiate this customer from their competition through brand building. This is the first introduction of Darfresh VSP in this region.
Before I highlight our full year results and 2016 outlook for Food Care, let me briefly provide you with an update on what we're seeing in the North America beef markets, which was the down approximately 5% in the fourth quarter and also 5% for the full year 2015.
Industry data points suggest that we are at the bottom in North America, and there is evidence that the market is on track to turn positive in the second half of 2016. Going forward, we are well-positioned to continue outperforming the capital market in North America as production increases and we continue to penetrate existing and new customers with our advanced portfolio across all proteins and adjacent markets.
For the full year, Food Care's net sales declined 11%, as reported, but increased 4% on an organic basis. Adjusted EBITDA margins of 20.3% expanded 280 basis points. And as on a -- on a reported basis, adjusted EBITDA increased 3%. Excluding unfavorable currency and divestitures, adjusted EBITDA increased 18% on an organic basis for the full year. In 2016, we expect Food Care to deliver net sales and adjusted EBITDA growth on an organic basis hence margin expansion. We expect volume trends in the second half to be stronger, as we reap the benefit of the business cycle turning positive in North America.
Slide 8 highlights the results from our Diversey Care division. Diversey Care net sales on a constant dollar basis were approximately 3% up in the fourth quarter. We have favorable price/mix in every region and volume growth in EMEA, North America and Asia Pacific.
Adjusted EBITDA margins of 11.2% increased 9% on a constant dollar basis. Across all regions in Diversey Care, even in Latin America where the volume is the most challenging, we have improved the overall quality of the operations. We are investing in disruptive technologies and have reshaped our product portfolio with a keen focus on sustainability, productivity, and the integration of chemicals, tooling and machinery. 
We have focused our sales and marketing efforts on our core vertical markets, including hospitality, healthcare, facility management, food services and retail. This approach is enabling us to grow our core business and consistently win new customers. In fact, we recently had strategic wins in North American facilities management, as a result of our focus on total cost of ownership and strength in our solutions offering.
You can see the result of our efforts in the performance of North America and EMEA regions, both of which have delivered constant dollar growth throughout 2015 after years of decline in sales.
And in the fourth quarter, North America was up 5% and EMEA was up 3% in constant dollars. Asia Pacific, where we have solid footing continued to have favorable performance and delivered 2.5% constant dollar growth in the fourth quarter.
Our pipeline for our Intellibot machines continues to grow, and we have over 200 machines operating today in the field.
We are integrating the advanced robotics capabilities of the Intellibot into our leading TASKI floor care equipment. I can assure you that we have learned a lot about robotics from that acquisition.
We also continue to see strong demand in healthcare for our accelerated hydrogen peroxide or AHP technology, with products like Oxivir. For the full year, Diversey Care net sales increased 3% in constant dollars, also on an as-reported basis it declined 8%. This division was hit the hardest by currency devaluations.
We continued our commitment to support our core growth and Change the Game initiatives by making substantial targeted investments in sales, marketing, and R&D, including the acquisition of Intellibot. Even with this increased investments, we still delivered 10% adjusted EBITDA growth in constant dollars and margins of 11.6%. And going forward in '16, we expect favorable sales and EBITDA trends in Diversey Care on a constant dollar basis and margin expansion. We will continue to focus on profitable growth opportunities, and manage our cost structure to help offset currency headwinds.
Let me now turn to Product Care results on Slide 9. Product Care net sales declined 3% in constant dollars in the quarter, and 1% for the full year. As you know, rationalization efforts have been ongoing over the last 12 months.
Our efforts in Latin America for the most parts are behind us and we look forward to rebuilding our business in that region. In North America, effective in January of this year, we divested another $15 million -- another $15 million of our product line. In EMEA, our rationalization efforts are still underway and are expected to be completed in the first half of 2016. 
If you look at our Product Care business on a global basis, excluding rationalization, it is performing well ahead of our expectations. Throughout 2015, we experienced double-digit growth in e-commerce and third-party logistics, and significantly improved our profitability in general packaging. We changed leadership in both Asia Pacific and Latin America, and are already seeing the benefits of our new go-to-market approach.
It is worth noting that across all of our end markets including the industrial segments, which has been relatively soft, we have strong equipment placements heading into year end. This is an indication of future growth and we look forward to capturing that opportunity as the year progresses.
Our adjusted EBITDA performance really tells the 2015 story for Product Care. In the quarter, Product Care delivered margins of 21.5%, a 360 basis points improvement compared to last year. For the full year, adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 310 basis points to nearly 21%. And on a constant dollar basis, adjusted EBITDA increased 16% in the quarter and for the full year. While some of this growth and margin expansion is the result of lower input cost, more of the improvements came from our rationalization efforts, pricing discipline, and an increasing mix of Global Performance Packaging solutions.
In 2016, we expect volume growth to improve throughout the year, as we complete our rationalization efforts and continue increasing our penetration into the rapidly growing fulfillment markets. For adjusted EBITDA, we expect continued constant dollar growth and margin expansion.
And know let me pass the call back to Carol, to review our net sales and EBITDA bridges cash flow and outlook. Carol?"

Turning to Slide 10 and 11, let me walk you through our net sales bridge and adjusted EBITDA performance for the quarter and for the year. Starting with net sales on Slide 10. 
We delivered $1.75 billion in sales in the fourth quarter and $7 billion for the year. On an organic basis, sales increased approximately 2% in the quarter and 3% for the full year. Sales growth was attributable to favorable price mix which was 1.6% or $32 million in the quarter and 2.3% or $176 million for the full year.
Volume was essentially unchanged in both periods. Unfavorable currency translation was $190 million in the quarter and $764 million for the full year. In 2015, approximately 18% of our total sales were exposed to the euro. In the quarter and for the full year, divestitures impacted net sales $64 million and $172 million, respectively. 
Turning to Slide 11. For the quarter, adjusted EBITDA of $282 million or 16.1% off net sales was essentially unchanged on an as-reported basis compared to our performance in the fourth quarter of 2014. Unfavorable currency translation was $30 million, and the impact from divestitures was $11 million.
On an organic basis, adjusted EBITDA increased 15%. This increase was largely due to favorable mix and price/cost spread of $40 million, and restructuring savings of $16 million. We are pleased to have delivered a 190 basis point improvement in adjusted gross margin and 180 basis point improvement in adjusted EBITDA margins compared to last year.
For the full year, adjusted EBITDA increased 5% year-over-year to $1.17 billion or 16.7% of net sales. Unfavorable currency was $126 million and the impact from divestitures was a negative $33 million. On an organic basis, adjusted EBITDA increased 19%. This increase was primarily due to favorable mix and price/cost spread of $185 million, as well as restructuring savings of $60 million.
The increase in SG&A and other expenses of $44 million was primarily related to higher nonmaterial inflation costs. We delivered a 230 basis point improvement and adjusted EBITDA margin compared to last year. For the full year, medical and corporate expenses, which is categorized as other in our adjusted EBITDA financial tables, was a net expense of approximately $69 million as compared to a net expense of $90 million in 2014. The year-over-year improvement was driven by the strong performance in our medical business. 
Adjusted earnings per share was $0.60 -- was $0.76 in the fourth quarter and $2.59 for the full year 2015. Currency negatively impacted adjusted EPS by $0.11 for the quarter and $0.38 for the year. Unfavorable FX was offset by higher earnings from operations, lower interest expense, a lower adjusted tax rate and share repurchases.
The adjusted tax rate for Q4 2015 was 8%, as compared with 9% for Q4 2014. For the full year, our adjusted tax rate was 20% as compared with 22% for 2014, contributing approximately $0.06 to the that year-over-year EPS improvement. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded foreign tax credits that previously were considered not recognizable. In 2015, we repurchased 16.1 million shares for a total value of $802 million. For the full year, the average diluted shares outstanding where 207 million compared to 214 million shares in the same period a year ago. Our share buyback had a favorable impact of $0.09 on 2015 adjusted EPS as compared to 2014.
We have $884 million remaining on our share repurchase program. We ended the year towards the low end of our target leverage ratio of 3.5x to 4x. We believe this leverage range is optimal, given our solid and recurring free cash flow.
Turning to Slide 12. Free cash flow was a source of $595 million in 2015, excluding the tax refund associated with the settlement agreement. Cash interest payments were $224 million and CapEx was $184 million. Working capital and other assets and liabilities were a source of $50 million in 2015.
We have made meaningful progress over the last few years achieving our operating working capital target of 15% of net sales based on a 13-month average. This is a 200 basis point improvement as compared to the same period a year ago. And as Jerome noted, there is still opportunity for us to improve inventory management.
Turning to Slide 13. We present our outlook for 2016. We expect net sales to be approximately $6.8 billion, a 3.5% increase on an organic basis. On an as-reported basis, unfavorable currency is expected to be $400 million. We anticipate approximately $250 million of this unfavorable currency in the first half of the year. The impact from the Food Care divestitures on 2016 net sales is $102 million, off which $67 million impacts the first quarter. Based on these assumptions, we anticipate net sales in the first quarter to be approximately $1.6 billion. Adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2016 is expected to be in the range of approximately $1.17 billion to $1.19 billion, an increase of 7% to 9% on an organic basis.
On an as-reported basis, we are estimating FX to have a negative impact on adjusted EBITDA of approximately $65 million. We anticipate nearly $40 million of this unfavorable FX in the first half of the year. The impact from the Food Care divestitures on the 2016 EBITDA is $21 million, of which $14 million impacts the first quarter. Keep in mind that we will have our toughest year-over-year comparison for Food Care in the first quarter 2016, due to currency headwinds, the impacts from the divestitures and formula pricing.
On an organic basis, we anticipate adjusted EBITDA to be down slightly. We expect sequential improvement for the remainder of the year. For the full year, we expect Food Care to deliver organic EBITDA growth and margin expansion. Our medical and corporate expenses are expected to be a net expense of $100 million for the full year 2016 as we continue to invest in our next-generation technologies including sensing, data analytics and our digital platform, and make further progress on our global ERP rollout.
Our adjusted EBITDA in Q1 is estimated to be approximately $245 million. We expect EBITDA to improve sequentially for the remainder of the year. Our interest expense for 2016 is estimated at $225 million. Depreciation and amortization is forecast to be approximately $285 million. Adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $2.52 to $2.60. The adjusted EPS unfavorable impact from currency is expected to be approximately $0.18.
Our adjusted EPS outlook for 2016 is based on an adjusted tax rate of 24%. Our free cash flow in 2016 is estimated to be $550 million. CapEx is expected to be $275 million, which is in line with the estimate we provided at our Analyst Day in June. Included in the $275 million is approximately $100 million related to the investment we are making in our Charlotte campus, and $40 million is associated with other capital restructuring activity. Excluding these items, maintenance and growth CapEx combined is estimated at $135 million.
Cash restructuring payments are expected to be $110 million. We expect to realize restructuring savings of approximately $30 million in 2016, and will have higher savings in 2017. Cash interest payments are expected to be $220 million and cash tax payments are estimated at $125 million. We anticipate working capital to be a source of cash of approximately $100 million.
In closing, we are confident that we are investing in the right markets and in the right regions where there are great opportunities for Sealed Air. We are not ignoring the global environment around us, and we will continue to implement continuous improvement processes to ensure we realize further operational efficiencies.
Our focus on new product adoption and investments in disruptive technologies will drive sustainable and profitable growth in the years to come.

We are -- we had growth of -- when apples-to-apples, we had 2.8% growth in 2015. We have an objective of growing 2.5% plus. And very frankly, I'm very pleased with what I'm seeing with our new products, and I could go and take them division by division. So we have our Food Care business, which is going to be helped in the second half of the year by the massive capital situation that we have talked in details about during our Investor Day, saying that it was probably going to be coming in the second half of 2016, and we definitely have now more confidence that it is clearly coming at that time. We have lots of very new products. We talked a lot about Darfresh On Tray, we talked a lot about Optidur. We are -- we have given you projections, 2018 projections for those types of products during our Investor Day. We are ahead of our schedule. We're very pleased. On Diversey Care, we are making very steady progress. Substantial customer wins, a very strong value proposition. Our Intellibot business is going well, our TASKI business is going well, our positioning is very strong. Our Product Care has suffered from top line growth in 2015, as we said earlier, we've divested from a little business in North America effective January 1. We are likely to conclude something else in Europe, which is not a quality business, later in the first half. But our value proposition, the acquisition of B+, the launch of our FloWrap solutions, our new offering are making me really confident. So it's been a long answer, but very frankly, between 2.8 and 3.5, given what we have, is something that we should really be able to do. And this is in an economy which is not good, but when has it been good in the last 3 years?"

I'm proud to report on behalf of all Sealed Air employees that for the third consecutive year, we executed on our commitments and delivered financial and operational improvements. We stayed focused",2542,"Well, thank you, Lori, and thank good morning, everyone. I'm proud to report on behalf of all Sealed Air employees that for the third consecutive year, we executed on our commitments and delivered financial and operational improvements. We stayed focused on our objectives, and our 3 divisions and functions performed extremely well. For the full year, 2015, we delivered 3% organic sales growth, with favorable price/mix in every division and in every region. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by 230 basis points. Our productivity metric, which is the ratio between our operating expenses to our gross profit improved from 65% [ph] in 2014 to 60% in 2015.
And if you look at our operational results, excluding FX and the impact of 2015 divestitures, our net sales increased $217 million, and our EBITDA increased by $212 million. That is impressive and something to be proud of.
Our free cash flow in 2015 was $595 million, which excluded $184 million in CapEx -- which included sorry, $184 million in CapEx and $98 million in restructuring. And we returned $802 million to shareholders through share repurchases, and still have $884 million, remaining under our current authorization.
Our ""Get Fit"" and ""Change the Game"" strategy is well underway, and you can see the financial benefit from Get Fit programs over the last few years. Some of our Get Fit successes include a tight cultural and strategic alignment, pricing discipline, targeted R&D investments, gross margin expansion, productivity improvements, and working capital management and there is still a lot to be done.
In supply chain for example, our Get Fit efforts are changing and simplifying how we or how and where we operate to deliver improvements in cost of goods sold, cash management and service. Over the last 24 months, we have consolidated 9% of our total facilities with another planned incremental reduction of 5% over the next 12 to 18 months. We have reduced our total active SKUs by 30% since 2013. And we will continue to optimize SKUs going forward.
In the past 2 years, we have been able to cut our cash conversion cycle by 1/3, largely to better management of payables and receivables. We have clear targets and will continue making progress in 2016 and beyond with a more concerted on inventory management.
Our ongoing commitments to continuous improvement will ensure that we are consistently realizing operational efficiencies. This is the power of being and staying focused. And believe me, our Get Fit program has many more good days ahead.
At our Analyst Day back in June 2015, we provided a detailed investment plan for Change the Game. Our early successes validate the long-term potential of these growth opportunities. In Food Care for example, demand for Darfresh On Tray in Europe has exceeded our expectations and our rollout in North America is off to a very solid start. Our recently introduced barrier technology, Optidur is also seeing similar market acceptance in Europe, and there is already meaningful interest globally.
In Diversey Care, the acquisition of Intellibot has given us first mover advantage in the robotic floor care equipment market. We are also delivering on our commitment to bring in sustainable solutions to the hygiene industry with our 100% biodegradable plant-based SURE solutions. And there are more solutions like this under development.
And in Product Care, our automated solutions including B+ and FloWrap are gaining traction and positioning us, as our customers' trusted consumable and equipment partner.
We will execute in 2016 with the same mindset as in 2015. We will deliver profitable growth and maximize free cash flow by focusing on the execution, and operational excellence. We will stay disciplined on our value-added selling approach, and we will continue investing in next generation disruptive technologies.
And before I get into the details of our results, I want to highlight something that I'm very passionate about. And that is sustainability being at the service [ph] of financial performance. Companies with sustainability at the forefront of what they do every day are long-term financial winners in tomorrow's world. At Sealed Air, sustainability is at the very core of what we do, how we innovate, and how we invest. As such, following the COP21 agreement in mid-December in Paris, we joined the group of companies who clearly wanted to commit. We pledged to disclose both the total financial impact and the environmental benefits of all new product introductions to our customers.
Proving our leadership, we were recognized for the second consecutive year by CDP for our sustainability efforts and have been awarded the position in CDP's climate indices, which puts us in the top 10% of global S&P companies. We were listed in CDP's Supplier A List and received a 100% disclosure score compared to an average of 84% for the other companies reporting.
With that said, let me turn to our fourth quarter and year-end results by region and by division, and then I will pass the call to Carol for more details on our financials, including our outlook for 2016.
On Slide 4, we present our performance by region for the fourth quarter. Net sales of $1.75 billion were up 2% on an organic basis, which excludes currency and the Food Care divestitures in North America and in Europe. 
Let's start with EMEA. We delivered 3% organic growth in the quarter with favorable trends in some of our largest Western European countries and continued growth in Russia and Turkey. These results were achieved despite anemic GDP growth throughout Europe and the slowdown in emerging markets. Our performance in the EMEA is a direct result of our pragmatic decision to realign our organizational structure enabling our divisions to be well positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities.
In North America, organic sales were relatively flat with 5% growth in Diversey Care, and a slight increase in Food Care upset by a decline in Product Care.
Asia-Pacific was also relatively flat compared to last year. We experienced 2% to 3% constant dollar growth in Australia and New Zealand, which was offset by some softness in China and other Asian countries. Australia and New Zealand combined account for approximately 6% of our net sales and China approximately 3%.
Latin America was hit the hardest with currency devaluation, declining 18% on an as-reported basis and increasing 7% in constant dollars. Constant dollar growth in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil were attributable to increased demand in our Food Care business. These 3 countries combined account for about 7% of our total net sales.
And as presented on Slide 5, the trends we experienced for the full year are consistent with the comments I just provided for the fourth quarter. We delivered $7 billion in net sales, an increase of 3% on an organic basis with growth in every region.
On Slide 6, we have done our price/mix volume and sales trends on a constant dollar and organic basis. We have favorable price/mix in every region throughout the year with the exception of North America in the fourth quarter. We are pleased with this performance given the declines in resin and our formula pricing structure in our Food Care business.
Our results demonstrate the rate of adoption of our advanced portfolio and how our customers are clearly valuing our offering. At Sealed Air, everything we do and everything we bring to market, not only meets the highest criteria for sustainability requirements but is designed with the most advanced technologies to help our customers improve productivity and save cost. That is an attractive value proposition in today's global economy.
Turning to our performance by division. On Slide 7, Food Care sales increased 3% on an organic basis in the fourth quarter, driven by a combination of favorable price/mix and higher volumes. By region, we delivered 2% and 1% organic growth in EMEA and North America, respectively. Latin America was up 12% in constant dollars, and Asia-Pacific was slightly up. Adjusted EBITDA increased 8% on an organic basis, margins of 18.7% expanded 120 basis points compared to last year. Throughout 2015, in every quarter, in every region, we delivered positive organic growth and outpaced our end markets.
In addition to what I highlighted earlier on Darfresh On Tray and Optidur, we're seeing increased demand for ready meals and our fluid-based solutions. We have 3 effective systems operating in 3 regions around the world and heading into yearend, equipment sales were strong. This is a strong indication of the strength underlying our Food Care packaging business. 
Our hygiene business -- our direct in hygiene business -- our direct food contact chemical solution designed to improve food safety and extend shelf life is really gaining traction with our key customers. This quarter, our team in Asia-Pacific was awarded the Darfresh Vacuum Skin Packaging or VSP contract for red meat, poultry and seafood with a large supermarket chain. These breakthrough solution increases operational efficiencies, extend shelf life, reduces food waste and differentiate this customer from their competition through brand building. This is the first introduction of Darfresh VSP in this region.
Before I highlight our full year results and 2016 outlook for Food Care, let me briefly provide you with an update on what we're seeing in the North America beef markets, which was the down approximately 5% in the fourth quarter and also 5% for the full year 2015.
Industry data points suggest that we are at the bottom in North America, and there is evidence that the market is on track to turn positive in the second half of 2016. Going forward, we are well-positioned to continue outperforming the capital market in North America as production increases and we continue to penetrate existing and new customers with our advanced portfolio across all proteins and adjacent markets.
For the full year, Food Care's net sales declined 11%, as reported, but increased 4% on an organic basis. Adjusted EBITDA margins of 20.3% expanded 280 basis points. And as on a -- on a reported basis, adjusted EBITDA increased 3%. Excluding unfavorable currency and divestitures, adjusted EBITDA increased 18% on an organic basis for the full year. In 2016, we expect Food Care to deliver net sales and adjusted EBITDA growth on an organic basis hence [ph] margin expansion. We expect volume trends in the second half to be stronger, as we reap the benefit of the business cycle turning positive in North America.
Slide 8 highlights the results from our Diversey Care division. Diversey Care net sales on a constant dollar basis were approximately 3% up in the fourth quarter. We have favorable price/mix in every region and volume growth in EMEA, North America and Asia-Pacific.
Adjusted EBITDA margins of 11.2% increased 9% on a constant dollar basis. Across all regions in Diversey Care, even in Latin America where the volume is the most challenging, we have improved the overall quality of the operations. We are investing in disruptive technologies and have reshaped our product portfolio with a keen focus on sustainability, productivity, and the integration of chemicals, tooling and machinery. 
We have focused our sales and marketing efforts on our core vertical markets, including hospitality, health care, facility management, food services and retail. This approach is enabling us to grow our core business and consistently win new customers. In fact, we recently had strategic wins in North America in facilities management, as a result of our focus on total cost of ownership and strength in our solutions offering.
You can see the result of our efforts in the performance of North America and EMEA regions, both of which have delivered constant dollar growth throughout 2015 after years of declining sales.
And in the fourth quarter, North America was up 5% and EMEA was up 3% in constant dollars. Asia-Pacific, where we have solid footing continued to have favorable performance and delivered 2.5% constant dollar growth in the fourth quarter.
Our pipeline for our Intellibot machines continues to grow, and we have over 200 machines operating today in the field.
We are integrating the advanced robotics capabilities of the Intellibot into our leading TASKI floor care equipment. I can assure you that we have learned a lot about robotics from that acquisition.
We also continue to see strong demand in health care for our accelerated hydrogen peroxide or AHP technology, with products like Oxivir. For the full year, Diversey Care net sales increased 3% in constant dollars, also on an as-reported basis it declined 8%. This division was hit the hardest by currency devaluations.
We continued our commitment to support our core growth and Change the Game initiatives by making substantial targeted investments in sales, marketing, and R&D, including the acquisition of Intellibot. Even with these increased investments, we still delivered 10% adjusted EBITDA growth in constant dollars and margins of 11.6%. And going forward in '16, we expect favorable sales and EBITDA trends in Diversey Care on a constant dollar basis and margin expansion. We will continue to focus on profitable growth opportunities, and manage our cost structure to help offset currency headwinds.
Let me now turn to Product Care results on Slide 9. Product Care net sales declined 3% in constant dollars in the quarter, and 1% for the full year. As you know, rationalization efforts have been ongoing over the last 12 months.
Our efforts in Latin America for the most parts are behind us and we look forward to rebuilding our business in that region. In North America, effective in January of this year, we divested another $15 million -- another $15 million of a product line. In EMEA, our rationalization efforts are still underway and are expected to be completed in the first half of 2016. 
If you look at our Product Care business on a global basis, excluding rationalization, it is performing well ahead of our expectations. Throughout 2015, we experienced double-digit growth in e-commerce and third-party logistics, and significantly improved our profitability in general packaging. We changed leadership in both Asia-Pacific and Latin America, and are already seeing the benefits of our new go-to-market approach.
It is worth noting that across all of our end markets including the industrial segments, which has been relatively soft, we have strong equipment placements heading into yearend. This is an indication of future growth and we look forward to capturing that opportunity as the year progresses.
Our adjusted EBITDA performance really tells the 2015 story for Product Care. In the quarter, Product Care delivered margins of 21.5%, a 360 basis points improvement compared to last year. For the full year, adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 310 basis points to nearly 21%. And on a constant dollar basis, adjusted EBITDA increased 16% in the quarter and for the full year. While some of this growth and margin expansion is the result of lower input cost, more of the improvements came from our rationalization efforts, pricing discipline, and an increasing mix of Global Performance Packaging solutions.
In 2016, we expect volume growth to improve throughout the year, as we complete our rationalization efforts and continue increasing our penetration into the rapidly growing fulfillment markets. For adjusted EBITDA, we expect continued constant dollar growth and margin expansion.
And now let me pass the call back to Carol, to review our net sales and EBITDA bridges cash flow and outlook. Carol?"

Turning to Slide 10 and 11, let me walk you through our net sales bridge and adjusted EBITDA performance for the quarter and for the year. Starting with net sales on Slide 10. We delivered $1.75 billion in sales in the fourth quarter",1347,"Thank you, Jerome. Turning to Slide 10 and 11, let me walk you through our net sales bridge and adjusted EBITDA performance for the quarter and for the year. Starting with net sales on Slide 10. 
We delivered $1.75 billion in sales in the fourth quarter and $7 billion for the year. On an organic basis, sales increased approximately 2% in the quarter and 3% for the full year. Sales growth was attributable to favorable price mix which was 1.6% or $32 million in the quarter and 2.3% or $176 million for the full year.
Volume was essentially unchanged in both periods. Unfavorable currency translation was $190 million in the quarter and $764 million for the full year. In 2015, approximately 18% of our total sales were exposed to the euro. In the quarter and for the full year, divestitures impacted net sales $64 million and $172 million, respectively. 
Turning to Slide 11. For the quarter, adjusted EBITDA of $282 million or 16.1% of net sales was essentially unchanged on an as-reported basis compared to our performance in the fourth quarter of 2014. Unfavorable currency translation was $30 million, and the impact from divestitures was $11 million.
On an organic basis, adjusted EBITDA increased 15%. This increase was largely due to favorable mix and price/cost spread of $40 million, and restructuring savings of $16 million. We are pleased to have delivered 190 basis point improvement in adjusted gross margin and 180 basis point improvement in adjusted EBITDA margins compared to last year.
For the full year, adjusted EBITDA increased 5% year-over-year to $1.17 billion or 16.7% of net sales. Unfavorable currency was $126 million and the impact from divestitures was a negative $33 million. On an organic basis, adjusted EBITDA increased 19%. This increase was primarily due to favorable mix and price/cost spread of $185 million, as well as restructuring savings of $60 million.
The increase in SG&A and other expenses of $44 million was primarily related to higher nonmaterial inflation costs. We delivered a 230 basis point improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin compared to last year. For the full year, medical and corporate expenses, which is categorized as other in our adjusted EBITDA financial tables, was a net expense of approximately $69 million as compared to a net expense of $90 million in 2014. The year-over-year improvement was driven by the strong performance in our medical business. 
Adjusted earnings per share was $0.60 -- was $0.76 in the fourth quarter and $2.59 for the full year 2015. Currency negatively impacted adjusted EPS by $0.11 for the quarter and $0.38 for the year. Unfavorable FX was offset by higher earnings from operations, lower interest expense, a lower adjusted tax rate and share repurchases.
The adjusted tax rate for Q4 2015 was 8%, as compared with 9% for Q4 2014. For the full year, our adjusted tax rate was 20% as compared with 22% for 2014, contributing approximately $0.06 to the that year-over-year EPS improvement. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded foreign tax credits that previously were considered not recognizable. In 2015, we repurchased 16.1 million shares for a total value of $802 million. For the full year, the average diluted shares outstanding were 207 million compared to 214 million shares in the same period a year ago. Our share buyback had a favorable impact of $0.09 on 2015 adjusted EPS as compared to 2014.
We have $884 million remaining on our share repurchase program. We ended the year towards the low end of our target leverage ratio of 3.5x to 4x. We believe this leverage range is optimal, given our solid and recurring free cash flow.
Turning to Slide 12. Free cash flow was a source of $595 million in 2015, excluding the tax refund associated with the settlement agreement. Cash interest payments were $224 million and CapEx was $184 million. Working capital and other assets and liabilities were a source of $50 million in 2015.
We have made meaningful progress over the last few years achieving our operating working capital target of 15% of net sales based on a 13-month average. This is a 200 basis point improvement as compared to the same period a year ago. And as Jerome noted, there is still opportunity for us to improve inventory management.
Turning to Slide 13. We present our outlook for 2016. We expect net sales to be approximately $6.8 billion, a 3.5% increase on an organic basis. On an as-reported basis, unfavorable currency is expected to be $400 million. We anticipate approximately $250 million of this unfavorable currency in the first half of the year. The impact from the Food Care divestitures on 2016 net sales is $102 million, of which $67 million impacts the first quarter. Based on these assumptions, we anticipate net sales in the first quarter to be approximately $1.6 billion. Adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2016 is expected to be in the range of approximately $1.17 billion to $1.19 billion, an increase of 7% to 9% on an organic basis.
On an as-reported basis, we are estimating FX to have a negative impact on adjusted EBITDA of approximately $65 million. We anticipate nearly $40 million of this unfavorable FX in the first half of the year. The impact from the Food Care divestitures on the 2016 EBITDA is $21 million, of which $14 million impacts the first quarter. Keep in mind that we will have our toughest year-over-year comparison for Food Care in the first quarter 2016, due to currency headwinds, the impacts from the divestitures and formula pricing.
On an organic basis, we anticipate adjusted EBITDA to be down slightly. We expect sequential improvement for the remainder of the year. For the full year, we expect Food Care to deliver organic EBITDA growth and margin expansion. Our medical and corporate expenses are expected to be a net expense of $100 million for the full year 2016 as we continue to invest in our next-generation technologies including sensing, data analytics and our digital platform, and make further progress on our global ERP rollout.
Our adjusted EBITDA in Q1 is estimated to be approximately $245 million. We expect EBITDA to improve sequentially for the remainder of the year. Our interest expense for 2016 is estimated at $225 million. Depreciation and amortization is forecast to be approximately $285 million. Adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $2.52 to $2.60. The adjusted EPS unfavorable impact from currency is expected to be approximately $0.18.
Our adjusted EPS outlook for 2016 is based on an adjusted tax rate of 24%. Our free cash flow in 2016 is estimated to be $550 million. CapEx is expected to be $275 million, which is in line with the estimate we provided at our Analyst Day in June. Included in the $275 million is approximately $100 million related to the investment we are making in our Charlotte campus, and $40 million is associated with other capital restructuring activity. Excluding these items, maintenance and growth CapEx combined is estimated at $135 million.
Cash restructuring payments are expected to be $110 million. We expect to realize restructuring savings of approximately $30 million in 2016, and will have higher savings in 2017. Cash interest payments are expected to be $220 million and cash tax payments are estimated at $125 million. We anticipate working capital to be a source of cash of approximately $100 million.
In closing, we are confident that we are investing in the right markets and in the right regions where there are great opportunities for Sealed Air. We are not ignoring the global environment around us, and we will continue to implement continuous improvement processes to ensure we realize further operational efficiencies.
Our focus on new product adoption and investments in disruptive technologies will drive sustainable and profitable growth in the years to come.

We have restructured our product business -- Product Care business, so we -- the comparables are not easy to make here because we have gotten rid of some very low-quality business.

So we have our Food Care business, which is going to be helped in the second half of the year by the massive capital situation that we have talked in details about during our Investor Day, saying that it was probably going to be coming in the second half of 2016, and we definitely have now more confidence that it is clearly coming at that time.

On Diversey Care, we are making very steady progress. Substantial customer wins, a very strong value proposition. Our Intellibot business is going well, our TASKI business is going well, our positioning is very strong. Our Product Care has suffered from top line growth in 2015, as we said earlier, we've divested from a little business in North America effective January 1. We are likely to conclude something else in Europe, which is not a quality business, later in the first half. But our value proposition, the acquisition of B+, the launch of our FloWrap solutions, our new offering are making me really confident. So it's been a long answer, but very frankly, between 2.8 and 3.5, given what we have, is something that we should really be able to do. And this is in an economy which is not good, but when has it been good in the last 3 years?"

Many of these factors are listed in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and as revised and updated on our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, which you can also find on our website at sealedair.com. 
We also discuss financial measures that do not conform to U.S. GAAP. You may find important information on our use of these measures and their reconciliation to U.S. GAAP and the financial tables that we have included in our earnings release. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Jerome Peribere, our President and CEO. Jerome?"

I know it's been a busy morning for many of you joining us today, but hopefully, we have the opportunity to review our first quarter earnings results.

I know it's been a busy morning for many of you joining us today, but hopefully, we have the opportunity to review our first quarter earnings results. I want to make sure and take a few minutes to highlight our performance and what we expect going forward. 
Our first quarter results over all were essentially in line with our expectations. Remember, I told you early February that our first quarter 2016 would be our toughest year-on-year comparable due to currency headwinds, the impact from divestitures and formula pricing in Food Care. This was why we set our first quarter 2016 guidance for sales at $1.6 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $245 million, with $18 million of currency headwinds and $14 million impact from divestitures. And this is about what we have delivered. 
The Food Care pricing formulas, which were highly favorable in the first quarter last year, turned unfavorable as predicted. And if there was a surprise, it was lying in the steepness in Venezuela and Brazil's Food Care volume decline and its related impact on profitability. Having said that, Food Care delivered 4% volume growth in North America and 3% volume growth in EMEA on an organic basis. 
Diversey Care increased volume over 4% in both Asia-Pacific and Latin America, and Product Care volume was up 6% in EMEA and essentially flat in North America, even with our rationalization efforts and ongoing softness in the industrial sector. 
So we're seeing nice volume growth in targeted regions and for the second consecutive quarter, we have seen robust equipment installments. In the first quarter, equipment sales increased more than 10% in constant dollars and all 3 divisions had positive growth. 
Adjusted EBITDA performance was attributable to solid results in our Product Care division, which increased margins 90% [ph] basis points as compared to last year. We also recognized incremental savings from restructuring and demonstrated corporate expense control. 
As I told you in February, that our -- I also told you in February that our performance what improved sequentially throughout the year with an acceleration of growth in the second half. We also said more of our growth would come from volume versus price/mix. And I do confirm that this remains our outlook for each of our 3 businesses, and we are confident in our guidance for the full year. 
Looking ahead for Food Care, further global adoption of our innovative solutions, coupled with a well-anticipated up cycle in the North American beef market, along with improving trends in other regions,  will drive profitable and accelerated growth for the remainder of the year and several years to come. Diversey Care and Product Care has tremendous momentum, thanks to the execution on our Change the Game strategy as does our medical business. And as I mentioned, we have had favorable equipment trends, which is a unique indication, a strong indication of what's to come. 
And before I get into the -- we get into the details of our results, I want to highlight that for the first time since 2010, we announced that the Board of Directors approved an increase on our quarterly dividend. The dividend was increased by 23% from $0.13 to $0.16. We also repurchased approximately 700,000 shares of our stock valued at $32 million in the first quarter, and still have $852 [ph] million remaining under our share repurchase program. 
Karl Deily, President of our Food Care division, is joining us today on our call along, with Carol Lowe, our CFO. So with that, let me pass the call to Carol and Karl, and then we'll answer any questions you may have. Carol?"

On Slide 4 of our presentation, you can see our performance by region for the first quarter. Let me start with EMEA, where we have 3% organic growth and positive sales trends across our 3 divisions. Food Care sales increased 5%; Product",606,"Thank you, Jerome. On Slide 4 of our presentation, you can see our performance by region for the first quarter. Let me start with EMEA, where we have 3% organic growth and positive sales trends across our 3 divisions. Food Care sales increased 5%; Product Care increased 6%; and Diversey Care increased 1%. On a by-country basis, EMEA was led by positive sales trends in France, Italy, Spain, Turkey, Poland and Russia. 
Asia-Pacific was up 1% in constant dollars led by 7% constant dollar sales growth in Diversey Care. Sales in China increased in both Diversey Care and Food Care. India delivered double-digit growth in Diversey Care. Australia and New Zealand combined account for 6% of our total net sales and just over 10% of Food Care sales. In Food Care, Australia was essentially unchanged despite slaughter declines of approximately 17% as cattle farmers initiated rebuilding of their herds. New Zealand was down 6% due to the ongoing weakness in the global dairy market. 
Latin America was hit the hardest by currency devaluations and socio and political instability, particularly in Venezuela and Brazil. On a reported basis, Latin America was down 19%, which translates into 9% growth in constant dollars. We were pleased to see volume growth in Diversey Care, which was attributable to recent customer wins in Chile, Argentina and Brazil. Also, if you exclude Venezuela and Brazil from Food Care results, volume in Latin America would be up 2.5% with strong growth in Mexico and Argentina. 
Let's move to Slide 5 and look at trends in North America. Overall, North America was down 2% on an organic basis due to unfavorable price/mix offsetting positive volume trends. Food Care's 4% volume growth was offset by formula pricing. As Jerome mentioned, Product Care's volumes were up slightly, but this was offset by unfavorable price/mix. As we move through the year, we anticipate volume growth to accelerate for both Food Care and Product Care with customer acceptance of our new portfolio and stronger end market demand. Diversey Care delivered positive price/mix, but it was offset by lower volumes in the distribution channel. 
Our ERP implementation is going well, however, there was some timing impact on the quarter. April sales for Diversey Care have been strong and we expect this growth to continue for the remainder of the year. 
Turning to Slide 6. Let me walk you through our net sales and adjusted EBITDA performance on a year-over-year basis. Starting with net sales. You can see that we delivered $1.6 billion in sales, a decrease of 9% on an as-reported basis and up 1.5% on an organic basis. Volume contributed $15 million to top line growth, favorable price/mix contributed $10 million. Unfavorable currency translation was $113 million, and the impact from divestitures was $67 million. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $243 million or 15.3% of net sales. Unfavorable currency translation was $18 million, and the impact from divestitures was $14 million. Operating expenses increased $30 million, of which salary and wage inflation was $16 million, and inventory capitalized variances were $12 million. These expenses were partially offset by $14 million in restructuring savings and $5 million from higher volumes. 
Adjusted earnings per share was $0.50 in the first quarter. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 21% compared to 25% last year primarily due to our ability to repatriate earnings in a tax efficient manner and a more favorable earnings mix in jurisdictions with lower tax rates. For the full year, we continue to expect our tax rate to be approximately 24%. 
Let me now turn the call over to Karl to go through our results by division. Karl?"
382724,330262018,965685,"Sealed Air Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Sealed Air Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Carol. Let's turn to Slide 7 and review Food Care results. Food Care sales increased 2% on an organic basis, driven by a combination of higher volumes and favorable price/mix.

Food Care sales increased 2% on an organic basis, driven by a combination of higher volumes and favorable price/mix. By region, EMEA increased 5%, while North America declined 1%. Latin America was up 10% in constant dollars and Asia-Pacific was essentially unchanged. Our adjusted EBITDA was $148 million or 19.3% of net sales. This compares to 21.7% last year and 18.7% last quarter. 
If you recall, this time last year, excluding the impact from currency and divestitures, we experienced a significant positive price/cost spread due to positive formula pricing and lower input cost. This year, our first quarter results reflect a tough comparable on formulas, the negative impact from Venezuela and Brazil and the expected slowdown in the Australia and New Zealand business. As Jerome noted, we expect sequential improvement in absolute dollars on both the top and bottom line in the second quarter and accelerated growth in the second half of the year. 
For the full year, we continue to forecast organic growth in sales and EBITDA with margin expansion. 
I want to spend a few minutes on what we are seeing in the marketplace that gives us the confidence in our future performance. First, on a global basis, we continue to see customer adoption and further market penetration across all protein sectors in our case-ready platforms. Darfresh On Tray and ready meals continue to gain significant momentum around the world; second, we are experiencing rapid expansion of our fluid-based solutions, including our vertical pouch packaging or VPP system as well as our asceptic offerings; and third, our customer trials across the globe for our new barrier technology, Optidur, are doing very well. 
As for our hygiene business, we are experiencing continued growth with our direct food contact solutions for food safety and our knowledge base services to optimize water and energy usage. 
We also are beginning to see positive impact of the larger herd size in North America, which is resulting in steady increase in cattle coming in the market. In Europe, where the protein market is relatively stable, we are experiencing organic sales growth as a result of new product acceptance in Western Europe and increased market penetration in Eastern Europe. We look forward to capitalizing on improving end market demand in both North America and Europe, but keep in mind, our growth in 2016 will be partially offset by a continued slowdown in Australia and New Zealand and the economic conditions in both Brazil and Venezuela. 
So if we go to Slide 8, we'll highlight the results from our Diversey Care division. Diversey Care net sales on a constant dollar basis were up just over 1% in the first quarter. We had favorable price/mix in every region and 4% to 5% volume growth in Latin America and Asia-Pacific. Adjusted EBITDA of $36 million was 8.2% of net sales. As a reminder, first quarter is our seasonally weakest quarter, and we continue to expect constant dollar sales growth as well as margin expansion for the full year. 
Also keep in mind, we have continued to invest in disruptive technologies, including specific investments in robotics. We are winning new strategic customers, and we have already started servicing those customers this quarter in facility management and food service industries. Our focus on sustainability, productivity and the integration of chemicals, tools and machinery is being recognized throughout the industry. 
This quarter, from a vertical market perspective, sales increased in food service, retail and hospitality. We have gained traction with our advanced floor care solutions with the installation of IntelliTrail, the advanced GPS tracking system, on more than 1,100 TASKI machines, and we see rapidly the growing demand for our Intellibot portfolio. 
Now let's turn to our Product Care results on Slide 9. Product Care's net sales were essentially unchanged on a year-over-year basis, where volume growth offset by unfavorable price/mix. You may recall that we divested a $15 million product line in North America in January, yet, we held volumes relatively flat as compared to last year. This is attributable to our strong position in e-commerce and third-party logistics for the fulfillment markets, where we continue to experienced double-digit growth. We also have been able to maintain good pricing disciplines despite lower input cost as our customers recognize the value add of our new and innovative solutions combined with our global reach and broad product portfolio. 
I also want to highlight our business in Europe, where we delivered 6% volume growth in light of ongoing rationalization efforts. Our performance was attributable to the successful integration of our B+ acquisition and the traction we've gained with our automated solutions, including the B+ portfolio, FloWrap, inflatable bubble and Sealed Air. In the second quarter, we will divest a $12 million product line in Europe, which should complete our product rationalization efforts. For the year, we anticipate top line growth and margin expansion with a stronger second half of the year given our success in the fulfillment market. 
Now let me pass the call back to Carol to review our free cash flow and our outlook for 2016. Carol?"

Free cash flow was the use of cash of $48 million in the first quarter. CapEx increased to $52 [ph] million as compared to $21 million during the same period a year ago, of which $15 million was related to our Charlotte campus. Working capital and other assets and liabilities for use of cash of $141 million. Operating working capital as a percent of net sales based on a 13-month average is relatively the same since year-end at 14.5%. As compared to a year ago, we improved 160 [ph] basis points. We believe there is still opportunity for further -- to further improve payable and inventory management, even though we have reached our long-term target of 15%. For the full year, we continue to expect working capital to be a source of cash of approximately $100 million. 
Turning to Slide 11. We are reaffirming our outlook for 2016. Net sales are expected to be approximately $6.8 billion. The impact from the Food Care divestitures on 2016 net sales is $102 million, of which $67 million impacted in the first quarter. We continue to forecast adjusted EBITDA in the range of $1.17 billion to $1.19 billion. The impact from the Food Care divestitures on 2016 EBITDA is $21 million, of which $14 million impacted the first quarter. 
We expect our second quarter results to be down on a year-over-year basis, due primarily to formula pricing and Food Care. However, as Jerome noted, we expect sequential improvement in every quarter going forward. 
Our medical and corporate expenses are expected to be a net expense of $100 million for the full year 2016 as we continue to invest in our next-generation digital technologies. Our interest expense for 2016 is estimated at $225 million. Depreciation and amortization is forecast to be approximately $285 million. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be within the range that we previously provided of $2.52 to $2.60. 
At this point in time, we are not updating our outlook on currency translation. As you know, markets have been extremely volatile and we are focusing on what we can control. We are on track to achieve our free cash flow target of approximately $550 million. CapEx is expected to be $275 million, which includes approximately $125 million related to the investment we are making in our Charlotte campus and other capital restructuring activities. Excluding these items, maintenance and growth CapEx combined is estimated to be $150 million. Cash restructuring payments are estimated at $110 million, and we expect to realize restructuring savings of approximately $30 million. Cash interest payments are expected to be $220 million, and cash tax payments are estimated at $125 million. 
In closing, I would like to once again note that we are confident we are investing in the right markets and in the right regions that will enable us to capitalize on future growth opportunities. We are not ignoring the global environment. We have and we will continue to advance continuous improvement in realize further operational efficiency. With our most challenging quarter now behind us, we look forward to delivering improved performance for the balance of the year ended the years ahead. 
Before I open the call to questions, I would like to remind you, our second quarter earnings call is tentatively scheduled for Thursday, July 28. We have invited Dr. Ilham Kadri, President of Diversey Care, to join Jerome and me for the Q2 call.

We need to go back to what we have guided towards, and you remember that it is the first time we gave a guidance for a specific quarter. And we did that because we knew what was happening from the pricing coming negative and growth being somewhat muted at the beginning of the year, the divestiture and the currency headwind. So as far as I'm concerned, really, no surprise. The only surprise has been coming from [indiscernible] Latin America Food Care has been with 6% volume decline, but this is very specific. It's been very specific as a result of Venezuela, which has melted down, and as Brazil, which has had, and call will add a little bit in that, which have seen very, very steep local meat consumption reductions and very high prices of meat. So -- and next to that in Latin America, by the way, our Diversey Care business has been very strong, specifically Brazil, Argentina, Chile and so on. So we said we prepared and we said all of that early February, and we are exactly where we said we would be in the end. With regards to the rest of the year, we are going to be talking specifically about the 3 divisions. But you need to remember that in Product Care to start with, because of the strength and the growth that we have in third-party logistics and e-commerce, we are going to now have this division to have its very specific seasonality toward Q4. And we're extremely optimistic, thanks to our equipment placement and our customer wins, that we are going to have sequentially very nice quarters of growth there. With regards to Diversey Care, we have had some very specific one-off in North America as a result of channel sales being a little bit muted and ERP consequence -- implementation consequences has happened to every single company when they go through that experience. But we are very fine and very pleased with what's going on in North America, specifically happy with what's going on in Asia-Pacific with renewed nice growth in China, for example, strong in India, always, et cetera, et cetera. And therefore, we're pleased with what we've seen. In Food Care, I will let Karl speak more specifically about it. But we've got some tailwind coming from the beef cycle, we've got proteins in general doing quite well and we've got a very nice innovation. All of this makes me confirm that you are going to see, as I said already last year -- late last year and early this year, we're going to have a nice growth, renewing with nice growth, and that this growth is going to be more on volume that it is going to be on price as a result of the raising prices. Karl, some comments on Food Care?"

Just real briefly, I mean, there's no doubt that Venezuela being down almost 59%, Brazil being down 8.5%, are ongoing issues. We do see Brazil though not improving immediately, but there is a medium to long term positive trends in Brazil. I mean, obviously, the Brazilian animal prices are still at a relatively all-time high. We do see retail prices dropping due to lack of demand, but we also see the export market having favorable trends occurring. If you remember, one of the reasons Brazil export market was down is that they were predominantly exporting to Venezuela and Russia, which have their own unique economic issues, but they've gained access -- although some small work yet left to do to gain access to U.S. as an export market. They are gaining significant business in China as an export market and parts of Asia, somewhat to fill the void left by Australia slaughter are being down. So we do believe that's a mid- to long-term positive in Brazil. We're also very favorable and the rest of our emerging markets, where we have over around 5% volume growth. And then we're still very, very positive on our volume growth in North America, 4% in Europe or [ph] 3%, where we basically have a strategy of growing geographically as well as growing in mature markets through innovation. So we're still seeing both of those through -- going through."

But again, it's largely timing. So again, the 2 major components are typical compensation inflation that we have every year as well as the inventory variances, of which most is capitalized and then amortized."

We have internal guidelines that we follow in terms of when we have changes from our standards by more than a certain percentage, typically using a 10% rule of thumb. That can be impacted within a region or country based on the amount of imports that we're doing. Are they impacted by purchase price variances? Are they impacted by FX transaction costs, which are different than translation cost as well as the operational efficiencies that impact our indirect supply chain cost, our fixed and administrative costs for running our factories and our warehouses and logistics on that words. So it's a combination of all of those as we bring them together and looking at the change for inventory values and properly capitalizing the amount so it's reflected in our inventory turns as we move forward.

But corn projections, although up slightly, are still very favorable. The amount of good to very good pasture conditions are still at a high level. So currency is still maybe impact somewhat export, but still, the fundamentals are there. The producers are making money. The cattle operations are making money and there were still retaining heifers. We don't have a balance of steers and heifers coming to market yet. When you see that, that will be an indication that they built the herd as large as they're going to build it, so we do see them continuing to build the herd.

The other is really based around efficiencies, purchase price variances, and that will change quarter-to-quarter, depending on how we're operating in demand and performance. And again, it's amortized, and a lot is driven by where we end with inventory balances of 1 quarter and how we progress through the next. And because of our doable footprint and the impact of currency and everything, it can vary from quarter to quarter, but it is a timing thing. And usually, because our inventory turns about 4x within a year, it typically moves out over the balance of the full year."

So we've also had some depression in the dairy market in New Zealand, so we have 2 key markets for us that the market conditions are unfavorable, but yet we kept relatively flat volumes. And we did that with diversification, new product innovation, disruptive innovations that have allowed us to grow in a down market. We would anticipate that the Australian beef market will stay relatively negative for at least 2 years because they're just starting their herd rebuilding cycle, but they are rebuilding the herd. So again, mid- to long-term, we're still very favorable in that segment of the market. But -- so that's some color in Australia and New Zealand. In Brazil, obviously, Brazil is an important part of our long-range strategy. And we think fundamentally, with the infrastructure they have in producing food, whether it's poultry, beef and a growing amount of pork, that we're well positioned to capitalize on as those markets recover. We're still heavily entrenched in the key customers in that region and continue to provide automation, new product introductions as well to position ourselves for when their volumes return. Venezuela is a more longer time -- term concern. And again, though, they're a nice part of Latin America, but much smaller on the grand scheme of things. So we have great confidence in our total Latin America business, where we're still seeing volume growth minus be 2 areas of concern.

We also know what's going on in Brazil, but the situation is extremely different. What you have is the perfect storm in Brazil. You have had high meat prices and you read the newspaper like me and, therefore, you have had socioeconomical difficulties there. And as you combine very high red meat prices and the situation I just talked about, you have had in the first quarter the highest meat consumption decrease that you ever had since statistics have existed in Brazil. So that's what I would call a temporary factor, because at the very same time, you didn't have very much exports. But exports from Brazil meats are going to be improving and, therefore, as the year passes, we believe that situation is going to be improving, both from the meat prices, capital heard prices and from the economic situation as the rise of political anxiety. So if you exclude Brazil and Venezuela, which it is what it is, we would -- you would have seen that we would have had a solid volume growth in the rest of Latin America, which is very encouraging. So we're not throwing the baby with the back water. We've been very specifically hit in this first quarter. It's not going to be a quick recovery, but the cattle and herd is going to be rebuilding in Brazil also and we're going to have some positive effects from Argentina over time as the new government, government is going to enable exports. They have started to do this at small levels, but they are going to liberalize meat exports. So I think it's -- all of this is positive."

If we were not seeing the growth rate that we have enjoyed, you have seen how strong our North American business has been last year in that division, I would just go and signal to you that we're seeing different things.  We're going to renew with very nice strength and growth."

I know it's been a busy morning for many of you joining us today, but hopefully, you had the opportunity to review our first quarter earnings results. I want to make sure and take a few minutes to highlight our",614,"Thank you, Lori, and good morning, everyone. I know it's been a busy morning for many of you joining us today, but hopefully, you had the opportunity to review our first quarter earnings results. I want to make sure and take a few minutes to highlight our performance and what we expect going forward. 
Our first quarter results overall were essentially in line with our expectations. Remember, I told you early February that our first quarter 2016 would be our toughest year-on-year comparable due to currency headwinds, the impact from divestitures and formula pricing in Food Care. This was why we set our first quarter 2016 guidance for sales at $1.6 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $245 million, with $18 million of currency headwinds and $14 million impact from divestitures. And this is about what we have delivered. 
The Food Care pricing formulas, which were highly favorable in the first quarter last year, turned unfavorable as predicted. And if there was a surprise, it was lying in the steepness in Venezuela's and Brazil's Food Care volume declines and its related impact on profitability. Having said that, Food Care delivered 4% volume growth in North America and 3% volume growth in EMEA on an organic basis. 
Diversey Care increased volume over 4% in both Asia Pacific and Latin America, and Product Care volume was up 6% in EMEA and essentially flat in North America even with our rationalization efforts and ongoing softness in the industrial sector. 
So we're seeing nice volume growth in targeted regions, and for the second consecutive quarter, we have seen robust equipment installments. In the first quarter, equipment sales increased more than 10% in constant dollars and all 3 divisions had positive growth. 
Adjusted EBITDA performance was attributable to solid results in our Product Care division, which increased margins 90% basis points as compared to last year. We also recognized incremental savings from restructuring and demonstrated corporate expense control. 
As I told you in February, that our -- I told you -- I also told you in February that our performance would improve sequentially throughout the year with an acceleration of growth in the second half. We also said more of our growth would come from volume versus price/mix. And I do confirm that this remains our outlook for each of our 3 businesses, and we are confident in our guidance for the full year. 
Looking ahead for Food Care, further global adoption of our innovative solutions, coupled with a well-anticipated up cycle in the North American beef market, along with improving trends in other regions, will drive profitable and accelerated growth for the remainder of the year and several years to come. 
Diversey Care and Product Care have tremendous momentum, thanks to the execution on our Change the Game strategy, as does our medical business. And as I mentioned, we have had favorable equipment trends, which is an indication -- a strong indication of what's to come. 
And before I get into the -- we get into the details of our results, I want to highlight that for the first time since 2010, we announced that the Board of Directors approved an increase on -- in our quarterly dividend. The dividend was increased by 23% from $0.13 to $0.16. We also repurchased approximately 700,000 shares of our stock valued at $32 million in the first quarter, and still have $852 million remaining under our share repurchase program. 
Karl Deily, President of our Food Care division, is joining us today on our call, along with Carol Lowe, our CFO. So with that, let me pass the call to Carol and Karl, and then we'll answer any questions you may have. Carol?"

On Slide 4 of our presentation, you can see our performance by region for the first quarter. Let me start with EMEA, where we have 3% organic growth and positive sales trends across our 3 divisions. Food Care sales increased 5%; Product",608,"Thank you, Jerome. On Slide 4 of our presentation, you can see our performance by region for the first quarter. Let me start with EMEA, where we have 3% organic growth and positive sales trends across our 3 divisions. Food Care sales increased 5%; Product Care increased 6%; and Diversey Care increased 1%. On a by-country basis, EMEA was led by positive sales trends in France, Italy, Spain, Turkey, Poland and Russia. 
Asia Pacific was up 1% in constant dollars led by 7% constant dollar sales growth in Diversey Care. Sales in China increased in both Diversey Care and Food Care. India delivered double-digit growth in Diversey Care. Australia and New Zealand combined account for 6% of our total net sales and just over 10% of Food Care sales. 
In Food Care, Australia was essentially unchanged despite slaughter declines of approximately 17% as cattle farmers initiated rebuilding of their herds. New Zealand was down 6% due to the ongoing weakness in the global dairy market. 
Latin America was hit the hardest by currency devaluations and socio and political instability, particularly in Venezuela and Brazil. On a reported basis, Latin America was down 19%, which translates into 9% growth in constant dollars. We were pleased to see volume growth in Diversey Care, which was attributable to recent customer wins in Chile, Argentina and Brazil. 
Also, if you exclude Venezuela and Brazil from Food Care results, volume in Latin America would be up 2.5%, with strong growth in Mexico and Argentina. 
Let's move to Slide 5 and look at trends in North America. Overall, North America was down 2% on an organic basis due to unfavorable price/mix offsetting positive volume trends. Food Care's 4% volume growth was offset by formula pricing. 
As Jerome mentioned, Product Care's volumes were up slightly, but this was offset by unfavorable price/mix. As we move through the year, we anticipate volume growth to accelerate for both Food Care and Product Care with customer acceptance of our new portfolio and stronger end market demand. Diversey Care delivered positive price/mix, but it was offset by lower volumes into the distribution channel. 
Our ERP implementation has gone well, however, there were some timing impact on the quarter. April sales for Diversey Care have been strong, and we expect this growth to continue for the remainder of the year. 
Turning to Slide 6. Let me walk you through our net sales and adjusted EBITDA performance on a year-over-year basis. Starting with the net sales. You can see that we delivered $1.6 billion in sales, a decrease of 9% on an as-reported basis and up 1.5% on an organic basis. 
Volume contributed $15 million to top line growth and favorable price/mix contributed $10 million. Unfavorable currency translation was $113 million, and the impact from divestitures was $67 million. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $243 million or 15.3% of net sales. Unfavorable currency translation was $18 million, and the impact from divestitures was $14 million. Operating expenses increased $30 million, of which salary and wage inflation was $16 million, and inventory capitalized variances were $12 million. These expenses were partially offset by $14 million in restructuring savings and $5 million from higher volumes. 
Adjusted earnings per share was $0.50 in the first quarter. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 21% compared to 25% last year, primarily due to our ability to repatriate earnings in a tax-efficient manner and a more favorable earnings mix in jurisdictions with lower tax rates. For the full year, we continue to expect our tax rate to be approximately 24%. 
Let me now turn the call over to Karl to go through our results by division. Karl?"

Let's turn to Slide 7 and review Food Care results. Food Care sales increased 2% on an organic basis, driven by a combination of higher volumes and favorable price/mix.

Food Care sales increased 2% on an organic basis, driven by a combination of higher volumes and favorable price/mix. By region, EMEA increased 5%, while North America declined 1%. Latin America was up 10% in constant dollars and Asia Pacific was essentially unchanged. Our adjusted EBITDA was $148 million or 19.3% of net sales. This compares to 21.7% last year and 18.7% last quarter. 
If you recall, this time last year, excluding the impact from currency and divestitures, we experienced a significant positive price/cost spread due to positive formula pricing and lower input cost. 
This year, our first quarter results reflect a tough comparable on formulas, the negative impact from Venezuela and Brazil and the expected slowdown in the Australia and New Zealand business. As Jerome noted, we expect sequential improvement in absolute dollars on both the top and bottom line in the second quarter and accelerated growth in the second half of the year. For the full year, we continue to forecast organic growth in sales and EBITDA with margin expansion. 
I want to spend a few minutes on what we are seeing in the marketplace that gives us the confidence in our future performance. First, on a global basis, we continue to see customer adoption and further market penetration across all protein sectors in our case-ready platforms. Darfresh On Tray and ready meals continue to gain significant momentum around the world. Second, we are experiencing rapid expansion of our fluid-based solutions, including our Vertical Pouch Packaging or VPP systems as well as our aseptic offerings. And third, our customer trials across the globe for our new barrier technology, Optidur, are doing very well. 
As for our hygiene business, we are experiencing continued growth with our direct food contact solutions for food safety and our knowledge-based services to optimize water and energy usage. 
We also are beginning to see positive impact of the larger herd size in North America, which is resulting in steady increase in cattle coming to market. In Europe, where the protein market is relatively stable, we are experiencing organic sales growth as a result of new product acceptance in Western Europe and increased market penetration in Eastern Europe. We look forward to capitalizing on improving end market demand in both North America and Europe, but keep in mind, our growth in 2016 will be partially offset by a continued slowdown in Australia and New Zealand and the economic conditions in both Brazil and Venezuela. 
So if we go to Slide 8, we'll highlight the results from our Diversey Care division. Diversey Care net sales on a constant dollar basis were up just over 1% in the first quarter. We had favorable price/mix in every region and 4% to 5% volume growth in Latin America and Asia Pacific. 
Adjusted EBITDA of $36 million was 8.2% of net sales. As a reminder, first quarter is our seasonally weakest quarter, and we continue to expect constant dollar sales growth as well as margin expansion for the full year. 
Also keep in mind, we have continued to invest in disruptive technologies, including specific investments in robotics. We are winning new strategic customers, and we have already started servicing those customers this quarter in facility management and food service industries. Our focus on sustainability, productivity and integration of chemicals, tools and machinery is being recognized throughout the industry. 
This quarter, from a vertical market perspective, sales increased in food service, retail and in hospitality. We have gained traction with our advanced floor care solutions with the installation of IntelliTrail, the advanced GPS tracking system, on more than 1,100 TASKI machines, and we see rapidly growing demand for our Intellibot portfolio. 
Now let's turn to our Product Care results on Slide 9. Product Care's net sales were essentially unchanged on a year-over-year basis, where volume growth offset by unfavorable price/mix. You may recall that we divested a $15 million product line in North America in January, yet we held volumes relatively flat as compared to last year. 
This is attributable to our strong position in e-commerce and third-party logistics for the fulfillment market, where we continue to experience double-digit growth. We also have been able to maintain good pricing disciplines despite lower input cost as our customers recognize the value add of our new and innovative solutions combined with our global reach and broad product portfolio. 
I also want to highlight our business in Europe, where we delivered 6% volume growth in light of ongoing rationalization efforts. Our performance was attributable to the successful integration of our B+ acquisition and the traction we've gained with our automated solutions, including the B+ portfolio, FloWrap, inflatable bubble and Sealed Air. 
In the second quarter, we will divest a $12 million product line in Europe, which we should -- which should complete our product rationalization efforts. For the year, we anticipate top line growth and margin expansion with a stronger second half of the year given our success in the fulfillment market. 
Now let me pass the call back to Carol to review our free cash flow and our outlook for 2016. Carol?"

Free cash flow was the use of cash of $48 million in the first quarter. CapEx increased to $52 million as compared to $21 million during the same period a year ago, of which $15 million was related to our Charlotte campus. 
Working capital and other assets and liabilities for use of cash of $141 million. Operating working capital as a percent of net sales based on a 13-month average is relatively the same since year-end at 14.5%. As compared to a year ago, we improved 160 basis points. 
We believe there is still opportunity for further -- to further improve payables and inventory management, even though we have reached our long-term target of 15%. For the full year, we continue to expect working capital to be a source of cash of approximately $100 million. 
Turning to Slide 11. We are reaffirming our outlook for 2016. Net sales are expected to be approximately $6.8 billion. The impact from the Food Care divestitures on 2016 net sales is $102 million, of which $67 million impacted the first quarter. We continue to forecast adjusted EBITDA in the range of $1.17 billion to $1.19 billion. The impact from the Food Care divestitures on 2016 EBITDA is $21 million, of which $14 million impacted the first quarter. 
We expect our second quarter results to be down on a year-over-year basis, due primarily to formula pricing and Food Care. However, as Jerome noted, we expect sequential improvement in every quarter going forward. 
Our medical and corporate expenses are expected to be a net expense of $100 million for the full year 2016 as we continue to invest in our next-generation digital technologies. Our interest expense for 2016 is estimated at $225 million. Depreciation and amortization is forecast to be approximately $285 million. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be within the range that we previously provided of $2.52 to $2.60. 
At this point in time, we are not updating our outlook on currency translation. As you know, markets have been extremely volatile and we are focusing on what we can control. We are on track to achieve our free cash flow target of approximately $550 million. 
CapEx is expected to be $275 million, which includes approximately $125 million related to the investment we are making in our Charlotte campus and other capital restructuring activities. Excluding these items, maintenance and growth CapEx combined is estimated to be $150 million. 
Cash restructuring payments are estimated at $110 million, and we expect to realize, restructuring savings of approximately $30 million. Cash interest payments are expected to be $220 million, and cash tax payments are estimated at $125 million. 
In closing, I would like to once again note that we are confident we are investing in the right markets and in the right regions that will enable us to capitalize on future growth opportunities. We are not ignoring the global environment. We have and we will continue to advance continuous improvement and realize further operational efficiency. 
With our most challenging quarter now behind us, we look forward to delivering improved performance for the balance of the year and in the years ahead. 
Before I open the call to questions, I would like to remind you, our second quarter earnings call is tentatively scheduled for Thursday, July 28. We have invited Dr. Ilham Kadri, President of Diversey Care, to join Jerome and me for the Q2 call.

The -- we need to go back to what we have guided towards, and you remember that it is the first time we gave a guidance for a specific quarter, and we did that because we knew what was happening from the pricing coming negative and growth being somewhat muted in -- at the beginning of the year; the divestiture and the currency headwind. So as far as I'm concerned, really, no surprise. The only surprise has been coming from how steep Latin America Food Care has been with 6% volume decline, but this is very specific. It's been very specific in -- as a result of Venezuela, which has melted down, and as Brazil, which has had -- and Karl will add a little bit in that, which have seen very, very steep local meat consumption reductions and very high prices of meat. So -- and next to that in Latin America, by the way, our Diversey Care business has been very strong, specifically in Brazil, Argentina, Chile and so on. So we said -- we prepared and we said all of that early February, and we are exactly where we said we would be in the end. With regards to the rest of the year, we are going to be talking specifically about the 3 divisions. But you need to remember that in Product Care to start with, we -- because of the strength and the growth that we have in third-party logistics and e-commerce, we are going to now have -- this division have its very specific seasonality towards Q4. And we are extremely optimistic, thanks to our equipment placement and our customer wins, that we are going to have sequentially very nice quarters of growth there. With regards to Diversey Care, we have had some very specific one-offs in North America as a result of channel sales being a little bit muted and ERP consequence -- implementation consequences as happens to every single company when they go through that experience. But we are very fine and very pleased with what's going on in North America, specifically happy with what's going on in Asia Pacific with renewed nice growth in China, for example, strong in India, as always, et cetera, et cetera. And therefore, we're pleased with what we've seen. In Food Care, I will let Karl speak more specifically about it. But we've got some tailwind coming from the beef cycle. We've got proteins in general doing quite well and we've got very nice innovation. All of these make me confirm that you are going to see, as I said, already last year -- late last year and early this year, we're going to have nice growth -- renewing with nice growth, and that this growth is going to be more on volumes than it is going to be on price as a result of the rise in prices."

Just real briefly, I mean, there's no doubt that Venezuela being down almost 59%, Brazil being down 8.5%, are ongoing issues. We do see Brazil, though, not improving immediately, but there is a medium- to long-term positive trends in Brazil. I mean, obviously, the Brazilian animal prices are still at a relatively all-time high. We do see retail prices dropping due to lack of demand, but we also see their export market having favorable trends occurring. If you remember, one of the reasons Brazil export market was down is they were predominantly exporting to Venezuela and Russia, which have their own unique economic issues. But they've gained access -- although some small work yet left to do to gain access to U.S. as an export market. They're gaining significant business in China as an export market and parts of Asia, somewhat to fill the void left by Australia slaughter being down. So we do believe that's a mid- to long-term positive in Brazil. We are also very favorable in the rest of our emerging markets, where we have over around 5% volume growth. And then we're still very, very positive on our volume growth in North America, 4%, and Europe with 3%, where we basically have a strategy of growing geographically as well as growing in mature markets through innovation.

But again, it's largely timing. So again, the 2 major components are typical compensation inflation that we have every year as well as the inventory variances, of which most is capitalized and then amortized."

So George, it -- without getting into a lot of detail, on the inventory variances, when we reset standards periodically, we have internal guidelines that we follow in terms of when we have changes from our standards by more than a certain percentage, typically using a 10% rule of thumb. That can be impacted within a region or a country based on the amount of imports that we're doing. Are they impacted by purchase price variances? Are they impacted by FX transaction costs, which are different than translation cost as well as the operational efficiencies that impact our indirect supply chain cost, our fixed and administrative costs for running our factories and our warehouses and logistics network? So it's a combination of all of those as we bring them together and looking at the change for inventory values and properly capitalizing the amount so it's reflected in our inventory turns as we move forward. And on a year-over-year basis, obviously, that can be very different, depending on where we end one quarter from an inventory level standpoint and efficiencies within that quarter versus comparison to the following year.

George, thank you for the question, and I'll try to be very brief but specific. We do have a lot of confidence that the cattle cycle and the herd is continuing to be rebuilt and that additional animals are currently going to market. You're absolutely right. Weather, feed cost, currency all have an impact, and drought has an impact. Pasture conditions can significantly have an impact. But corn projections, although up slightly, are still very favorable. The amount of good to very good pasture conditions are still at a high level. So currency is still maybe impact some on export, but still, the fundamentals are there. The producers are making money. The cow/calf operations are making money and they were still retaining heifers. We don't have a balance of steers and heifers coming to market yet. When you see that, that will be an indication that they built the herd as large as they're going to build it, so we do see them continuing to build the herd. If you go back to what we said at Investor's Day, it's a baseline. We're right on target. We believe that the herd will continue to be built and that additional animals will come to market over the next 3 years at a minimum."

We saw Australia where their slaughter rates are down, Carol said 17%. Our sales are relatively flat in that area. So we've also had some depression in the dairy market in New Zealand. So we have 2 key markets for us that the market conditions are unfavorable, but yet we kept relatively flat volumes. And we did that with diversification, new product innovation, disruptive innovations that have allowed us to grow in a down market. We would anticipate that the Australian beef market will stay relatively negative for at least 2 years because they're just starting their herd rebuilding cycle, but they are rebuilding the herd. So again, mid to long term, we're still very favorable in that segment of the market. But -- so that's some color in Australia and New Zealand. In Brazil, obviously, Brazil is an important part of our long-range strategy. And we think fundamentally, with their -- the infrastructure they have in producing food, whether it's poultry, beef and a growing amount of pork, that we're well-positioned to capitalize on as those markets recover. We're still heavily entrenched in the key customers in that region and continue to provide automation, new product introductions as well to position ourselves for when they -- their volumes return. Venezuela is a more longer-term concern, and again, though, they're a nice part of Latin America, but much smaller on the grand scheme of things. So we have great confidence in our total Latin America business, where we're still seeing volume growth minus the 2 areas of concern.

We also know what's going on in Brazil, but the situation is extremely different. What you have is the perfect storm in Brazil. You have had the high meat prices and you read the newspaper like me and, therefore, you have had socioeconomical difficulties there. And as you combine very high red meat prices and the situation I just talked about, you have had, in the first quarter, the highest meat consumption decrease that you ever had since statistics has existed in Brazil. So that's what I would call a temporary factor, because at the very same time, you didn't have very much exports. But exports from Brazil meats are going to be improving and, therefore, as the year passes, we believe that, that situation is going to be improving, both from the meat prices, cattle and herd prices and from the economic situation as the rise in political anxiety. So if you exclude Brazil and Venezuela, which it is what it is, we would -- you would have seen that we would have a solid volume growth in the rest of Latin America, which is very encouraging. So we're not throwing the baby with the bathwater. We've been very specifically hit in this first quarter. It's not going to be a quick recovery, but the cattle and herd is going to be rebuilding in Brazil also and we're going to have some positive effects from Argentina over time as the new government, the Macri government, is going to enable exports. They have started to do this at small levels, but they are going to liberalize meat exports. So I think it's -- all of this is positive."

That's -- it would be better to have more general economic momentum, but we don't need that given what we have in place. Let me repeat, the customer wins in Diversey Care as a result of the integration of our equipment tools in chemicals as a result of our knowledge-based savings introduction and very good focused work we are doing. And by the way, we're seeing this in our pricing. Pricing has been nicely positive this quarter, and we expect this to continue. Product Care, a lot of momentum, a lot of momentum, thanks to the technologies once again, the 4 pillars and stuff. In Food Care -- and by the way, in Product Care, in an industrial GDP environment, which is pretty tepid, actually. And in Food Care, we talked to you, it's nicer to have slightly the beginning of an up cycle in the beef, but we're seeing the general protein consumption being positive there. But it is not what is going to create the biggest change in our growth in 2016. What is going to create the biggest change in our growth in 2016 is our innovation."

I know it's been a busy morning for many of you joining us today, but hopefully, you had the opportunity to review our first quarter earnings results.

I know it's been a busy morning for many of you joining us today, but hopefully, you had the opportunity to review our first quarter earnings results. I want to make sure and take a few minutes to highlight our performance and what we expect going forward. 
Our first quarter results overall were essentially in line with our expectations. Remember, I told you early February that our first quarter 2016 would be our toughest year-on-year comparable due to currency headwinds, the impact from divestitures and formula pricing in Food Care. This was why we set our first quarter 2016 guidance for sales at $1.6 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $245 million, with $18 million of currency headwinds and $14 million impact from divestitures. And this is about what we have delivered. 
The Food Care pricing formulas, which were highly favorable in the first quarter last year, turned unfavorable as predicted. And if there was a surprise, it was lying in the steepness in Venezuela's and Brazil's Food Care volume declines and its related impact on profitability. Having said that, Food Care delivered 4% volume growth in North America and 3% volume growth in EMEA on an organic basis. 
Diversey Care increased volume over 4% in both Asia Pacific and Latin America, and Product Care volume was up 6% in EMEA and essentially flat in North America even with our rationalization efforts and ongoing softness in the industrial sector. 
So we're seeing nice volume growth in targeted regions, and for the second consecutive quarter, we have seen robust equipment installments. In the first quarter, equipment sales increased more than 10% in constant dollars and all 3 divisions had positive growth. 
Adjusted EBITDA performance was attributable to solid results in our Product Care division, which increased margins 90% basis points as compared to last year. We also recognized incremental savings from restructuring and demonstrated corporate expense control. 
As I told you in February, that our -- I told you -- I also told you in February that our performance would improve sequentially throughout the year with an acceleration of growth in the second half. We also said more of our growth would come from volume versus price/mix. And I do confirm that this remains our outlook for each of our 3 businesses, and we are confident in our guidance for the full year. 
Looking ahead for Food Care, further global adoption of our innovative solutions, coupled with a well-anticipated up cycle in the North American beef market, along with improving trends in other regions, will drive profitable and accelerated growth for the remainder of the year and several years to come. 
Diversey Care and Product Care have tremendous momentum, thanks to the execution on our Change the Game strategy, as does our medical business. And as I mentioned, we have had favorable equipment trends, which is an indication -- a strong indication of what's to come. 
And before I get into the -- we get into the details of our results, I want to highlight that for the first time since 2010, we announced that the Board of Directors approved an increase on -- in our quarterly dividend. The dividend was increased by 23% from $0.13 to $0.16. We also repurchased approximately 700,000 shares of our stock valued at $32 million in the first quarter, and still have $852 million remaining under our share repurchase program. 
Karl Deily, President of our Food Care division, is joining us today on our call, along with Carol Lowe, our CFO. So with that, let me pass the call to Carol and Karl, and then we'll answer any questions you may have. Carol?"

On Slide 4 of our presentation, you can see our performance by region for the first quarter. Let me start with EMEA, where we have 3% organic growth and positive sales trends across our 3 divisions. Food Care sales increased 5%; Product",608,"Thank you, Jerome. On Slide 4 of our presentation, you can see our performance by region for the first quarter. Let me start with EMEA, where we have 3% organic growth and positive sales trends across our 3 divisions. Food Care sales increased 5%; Product Care increased 6%; and Diversey Care increased 1%. On a by-country basis, EMEA was led by positive sales trends in France, Italy, Spain, Turkey, Poland and Russia. 
Asia Pacific was up 1% in constant dollars led by 7% constant dollar sales growth in Diversey Care. Sales in China increased in both Diversey Care and Food Care. India delivered double-digit growth in Diversey Care. Australia and New Zealand combined account for 6% of our total net sales and just over 10% of Food Care sales. 
In Food Care, Australia was essentially unchanged despite slaughter declines of approximately 17% as cattle farmers initiated rebuilding of their herds. New Zealand was down 6% due to the ongoing weakness in the global dairy market. 
Latin America was hit the hardest by currency devaluations and socio and political instability, particularly in Venezuela and Brazil. On a reported basis, Latin America was down 19%, which translates into 9% growth in constant dollars. We were pleased to see volume growth in Diversey Care, which was attributable to recent customer wins in Chile, Argentina and Brazil. 
Also, if you exclude Venezuela and Brazil from Food Care results, volume in Latin America would be up 2.5%, with strong growth in Mexico and Argentina. 
Let's move to Slide 5 and look at trends in North America. Overall, North America was down 2% on an organic basis due to unfavorable price/mix offsetting positive volume trends. Food Care's 4% volume growth was offset by formula pricing. 
As Jerome mentioned, Product Care's volumes were up slightly, but this was offset by unfavorable price/mix. As we move through the year, we anticipate volume growth to accelerate for both Food Care and Product Care with customer acceptance of our new portfolio and stronger end market demand. Diversey Care delivered positive price/mix, but it was offset by lower volumes into the distribution channel. 
Our ERP implementation has gone well, however, there were some timing impact on the quarter. April sales for Diversey Care have been strong, and we expect this growth to continue for the remainder of the year. 
Turning to Slide 6. Let me walk you through our net sales and adjusted EBITDA performance on a year-over-year basis. Starting with the net sales. You can see that we delivered $1.6 billion in sales, a decrease of 9% on an as-reported basis and up 1.5% on an organic basis. 
Volume contributed $15 million to top line growth and favorable price/mix contributed $10 million. Unfavorable currency translation was $113 million, and the impact from divestitures was $67 million. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $243 million or 15.3% of net sales. Unfavorable currency translation was $18 million, and the impact from divestitures was $14 million. Operating expenses increased $30 million, of which salary and wage inflation was $16 million, and inventory capitalized variances were $12 million. These expenses were partially offset by $14 million in restructuring savings and $5 million from higher volumes. 
Adjusted earnings per share was $0.50 in the first quarter. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 21% compared to 25% last year, primarily due to our ability to repatriate earnings in a tax-efficient manner and a more favorable earnings mix in jurisdictions with lower tax rates. For the full year, we continue to expect our tax rate to be approximately 24%. 
Let me now turn the call over to Karl to go through our results by division. Karl?"

Let's turn to Slide 7 and review Food Care results. Food Care sales increased 2% on an organic basis, driven by a combination of higher volumes and favorable price/mix.

Food Care sales increased 2% on an organic basis, driven by a combination of higher volumes and favorable price/mix. By region, EMEA increased 5%, while North America declined 1%. Latin America was up 10% in constant dollars and Asia Pacific was essentially unchanged. Our adjusted EBITDA was $148 million or 19.3% of net sales. This compares to 21.7% last year and 18.7% last quarter. 
If you recall, this time last year, excluding the impact from currency and divestitures, we experienced a significant positive price/cost spread due to positive formula pricing and lower input cost. 
This year, our first quarter results reflect a tough comparable on formulas, the negative impact from Venezuela and Brazil and the expected slowdown in the Australia and New Zealand business. As Jerome noted, we expect sequential improvement in absolute dollars on both the top and bottom line in the second quarter and accelerated growth in the second half of the year. For the full year, we continue to forecast organic growth in sales and EBITDA with margin expansion. 
I want to spend a few minutes on what we are seeing in the marketplace that gives us the confidence in our future performance. First, on a global basis, we continue to see customer adoption and further market penetration across all protein sectors in our case-ready platforms. Darfresh On Tray and ready meals continue to gain significant momentum around the world. Second, we are experiencing rapid expansion of our fluid-based solutions, including our Vertical Pouch Packaging or VPP systems as well as our aseptic offerings. And third, our customer trials across the globe for our new barrier technology, Optidur, are doing very well. 
As for our hygiene business, we are experiencing continued growth with our direct food contact solutions for food safety and our knowledge-based services to optimize water and energy usage. 
We also are beginning to see positive impact of the larger herd size in North America, which is resulting in steady increase in cattle coming to market. In Europe, where the protein market is relatively stable, we are experiencing organic sales growth as a result of new product acceptance in Western Europe and increased market penetration in Eastern Europe. We look forward to capitalizing on improving end market demand in both North America and Europe, but keep in mind, our growth in 2016 will be partially offset by a continued slowdown in Australia and New Zealand and the economic conditions in both Brazil and Venezuela. 
So if we go to Slide 8, we'll highlight the results from our Diversey Care division. Diversey Care net sales on a constant dollar basis were up just over 1% in the first quarter. We had favorable price/mix in every region and 4% to 5% volume growth in Latin America and Asia Pacific. 
Adjusted EBITDA of $36 million was 8.2% of net sales. As a reminder, first quarter is our seasonally weakest quarter, and we continue to expect constant dollar sales growth as well as margin expansion for the full year. 
Also keep in mind, we have continued to invest in disruptive technologies, including specific investments in robotics. We are winning new strategic customers, and we have already started servicing those customers this quarter in facility management and food service industries. Our focus on sustainability, productivity and integration of chemicals, tools and machinery is being recognized throughout the industry. 
This quarter, from a vertical market perspective, sales increased in food service, retail and in hospitality. We have gained traction with our advanced floor care solutions with the installation of IntelliTrail, the advanced GPS tracking system, on more than 1,100 TASKI machines, and we see rapidly growing demand for our Intellibot portfolio. 
Now let's turn to our Product Care results on Slide 9. Product Care's net sales were essentially unchanged on a year-over-year basis, where volume growth offset by unfavorable price/mix. You may recall that we divested a $15 million product line in North America in January, yet we held volumes relatively flat as compared to last year. 
This is attributable to our strong position in e-commerce and third-party logistics for the fulfillment market, where we continue to experience double-digit growth. We also have been able to maintain good pricing disciplines despite lower input cost as our customers recognize the value add of our new and innovative solutions combined with our global reach and broad product portfolio. 
I also want to highlight our business in Europe, where we delivered 6% volume growth in light of ongoing rationalization efforts. Our performance was attributable to the successful integration of our B+ acquisition and the traction we've gained with our automated solutions, including the B+ portfolio, FloWrap, inflatable bubble and Sealed Air. 
In the second quarter, we will divest a $12 million product line in Europe, which we should -- which should complete our product rationalization efforts. For the year, we anticipate top line growth and margin expansion with a stronger second half of the year given our success in the fulfillment market. 
Now let me pass the call back to Carol to review our free cash flow and our outlook for 2016. Carol?"

Free cash flow was the use of cash of $48 million in the first quarter. CapEx increased to $52 million as compared to $21 million during the same period a year ago, of which $15 million was related to our Charlotte campus. 
Working capital and other assets and liabilities for a use of cash of $141 million. Operating working capital as a percent of net sales based on a 13-month average is relatively the same since year-end at 14.5%. As compared to a year ago, we improved 160 basis points. 
We believe there is still opportunity for further -- to further improve payables and inventory management, even though we have reached our long-term target of 15%. For the full year, we continue to expect working capital to be a source of cash of approximately $100 million. 
Turning to Slide 11. We are reaffirming our outlook for 2016. Net sales are expected to be approximately $6.8 billion. The impact from the Food Care divestitures on 2016 net sales is $102 million, of which $67 million impacted the first quarter. We continue to forecast adjusted EBITDA in the range of $1.17 billion to $1.19 billion. The impact from the Food Care divestitures on 2016 EBITDA is $21 million, of which $14 million impacted the first quarter. 
We expect our second quarter results to be down on a year-over-year basis, due primarily to formula pricing and Food Care. However, as Jerome noted, we expect sequential improvement in every quarter going forward. 
Our medical and corporate expenses are expected to be a net expense of $100 million for the full year 2016 as we continue to invest in our next-generation digital technologies. Our interest expense for 2016 is estimated at $225 million. Depreciation and amortization is forecast to be approximately $285 million. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be within the range that we previously provided of $2.52 to $2.60. 
At this point in time, we are not updating our outlook on currency translation. As you know, markets have been extremely volatile and we are focusing on what we can control. We are on track to achieve our free cash flow target of approximately $550 million. 
CapEx is expected to be $275 million, which includes approximately $125 million related to the investment we are making in our Charlotte campus and other capital restructuring activities. Excluding these items, maintenance and growth CapEx combined is estimated to be $150 million. 
Cash restructuring payments are estimated at $110 million, and we expect to realize, restructuring savings of approximately $30 million. Cash interest payments are expected to be $220 million, and cash tax payments are estimated at $125 million. 
In closing, I would like to once again note that we are confident we are investing in the right markets and in the right regions that will enable us to capitalize on future growth opportunities. We are not ignoring the global environment. We have and we will continue to advance continuous improvement and realize further operational efficiency. 
With our most challenging quarter now behind us, we look forward to delivering improved performance for the balance of the year and in the years ahead. 
Before I open the call to questions, I would like to remind you, our second quarter earnings call is tentatively scheduled for Thursday, July 28. We have invited Dr. Ilham Kadri, President of Diversey Care, to join Jerome and me for the Q2 call.

The -- we need to go back to what we have guided towards, and you remember that it is the first time we gave a guidance for a specific quarter, and we did that because we knew what was happening from the pricing coming negative and growth being somewhat muted in -- at the beginning of the year; the divestiture and the currency headwind. So as far as I'm concerned, really, no surprise. The only surprise has been coming from how steep Latin America Food Care has been with 6% volume decline, but this is very specific. It's been very specific in -- as a result of Venezuela, which has melted down, and as Brazil, which has had -- and Karl will add a little bit in that, which have seen very, very steep local meat consumption reductions and very high prices of meat. So -- and next to that in Latin America, by the way, our Diversey Care business has been very strong, specifically in Brazil, Argentina, Chile and so on. So we said -- we prepared and we said all of that early February, and we are exactly where we said we would be in the end. With regards to the rest of the year, we are going to be talking specifically about the 3 divisions. But you need to remember that in Product Care to start with, we -- because of the strength and the growth that we have in third-party logistics and e-commerce, we are going to now have -- this division have its very specific seasonality towards Q4. And we are extremely optimistic, thanks to our equipment placement and our customer wins, that we are going to have sequentially very nice quarters of growth there. With regards to Diversey Care, we have had some very specific one-offs in North America as a result of channel sales being a little bit muted and ERP consequence -- implementation consequences as happens to every single company when they go through that experience. But we are very fine and very pleased with what's going on in North America, specifically happy with what's going on in Asia Pacific with renewed nice growth in China, for example, strong in India, as always, et cetera, et cetera. And therefore, we're pleased with what we've seen. In Food Care, I will let Karl speak more specifically about it. But we've got some tailwind coming from the beef cycle. We've got proteins in general doing quite well and we've got very nice innovation. All of these make me confirm that you are going to see, as I said, already last year -- late last year and early this year, we're going to have nice growth -- renewing with nice growth, and that this growth is going to be more on volume than it is going to be on price as a result of the rise in prices."

Just real briefly, I mean, there's no doubt that Venezuela being down almost 59%, Brazil being down 8.5%, are ongoing issues. We do see Brazil, though, not improving immediately, but there is a medium- to long-term positive trends in Brazil. I mean, obviously, the Brazilian animal prices are still at a relatively all-time high. We do see retail prices dropping due to lack of demand, but we also see their export market having favorable trends occurring. If you remember, one of the reasons Brazil export market was down is they were predominantly exporting to Venezuela and Russia, which have their own unique economic issues. But they've gained access -- although some small work yet left to do to gain access to U.S. as an export market. They're gaining significant business in China as an export market and parts of Asia, somewhat to fill the void left by Australia slaughter being down. So we do believe that's a mid- to long-term positive in Brazil. We are also very favorable in the rest of our emerging markets, where we have over around 5% volume growth. And then we're still very, very positive on our volume growth in North America, 4%, and Europe with 3%, where we basically have a strategy of growing geographically as well as growing in mature markets through innovation. So we're still seeing both of those through -- going through."

In salary wage inflation and cost of goods sold, the salary wage inflation is approximately $9 million, and that gets you to the $16 million. If we look at the $12 million that I referenced on inventory variances, that is largely due to timing relative to capitalized variances that we amortized over our inventory turns and varies from quarter-to-quarter, year-to-year, depending on inventory levels, what's capitalized, purchase price variances, efficiencies in the factories. But again, it's largely timing. So again, the 2 major components are typical compensation inflation that we have every year as well as the inventory variances, of which most is capitalized and then amortized."

So George, it -- without getting into a lot of detail, on the inventory variances, when we reset standards periodically, we have internal guidelines that we follow in terms of when we have changes from our standards by more than a certain percentage, typically using a 10% rule of thumb. That can be impacted within a region or a country based on the amount of imports that we're doing. Are they impacted by purchase price variances? Are they impacted by FX transaction costs, which are different than translation costs as well as the operational efficiencies that impact our indirect supply chain costs, our fixed and administrative costs for running our factories and our warehouses and logistics network? So it's a combination of all of those as we bring them together and looking at the change for inventory values and properly capitalizing the amount so it's reflected in our inventory turns as we move forward. And on a year-over-year basis, obviously, that can be very different, depending on where we end one quarter from an inventory level standpoint and efficiencies within that quarter versus comparison to the following year.

George, thank you for the question, and I'll try to be very brief but specific. We do have a lot of confidence that the cattle cycle and the herd is continuing to be rebuilt and that additional animals are currently going to market. You're absolutely right. Weather, feed cost, currency all have an impact, and drought as it impacts pasture conditions can significantly have an impact. But corn projections, although up slightly, are still very favorable. The amount of good to very good pasture conditions are still at a high level. So currency is still maybe impacts some on export, but still, the fundamentals are there. The producers are making money. The cow/calf operations are making money and they were still retaining heifers. We don't have a balance of steers and heifers coming to market yet. When you see that, that will be an indication that they built the herd as large as they're going to build it, so we do see them continuing to build the herd. If you go back to what we said at Investor's Day, it's a baseline. We're right on target. We believe that the herd will continue to be built and that additional animals will come to market over the next 3 years at a minimum."

We saw Australia where their slaughter rates are down, Carol said 17%. Our sales are relatively flat in that area. So we've also had some depression in the dairy market in New Zealand. So we have 2 key markets for us that the market conditions are unfavorable, but yet we kept relatively flat volumes. And we did that with diversification, new product innovation, disruptive innovations that have allowed us to grow in a down market. We would anticipate that the Australian beef market will stay relatively negative for at least 2 years because they're just starting their herd rebuilding cycle, but they are rebuilding the herd. So again, mid to long term, we're still very favorable in that segment of the market. But -- so that's some color in Australia and New Zealand. In Brazil, obviously, Brazil is an important part of our long-range strategy. And we think fundamentally, with their -- the infrastructure they have in producing food, whether it's poultry, beef and a growing amount of pork, that we're well-positioned to capitalize on as those markets recover. We're still heavily entrenched in the key customers in that region and continue to provide automation, new product introductions as well to position ourselves for when they -- their volumes return. Venezuela is a more longer-term concern, and again, though, they're a nice part of Latin America, but much smaller on the grand scheme of things. So we have great confidence in our total Latin America business, where we're still seeing volume growth minus the 2 areas of concern.

We also know what's going on in Brazil, but the situation is extremely different. What you have is the perfect storm in Brazil. You have had high meat prices and you read the newspaper like me and, therefore, you have had socioeconomical difficulties there. And as you combine very high red meat prices and the situation I just talked about, you have had, in the first quarter, the highest meat consumption decrease that you ever had since statistics have existed in Brazil. So that's what I would call a temporary factor, because at the very same time, you didn't have very much exports. But exports from Brazil meats are going to be improving and, therefore, as the year passes, we believe that, that situation is going to be improving, both from the meat prices, cattle and herd prices and from the economic situation as the rise in political anxiety. So if you exclude Brazil and Venezuela, which it is what it is, we would -- you would have seen that we would have a solid volume growth in the rest of Latin America, which is very encouraging. So we're not throwing the baby with the bathwater. We've been very specifically hit in this first quarter. It's not going to be a quick recovery, but the cattle and herd is going to be rebuilding in Brazil also and you're going to have some positive effects from Argentina over time as the new government, the Macri government, is going to enable exports. They have started to do this at small levels, but they are going to liberalize meat exports. So I think it's -- all of this is positive."

I know it's been a busy morning for many of you joining us today, but hopefully, you had the opportunity to review our first quarter earnings results.

I know it's been a busy morning for many of you joining us today, but hopefully, you had the opportunity to review our first quarter earnings results. I want to make sure and take a few minutes to highlight our performance and what we expect going forward. 
Our first quarter results overall were essentially in line with our expectations. Remember, I told you early February that our first quarter 2016 would be our toughest year-on-year comparable due to currency headwinds, the impact from divestitures and formula pricing in Food Care. This was why we set our first quarter 2016 guidance for sales at $1.6 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $245 million, with $18 million of currency headwinds and $14 million impact from divestitures. And this is about what we have delivered. 
The Food Care pricing formulas, which were highly favorable in the first quarter last year, turned unfavorable as predicted. And if there was a surprise, it was lying in the steepness in Venezuela's and Brazil's Food Care volume declines and its related impact on profitability. Having said that, Food Care delivered 4% volume growth in North America and 3% volume growth in EMEA on an organic basis. 
Diversey Care increased volume over 4% in both Asia Pacific and Latin America, and Product Care volume was up 6% in EMEA and essentially flat in North America even with our rationalization efforts and ongoing softness in the industrial sector. 
So we're seeing nice volume growth in targeted regions, and for the second consecutive quarter, we have seen robust equipment installments. In the first quarter, equipment sales increased more than 10% in constant dollars and all 3 divisions had positive growth. 
Adjusted EBITDA performance was attributable to solid results in our Product Care division, which increased margins 90% basis points as compared to last year. We also recognized incremental savings from restructuring and demonstrated corporate expense control. 
As I told you in February, that our -- I told you -- I also told you in February that our performance would improve sequentially throughout the year with an acceleration of growth in the second half. We also said more of our growth would come from volume versus price/mix. And I do confirm that this remains our outlook for each of our 3 businesses, and we are confident in our guidance for the full year. 
Looking ahead for Food Care, further global adoption of our innovative solutions, coupled with a well-anticipated up cycle in the North American beef market, along with improving trends in other regions, will drive profitable and accelerated growth for the remainder of the year and several years to come. 
Diversey Care and Product Care have tremendous momentum, thanks to the execution on our Change the Game strategy, as does our medical business. And as I mentioned, we have had favorable equipment trends, which is an indication -- a strong indication of what's to come. 
And before I get into the -- we get into the details of our results, I want to highlight that for the first time since 2010, we announced that the Board of Directors approved an increase on -- in our quarterly dividend. The dividend was increased by 23% from $0.13 to $0.16. We also repurchased approximately 700,000 shares of our stock valued at $32 million in the first quarter, and still have $852 million remaining under our share repurchase program. Karl Deily, President of our Food Care division, is joining us today on our call, along with Carol Lowe, our CFO. 
So with that, let me pass the call to Carol and Karl, and then we'll answer any questions you may have. Carol?"

Let me start with EMEA, where we have 3% organic growth and positive sales trends across our 3 divisions. Food Care sales increased 5%; Product Care increased 6%; and Diversey Care increased 1%. On a by-country basis, EMEA was led by positive sales trends in France, Italy, Spain, Turkey, Poland and Russia. 
Asia Pacific was up 1% in constant dollars led by 7% constant dollar sales growth in Diversey Care. Sales in China increased in both Diversey Care and Food Care. India delivered double-digit growth in Diversey Care. Australia and New Zealand combined account for 6% of our total net sales and just over 10% of Food Care sales. 
In Food Care, Australia was essentially unchanged despite slaughter declines of approximately 17% as cattle farmers initiated rebuilding of their herds. New Zealand was down 6% due to the ongoing weakness in the global dairy market. 
Latin America was hit the hardest by currency devaluations and socio and political instability, particularly in Venezuela and Brazil. On a reported basis, Latin America was down 19%, which translates into 9% growth in constant dollars. We were pleased to see volume growth in Diversey Care, which was attributable to recent customer wins in Chile, Argentina and Brazil. 
Also, if you exclude Venezuela and Brazil from Food Care results, volume in Latin America would be up 2.5%, with strong growth in Mexico and Argentina. 
Let's move to Slide 5 and look at trends in North America. Overall, North America was down 2% on an organic basis due to unfavorable price/mix offsetting positive volume trends. Food Care's 4% volume growth was offset by formula pricing. 
As Jerome mentioned, Product Care's volumes were up slightly, but this was offset by unfavorable price/mix. As we move through the year, we anticipate volume growth to accelerate for both Food Care and Product Care with customer acceptance of our new portfolio and stronger end market demand. Diversey Care delivered positive price/mix, but it was offset by lower volumes into the distribution channel. 
Our ERP implementation has gone well, however, there were some timing impact on the quarter. April sales for Diversey Care have been strong, and we expect this growth to continue for the remainder of the year. 
Turning to Slide 6. Let me walk you through our net sales and adjusted EBITDA performance on a year-over-year basis. Starting with the net sales. You can see that we delivered $1.6 billion in sales, a decrease of 9% on an as-reported basis and up 1.5% on an organic basis. 
Volume contributed $15 million to top line growth and favorable price/mix contributed $10 million. Unfavorable currency translation was $113 million, and the impact from divestitures was $67 million. 
Adjusted EBITDA was $243 million or 15.3% of net sales. Unfavorable currency translation was $18 million, and the impact from divestitures was $14 million. Operating expenses increased $30 million, of which salary and wage inflation was $16 million, and inventory capitalized variances were $12 million. These expenses were partially offset by $14 million in restructuring savings and $5 million from higher volumes. 
Adjusted earnings per share was $0.50 in the first quarter. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 21% compared to 25% last year, primarily due to our ability to repatriate earnings in a tax-efficient manner and a more favorable earnings mix in jurisdictions with lower tax rates. For the full year, we continue to expect our tax rate to be approximately 24%. 
Let me now turn the call over to Karl to go through our results by division. Karl?"

Food Care sales increased 2% on an organic basis, driven by a combination of higher volumes and favorable price/mix. By region, EMEA increased 5%, while North America declined 1%. Latin America was up 10% in constant dollars and Asia Pacific was essentially unchanged. Our adjusted EBITDA was $148 million or 19.3% of net sales. This compares to 21.7% last year and 18.7% last quarter. 
If you recall, this time last year, excluding the impact from currency and divestitures, we experienced a significant positive price/cost spread due to positive formula pricing and lower input cost. 
This year, our first quarter results reflect a tough comparable on formulas, the negative impact from Venezuela and Brazil and the expected slowdown in the Australia and New Zealand business. As Jerome noted, we expect sequential improvement in absolute dollars on both the top and bottom line in the second quarter and accelerated growth in the second half of the year. For the full year, we continue to forecast organic growth in sales and EBITDA with margin expansion. 
I want to spend a few minutes on what we are seeing in the marketplace that gives us the confidence in our future performance. First, on a global basis, we continue to see customer adoption and further market penetration across all protein sectors in our case-ready platforms. Darfresh On Tray and ready meals continue to gain significant momentum around the world. Second, we are experiencing rapid expansion of our fluid-based solutions, including our Vertical Pouch Packaging or VPP systems as well as our aseptic offerings. And third, our customer trials across the globe for our new barrier technology, Optidur, are doing very well. 
As for our hygiene business, we are experiencing continued growth with our direct food contact solutions for food safety and our knowledge-based services to optimize water and energy usage. 
We also are beginning to see positive impact of the larger herd size in North America, which is resulting in steady increase in cattle coming to market. In Europe, where the protein market is relatively stable, we are experiencing organic sales growth as a result of new product acceptance in Western Europe and increased market penetration in Eastern Europe. We look forward to capitalizing on improving end market demand in both North America and Europe, but keep in mind, our growth in 2016 will be partially offset by a continued slowdown in Australia and New Zealand and the economic conditions in both Brazil and Venezuela. 
So if we go to Slide 8, we'll highlight the results from our Diversey Care division. Diversey Care net sales on a constant dollar basis were up just over 1% in the first quarter. We had favorable price/mix in every region and 4% to 5% volume growth in Latin America and Asia Pacific. 
Adjusted EBITDA of $36 million was 8.2% of net sales. As a reminder, first quarter is our seasonally weakest quarter, and we continue to expect constant dollar sales growth as well as margin expansion for the full year. 
Also keep in mind, we have continued to invest in disruptive technologies, including specific investments in robotics. We are winning new strategic customers, and we have already started servicing those customers this quarter in facility management and food service industries. Our focus on sustainability, productivity and integration of chemicals, tools and machinery is being recognized throughout the industry. 
This quarter, from a vertical market perspective, sales increased in food service, retail and in hospitality. We have gained traction with our advanced floor care solutions with the installation of IntelliTrail, the advanced GPS tracking system, on more than 1,100 TASKI machines, and we see rapidly growing demand for our Intellibot portfolio. 
Now let's turn to our Product Care results on Slide 9. Product Care's net sales were essentially unchanged on a year-over-year basis, where volume growth offset by unfavorable price/mix. You may recall that we divested a $15 million product line in North America in January, yet we held volumes relatively flat as compared to last year. 
This is attributable to our strong position in e-commerce and third-party logistics for the fulfillment market, where we continue to experience double-digit growth. We also have been able to maintain good pricing disciplines despite lower input cost as our customers recognize the value add of our new and innovative solutions combined with our global reach and broad product portfolio. 
I also want to highlight our business in Europe, where we delivered 6% volume growth in light of ongoing rationalization efforts. Our performance was attributable to the successful integration of our B+ acquisition and the traction we've gained with our automated solutions, including the B+ portfolio, FloWrap, inflatable bubble and Sealed Air. 
In the second quarter, we will divest a $12 million product line in Europe, which we should -- which should complete our product rationalization efforts. For the year, we anticipate top line growth and margin expansion with a stronger second half of the year given our success in the fulfillment market.

Free cash flow was the use of cash of $48 million in the first quarter. CapEx increased to $52 million as compared to $21 million during the same period a year ago, of which $15 million was related to our Charlotte campus. 
Working capital and other assets and liabilities for a use of cash of $141 million. Operating working capital as a percent of net sales based on a 13-month average is relatively the same since year-end at 14.5%. As compared to a year ago, we improved 160 basis points. 
We believe there is still opportunity for further -- to further improve payables and inventory management, even though we have reached our long-term target of 15%. For the full year, we continue to expect working capital to be a source of cash of approximately $100 million. 
Turning to Slide 11. We are reaffirming our outlook for 2016. Net sales are expected to be approximately $6.8 billion. The impact from the Food Care divestitures on 2016 net sales is $102 million, of which $67 million impacted the first quarter. We continue to forecast adjusted EBITDA in the range of $1.17 billion to $1.19 billion. The impact from the Food Care divestitures on 2016 EBITDA is $21 million, of which $14 million impacted the first quarter. 
We expect our second quarter results to be down on a year-over-year basis, due primarily to formula pricing and Food Care. However, as Jerome noted, we expect sequential improvement in every quarter going forward. 
Our medical and corporate expenses are expected to be a net expense of $100 million for the full year 2016 as we continue to invest in our next-generation digital technologies. Our interest expense for 2016 is estimated at $225 million. Depreciation and amortization is forecast to be approximately $285 million. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be within the range that we previously provided of $2.52 to $2.60. 
At this point in time, we are not updating our outlook on currency translation. As you know, markets have been extremely volatile and we are focusing on what we can control. We are on track to achieve our free cash flow target of approximately $550 million. 
CapEx is expected to be $275 million, which includes approximately $125 million related to the investment we are making in our Charlotte campus and other capital restructuring activities. Excluding these items, maintenance and growth CapEx combined is estimated to be $150 million. 
Cash restructuring payments are estimated at $110 million, and we expect to realize, restructuring savings of approximately $30 million. Cash interest payments are expected to be $220 million, and cash tax payments are estimated at $125 million. 
In closing, I would like to once again note that we are confident we are investing in the right markets and in the right regions that will enable us to capitalize on future growth opportunities. We are not ignoring the global environment. We have and we will continue to advance continuous improvement and realize further operational efficiency. 
With our most challenging quarter now behind us, we look forward to delivering improved performance for the balance of the year and in the years ahead. 
Before I open the call to questions, I would like to remind you, our second quarter earnings call is tentatively scheduled for Thursday, July 28. We have invited Dr. Ilham Kadri, President of Diversey Care, to join Jerome and me for the Q2 call. 
Operator, can you please now open the call for questions?"

The -- we need to go back to what we have guided towards, and you remember that it is the first time we gave a guidance for a specific quarter, and we did that because we knew what was happening from the pricing coming negative and growth being somewhat muted in -- at the beginning of the year; the divestiture and the currency headwind. So as far as I'm concerned, really, no surprise. The only surprise has been coming from how steep Latin America Food Care has been with 6% volume decline, but this is very specific. It's been very specific in -- as a result of Venezuela, which has melted down, and as Brazil, which has had -- and Karl will add a little bit in that, which have seen very, very steep local meat consumption reductions and very high prices of meat. So -- and next to that in Latin America, by the way, our Diversey Care business has been very strong, specifically in Brazil, Argentina, Chile and so on. So we said -- we prepared and we said all of that early February, and we are exactly where we said we would be in the end. With regards to the rest of the year, we are going to be talking specifically about the 3 divisions. But you need to remember that in Product Care to start with, we -- because of the strength and the growth that we have in third-party logistics and e-commerce, we are going to now have -- this division have its very specific seasonality towards Q4. And we are extremely optimistic, thanks to our equipment placement and our customer wins, that we are going to have sequentially very nice quarters of growth there. With regards to Diversey Care, we have had some very specific one-offs in North America as a result of channel sales being a little bit muted and ERP consequence -- implementation consequences as happens to every single company when they go through that experience. But we are very fine and very pleased with what's going on in North America, specifically happy with what's going on in Asia Pacific with renewed nice growth in China, for example, strong in India, as always, et cetera, et cetera. And therefore, we're pleased with what we've seen. In Food Care, I will let Karl speak more specifically about it. But we've got some tailwind coming from the beef cycle. We've got proteins in general doing quite well and we've got very nice innovation. All of these make me confirm that you are going to see, as I said, already last year -- late last year and early this year, we're going to have nice growth -- renewing with nice growth, and that this growth is going to be more on volume than it is going to be on price as a result of the rise in prices."

Just real briefly, I mean, there's no doubt that Venezuela being down almost 59%, Brazil being down 8.5%, are ongoing issues. We do see Brazil, though, not improving immediately, but there is a medium- to long-term positive trends in Brazil. I mean, obviously, the Brazilian animal prices are still at a relatively all-time high. We do see retail prices dropping due to lack of demand, but we also see their export market having favorable trends occurring. If you remember, one of the reasons Brazil export market was down is they were predominantly exporting to Venezuela and Russia, which have their own unique economic issues. But they've gained access -- although some small work yet left to do to gain access to U.S. as an export market. They're gaining significant business in China as an export market and parts of Asia, somewhat to fill the void left by Australia slaughter being down. So we do believe that's a mid- to long-term positive in Brazil. We are also very favorable in the rest of our emerging markets, where we have over around 5% volume growth. And then we're still very, very positive on our volume growth in North America, 4%, and Europe with 3%, where we basically have a strategy of growing geographically as well as growing in mature markets through innovation. So we're still seeing both of those through -- going through."

In salary wage inflation and cost of goods sold, the salary wage inflation is approximately $9 million, and that gets you to the $16 million. If we look at the $12 million that I referenced on inventory variances, that is largely due to timing relative to capitalized variances that we amortized over our inventory turns and varies from quarter-to-quarter, year-to-year, depending on inventory levels, what's capitalized, purchase price variances, efficiencies in the factories. But again, it's largely timing. So again, the 2 major components are typical compensation inflation that we have every year as well as the inventory variances, of which most is capitalized and then amortized."

So George, it -- without getting into a lot of detail, on the inventory variances, when we reset standards periodically, we have internal guidelines that we follow in terms of when we have changes from our standards by more than a certain percentage, typically using a 10% rule of thumb. That can be impacted within a region or a country based on the amount of imports that we're doing. Are they impacted by purchase price variances? Are they impacted by FX transaction costs, which are different than translation costs as well as the operational efficiencies that impact our indirect supply chain costs, our fixed and administrative costs for running our factories and our warehouses and logistics network? So it's a combination of all of those as we bring them together and looking at the change for inventory values and properly capitalizing the amount so it's reflected in our inventory turns as we move forward. And on a year-over-year basis, obviously, that can be very different, depending on where we end one quarter from an inventory level standpoint and efficiencies within that quarter versus comparison to the following year.

George, thank you for the question, and I'll try to be very brief but specific. We do have a lot of confidence that the cattle cycle and the herd is continuing to be rebuilt and that additional animals are currently going to market. You're absolutely right. Weather, feed cost, currency all have an impact, and drought as it impacts pasture conditions can significantly have an impact. But corn projections, although up slightly, are still very favorable. The amount of good to very good pasture conditions are still at a high level. So currency is still maybe impacts some on export, but still, the fundamentals are there. The producers are making money. The cow/calf operations are making money and they were still retaining heifers. We don't have a balance of steers and heifers coming to market yet. When you see that, that will be an indication that they built the herd as large as they're going to build it, so we do see them continuing to build the herd. If you go back to what we said at Investor's Day, it's a baseline. We're right on target. We believe that the herd will continue to be built and that additional animals will come to market over the next 3 years at a minimum."

So we have 2 key markets for us that the market conditions are unfavorable, but yet we kept relatively flat volumes. And we did that with diversification, new product innovation, disruptive innovations that have allowed us to grow in a down market. We would anticipate that the Australian beef market will stay relatively negative for at least 2 years because they're just starting their herd rebuilding cycle, but they are rebuilding the herd. So again, mid to long term, we're still very favorable in that segment of the market. But -- so that's some color in Australia and New Zealand. In Brazil, obviously, Brazil is an important part of our long-range strategy. And we think fundamentally, with their -- the infrastructure they have in producing food, whether it's poultry, beef and a growing amount of pork, that we're well-positioned to capitalize on as those markets recover. We're still heavily entrenched in the key customers in that region and continue to provide automation, new product introductions as well to position ourselves for when they -- their volumes return. Venezuela is a more longer-term concern, and again, though, they're a nice part of Latin America, but much smaller on the grand scheme of things. So we have great confidence in our total Latin America business, where we're still seeing volume growth minus the 2 areas of concern.

We also know what's going on in Brazil, but the situation is extremely different. What you have is the perfect storm in Brazil. You have had high meat prices and you read the newspaper like me and, therefore, you have had socioeconomical difficulties there. And as you combine very high red meat prices and the situation I just talked about, you have had, in the first quarter, the highest meat consumption decrease that you ever had since statistics have existed in Brazil. So that's what I would call a temporary factor, because at the very same time, you didn't have very much exports. But exports from Brazil meats are going to be improving and, therefore, as the year passes, we believe that, that situation is going to be improving, both from the meat prices, cattle and herd prices and from the economic situation as the rise in political anxiety. So if you exclude Brazil and Venezuela, which it is what it is, we would -- you would have seen that we would have a solid volume growth in the rest of Latin America, which is very encouraging. So we're not throwing the baby with the bathwater. We've been very specifically hit in this first quarter. It's not going to be a quick recovery, but the cattle and herd is going to be rebuilding in Brazil also and you're going to have some positive effects from Argentina over time as the new government, the Macri government, is going to enable exports. They have started to do this at small levels, but they are going to liberalize meat exports. So I think it's -- all of this is positive."

I'm sure that you have the time to review our second quarter earnings results and I will keep my comments brief and then pass the call on to Carol Lowe, our CFO; and Dr. [indiscernible], President of our Diversey Care Division, to provide a more detailed review of our second quarter performance and full year outlook. 
Our second quarter results were in line with our expectations each of our 3 divisions. We knew from the onset of the year that our growth in the first half would be muted. Food Care, Diversey Care and Product Care capitalized on growth opportunities in targeted countries and end markets, which offset other areas challenged by economic uncertainties, political unrest and a weak industrial environment. Overall, I am pleased with our adjusted EBITDA results of $306 million or 17.7% of net sales, which includes about $7 million of reimbursement related to environmental expenses on a slight increase in organic net sales. 
Excluding this reimbursement, we had a very solid adjusted EBITDA margin performance of over 17% of sales. Product Care delivered over 21% margin, Food Care over 20%, and for the first time Diversey Care delivered 15% margin, excluding the environmental reimbursements. As we look to the second half, and as previously communicated, we expect stronger performance, primarily driven by volume acceleration. 
In Food Care, the operation rate continues to penetrate the market in Europe and we are in successful trials with 2 large retailers in North America. Diversey Care is enjoying new customer wins across its portfolio and our robotics start up, Intellibot, delivered record sales in May and June. 
In Product Care, our new innovation pipeline and customer inflows are building as we prepare for a seasonally strong year-end. This momentum, coupled with an improved protein market and accelerated growth in e-commerce and fulfillment, gives us the confidence in our second half growth trajectory. 
For full year, our outlook is within the range of our previously provided guidance. Currently, headwinds are not as high as we anticipated. But this benefit is being offset by our assumptions on rate and cost and the related impact on Food Care's formula pricing. Additionally, we anticipate the recent geopolitical events in Europe and the Middle East to have an impact on our business in the coming months. 
Overall, our strategy is clearly working. Our market differentiation of revolutionary innovation is gaining significant traction in each of our divisions. In Food Care, customer interest continues to increase for our next-generation target technology, [indiscernible]. Diversey Care disrupted and innovated technology, including  the Internet of Things platform and digitally enabled solutions are increasing our sales opportunities in a meaningful way.
In May, we receive a Innovation Award at the ISSA Trade Show in Amsterdam. And Product Care has shared its entire portfolio and go-to-market strategy with Dimension and Ways and Fulfillment Velocity and Consumer Experience solution. 
I strongly encourage all of you to attend 2 upcoming tradeshows: The ISSA in late October; and Pack Expo in early November, both of which are being held in Chicago. At Pack Expo, Product Care will showcase more commercialized innovation that they ever had in the history of Sealed Air. 
So with that said, let me now pass on the call to Carol and William to get into more details by division and our outlook. And then we will answer any questions that you may have. Carol?"

Let me start with EMEA, where we had 2.5% organic growth and positive sales across our 3 divisions. Food Care sales increased 3%, Diversey Care increased 1% and Product Care increased 5%. On a by-country basis, EMEA was led by double-digit growth in Russia and high single-digit growth in Spain and Holland. We also experienced positive sales in Germany and Sweden. 
Asia Pacific was up 1% in constant dollars. India was up 12% led by double-digit growth in Diversey Care and Product Care. In China, Diversey Care delivered high single-digit growth and Product Care's business returned to growth in the quarter. Our largest market in Asia Pacific are Australia and New Zealand. And combined, they account for 6% of our total net sales and just over 10% of Food Care sales. 
In Food Care, sales in Australia and New Zealand were essentially flat compared to last year. In Australia, adoption of our advanced product portfolio and new customer wins are helping to offset the double-digit declines in slaughter rate and the export of live animals. In New Zealand, our business continues to be impacted by the ongoing weakness in the global dairy market. 
Latin America was hit the hardest by currency devaluations and socio- and political instability. On a reported basis, Latin America was down 11%, which translates into constant dollar growth of 8%. Despite the current environment in Latin America, Food Care experienced positive sales growth in Brazil and Mexico on an as-reported basis. This translates into nearly 20% growth in both countries on a constant dollar basis. Brazil and Mexico each accounted for approximately 4% of Food Care sales. 
Let's move to Slide 6 and look at trends in North America. Overall, North America sales were down 2% on an organic basis due to unfavorable price/mix of 3%, partially offset by 1% volume growth. Food Care delivered healthy volume growth of 3%. This was more than offset by unfavorable formula pass-throughs. Diversey Care's North America business returned to growth in the second quarter with positive price/mix and volume trends. Product Care's volume and product mix were negatively impacted by the ongoing weakness in the industrial market, particularly in manufacturing and electronics. Volume was also impacted by our rationalization efforts. Excluding rationalization, volume would have been positive in the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 7. Let me walk you through our net sales and adjusted EBITDA performance on a year-over-year basis. Starting with the net sales, you can see that we delivered $1.7 billion. Volume contributed $9 million to top line growth and favorable price/mix contributed $7 million. Unfavorable currency translation was $59 million and the impact from divestitures was $15 million. 
On Slide 8, you can see that our adjusted EBITDA was $306 million or 17.7% of net sales. Mix and price cost spread was $9 million favorable and positive volume contributed $4 million. We had $9 million in restructuring savings. Operating expenses of $12 million is net of the $7 million environmental reimbursement Jerome mentioned in his comments earlier. Salary and wage inflation of $17 million, currency was negative $9 million and divestitures were $3 million. 
Adjusted earnings per share was $0.65 in the second quarter. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 29%. For the full year, we continue to expect our tax rate to be approximately 24%. 
Let me now turn the call over to Ilham to go through our results by division. Ilham?"

Diversey Care net sales on a constant dollar basis were at 2.4% in the second quarter. We had positive sales growth in constant dollars in all regions. Asia Pacific was our fastest-growing region with 7% constant dollar sales growth. In North America and Europe, constant dollar sales were at 3% and 2.4%, respectively. 
If you look at our adjusted EBITDA excluding the environmental reimbursement, we delivered $80 million or 15% of net sales. Volume, pricing and cost management all contributed to our strong EBITDA performance. It's worth noting that in the last 2.5 years, with the exception of 1 quarter, we delivered positive constant dollar sales and adjusted EBITDA growth every quarter. I am particularly proud of the performance in North America and Europe over this time period. Remember that when we reorganized this business back in 2013, both Europe and North America had many years of declining sales and deteriorating margins. Whereas Middle East, Africa and Latin America increased sales on a constant dollar basis this quarter, we are seeing a slowdown in our business due to political unrest in the Middle East and economic weakness in Argentina. Middle East, Africa and Latin America combined represents 15% [ph] of our sales. Looking ahead, we are confident the momentum in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific will continue. We are rolling out new customers and adding to our list of strategic wins across all sectors, including facility management, retail and health care sectors. 
Customer feedback on our Robotics and Internet of Things platforms has been extremely positive, and as a result we're accelerating our go-to-market strategy. For the full year, we expect constant dollar adjusted EBITDA growth and margin expansion. The third quarter will experience a decline versus quarter 2 as we step up our implementation of new sites related to recent customer wins and the significant slowdown in hospitality in Middle East, Africa. We expect our fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA to be stronger given the timing of the new customer rollouts and product and regional mix heading into year-end. 
Let's now turn to Slide 10 and review Food Care results. Food Care sales increased 1% on an organic basis driven by a combination of higher volume and favorable price/mix. By region, Latin America was up 11% and EMEA increased 3%. Asia Pacific was essentially unchanged and North America declined 3%. Adjusted EBITDA was $163 million, or 20.3% of net sales. Positive volume in North America and EMEA is largely a result of our case-ready platform, including dairy fresh entrée. Also our next-generation barrier technology, Optidur, is gaining traction with successful trials in North America, Asia Pacific and Europe. 
In Hygiene, we continue to improve both sales trends and profitability. We are also investing in new solutions, including our recent acquisition of Finland-based, [indiscernible], a leading, cleaning place systems optimization company. This acquisition complements our expertise in remote monitoring and data analytics and enhances our knowledge-based service offering. 
In the second half of the year, Food Care organic sales growth is expected to accelerate, primarily driven by increase in sales volume in North America and Europe. Both region will benefit from higher protein productions level as well as continued adoption of advanced product. We also believe our packaging business in Brazil is beginning to stabilize with 4% volume growth in the second quarter. These positive trends will be partially offset by declines in Australia and New Zealand and North America formula pricing. 
On the bottom line, we continue to expect sequential growth in absolute dollars in the third and fourth quarter, resulting in full year organic EBITDA growth and margin expansion. As Jerome noted, Food Care EBITDA will be negatively impacted by our assumption of raw material cost heading into year-end. 
Let's turn to Product Care results on Slide 11. Product Care's net sales in constant dollars were down 1.5% due to a 4% decline in North America, partially offset by mid-single-digit growth in EMEA. We continue to experience strong growth in e-commerce and fulfillment in the first half of the year on a global basis. In North America, this was more than offset by ongoing weakness in the industrial sector. Also keep in mind that we divested $15 [ph] million of annualized sales in North America in January, and another $12 million of annualized sales in Europe in May. Excluding these guidance figures, global volume trends would have been stronger and we would have delivered a slight uptick in North America. 
In the second half of the year, and more so in the fourth quarter than the third quarter, we expect our constant dollar growth rate to accelerate. Demand continues to increase for our inflexible [indiscernible] Korrvu, [indiscernible], [indiscernible] and [indiscernible] equipment platform. This level of demand is translating into strong double-digit growth in equipment sales and installments. 
For the full year 2016, top line growth coupled with our focus on pricing and cost discipline will drive custom dollar EBITDA growth and margin expansion. 
Now let me pass the call back to Carol to review our free cash flow and our outlook for 2016. Carol?"

Free cash flow was a source of cash of $68 million in the first half of the year. CapEx increased to $114 [ph] million as compared to $58 million during the same period a year ago, of which $40 million was related to our Charlotte campus. Working capital and other assets and liabilities where a use of cash of $165 million. Operating working capital as a percent of net sales based on a 13-month average is relatively the same since year-end at 14.3%. As compared to June 30 last year, we improved 130 basis points. 
Now turning to outlook on Slide 13. Net sales are expected to be approximately $6.85 billion. The impact from the Food Care divestitures on 2016 net sales is $102 million, of which $82 million impacted the first half of the year. Currency is expected to have an unfavorable impact on sales of approximately $275 million. Our outlook for adjusted EBITDA is now at $1.17 billion to $1.18 billion. The impact from the Food Care divestitures on 2016 EBITDA is $21 million, of which $17 million impacted the first half of the year. Currency is expected to have an unfavorable impact on EBITDA of approximately $45 million. 
As Jerome mentioned earlier, we are expecting accelerated EBITDA growth in the second half of the year and anticipate that the fourth quarter will be our strongest quarter of the year. Strength in the fourth quarter will be driven by higher Food Care volumes, our customer rollout schedule in Diversey Care and seasonal strength in Product Care. Our medical and corporate expenses are expected to be a net expense of $90 [ph] million for the full year 2016. Our interest expense for 2016 is estimated at $225 million. Depreciation and amortization is forecast to be approximately $280 million. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be at the high end of our previously provided range of $2.52 to $2.60. 
We are maintaining our free cash flow target of approximately $550 million. CapEx is expected to be $275 million, which includes approximately $125 million related to the investment we are making in our Charlotte campus and other capital restructuring activities. Excluding these items, maintenance and growth CapEx combined is estimated to be approximately $150 million. 
For the full year, we continue to expect working capital and other assets liabilities to be a source of cash of approximately $100 million. Cash restructuring payments are estimated to be $110 million and we expect to realize restructuring savings of approximately $30 million. Cash interest payments are expected to be $220 million and cash tax payments are estimated at $125 million. 
As we head into year end, we will focus on what we can control and look for opportunities that will help mitigate potential impact of the macro environment. We will continue investing to support our future growth opportunities. Our focus on execution and delivering profitable growth is embedded in our winning culture. 
Before I open the call to questions, I would like to remind you, our third quarter earnings call is tentatively scheduled for Thursday, October 27. We have invited Kevin, President of Product Care, to join Jerome and I on that call.

I've said from the very beginning that the first half was going to be rereviewed and that we were going to see business acceleration. What I also said was that this was going to grow mostly with volume. What I didn't think was going to happen to the -- was the assumptions that I have -- that we have put on rate and prices. And they have been lower than what we thought. That is having an impact on our formula pricing. You know how important they are. And we were thinking at the time that those formula pricing in Food Care in North America were mostly going to be in the first half and not in the second half. Well because of what working prices are and we anticipate they're going to be, we are going to have negative formula pricing in the second half. And that's basically how we are seeing the situation today. Having said that, our global price/mix in Food Care and price/mix versus cost price will be positive for the full year but not as positive as we had originally forecasted. So that's basically the slight difference. This is impacting sales growth because of the net sales as a result of the lower rate in prices. But what we're doing here is we're narrowing the range that we're having and that's mostly what we're doing here. And keep in mind that pricing dropped straight to the bottom line. Now that's great. The important thing to remember here is the volume trend. And the volume trend is really, as per what we were expecting. And why are we seeing good volume trend? It is very clearly the impact of our innovation is kicking in."

With regards to Darfresh On Tray, the value proposition in several front. Number one, you have vacuum skin packaging, which is improving shelflife and this has value for the retailer.

When you look at Product Care, and I would let then Ilham comment on Diversey Care, you absolutely you need to come to PAC Expo this autumn as I mentioned in my prepared remarks. You will see in there as the booth with the highest innovations, and that is what is driving our growth. Our e-commerce business is growing extremely well. What is in Product Care, it's one and simple, is that industrial GDP is good. If you look at the CAT index, which is the truck and rail freight index, it is at the lowest since 2010 right now. So you can't pretend the economy, the industrial economy is doing really well because it does. When you look at e-commerce and when you look at how we are doing in that environment, actually, we clearly are partnering with our customers fulfillment companies 3PLs to join them in the growth they're expecting and in the growth map. We have multiplied by 2.5 the installs of our small equipment in North America. We have done the same, but we have increased by 15% the installs of our small equipment in EMEA and almost 30% in Asia.

With regards to the resin, actually, that's what I said before. Entering the year, I said in the February call that we were seeing the resin being weak and staying weak for a year. And they haven't been that weak because you had these price increases in March and you had these price increases in April. And whereas one could anticipate that they wouldn't hold for a long time, so far, so good for the producers. They have helped quite a lot. So therefore, this has had, and will have in the second half a negative impact, which is in fact eliminating the positive impact from lower -- from better currency movements that we're going to take. So we are going to have a negative formula pricing there. And I just don't know what to tell you because I don't think that resin prices would be where they are as I thought there they would be at the beginning of the year where they are right now. So capacity will be coming next year and so on. And The whole thing will very much depend on hurricane, we're entering the hurricane season.

And what you're seeing is that it's going to be less than 3 [ph]. And that is not because of volume, it is because of resin prices and a little bit of weakness in the sectors on hospitality that I just talked about. But those kinds of things and situations are happening every single day. Every single day we have positives and we have negatives. So if resin prices have -- would have gone up another 10%, you would've seen our sales growth go up more than what I would have said at the beginning of the year and 3.5%. And there is a lag on those kind of things because of the pricing. So the real question to say is that [indiscernible] you're saying 3.5% [ph], you're saying slightly less than 3 [ph], is there a problem? Well, no. It's basically when you have a raw material, which is a part of your cost base and then you have formulas, which in time correct for overall pricing without impacting your margin, you have slightly less dollars sales. If we have resin prices going up or doubling in the next 5 years, what you're going to see our proportional improvements from Sealed Air, which is not necessarily the case under a few years ago even if the proportion increased in our top levered sales. So that separates what is an external environment which impacts potentially your net sales but not your margins with internal issues. Let me confirm to you point-blank very clearly, we are ahead of everything we said we would be doing in our Investor Day. Our innovation is kicking in better. And this is what is going to fuel our margin and our business in the future."

And now as material costs are falling, my understanding is a lot of your formulaic pass-throughs that it's basically passing through. I mean it doesn't have a dollar impact to Sealed Air. It sounds now like maybe, Jerome, what you're saying that while you're still on track to that volume growth at the back half of the year to make up that T, that the revenue growth may not be there because some of the mechanisms are lower in price. Is there something perhaps different in the competitive landscape today that's not enabling you to -- or that's cutting price perhaps more than just what the formulas are moving, impeding your ability to kind of work on the net price side? What's changed perhaps from a quarter or so ago to today, or if this has progressed?"

I'm sure that you had the time to review our second quarter earnings results, and I will keep my comments brief, and then pass the call on to Carol Lowe, our CFO; and Dr. Ilham Kadri, President of our Diversey Care Division, to provide a more detailed review of our second quarter performance and full year outlook. 
Our second quarter results were in line with our expectations in each of our 3 divisions. We knew from the onset of the year that our growth in the first half would be muted. Food Care, Diversey Care and Product Care capitalized on growth opportunities in targeted countries and end markets, which offset other areas challenged by economic uncertainties, political unrest and a weak industrial environment. 
Overall, I am pleased with our adjusted EBITDA results of $306 million or 17.7% of net sales, which includes about $7 million of reimbursement related to environmental expenses on a slight increase in organic net sales. 
Excluding this reimbursement, we had a very solid adjusted EBITDA margin performance of over 17% of sales. Product Care delivered over 21% margin; Food Care, over 20%; and for the first time, Diversey Care delivered 15% margin, excluding the environmental reimbursements. As we look to the second half and as previously communicated, we expect stronger performance, primarily driven by volume acceleration. 
In Food Care. The operation rate continues to penetrate the market in Europe, and we are in successful trials with 2 large retailers in North America. Diversey Care is enjoying new customer wins across its portfolio, and our robotics start-up, Intellibot, delivered record sales in May and June. 
In Product Care. Our new innovation pipeline and customer inflows are building as we prepare for a seasonally strong year-end. This momentum, coupled with an improved protein market and accelerated growth in e-commerce and fulfillment, gives us the confidence in our second half growth trajectory. 
For full year, our outlook is within the range of our previously provided guidance. Currency headwinds are not as high as we anticipated. But this benefit is being offset by our assumptions on rate and cost and the related impact on Food Care's formula pricing. Additionally, we anticipate the recent geopolitical events in Europe and the Middle East to have an impact on our business in the coming months. 
Overall, our strategy is clearly working. Our market differentiation of revolutionary innovation is gaining significant traction in each of our divisions. In Food Care, customer interest continues to increase for our next-generation target technology, Optidur. Diversey Care's disrupted and innovated technology, including the Internet of Things platform and digitally enabled solutions are increasing our sales opportunities in a meaningful way.
In May, we receive the top Innovation Award at the ISSA/INTERCLEAN trade show in Amsterdam. And Product Care has reshared its entire portfolio and go-to-market strategy with Dimensional Weight, Fulfillment Velocity and Consumer Experience solutions. 
I strongly encourage all of you to attend 2 upcoming trade shows: The ISSA/INTERCLEAN in late October, and PACK EXPO in early November, both of which are being held in Chicago. At PACK EXPO, Product Care will showcase more commercialized innovation that they ever had in the history of Sealed Air. 
So with that said, let me now pass on the call to Carol and Ilham to get into more details by division and our outlook, and then we will answer any questions that you may have. Carol?"

Let me start with EMEA, where we had 2.5% organic growth and positive sales across our 3 divisions. Food Care sales increased 3%, Diversey Care increased 1% and Product Care increased 5%. On a by-country basis, EMEA was led by double-digit growth in Russia and high single-digit growth in Spain and Holland. We also experienced positive sales in Germany and Sweden. 
Asia Pacific was up 1% in constant dollars. India was up 12% led by double-digit growth in Diversey Care and Product Care. In China, Diversey Care delivered high single-digit growth, and Product Care's business returned to growth in the quarter. Our largest markets in Asia Pacific are Australia and New Zealand, and combined, they account for 6% of our total net sales and just over 10% of Food Care sales. 
In Food Care, sales in Australia and New Zealand were essentially flat compared to last year. In Australia, adoption of our advanced product portfolio and new customer wins are helping to offset the double-digit declines in slaughter rate and the export of live animals. In New Zealand, our business continues to be impacted by the ongoing weakness in the global dairy market. 
Latin America was hit the hardest by currency devaluations and socio and political instability. On a reported basis, Latin America was down 11%, which translates into constant dollar growth of 8%. Despite the current environment in Latin America, Food Care experienced positive sales growth in Brazil and Mexico on an as-reported basis. This translates into nearly 20% growth in both countries on a constant dollar basis. Brazil and Mexico each accounted for approximately 4% of Food Care sales. 
Let's move to Slide 6 and look at trends in North America. Overall, North America sales were down 2% on an organic basis due to unfavorable price/mix of 3%, partially offset by 1% volume growth. Food Care delivered healthy volume growth of 3%. This was more than offset by unfavorable formula pass-throughs. Diversey Care's North America business returned to growth in the second quarter with positive price/mix and volume trends. Product Care's volume and product mix were negatively impacted by the ongoing weakness in the industrial market, particularly in manufacturing and electronics. Volume was also impacted by our rationalization efforts. Excluding rationalization, volume would have been positive in the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 7. Let me walk you through our net sales and adjusted EBITDA performance on a year-over-year basis. Starting with the net sales, you can see that we delivered $1.7 billion. Volume contributed $9 million to top line growth, and favorable price/mix contributed $7 million. Unfavorable currency translation was $59 million, and the impact from divestitures was $15 million. 
On Slide 8, you can see that our adjusted EBITDA was $306 million or 17.7% of net sales. Mix and price cost spread was $9 million favorable, and positive volume contributed $4 million. We had $9 million in restructuring savings. Operating expenses of $12 million is net of the $7 million environmental reimbursement Jerome mentioned in his comments earlier. Salary and wage inflation of $17 million, currency was negative $9 million and divestitures were $3 million. 
Adjusted earnings per share was $0.65 in the second quarter. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 29%. For the full year, we continue to expect our tax rate to be approximately 24%. 
Let me now turn the call over to Ilham to go through our results by division. Ilham?"
382724,372945213,1015574,"Sealed Air Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Sealed Air Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Carol. Slide 9 highlights the results of our Diversey Care division. Diversey Care net sales on a constant dollar basis were at 2.4% in the second quarter.

Diversey Care net sales on a constant dollar basis were at 2.4% in the second quarter. We had positive sales growth in constant dollars in all regions. Asia Pacific was our fastest-growing region with 7% constant dollar sales growth. In North America and Europe, constant dollar sales were at 3% and 2.4%, respectively. 
If you look at our adjusted EBITDA, excluding the environmental reimbursement, we delivered $80 million or 15% of net sales. Volume, pricing and cost management all contributed to our strong EBITDA performance. It's worth noting that in the last 2.5 years, with the exception of 1 quarter, we delivered positive constant dollar sales and adjusted EBITDA growth every quarter. I am particularly proud of the performance in North America and Europe over this time period. Remember that when we reorganized this business back in 2013, both Europe and North America had many years of declining sales and deteriorating margins. Whereas Middle East, Africa and Latin America increased sales on a constant dollar basis this quarter, we are seeing a slowdown in our business due to political unrest in the Middle East and economic weakness in Argentina. Middle East, Africa and Latin America combined represents 15% of our sales. Looking ahead, we are confident the momentum in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific will continue. We are rolling out new customers and adding to our list of strategic wins across all sectors, including facility management, retail and health care sectors. 
Customer feedback on our Robotics and Internet of Things platforms have been extremely positive, and as a result, we're accelerating our go-to-market strategy. For the full year, we expect constant dollar adjusted EBITDA growth and margin expansion. The third quarter will experience a decline versus quarter 2 as we step up our implementation of new sites related to recent customer wins and the significant slowdown in hospitality in Middle East, Africa. We expect our fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA to be stronger given the timing of the new customer rollouts and product and regional mix heading into year-end. 
Let's now turn to Slide 10 and review Food Care results. Food Care sales increased 1% on an organic basis, driven by a combination of higher volume and favorable price/mix. By region, Latin America was up 11%, and EMEA increased 3%. Asia Pacific was essentially unchanged, and North America declined 3%. Adjusted EBITDA was $163 million or 20.3% of net sales. Positive volume in North America and EMEA is largely a result of our case-ready platform, including Darfesh on Tray. Also our next-generation barrier technology, Optidur, is gaining traction with successful trials in North America, Asia Pacific and Europe. 
In Hygiene, we continue to improve both sales trends and profitability. We are also investing in new solutions, including our recent acquisition of Finland-based, TTS-Ciptec, a leading Clean-In-Place systems optimization company. This acquisition complements our expertise in remote monitoring and data analytics and enhances our knowledge-based service offering. 
In the second half of the year, Food Care organic sales growth is expected to accelerate, primarily driven by increase in sales volume in North America and Europe. Both regions will benefit from higher protein productions level as well as continued adoption of advanced products. We also believe our packaging business in Brazil is beginning to stabilize with 4% volume growth in the second quarter. These positive trends will be partially offset by declines in Australia and New Zealand and North America formula pricing. 
On the bottom line, we continue to expect sequential growth in absolute dollars in the third and fourth quarter, resulting in full year organic EBITDA growth and margin expansion. As Jerome noted, Food Care EBITDA will be negatively impacted by our assumption of raw material cost heading into year-end. 
Let's turn to Product Care results on Slide 11. Product Care's net sales in constant dollars were down 1.5% due to a 4% decline in North America, partially offset by mid-single-digit growth in EMEA. We continue to experience strong growth in e-commerce and fulfillment in the first half of the year on a global basis. In North America, this was more than offset by ongoing weakness in the industrial sector. Also keep in mind that we divested $15 million of annualized sales in North America in January and another $12 million of annualized sales in Europe in May. Excluding these divestitures, global volume trends would have been stronger and we would have delivered a slight uptick in North America. 
In the second half of the year, and more so in the fourth quarter than the third quarter, we expect our constant dollar growth rate to accelerate. Demand continues to increase for our inflatable bubble inflatable bubble, Korrvu, Fill-Air, B+ and FloWrap equipment platform. This level of demand is translating into strong double-digit growth in equipment sales and installments. 
For the full year 2016, top line growth coupled with our focus on pricing and cost discipline will drive custom dollar EBITDA growth and margin expansion. 
Now let me pass the call back to Carol to review our free cash flow and our outlook for 2016. Carol?"

Free cash flow was a source of cash of $68 million in the first half of the year. CapEx increased to $114 million as compared to $58 million during the same period a year ago, of which $40 million was related to our Charlotte campus. Working capital and other assets and liabilities or use of cash of $165 million. Operating working capital as a percent of net sales based on a 13-month average is relatively the same since year-end at 14.3%. As compared to June 30 last year, we improved 130 basis points. 
Now turning to outlook on Slide 13. Net sales are expected to be approximately $6.85 billion. The impact from the Food Care divestitures on 2016 net sales is $102 million, of which $82 million impacted the first half of the year. Currency is expected to have an unfavorable impact on sales of approximately $275 million. Our outlook for adjusted EBITDA is now at $1.17 billion to $1.18 billion. The impact from the Food Care divestitures on 2016 EBITDA is $21 million, of which $17 million impacted the first half of the year. Currency is expected to have an unfavorable impact on EBITDA of approximately $45 million. 
As Jerome mentioned earlier, we are expecting accelerated EBITDA growth in the second half of the year and anticipate that the fourth quarter will be our strongest quarter of the year. Strength in the fourth quarter will be driven by higher Food Care volumes, our customer rollout schedule in Diversey Care and seasonal strength in Product Care. Our medical and corporate expenses are expected to be a net expense of $90 million for the full year 2016. Our interest expense for 2016 is estimated at $225 million. Depreciation and amortization is forecast to be approximately $280 million. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be at the high end of our previously provided range of $2.52 to $2.60. 
We are maintaining our free cash flow target of approximately $550 million. CapEx is expected to be $275 million, which includes approximately $125 million related to the investment we are making in our Charlotte campus and other capital restructuring activities. Excluding these items, maintenance and growth CapEx combined is estimated to be approximately $150 million. 
For the full year, we continue to expect working capital and other assets liabilities to be a source of cash of approximately $100 million. Cash restructuring payments are estimated to be $110 million, and we expect to realize restructuring savings of approximately $30 million. Cash interest payments are expected to be $220 million, and cash tax payments are estimated at $125 million. 
As we head into year end, we will focus on what we can control and look for opportunities that will help mitigate potential impact of the macro environment. We will continue investing to support our future growth opportunities. Our focus on execution and delivering profitable growth is embedded in our winning culture. 
Before I open the call to questions, I would like to remind you, our third quarter earnings call is tentatively scheduled for Thursday, October 27. We have invited Ken Chrisman, President of Product Care, to join Jerome and I on that call.

I told -- I've said from the very beginning that the first half was going to be really muted and that we were going to see business acceleration. What I was also -- what I also said was that this was going to grow mostly with volume. What I didn't think was going to happen to the -- was -- the assumptions that I have -- that we have put on rate and prices. And they have been lower than what we thought. That is having an impact on our formula pricing. You know how important they are. And we were thinking at the time that those formula pricing in Food Care in North America were mostly going to be in the first half and not in the second half. Well, because of what working prices are and we anticipate they're going to be, we are going to have negative formula pricing in the second half, and that's basically how we are seeing the situation today. Having said that, our global price/mix in Food Care and price/mix versus cost price will be positive for the full year, but not as positive as we had originally forecasted. So that's basically the slight difference. This is impacting sales growth because of the net sales as a result of the lower rate in prices. But what we're doing here is that we're narrowing the range that we're having, and that's mostly what we're doing here. And keep in mind that pricing dropped straight to the bottom line. So that's great. The important thing to remember here is the volume trend. And the volume trend is really as per what we were expecting. And why are we seeing good volume trend? It is very clearly the impact of our innovation is kicking in."

And this is -- at this point in time in Europe, we have run trials in plants in North America, all extraordinarily successful.

And therefore, overall, in time, it's going to be a quarter load of sales cannibalization but dramatically improved margin expansion for all kind of reasons that we already have talked about and stuff. 
With regards to Darfresh On Tray, the value-selling proposition in several fronts. Number one, you have vacuum skin packaging, which is improving shelf life. And this has value for the retailer. It also has value for the producer because of the shipping time, et cetera. And it has value for the consumer because it can keep the product freezer-ready, keeps the product longer in the fridge, et cetera, et cetera.

When you look at Product Care, and I would let then Ilham comment on Diversey Care, we -- you absolutely need to come to PACK EXPO this autumn, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks. You will see Sealed Air as the booth with the highest innovations, and that is what is driving our growth. Our e-commerce business is growing extremely well. What is the issue in Product Care? It's one and simple. It's that the industrial GDP is not good. Well, if you look at the CAT index, which is the truck and rail freight index, it is at the lowest since 2010 right now. So you can't pretend the economy, the industrial economy is doing really well because it doesn't. But when you look at e-commerce and when you look at how we are doing in that environment, actually, we clearly are partnering with our customers' fulfillment companies' 3PLs to join them in the growth they're expecting and in the growth plans. We have multiplied by 2.5 the installs of our small equipment in North America. We have done the same, but we have increased by 15%, the installs of our small equipment in EMEA and almost 30% in Asia. So this tells you that the consumer was they're going to come during the year.

In North America. North America returned growth, as we told you, in quarter 2, thanks to our health care business doing extremely great, with our unique sustainable technologies there, as well as we are rolling out some large customers in facility management. We are rolling out as we speak, and we have implemented. And kudos to the team, half of the 50,000 sites in the report timing, and we are tracking ahead of time. And last but the least, in APAC, we had a good momentum there as well. We are growing the book, the industries we serve, with 4% out of the 16 Diversey Care coming from volume at [indiscernible] level, as we told you.

And whereas one could anticipate that they wouldn't hold for a long time, so far, so good for the producers. They have helped quite a lot.

So yes, capacity results is going to come in next year and so on and the whole thing will very much depend on the hurricane. We're entering the hurricane season. So some people are wishing for lots of hurricane, and some of it for nothing, et cetera. So it's very difficult to predict one. If you have 1 or 2 hurricanes hitting Texas, I tell you, this is going to change the game."

We anticipate that the -- that we can take full advantage of our equipment and our consumables in that market sector. We are completely reinventing this division, and it is growing absolutely fabulous. I told you. I told you at the very beginning of this year. I've told you at the end of last year that you will be surprised with our innovation momentum and customer pickup over time and starting the second half. We have all this time to confirm that this is going on. 
So now rationalization. I told you also in January that we had just divested from historic line in November the U.S., which is $15 million of sales. I told you that we were going to be closing in the second quarter on a plant and the product line in France. And I think I told you that was about $12 million. 
So to your question, yes, we believe that this is basically over in terms of product rationalization there. We have, then you're going to look at Brexit. And the Brexit is having an impact on our translation costs. We have a strong business in Product Care, in Food Care also, in Diversey Care also, in the U.K. So what we have been clearly doing here is that we have announced for a 6% to 8% price increase effective September 1 later, sometimes earlier, in order to capture the transaction costs that we're suffering in -- from the U.K. pound. And that is, what I would say, embedded in our culture now, which is don't take those kind of things and absorb it because we're not in that business. So we have communicated that to our customers. We're moving on. And actually, between you and me, we have been a little bit surprised by how easy this is going through because we -- because everybody understands that this is the way it's supposed to be."

And what you're see in that is that it's going to be slightly less than 3%. And that is not because of volume. It is because of resin prices and a little bit of weakness in the sectors on hospitality that I've just talked about. But those kinds of things and situations are happening every single day. Every single day, we have positives and we have negatives. So if resin prices have -- would have gone up another 10%, you would've seen our sales growth go up more than what I would have said at the beginning of the year, and 3.5%. And there is a lag on those kind of things because of the pricing. So the real question to see -- to say is that -- so you were saying 3.5%. You're saying slightly less than 3%. Is there a problem? Well, no. It's basically when you have a raw material, which is a part of your cost base, and when you have formulas which, in time, correct for your overall pricing without impacting your margin, you have -- you book slightly less dollars sales. 
If we have resin prices going up or doubling in the next 5 years, what you're going to see are proportional improvements from [indiscernible] which was not necessarily the case under a few years ago, but you're going to see a proportional increase in our top-level sales. So that's what separates what is an external environment which impacts potentially your net sale but not your margins with internal issues. Let me confirm to you point-blank very clearly, we are ahead of everything we said we would be doing in our Investor Day. Our innovation is kicking in better. And this is what is going to fuel our margin and our business in the future."

And now as material costs are falling, I mean, my understanding was for a lot of your formulaic pass-throughs that it's basically passing through and that it doesn't have a dollar impact to Sealed Air. It sounds now like maybe, Jerome, what you're saying that while you're still on track to get volume growth to the back half of the year to make up that piece, the revenue growth may not be there because some of the mechanisms are lower in price. Is there something perhaps different in the competitive landscape today that's not enabling you to -- or that's cutting price perhaps more than just what the formulas are moving, that's impeding your ability to kind of work on the net price side?

You have the volumes in North America and -- which have been going up. And now you're going to see it has been nicely going up in the second quarter. It seems to be a sign for a very slight pause in the third quarter, but that's going to be because of the very heavy second quarter harvest. But overall, it is anticipated to increase by over 3.5%. So that trend is on, and it's moving. And you know that over the cycle, we're going to move from about 22 million heads slaughtered to 27 million, 28 million by the end of the decade. That is on its way. 
When -- then in -- you look at the situation in Russia, which is developing its herd, et cetera, things are positive. By the way, our business down there is doing absolutely wonderful.

I'm sure that you had the time to review our second quarter earnings results, and I will keep my comments brief, and then pass the call on to Carol Lowe, our CFO; and Dr. Ilham Kadri, President of our Diversey Care Division, to provide a more detailed review of our second quarter performance and full year outlook. 
Our second quarter results were in line with our expectations in each of our 3 divisions. We knew from the onset of the year that our growth in the first half would be muted. Food Care, Diversey Care and Product Care capitalized on growth opportunities in targeted countries and end markets, which offset other areas challenged by economic uncertainties, political unrest and a weak industrial environment. Overall, I am pleased with our adjusted EBITDA results of $306 million or 17.7% of net sales, which includes about $7 million of reimbursement related to environmental expenses on a slight increase in organic net sales. 
Excluding this reimbursement, we had a very solid adjusted EBITDA margin performance of over 17% of sales. Product Care delivered over 21% margin; Food Care, over 20%; and for the first time, Diversey Care delivered 15% margin, excluding the environmental reimbursements. As we look to the second half and as previously communicated, we expect stronger performance, primarily driven by volume acceleration. 
In Food Care. The operation rate continues to penetrate the market in Europe, and we are in successful trials with 2 large retailers in North America. Diversey Care is enjoying new customer wins across its portfolio, and our robotics start-up, Intellibot, delivered record sales in May and June. In Product Care. Our new innovation pipeline and customer inflows are building as we prepare for a seasonally strong year-end. This momentum, coupled with an improved protein market and accelerated growth in e-commerce and fulfillment, gives us the confidence in our second half growth trajectory. 
For full year, our outlook is within the range of our previously provided guidance. Currency headwinds are not as high as we anticipated. But this benefit is being offset by our assumptions on rate and cost and the related impact on Food Care's formula pricing. Additionally, we anticipate the recent geopolitical events in Europe and the Middle East to have an impact on our business in the coming months. 
Overall, our strategy is clearly working. Our market differentiation of revolutionary innovation is gaining significant traction in each of our divisions. In Food Care, customer interest continues to increase for our next-generation target technology, Optidur. Diversey Care's disrupted and innovated technology, including the Internet of Things platform and digitally enabled solutions are increasing our sales opportunities in a meaningful way. In May, we received the top Innovation Award at the ISSA/INTERCLEAN trade show in Amsterdam. And Product Care has reshared its entire portfolio and go-to-market strategy with Dimensional Weight, Fulfillment Velocity and Consumer Experience solutions. 
I strongly encourage all of you to attend 2 upcoming trade shows: The ISSA/INTERCLEAN in late October, and PACK EXPO in early November, both of which are being held in Chicago. At PACK EXPO, Product Care will showcase more commercialized innovation that they ever had in the history of Sealed Air. 
So with that said, let me now pass on the call to Carol and Ilham to get into more details by division and our outlook, and then we will answer any questions that you may have. Carol?"

Let me start with EMEA, where we had 2.5% organic growth and positive sales across our 3 divisions. Food Care sales increased 3%, Diversey Care increased 1% and Product Care increased 5%. On a by-country basis, EMEA was led by double-digit growth in Russia and high single-digit growth in Spain and Holland. We also experienced positive sales in Germany and Sweden. 
Asia Pacific was up 1% in constant dollars. India was up 12% led by double-digit growth in Diversey Care and Product Care. In China, Diversey Care delivered high single-digit growth, and Product Care's business returned to growth in the quarter. Our largest markets in Asia Pacific are Australia and New Zealand, and combined, they account for 6% of our total net sales and just over 10% of Food Care sales. 
In Food Care, sales in Australia and New Zealand were essentially flat compared to last year. In Australia, adoption of our advanced product portfolio and new customer wins are helping to offset the double-digit declines in slaughter rate and the export of live animals. In New Zealand, our business continues to be impacted by the ongoing weakness in the global dairy market. 
Latin America was hit the hardest by currency devaluations and socio and political instability. On a reported basis, Latin America was down 11%, which translates into constant dollar growth of 8%. Despite the current environment in Latin America, Food Care experienced positive sales growth in Brazil and Mexico on an as-reported basis. This translates into nearly 20% growth in both countries on a constant dollar basis. Brazil and Mexico each accounted for approximately 4% of Food Care sales. 
Let's move to Slide 6 and look at trends in North America. Overall, North America sales were down 2% on an organic basis due to unfavorable price/mix of 3%, partially offset by 1% volume growth. Food Care delivered healthy volume growth of 3%. This was more than offset by unfavorable formula pass-throughs. Diversey Care's North America business returned to growth in the second quarter with positive price/mix and volume trends. Product Care's volume and product mix were negatively impacted by the ongoing weakness in the industrial market, particularly in manufacturing and electronics. Volume was also impacted by our rationalization efforts. Excluding rationalization, volume would have been positive in the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 7. Let me walk you through our net sales and adjusted EBITDA performance on a year-over-year basis. Starting with the net sales, you can see that we delivered $1.7 billion. Volume contributed $9 million to top line growth, and favorable price/mix contributed $7 million. Unfavorable currency translation was $59 million, and the impact from divestitures was $15 million. 
On Slide 8, you can see that our adjusted EBITDA was $306 million or 17.7% of net sales. Mix and price cost spread was $9 million favorable, and positive volume contributed $4 million. We had $9 million in restructuring savings. Operating expenses of $12 million is net of the $7 million environmental reimbursement Jerome mentioned in his comments earlier. Salary and wage inflation of $17 million, currency was negative $9 million and divestitures were $3 million.  Adjusted earnings per share was $0.65 in the second quarter. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 29%. For the full year, we continue to expect our tax rate to be approximately 24%. 
Let me now turn the call over to Ilham to go through our results by division. Ilham?"
382724,372945213,1015861,"Sealed Air Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Sealed Air Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Carol. Slide 9 highlights the results of our Diversey Care division. Diversey Care net sales on a constant dollar basis were at 2.4% in the second quarter.

Diversey Care net sales on a constant dollar basis were at 2.4% in the second quarter. We had positive sales growth in constant dollars in all regions. Asia Pacific was our fastest-growing region with 7% constant dollar sales growth. In North America and Europe, constant dollar sales were at 3% and 2.4%, respectively. 
If you look at our adjusted EBITDA, excluding the environmental reimbursement, we delivered $80 million or 15% of net sales. Volume, pricing and cost management all contributed to our strong EBITDA performance. It's worth noting that in the last 2.5 years, with the exception of 1 quarter, we delivered positive constant dollar sales and adjusted EBITDA growth every quarter. I am particularly proud of the performance in North America and Europe over this time period. Remember that when we reorganized this business back in 2013, both Europe and North America had many years of declining sales and deteriorating margins. Whereas Middle East, Africa and Latin America increased sales on a constant dollar basis this quarter, we are seeing a slowdown in our business due to political unrest in the Middle East and economic weakness in Argentina. Middle East, Africa and Latin America combined represents 15% of our sales. Looking ahead, we are confident the momentum in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific will continue. We are rolling out new customers and adding to our list of strategic wins across all sectors, including facility management, retail and health care sectors. 
Customer feedback on our Robotics and Internet of Things platforms have been extremely positive, and as a result, we're accelerating our go-to-market strategy. For the full year, we expect constant dollar adjusted EBITDA growth and margin expansion. The third quarter will experience a decline versus quarter 2 as we step up our implementation of new sites related to recent customer wins and the significant slowdown in hospitality in Middle East, Africa. We expect our fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA to be stronger given the timing of new customer rollouts and product and regional mix heading into year-end. 
Let's now turn to Slide 10 and review Food Care results. Food Care sales increased 1% on an organic basis, driven by a combination of higher volume and favorable price/mix. By region, Latin America was up 11%, and EMEA increased 3%. Asia Pacific was essentially unchanged, and North America declined 3%. Adjusted EBITDA was $163 million or 20.3% of net sales. Positive volume in North America and EMEA is largely a result of our case-ready platform, including Darfresh on Tray. Also our next-generation barrier technology, Optidur, is gaining traction with successful trials in North America, Asia Pacific and Europe. 
In Hygiene, we continue to improve both sales trends and profitability. We are also investing in new solutions, including our recent acquisition of Finland-based, TTS-Ciptec, a leading Clean-In-Place systems optimization company. This acquisition complements our expertise in remote monitoring and data analytics and enhances our knowledge-based service offering. 
In the second half of the year, Food Care organic sales growth is expected to accelerate, primarily driven by increasing sales volume in North America and Europe. Both regions will benefit from higher protein productions level as well as continued adoption of advanced products. We also believe our packaging business in Brazil is beginning to stabilize with 4% volume growth in the second quarter. These positive trends will be partially offset by declines in Australia and New Zealand and North America formula pricing. On the bottom line, we continue to expect sequential growth in absolute dollars in the third and fourth quarter, resulting in full year organic EBITDA growth and margin expansion. As Jerome noted, Food Care EBITDA will be negatively impacted by our assumption of raw material cost heading into year-end. 
Let's turn to Product Care results on Slide 11. Product Care's net sales in constant dollars were down 1.5% due to a 4% decline in North America, partially offset by mid-single-digit growth in EMEA. We continue to experience strong growth in e-commerce and fulfillment in the first half of the year on a global basis. In North America, this was more than offset by ongoing weakness in the industrial sector. Also keep in mind that we divested $15 million of annualized sales in North America in January and another $12 million of annualized sales in Europe in May. Excluding these divestitures, global volume trends would have been stronger and we would have delivered a slight uptick in North America. 
In the second half of the year, and more so in the fourth quarter than the third quarter, we expect our constant dollar growth rate to accelerate. Demand continues to increase for our inflatable bubble inflatable bubble, Korrvu, Fill-Air, B+ and FloWrap equipment platform. This level of demand is translating into strong double-digit growth in equipment sales and installments. For the full year 2016, top line growth coupled with our focus on pricing and cost discipline will drive constant dollar EBITDA growth and margin expansion. 
Now let me pass the call back to Carol to review our free cash flow and our outlook for 2016. Carol?"

Free cash flow was a source of cash of $68 million in the first half of the year. CapEx increased to $114 million as compared to $58 million during the same period a year ago, of which $40 million was related to our Charlotte campus. Working capital and other assets and liabilities or a use of cash of $165 million. Operating working capital as a percent of net sales based on a 13-month average is relatively the same since year-end at 14.3%. As compared to June 30 last year, we improved 130 basis points. 
Now turning to outlook on Slide 13. Net sales are expected to be approximately $6.85 billion. The impact from the Food Care divestitures on 2016 net sales is $102 million, of which $82 million impacted the first half of the year. Currency is expected to have an unfavorable impact on sales of approximately $275 million. Our outlook for adjusted EBITDA is now at $1.17 billion to $1.18 billion. The impact from the Food Care divestitures on 2016 EBITDA is $21 million, of which $17 million impacted the first half of the year. Currency is expected to have an unfavorable impact on EBITDA of approximately $45 million. 
As Jerome mentioned earlier, we are expecting accelerated EBITDA growth in the second half of the year and anticipate that the fourth quarter will be our strongest quarter of the year. Strength in the fourth quarter will be driven by higher Food Care volumes, our customer rollout schedule in Diversey Care and seasonal strength in Product Care. Our medical and corporate expenses are expected to be a net expense of $90 million for the full year 2016. Our interest expense for 2016 is estimated at $225 million. Depreciation and amortization is forecast to be approximately $280 million. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be at the high end of our previously provided range of $2.52 to $2.60.  We are maintaining our free cash flow target of approximately $550 million. CapEx is expected to be $275 million, which includes approximately $125 million related to the investment we are making in our Charlotte campus and other capital restructuring activities. Excluding these items, maintenance and growth CapEx combined is estimated to be approximately $150 million.  
For the full year, we continue to expect working capital and other assets liabilities to be a source of cash of approximately $100 million. Cash restructuring payments are estimated to be $110 million, and we expect to realize restructuring savings of approximately $30 million. Cash interest payments are expected to be $220 million, and cash tax payments are estimated at $125 million. As we head into year end, we will focus on what we can control and look for opportunities that will help mitigate potential impact of the macro environment. We will continue investing to support our future growth opportunities. Our focus on execution and delivering profitable growth is embedded in our winning culture. 
Before I open the call to questions, I would like to remind you, our third quarter earnings call is tentatively scheduled for Thursday, October 27. We have invited Ken Chrisman, President of Product Care, to join Jerome and I on that call.

I told -- I've said from the very beginning that the first half was going to be really muted and that we were going to see business acceleration. What I was also -- what I also said was that this was going to grow mostly with volume. What I didn't think was going to happen to the -- was -- the assumptions that I have -- that we have put on rate and prices. And they have been lower than what we thought. That is having an impact on our formula pricing. You know how important they are. And we were thinking at the time that those formula pricing in Food Care in North America were mostly going to be in the first half and not in the second half. Well, because of what working prices are and we anticipate they're going to be, we are going to have negative formula pricing in the second half, and that's basically how we are seeing the situation today. Having said that, our global price/mix in Food Care and price/mix versus cost price will be positive for the full year, but not as positive as we had originally forecasted. So that's basically the slight difference. This is impacting sales growth because of the net sales as a result of the lower rate in prices. But what we're doing here is that we're narrowing the range that we're having, and that's mostly what we're doing here. And keep in mind that pricing dropped straight to the bottom line. So that's great. The important thing to remember here is the volume trend. And the volume trend is really as per what we were expecting. And why are we seeing good volume trend? It is very clearly the impact of our innovation is kicking in."

And therefore, overall, in time, it's going to be a quarter load of sales cannibalization but dramatically improved margin expansion for all kind of reasons that we already have talked about and stuff. With regards to Darfresh On Tray, the value-selling proposition in several fronts. Number one, you have vacuum skin packaging, which is improving shelf life. And this has value for the retailer. It also has value for the producer because of the shipping time, et cetera. And it has value for the consumer because it can keep the product freezer-ready, keeps the product longer in the fridge, et cetera, et cetera.

You will see Sealed Air as the booth with the highest innovations, and that is what is driving our growth. Our e-commerce business is growing extremely well. What is the issue in Product Care? It's one and simple. It's that the industrial GDP is not good. Well, if you look at the CAT index, which is the truck and rail freight index, it is at the lowest since 2010 right now. So you can't pretend the economy, the industrial economy is doing really well because it doesn't. But when you look at e-commerce and when you look at how we are doing in that environment, actually, we clearly are partnering with our customers' fulfillment companies' 3PLs to join them in the growth they're expecting and in the growth plans. We have multiplied by 2.5 the installs of our small equipment in North America. We have done the same, but we have increased by 15%, the installs of our small equipment in EMEA and almost 30% in Asia. So this tells you that the consumer boosts are going to come during the year.

We are winning new customers, like in the U.K., where we are rolling out, and will start kicking in by the end of the year. In North America. North America returned growth, as we told you, in quarter 2, thanks to our health care business doing extremely great, with our unique sustainable technologies there, as well as we are rolling out some large customers in facility management. We are rolling out as we speak, and we have implemented. And kudos to the team, half of the 50,000 sites in the report timing, and we are tracking ahead of time. And last but the least, in APAC, we had a good momentum there as well. We are growing the book, the industries we serve, with 4% out of the 16 Diversey Care coming from volume at [indiscernible] level, as we told you. China is growing high-single digits, and India, mid-double-digit, just to highlight few leading and strategic economies for our filled air economy."

You have tourism down, and some hotel chains have published some results, and you could see that tourism is down in France, tourism down in Belgium, down in Morocco, dramatically down in Turkey. Somewhat down in the Middle East. In Egypt, the capacity -- hotel capacity utilization is at 55%, and it's at 50% in Turkey. So you just can't dream of a perfect world because it is not. That is going to – so 2 things are going to impact the newbuild Diversey Care in the third quarter and be favorable in the fourth. One is what I've just talked about. In the first quarter, remember that tourism is, right now, it's big season right now. And the second one is that because of our customer wins, we have a lot, a lot, a lot of installs. And that requires resources, which are being deployed exactly now, and we're going to benefit from those sometime next year. And generally speaking, overall on the net sales growth, it is the pricing and the formula pricing of resin, which is impacting the dollar sales growth. But definitely not the momentum."

With regards to the resin, there you have -- actually, that's what I've said before. Entering the year, I said in the February call that we were seeing the resins being weak and staying weak for a year. And they haven't been that weak because you have had these price increases in March, and you have had these price increases in April. And whereas one could anticipate that they wouldn't hold for a long time, so far, so good for the producers. They have helped quite a lot. So therefore, this has had -- have had, and will have in the second half, a negative impact, which is, in fact, eliminating the positive impact from lower -- from better currency movements that we were anticipating. So we're going to have a negative formula pricing there. And we -- and I just don't know what to tell you because I didn't think that resin prices would be where they are, and I wouldn't have said they would be, at the beginning of the year, where they are right now. So yes, capacity results is going to come in next year and so on and the whole thing will very much depend on the hurricane. We're entering the hurricane season. So some people are wishing for lots of hurricane, and some of it for nothing, et cetera. So it's very difficult to predict one. If you have 1 or 2 hurricanes hitting Texas, I tell you, this is going to change the game."

And the Brexit is having an impact on our translation costs. We have a strong business in Product Care, in Food Care also, in Diversey Care also, in the U.K. So what we have been clearly doing here is that we have announced for a 6% to 8% price increase effective September 1 later, sometimes earlier, in order to capture the transaction costs that we're suffering in -- from the U.K. pound. And that is, what I would say, embedded in our culture now. We just don't take those kind of things and absorb it because we're not in that business. So we have communicated that to our customers.

And what you're seeing is that it's going to be slightly less than 3%. And that is not because of volume. It is because of resin prices and a little bit of weakness in the sectors on hospitality that I've just talked about. But those kinds of things and situations are happening every single day. Every single day, we have positives and we have negatives. So if resin prices have -- would have gone up another 10%, you would have seen our sales growth go up more than what I would have said at the beginning of the year, and 3.5%. And there is a lag on those kind of things because of the pricing. So the real question to see -- to say is that -- so you were saying 3.5%. You're saying slightly less than 3%. Is there a problem? Well, no. It's basically when you have a raw material, which is a part of your cost base, and when you have formulas which, in time, correct for your overall pricing without impacting your margin, you have -- you book slightly less dollar sales. If we have resin prices going up or doubling in the next 5 years, what you're going to see are proportional improvements, which was not necessarily the case under a few years ago, but you're going to see a proportional increase in our top-level sales. So that's what separates what is an external environment which impacts potentially your net sale but not your margins with internal issues. Let me confirm to you point-blank very clearly, we are ahead of everything we said we would be doing in our Investor Day. Our innovation is kicking in better. And this is what is going to fuel our margin and our business in the future."

It sounds now like maybe, Jerome, what you're saying that while you're still on track to get volume growth to the back half of the year to make up that piece, the revenue growth may not be there because some of the mechanisms are lower in price. Is there something perhaps different in the competitive landscape today that's not enabling you to -- or that's cutting price perhaps more than just what the formulas are moving, that's impeding your ability to kind of work on the net price side?

And not only they are responding to dim weight, but they're responding to something which is very, very new, which is that they now start to understand that the packaging looks, that how you present your products through e-commerce packaging is very important. We have all kinds of studies, and we're continuing them, and we're going to publish them at PACK EXPO are showing that the image of the retailer or of the e-commerce company is dramatically conveyed through the packaging, which is, by the way, something that you could very instinctively understand.

I'm sure that you had the time to review our second quarter earnings results, and I will keep my comments brief, and then pass the call on to Carol Lowe, our CFO; and Dr. Ilham Kadri, President of our Diversey Care Division, to provide a more detailed review of our second quarter performance and full year outlook. 
Our second quarter results were in line with our expectations in each of our 3 divisions. We knew from the onset of the year that our growth in the first half would be muted. Food Care, Diversey Care and Product Care capitalized on growth opportunities in targeted countries and end markets, which offset other areas challenged by economic uncertainties, political unrest and a weak industrial environment. Overall, I am pleased with our adjusted EBITDA results of $306 million or 17.7% of net sales, which includes about $7 million of reimbursement related to environmental expenses on a slight increase in organic net sales. 
Excluding this reimbursement, we had a very solid adjusted EBITDA margin performance of over 17% of sales. Product Care delivered over 21% margin; Food Care, over 20%; and for the first time, Diversey Care delivered 15% margin, excluding the environmental reimbursements. As we look to the second half and as previously communicated, we expect stronger performance, primarily driven by volume acceleration. 
In Food Care. The operation rate continues to penetrate the market in Europe, and we are in successful trials with 2 large retailers in North America. Diversey Care is enjoying new customer wins across its portfolio, and our robotics start-up, Intellibot, delivered record sales in May and June. In Product Care. Our new innovation pipeline and customer inflows are building as we prepare for a seasonally strong year-end. This momentum, coupled with an improved protein market and accelerated growth in e-commerce and fulfillment, gives us the confidence in our second half growth trajectory. 
For full year, our outlook is within the range of our previously provided guidance. Currency headwinds are not as high as we anticipated. But this benefit is being offset by our assumptions on rate and cost and the related impact on Food Care's formula pricing. Additionally, we anticipate the recent geopolitical events in Europe and the Middle East to have an impact on our business in the coming months. 
Overall, our strategy is clearly working. Our market differentiation of revolutionary innovation is gaining significant traction in each of our divisions. In Food Care, customer interest continues to increase for our next-generation target technology, Optidur. Diversey Care's disrupted and innovated technology, including the Internet of Things platform and digitally enabled solutions are increasing our sales opportunities in a meaningful way. In May, we received the top Innovation Award at the ISSA/INTERCLEAN trade show in Amsterdam. And Product Care has reshared its entire portfolio and go-to-market strategy with Dimensional Weight, Fulfillment Velocity and Consumer Experience solutions. 
I strongly encourage all of you to attend 2 upcoming trade shows: The ISSA/INTERCLEAN in late October, and PACK EXPO in early November, both of which are being held in Chicago. At PACK EXPO, Product Care will showcase more commercialized innovation that they ever had in the history of Sealed Air. 
So with that said, let me now pass on the call to Carol and Ilham to get into more details by division and our outlook, and then we will answer any questions that you may have. Carol?"

Let me start with EMEA, where we had 2.5% organic growth and positive sales across our 3 divisions. Food Care sales increased 3%, Diversey Care increased 1% and Product Care increased 5%. On a by-country basis, EMEA was led by double-digit growth in Russia and high single-digit growth in Spain and Holland. We also experienced positive sales in Germany and Sweden. 
Asia Pacific was up 1% in constant dollars. India was up 12% led by double-digit growth in Diversey Care and Product Care. In China, Diversey Care delivered high single-digit growth, and Product Care's business returned to growth in the quarter. Our largest markets in Asia Pacific are Australia and New Zealand, and combined, they account for 6% of our total net sales and just over 10% of Food Care sales. 
In Food Care, sales in Australia and New Zealand were essentially flat compared to last year. In Australia, adoption of our advanced product portfolio and new customer wins are helping to offset the double-digit declines in slaughter rate and the export of live animals. In New Zealand, our business continues to be impacted by the ongoing weakness in the global dairy market. 
Latin America was hit the hardest by currency devaluations and socio and political instability. On a reported basis, Latin America was down 11%, which translates into constant dollar growth of 8%. Despite the current environment in Latin America, Food Care experienced positive sales growth in Brazil and Mexico on an as-reported basis. This translates into nearly 20% growth in both countries on a constant dollar basis. Brazil and Mexico each accounted for approximately 4% of Food Care sales. 
Let's move to Slide 6 and look at trends in North America. Overall, North America sales were down 2% on an organic basis due to unfavorable price/mix of 3%, partially offset by 1% volume growth. Food Care delivered healthy volume growth of 3%. This was more than offset by unfavorable formula pass-throughs. Diversey Care's North America business returned to growth in the second quarter with positive price/mix and volume trends. Product Care's volume and product mix were negatively impacted by the ongoing weakness in the industrial market, particularly in manufacturing and electronics. Volume was also impacted by our rationalization efforts. Excluding rationalization, volume would have been positive in the quarter. 
Turning to Slide 7. Let me walk you through our net sales and adjusted EBITDA performance on a year-over-year basis. Starting with the net sales, you can see that we delivered $1.7 billion. Volume contributed $9 million to top line growth, and favorable price/mix contributed $7 million. Unfavorable currency translation was $59 million, and the impact from divestitures was $15 million. 
On Slide 8, you can see that our adjusted EBITDA was $306 million or 17.7% of net sales. Mix and price cost spread was $9 million favorable, and positive volume contributed $4 million. We had $9 million in restructuring savings. Operating expenses of $12 million is net of the $7 million environmental reimbursement Jerome mentioned in his comments earlier. Salary and wage inflation of $17 million, currency was negative $9 million and divestitures were $3 million.  Adjusted earnings per share was $0.65 in the second quarter. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 29%. For the full year, we continue to expect our tax rate to be approximately 24%. 
Let me now turn the call over to Ilham to go through our results by division. Ilham?"
382724,372945213,1016589,"Sealed Air Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Sealed Air Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Carol. Slide 9 highlights the results of our Diversey Care division. Diversey Care net sales on a constant dollar basis were at 2.4% in the second quarter.

Diversey Care net sales on a constant dollar basis were at 2.4% in the second quarter. We had positive sales growth in constant dollars in all regions. Asia Pacific was our fastest-growing region with 7% constant dollar sales growth. In North America and Europe, constant dollar sales were at 3% and 2.4%, respectively. 
If you look at our adjusted EBITDA, excluding the environmental reimbursement, we delivered $80 million or 15% of net sales. Volume, pricing and cost management all contributed to our strong EBITDA performance. It's worth noting that in the last 2.5 years, with the exception of 1 quarter, we delivered positive constant dollar sales and adjusted EBITDA growth every quarter. I am particularly proud of the performance in North America and Europe over this time period. Remember that when we reorganized this business back in 2013, both Europe and North America had many years of declining sales and deteriorating margins. Whereas Middle East, Africa and Latin America increased sales on a constant dollar basis this quarter, we are seeing a slowdown in our business due to political unrest in the Middle East and economic weakness in Argentina. Middle East, Africa and Latin America combined represents 15% of our sales. Looking ahead, we are confident the momentum in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific will continue. We are rolling out new customers and adding to our list of strategic wins across all sectors, including facility management, retail and health care sectors. 
Customer feedback on our Robotics and Internet of Things platforms have been extremely positive, and as a result, we're accelerating our go-to-market strategy. For the full year, we expect constant dollar adjusted EBITDA growth and margin expansion. The third quarter will experience a decline versus quarter 2 as we step up our implementation of new sites related to recent customer wins and the significant slowdown in hospitality in Middle East, Africa. We expect our fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA to be stronger given the timing of new customer rollouts and product and regional mix heading into year-end. 
Let's now turn to Slide 10 and review Food Care results. Food Care sales increased 1% on an organic basis, driven by a combination of higher volume and favorable price/mix. By region, Latin America was up 11%, and EMEA increased 3%. Asia Pacific was essentially unchanged, and North America declined 3%. Adjusted EBITDA was $163 million or 20.3% of net sales. Positive volume in North America and EMEA is largely a result of our case-ready platform, including Darfresh on Tray. Also our next-generation barrier technology, Optidur, is gaining traction with successful trials in North America, Asia Pacific and Europe. 
In Hygiene, we continue to improve both sales trends and profitability. We are also investing in new solutions, including our recent acquisition of Finland-based, TTS-Ciptec, a leading Clean-In-Place systems optimization company. This acquisition complements our expertise in remote monitoring and data analytics and enhances our knowledge-based service offering. 
In the second half of the year, Food Care organic sales growth is expected to accelerate, primarily driven by increasing sales volume in North America and Europe. Both regions will benefit from higher protein productions level as well as continued adoption of advanced products. We also believe our packaging business in Brazil is beginning to stabilize with 4% volume growth in the second quarter. These positive trends will be partially offset by declines in Australia and New Zealand and North America formula pricing. On the bottom line, we continue to expect sequential growth in absolute dollars in the third and fourth quarter, resulting in full year organic EBITDA growth and margin expansion. As Jerome noted, Food Care EBITDA will be negatively impacted by our assumption of raw material cost heading into year-end. 
Let's turn to Product Care results on Slide 11. Product Care's net sales in constant dollars were down 1.5% due to a 4% decline in North America, partially offset by mid-single-digit growth in EMEA. We continue to experience strong growth in e-commerce and fulfillment in the first half of the year on a global basis. In North America, this was more than offset by ongoing weakness in the industrial sector. Also keep in mind that we divested $15 million of annualized sales in North America in January and another $12 million of annualized sales in Europe in May. Excluding these divestitures, global volume trends would have been stronger and we would have delivered a slight uptick in North America. 
In the second half of the year, and more so in the fourth quarter than the third quarter, we expect our constant dollar growth rate to accelerate. Demand continues to increase for our inflatable bubble inflatable bubble, Korrvu, Fill-Air, B+ and FloWrap equipment platform. This level of demand is translating into strong double-digit growth in equipment sales and installments. For the full year 2016, top line growth coupled with our focus on pricing and cost discipline will drive constant dollar EBITDA growth and margin expansion. 
Now let me pass the call back to Carol to review our free cash flow and our outlook for 2016. Carol?"

Working capital and other assets and liabilities or a use of cash of $165 million. Operating working capital as a percent of net sales based on a 13-month average is relatively the same since year-end at 14.3%. As compared to June 30 last year, we improved 130 basis points. 
Now turning to outlook on Slide 13. Net sales are expected to be approximately $6.85 billion. The impact from the Food Care divestitures on 2016 net sales is $102 million, of which $82 million impacted the first half of the year. Currency is expected to have an unfavorable impact on sales of approximately $275 million. Our outlook for adjusted EBITDA is now at $1.17 billion to $1.18 billion. The impact from the Food Care divestitures on 2016 EBITDA is $21 million, of which $17 million impacted the first half of the year. Currency is expected to have an unfavorable impact on EBITDA of approximately $45 million. 
As Jerome mentioned earlier, we are expecting accelerated EBITDA growth in the second half of the year and anticipate that the fourth quarter will be our strongest quarter of the year. Strength in the fourth quarter will be driven by higher Food Care volumes, our customer rollout schedule in Diversey Care and seasonal strength in Product Care. Our medical and corporate expenses are expected to be a net expense of $90 million for the full year 2016. Our interest expense for 2016 is estimated at $225 million. Depreciation and amortization is forecast to be approximately $280 million. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be at the high end of our previously provided range of $2.52 to $2.60.  We are maintaining our free cash flow target of approximately $550 million. CapEx is expected to be $275 million, which includes approximately $125 million related to the investment we are making in our Charlotte campus and other capital restructuring activities. Excluding these items, maintenance and growth CapEx combined is estimated to be approximately $150 million.  
For the full year, we continue to expect working capital and other assets liabilities to be a source of cash of approximately $100 million. Cash restructuring payments are estimated to be $110 million, and we expect to realize restructuring savings of approximately $30 million. Cash interest payments are expected to be $220 million, and cash tax payments are estimated at $125 million. As we head into year end, we will focus on what we can control and look for opportunities that will help mitigate potential impact of the macro environment. We will continue investing to support our future growth opportunities. Our focus on execution and delivering profitable growth is embedded in our winning culture. 
Before I open the call to questions, I would like to remind you, our third quarter earnings call is tentatively scheduled for Thursday, October 27. We have invited Ken Chrisman, President of Product Care, to join Jerome and I on that call.

I told -- I've said from the very beginning that the first half was going to be really muted and that we were going to see business acceleration. What I was also -- what I also said was that this was going to grow mostly with volume. What I didn't think was going to happen to the -- was -- the assumptions that I have -- that we have put on rate and prices. And they have been lower than what we thought. That is having an impact on our formula pricing. You know how important they are. And we were thinking at the time that those formula pricing in Food Care in North America were mostly going to be in the first half and not in the second half. Well, because of what working prices are and we anticipate they're going to be, we are going to have negative formula pricing in the second half, and that's basically how we are seeing the situation today. Having said that, our global price/mix in Food Care and price/mix versus cost price will be positive for the full year, but not as positive as we had originally forecasted. So that's basically the slight difference. This is impacting sales growth because of the net sales as a result of the lower rate in prices. But what we're doing here is that we're narrowing the range that we're having, and that's mostly what we're doing here. And keep in mind that pricing dropped straight to the bottom line. So that's great. The important thing to remember here is the volume trend. And the volume trend is really as per what we were expecting. And why are we seeing good volume trend? It is very clearly the impact of our innovation is kicking in."

George, with the EPS, one of the changes is the slight decrease in depreciation and amortization of about $5 million. Also our share count as we're exiting Q2, we're at approximately 197 million shares outstanding. We're seeing benefit from share repurchases going into the weighted average calculation from the first quarter, where we spent about $32 million to buy almost 700,000 shares back in Q2. We spent approximately $20 million buying an additional 435,000 shares back. So year-to-date, we're 1.13 million shares with a spend of $52 million. I'll remind everyone, we still have $832 million available under our July 2015 board authorization. And managing within our targeted leverage range of 3.5x to 4x, we would expect to return value to shareholders as we consistently messaged as we move forward throughout the year, again maintaining within our leverage."

It takes time to ramp all of this and then to have the full adoption, et cetera, because of all of these recurrent investments. But what I would say, if you just go back to our Investor Day of exactly a year ago, it's all happening and better. When you look at Product Care, and I would let then Ilham comment on Diversey Care, we -- you absolutely need to come to PACK EXPO this autumn, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks. You will see Sealed Air as the booth with the highest innovations, and that is what is driving our growth. Our e-commerce business is growing extremely well. What is the issue in Product Care? It's one and simple. It's that the industrial GDP is not good. Well, if you look at the CAT index, which is the truck and rail freight index, it is at the lowest since 2010 right now. So you can't pretend the economy, the industrial economy is doing really well because it doesn't. But when you look at e-commerce and when you look at how we are doing in that environment, actually, we clearly are partnering with our customers' fulfillment companies' 3PLs to join them in the growth they're expecting and in the growth plans. We have multiplied by 2.5 the installs of our small equipment in North America. We have done the same, but we have increased by 15%, the installs of our small equipment in EMEA and almost 30% in Asia. So this tells you that the consumer boosts are going to come during the year.

Europe was extremely strong, showing continuum momentum since we started on forming this business back in 2013. This was not built to raise above markets in South Europe, in Germany. We are winning new customers, like in the U.K., where we are rolling out, and will start kicking in by the end of the year. In North America. North America returned growth, as we told you, in quarter 2, thanks to our health care business doing extremely great, with our unique sustainable technologies there, as well as we are rolling out some large customers in facility management. We are rolling out as we speak, and we have implemented. And kudos to the team, half of the 50,000 sites in the report timing, and we are tracking ahead of time. And last but the least, in APAC, we had a good momentum there as well. We are growing the book, the industries we serve, with 4% out of the 16 Diversey Care coming from volume at [indiscernible] level, as we told you. China is growing high-single digits, and India, mid-double-digit, just to highlight few leading and strategic economies for our filled air economy."

Somewhat down in the Middle East. In Egypt, the capacity -- hotel capacity utilization is at 55%, and it's at 50% in Turkey. So you just can't dream of a perfect world because it is not. That is going to – so 2 things are going to impact the newbuild Diversey Care in the third quarter and be favorable in the fourth. One is what I've just talked about. In the first quarter, remember that tourism is, right now, it's big season right now. And the second one is that because of our customer wins, we have a lot, a lot, a lot of installs. And that requires resources, which are being deployed exactly now, and we're going to benefit from those sometime next year. And generally speaking, overall on the net sales growth, it is the pricing and the formula pricing of resin, which is impacting the dollar sales growth. But definitely not the momentum."

With regards to the resin, there you have -- actually, that's what I've said before. Entering the year, I said in the February call that we were seeing the resins being weak and staying weak for a year. And they haven't been that weak because you have had these price increases in March, and you have had these price increases in April. And whereas one could anticipate that they wouldn't hold for a long time, so far, so good for the producers. They have helped quite a lot. So therefore, this has had -- have had, and will have in the second half, a negative impact, which is, in fact, eliminating the positive impact from lower -- from better currency movements that we were anticipating. So we're going to have a negative formula pricing there. And we -- and I just don't know what to tell you because I didn't think that resin prices would be where they are, and I wouldn't have said they would be, at the beginning of the year, where they are right now. So yes, capacity results is going to come in next year and so on and the whole thing will very much depend on the hurricane. We're entering the hurricane season. So some people are wishing for lots of hurricane, and some of it for nothing, et cetera. So it's very difficult to predict one. If you have 1 or 2 hurricanes hitting Texas, I tell you, this is going to change the game."

So to your question, yes, we believe that this is basically over in terms of product rationalization there. We have, then you're going to look at Brexit. And the Brexit is having an impact on our translation costs. We have a strong business in Product Care, in Food Care also, in Diversey Care also, in the U.K. So what we have been clearly doing here is that we have announced for a 6% to 8% price increase effective September 1 later, sometimes earlier, in order to capture the transaction costs that we're suffering in -- from the U.K. pound. And that is, what I would say, embedded in our culture now. We just don't take those kind of things and absorb it because we're not in that business. So we have communicated that to our customers.

And what you're seeing is that it's going to be slightly less than 3%. And that is not because of volume. It is because of resin prices and a little bit of weakness in the sectors on hospitality that I've just talked about. But those kinds of things and situations are happening every single day. Every single day, we have positives and we have negatives. So if resin prices have -- would have gone up another 10%, you would have seen our sales growth go up more than what I would have said at the beginning of the year, and 3.5%. And there is a lag on those kind of things because of the pricing. So the real question to see -- to say is that -- so you were saying 3.5%. You're saying slightly less than 3%. Is there a problem? Well, no. It's basically when you have a raw material, which is a part of your cost base, and when you have formulas which, in time, correct for your overall pricing without impacting your margin, you have -- you book slightly less dollar sales. If we have resin prices going up or doubling in the next 5 years, what you're going to see are proportional improvements, which was not necessarily the case under a few years ago, but you're going to see a proportional increase in our top-level sales. So that's what separates what is an external environment which impacts potentially your net sale but not your margins with internal issues. Let me confirm to you point-blank very clearly, we are ahead of everything we said we would be doing in our Investor Day. Our innovation is kicking in better.

It sounds now like maybe, Jerome, what you're saying that while you're still on track to get volume growth to the back half of the year to make up that piece, the revenue growth may not be there because some of the mechanisms are lower in price. Is there something perhaps different in the competitive landscape today that's not enabling you to -- or that's cutting price perhaps more than just what the formulas are moving, that's impeding your ability to kind of work on the net price side?

Thank you, and good morning everyone. We have definitely a lot to cover on our call today, and in addition to a review of our third quarter results and outlook, we will be discussing the announcement that we made on October 17 to pursue a",1082,"Thank you, Lori. Thank you, and good morning everyone. We have definitely a lot to cover on our call today, and in addition to a review of our third quarter results and outlook, we will be discussing the announcement that we made on October 17 to pursue a tax-free spin-off of Diversey Care and our related hygiene business. 
As planned, we have Ken Chrisman, President of our Product Care division, joining Carol for our third quarter discussion. And I also invited Dr. Ilham Kadri, President of Diversey Care; and Karl Deily, President of Food Care, to join us during this important Q&A session. 
So let me get started. In the third quarter, we reported $304 [ph] million of adjusted EBITDA on sales of $1.7 billion. Our margin and free cash flow performance in the quarter is a testament to our strong operation and discipline and working capital management despite soft organic sales growth of 1%. We are pleased to report adjusted EBITDA margins of 17.7%, a 50 basis points improvement over last year, and we generated $212 million of free cash flow during Q3 as compared with $191 million [ph] for the same quarter last year. I will provide a few comments and leave the details to Carol and Ken. 
Our price/mix discipline came through in the quarter, with all regions delivering favorable trends except North America, primarily due to timing of raw materials cost plateau [ph] in Food Care. 
Let me highlight volume growth, which was largely driven by our execution of our Change the Game strategy. 
Product Care volumes in North America were up 7% if you exclude the 100 basis points of rationalization. Diversey Care delivered positive volume in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific as a result of customer win; and Food Care protein packaging volumes were led by more than 5% growth in North America and positive trends in the EMEA region. These positive volume trends are very important to us, as they are strong indications of what's to come into year-end and in 2017. 
Unfortunately, our business suffered from some softness in Latin America, Mid East and Australia and continued weakness in the general industrial GDP. You can see [ph] that we have and will continue to take corrective actions to preserve [indiscernible] and commit to our free cash flow in 2017. Such agility is now in our DNA. With that said, let me turn back to our decision to pursue a tax-free spin of Diversey. 
By separating our Food Care, Product Care and medical business from our Diversey Care and related hygiene business, we create 2 pure-play, industry-leading companies with strong financial profile, each with its own unique and compelling investment opportunities. We believe that this is the appropriate next step in our company's transformation and will accelerate profitable growth for both entities. 
Before I get into the rationale, I will quickly highlight the structure of the transaction on Slide 5. Following completion of the tax-free spin, Sealed Air shareholders will own 100% of the common stock of what I would call new Diversey. Both new Sealed Air and new Diversey will be well capitalized with disciplined, return-based approaches to capital allocation. We anticipate a similar credit rating to existing Sealed Air at both companies. 
The transaction is expected to be completed in the second half of 2017, and we anticipate timing of the Form 10 as early as the first quarter of 2017, which will provide you with independent stand-alone financials for new Diversey. 
So now let's turn into Slide 6, where we highlight the strategic rationale for the separation. This separation will give both entities the ability to tailor their strategic objectives and capitalize on global growth opportunities, both at the core of their businesses and with respect to innovative and disruptive technology. New Sealed Air and new Diversey will have leaner and more streamlined operations and will become even more entrepreneurial. 
I want to spend a few minutes highlighting both new Sealed Air and new Diversey. 
First, new Sealed Air on Slide 7. Many of you have heard me say this before, but I will say it again. We believe that our Food Care and Product Care divisions are, by far, the most innovative leaders in their respective industries with unmatched global scale and reach. In short, we are market makers. Over the last 3-plus years, we extended this leadership globally with new innovative product offerings and consultative services. Adjusted EBITDA for our Food Care division, excluding the hygiene business and our Product Care division, has reported a 3-year compounded annual growth rate of approximately 11% in constant dollars. 
To give you a sense of the size and the margin profile on an as-reported basis, the adjusted EBITDA margin for new Sealed Air reported approximately 20% adjusted EBITDA margins in the last 12 months ended September 30, 2016. New Sealed Air will continue to generate strong free cash flow, which will support future growth initiatives and value-added M&A and consistently return value to shareholders. 
Let me turn to Slide 8 on new Diversey. Under the Sealed Air umbrella, both Diversey Care and our hygiene business streamlined their organizations, revamped their product portfolio and go-to-market strategy, reenergized energy with a renewed focus on disruptive solutions and embraced a truly entrepreneurial culture, which made them be the most innovative player in the industry, all of which have contributed to consistent top line growth, what will make the new Diversey and has generated a 3-year compounded annual growth rate of approximately 15% in adjusted EBITDA ona constant dollar basis. 
Our innovative platforms, including the Internet of Things, Intellibot Robotics, Clean-in-Place solutions, biodegradable chemistry, dry lube and others, are enabling us to win new customers around the world. 
And in a separate announcement, you saw that our branded licensing agreement with SCJ will expire in May 2017. We have already started working on developing new partnerships, as announced yesterday morning, with Spectrum and Nakoma. We will also look for opportunities to expand existing relationships and grow our own brand into new channels. 
Given the low capital requirements and free cash flow generation, new Diversey will have the flexibility to invest in growth and return value to shareholders. In short, you have instilled [ph] there what a renowned industry analyst once called ""the ATM you want to own."" Now you will have 2 ATM machines. With that, let me now turn the call to Carol for a look at the financial results for the third quarter. Carol?"

The 2 regions that delivered constant dollar sales growth were North America and Latin America. Growth in North America was driven by an increase of approximately 4% in volume, with positive trends across our 3 divisions. In Latin America, constant dollar growth was a result of our pricing efforts to offset currency devaluations. In EMEA, positive trends in Food Care were offset by declines in Diversey Care and Product Care. Performance in Asia Pacific was primarily impacted by a 14% decline in Australia. The Australian beef market is significantly depressed, with slaughter rates at their lowest level in 20 years. Australia accounts for approximately 6% of Food Care's net sales. 
Turning to Slide 10. We highlight volume and price/mix trends by division and by region. We have already highlighted key volume trend, so I will focus my comments on price/mix. You can see from this slide that, with the exception of North America, we have had positive price/mix in all regions for 3 consecutive quarters. Food Care's price/mix was positive on a global basis despite North America being negatively impacted by the timing of raw material pass-through. Diversey Care delivered favorable price/mix across all regions, which has been consistent throughout the year. In Product Care, strong e-commerce volumes are currently having a negative impact on mix. 
Turning to Slide 11. Let me walk you through our net sales performance on a year-over-year basis. We delivered $1.7 billion in sales on essentially flat volume. Price/mix contributed $15 million to top line growth and favorable currency translation was $31 million, and the impact from divestitures was $15 million. 
Now turning to Slide 12. We present our adjusted EBITDA bridge. I would like to note that our adjusted gross margin improved 90 basis points from 36.4% in Q3 2015 to 37.3% in Q3 2016. Our adjusted EBITDA was $304 million or 17.7% of net sales. Mix and price/cost spread was $22 million favorable, and we realized $10 million in restructuring savings. 
Operating expenses had an impact of $21 million, of which salary and wage inflation was $17 million. Currency was a negative $4 million and divestitures were $3 million. 
Adjusted earnings per share was $0.71 in the third quarter. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 23%. For the full year, we continue to expect our tax rate to be approximately 24%. We repurchased 3.5 million shares for approximately $165 million and exited the third quarter with 194 million shares outstanding. 
Let me now turn the call over to Ken to go through our results by division."
382724,403874719,1063257,"Sealed Air Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Sealed Air Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Carol.

Product Care net sales on a constant dollar basis were unchanged on a year-over-year basis. Rationalization efforts in North America and Europe had a negative impact on constant dollar sales of approximately 200 basis points. We reported a record level of EBITDA margin of nearly 23%, an increase of 160 basis points, which is notable given the raw material environment and a soft industrial sector. 
As you heard from both Jerome and Carol, our third quarter sales performance was due to strength in e-commerce and fulfillment. We delivered nearly 4% sales growth in North America, adjusted for rationalization. North America accounts for approximately 60% of Product Care's total sales. Volume accelerated throughout the quarter, and we continue to see good growth in October. Our thought leadership in providing solutions to e-commerce and fulfillment sectors is resulting in accelerated adoption of our more profitable, differentiated innovations, including inflatable bubble, Korrvu and B+ Equipment, complemented by record levels of equipment installations. We are also seeing expanded adoption of our protective mailers as customers respond to dimensional [ph] weight pricing challenges. 
Heading into year-end, we expect growth in e-commerce and fulfillment to accelerate and drive top and bottom line performance. Our robust equipment installations, fueled by our new offerings, gives us confidence in achieving accelerated growth. While we are not seeing much of a rebound from the industrial sector, our customers in this sector are expressing increased interest in our new offerings as they address the impact of dimensional weight pricing. 
Let's turn now to Slide 14 and review Food Care results. Favorable price/mix, positive volume trends in North America and Europe and disciplined cost management were key contributors to sales and EBITDA performance in the third quarter. On an organic basis, adjusted EBITDA increased 7% on 1% sales growth. EBITDA margins increased 110 basis points to just over 21%. Production of all proteins in North America and Europe were up in the third quarter. 
On one hand, our business is reaping the benefit of higher beef volumes and continued global adoption of our new products. On the other hand, these positive trends are being offset by the challenging business environments in Asia Pacific, particularly in Australia, as Carol mentioned, and Latin America, which took a turn for the worse in September after trends appeared to be stabilizing. 
In the fourth quarter, we expect sequential improvement in sales and adjusted EBITDA, with accelerating volume trends in North America and Europe offsetting continued weakness in Australia and Latin America. 
Let's turn to Diversey Care results on Slide 15. Diversey Care net sales were up 1.5% in constant dollars, and adjusted EBITDA margins were 13%. Growth in the quarter was driven by new customer rollouts in North America and Europe and positive trends in Asia Pacific. We were pleased to see North America deliver growth in light of a tough comparable. In Western Europe, most of our largest countries experienced positive constant dollar sales growth; and in Asia Pacific, growth was led by strength in China and India. These positive trends were partially offset by declines in the Middle East. As we anticipated, the hospitality sector, particularly in Turkey, continues to struggle as a result of significant decline in tourism and occupancy rates. 
For the fourth quarter, we expect the positive trend in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific to continue and more than offset challenges in Latin America and Middle East. Customer rollouts are on schedule, and our list of strategic wins across all sectors continues to grow. 
Now let me pass the call back to Carol to review our free cash flow and our outlook for 2016. Carol?"

CapEx during the same period last year was $112 million. 
Now turning to our outlook on Slide 17. Net sales are expected to be approximately $6.8 billion. The impact from the Food Care divestitures on 2016 net sales is $102 million. Currency is expected to have an unfavorable impact on sales of approximately $225 million. 
Our outlook for adjusted EBITDA is now at $1.17 billion. Impact from the Food Care divestitures on 2016 EBITDA is $21 million. Currency is expected to have an unfavorable impact on EBITDA of approximately $35 million. 
We continue to anticipate that the fourth quarter will be our strongest quarter of the year with organic sales growth of approximately 3%. As Jerome and Ken highlighted, our growth in the fourth quarter will be primarily driven by accelerated volume in both Food Care and Product Care. 
Our medical and corporate expenses are expected to be a net expense of $90 million for the full year 2016. Our interest expense for 2016 is estimated at $218 million. Depreciation and amortization is forecast to be approximately $275 million. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be approximately $2.60. 
We are maintaining our free cash flow target of approximately $550 million. CapEx is expected to be $275 million, which includes approximately $125 million related to the investment we are making in our Charlotte campus and other capital restructuring activities. Excluding these items, maintenance and growth CapEx combined is estimated at $150 million. 
For the full year, we expect working capital and other current assets and liabilities to be a source of cash of approximately $80 million. Cash restructuring payments are estimated at $90 million, and we expect to realize restructuring savings of approximately $40 million.

So this is Karl, and so let's -- I'll start with your second question first, if that's okay. And we have had synergies with the hygiene business. However, the natural fit is to keep the hygiene business with the Diversey Care business due to the synergies of supply chain and a number of other things. And obviously, our ability to partner going forward will still be there, but they are 2 different businesses with 2 different sales processes and sales cycles, and we feel it's the most prudent thing to do to include them in the spin. Now in your first question, I wish I could answer Latin America. We thought that Brazil had bottomed out and Argentina was going along relatively well, and they both took a turn for the worse at the end of the quarter, which had an impact. We still have very good positive growth going in the northern [ph] cone of Latin America. So we obviously are keeping our pulse on the market and our key customers and having very good introduction of new products and value-added products in Latin America. So as soon as the market does start to turn positive, we expect to get an accelerated growth. But we just have to stay close to that market because it is volatile."

I have been a bit disappointed with my, with our 1% growth in Q3. But this is a fair -- this is 2 different stories. At that time, I did not anticipate the severity of the Australian reduction in the beef market. At that time, I was coming -- at that time being in July, [indiscernible] the second quarter results, we were coming from a strong Latin American and Brazilian recovery on the beef markets because it was volume was -- growth was there, et cetera and it didn't continue. It has been just a little positive blip. And ask ourselves, by the way, on Food Care, Northern LatAm is very much strong and Southern LatAm is bad. At that time, I was fearing that we would be hurt, as Ilham had clearly said, it was -- that we were going to be impacted by the instability of the Middle East and by the hospitality business in markets like France, and Germany and we have been a little bit more. Having said that, and to come to your question, it is -- I am very pleased with what we are seeing in some very key markets where we are executing on change against strategy. North American Food Care has had a 3.5% volume growth in the third quarter. North American Product Care has had, which is a very key market for us, very big for us in Product Care, has had a 7% volume growth when you exclude the 100 basis points from the divestitures or from the portfolio rationalization. And Diversey Care has a very tough comparable in the third [ph] quarter and yet it has been positive. That tells me that I -- that we should be confident on Q4 and I am confident on Q4, and what is going to be really the barometer for me, is going to be how we are going to grow volume in Q4 and in each of those 3 divisions. And I can assure you that we are projecting volume growth in Q4 in each of those divisions and solid volume growth, and that definitely, in our minds, is showing the cut off between the trends in 2015 and '16 into '17."

And when you look at the gross profit of Sealed Air, you have seen it in the third quarter, we have increased our gross profits by about 70 basis points, which just shows that we're very focused on those kind of things, and it is as valid, the same thing for the Food Care division."

And we create value to the meat processors, we create value to the food retailers by reducing food waste, meat waste, et cetera, et cetera. So we're just not pricing based on our cost. So this concept does, that the price goes up when resin prices goes up. And when the price goes down when resin prices goes down, is not the right concept. With some customers, we do have formula and we apply those formula. But I think it's very important to see that we, like any company, we do have a commodity business, and we make sure we are competitive in the commodity business.

So when you really think about it, the synergies are low. So from then on, you've got to go and wonder whether -- you go and wonder whether there are things which -- what is the best solution? The best solution, for us, was to really look at how we can improve this business. And as I said, the old Diversey is a same shadow of what it is now. We now have a winning company in the marketplace. We have value-added solution for our customers and when we switch a customer to us, it is because they see the differential advantage of our solution, and this is why. So it's not so much a question of if it would be a question of when, and the reason we decided to do with now is because no kidding, under the leadership of Dr. Kadri, this new Diversey is going to fly very nicely under -- by its own wing. If there's 1 thing that's been a positive is the creation of a 1 culture, and this is why we have a leverage all of those kinds of things.

Thank you, and good morning everyone. We have definitely a lot to cover on our call today, and in addition to a review of our third quarter results and outlook, we will be discussing the announcement that we made on October 17 to pursue a tax-free spin-off of Diversey Care and our related hygiene business. 
As planned, we have Ken Chrisman, President of our Product Care division, joining Carol for our third quarter discussion. And I also invited Dr. Ilham Kadri, President of Diversey Care; and Karl Deily, President of Food Care, to join us during this important Q&A session. 
So let me get started. In the third quarter, we reported $304 million of adjusted EBITDA on sales of $1.7 billion. Our margin and free cash flow performance in the quarter is a testament to our strong operation and discipline and working capital management despite soft organic sales growth of 1%. We are pleased to report adjusted EBITDA margins of 17.7%, a 50 basis points improvement over last year, and we generated $212 million of free cash flow during Q3 as compared with $191 million for the same quarter last year. I will provide a few comments and leave the details to Carol and Ken. 
Our price/mix discipline came through in the quarter, with all regions delivering favorable trends except North America, primarily due to timing of raw materials cost pass-through in Food Care. 
Let me highlight volume growth, which was largely driven by our execution of our Change the Game strategy. 
Product Care volumes in North America were up 7% if you exclude the 100 basis points of rationalization. Diversey Care delivered positive volume in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific as a result of customer win; and Food Care protein packaging volumes were led by more than 5% growth in North America and positive trends in the EMEA region. These positive volume trends are very important to us, as they are strong indications of what's to come into year-end and in 2017. 
Unfortunately, our business suffered from some softness in Latin America, Mid East and Australia and continued weakness in the general industrial GDP. You can see that we have and will continue to take corrective actions to preserve our bottom line guidance and commit to our free cash flow in 2017. Such agility is now in our DNA. With that said, let me turn back to our decision to pursue a tax-free spin of Diversey. 
By separating our Food Care, Product Care and medical business from our Diversey Care and related hygiene business, we create 2 pure-play, industry-leading companies with strong financial profile, each with its own unique and compelling investment opportunities. We believe that this is the appropriate next step in our company's transformation and will accelerate profitable growth for both entities. 
Before I get into the rationale, I will quickly highlight the structure of the transaction on Slide 5. Following completion of the tax-free spin, Sealed Air shareholders will own 100% of the common stock of what I would call New Diversey. Both New Sealed Air and New Diversey will be well capitalized with disciplined, return-based approaches to capital allocation. We anticipate a similar credit rating to existing Sealed Air at both companies. 
The transaction is expected to be completed in the second half of 2017, and we anticipate timing of the Form 10 as early as the first quarter of 2017, which will provide you with independent stand-alone financials for New Diversey. 
So now let's turn into Slide 6, where we highlight the strategic rationale for the separation. This separation will give both entities the ability to tailor their strategic objectives and capitalize on global growth opportunities, both at the core of their businesses and with respect to innovative and disruptive technology. New Sealed Air and New Diversey will have leaner and more streamlined operations and will become even more entrepreneurial. 
I want to spend a few minutes highlighting both New Sealed Air and New Diversey. 
First, New Sealed Air on Slide 7. Many of you have heard me say this before, but I will say it again. We believe that our Food Care and Product Care divisions are, by far, the most innovative leaders in their respective industries with unmatched global scale and reach. In short, we are market makers. Over the last 3-plus years, we extended this leadership globally with new innovative product offerings and consultative services. Adjusted EBITDA for our Food Care division, excluding the hygiene business and our Product Care division, has reported a 3-year compounded annual growth rate of approximately 11% in constant dollars. 
To give you a sense of the size and the margin profile on an as-reported basis, the adjusted EBITDA margin for New Sealed Air reported approximately 20% adjusted EBITDA margins in the last 12 months ended September 30, 2016. New Sealed Air will continue to generate strong free cash flow, which will support future growth initiatives and value-added M&A and consistently return value to shareholders. 
Let me turn to Slide 8 on New Diversey. Under the Sealed Air umbrella, both Diversey Care and our hygiene business streamlined their organizations, revamped their product portfolio and go-to-market strategy, reenergized energy with a renewed focus on disruptive solutions and embraced a truly entrepreneurial culture, which made them be the most innovative player in the industry, all of which have contributed to consistent top line growth, what will make the New Diversey and has generated a 3-year compounded annual growth rate of approximately 15% in adjusted EBITDA on a constant dollar basis. 
Our innovative platforms, including the Internet of Things, Intellibot Robotics, Clean-in-Place solutions, biodegradable chemistry, dry lube and others, are enabling us to win new customers around the world. 
And in a separate announcement, you saw that our branded licensing agreement with SCJ will expire in May 2017. We have already started working on developing new partnerships, as announced yesterday morning, with Spectrum and Nakoma. We will also look for opportunities to expand existing relationships and grow our own brand into new channels. 
Given the low capital requirements and free cash flow generation, New Diversey will have the flexibility to invest in growth and return value to shareholders. In short, you have instilled [ph] there what a renowned industry analyst once called ""the ATM you want to own."" Now you will have 2 ATM machines. With that, let me now turn the call to Carol for a look at the financial results for the third quarter. Carol?"

The 2 regions that delivered constant dollar sales growth were North America and Latin America. Growth in North America was driven by an increase of approximately 4% in volume, with positive trends across our 3 divisions. In Latin America, constant dollar growth was a result of our pricing efforts to offset currency devaluations. In EMEA, positive trends in Food Care were offset by declines in Diversey Care and Product Care. Performance in Asia Pacific was primarily impacted by a 14% decline in Australia. The Australian beef market is significantly depressed, with slaughter rates at their lowest level in 20 years. Australia accounts for approximately 6% of Food Care's net sales. 
Turning to Slide 10. We highlight volume and price/mix trends by division and by region. We have already highlighted key volume trend, so I will focus my comments on price/mix. You can see from this slide that, with the exception of North America, we have had positive price/mix in all regions for 3 consecutive quarters. Food Care's price/mix was positive on a global basis despite North America being negatively impacted by the timing of raw material pass-through. Diversey Care delivered favorable price/mix across all regions, which has been consistent throughout the year. In Product Care, strong e-commerce volumes are currently having a negative impact on mix. 
Turning to Slide 11. Let me walk you through our net sales performance on a year-over-year basis. We delivered $1.7 billion in sales on essentially flat volume. Price/mix contributed $15 million to top line growth and favorable currency translation was $31 million, and the impact from divestitures was $15 million. 
Now turning to Slide 12. We present our adjusted EBITDA bridge. I would like to note that our adjusted gross margin improved 90 basis points from 36.4% in Q3 2015 to 37.3% in Q3 2016. Our adjusted EBITDA was $304 million or 17.7% of net sales. Mix and price/cost spread was $22 million favorable, and we realized $10 million in restructuring savings. 
Operating expenses had an impact of $21 million, of which salary and wage inflation was $17 million. Currency was a negative $4 million and divestitures were $3 million. 
Adjusted earnings per share was $0.71 in the third quarter. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 23%. For the full year, we continue to expect our tax rate to be approximately 24%. We repurchased 3.5 million shares for approximately $165 million and exited the third quarter with 194 million shares outstanding. 
Let me now turn the call over to Ken to go through our results by division."
382724,403874719,1063513,"Sealed Air Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Sealed Air Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Carol.

Product Care net sales on a constant dollar basis were unchanged on a year-over-year basis. Rationalization efforts in North America and Europe had a negative impact on constant dollar sales of approximately 200 basis points. We reported a record level of EBITDA margin of nearly 23%, an increase of 160 basis points, which is notable given the raw material environment and a soft industrial sector. 
As you heard from both Jerome and Carol, our third quarter sales performance was due to strength in e-commerce and fulfillment. We delivered nearly 4% sales growth in North America, adjusted for rationalization. North America accounts for approximately 60% of Product Care's total sales. Volume accelerated throughout the quarter, and we continue to see good growth in October. Our thought leadership in providing solutions to e-commerce and fulfillment sectors is resulting in accelerated adoption of our more profitable, differentiated innovations, including inflatable bubble, Korrvu and B+ Equipment, complemented by record levels of equipment installations. We are also seeing expanded adoption of our protective mailers as customers respond to dimensional weight pricing challenges. 
Heading into year-end, we expect growth in e-commerce and fulfillment to accelerate and drive top and bottom line performance. Our robust equipment installations, fueled by our new offerings, gives us confidence in achieving accelerated growth. While we are not seeing much of a rebound from the industrial sector, our customers in this sector are expressing increased interest in our new offerings as they address the impact of dimensional weight pricing. 
Let's turn now to Slide 14 and review Food Care results. Favorable price/mix, positive volume trends in North America and Europe and disciplined cost management were key contributors to sales and EBITDA performance in the third quarter. On an organic basis, adjusted EBITDA increased 7% on 1% sales growth. EBITDA margins increased 110 basis points to just over 21%. Production of all proteins in North America and Europe were up in the third quarter. 
On one hand, our business is reaping the benefit of higher beef volumes and continued global adoption of our new products. On the other hand, these positive trends are being offset by the challenging business environments in Asia Pacific, particularly in Australia, as Carol mentioned, and Latin America, which took a turn for the worse in September after trends appeared to be stabilizing. 
In the fourth quarter, we expect sequential improvement in sales and adjusted EBITDA, with accelerating volume trends in North America and Europe offsetting continued weakness in Australia and Latin America. 
Let's turn to Diversey Care results on Slide 15. Diversey Care net sales were up 1.5% in constant dollars, and adjusted EBITDA margins were 13%. Growth in the quarter was driven by new customer rollouts in North America and Europe and positive trends in Asia Pacific. We were pleased to see North America deliver growth in light of a tough comparable. In Western Europe, most of our largest countries experienced positive constant dollar sales growth; and in Asia Pacific, growth was led by strength in China and India. These positive trends were partially offset by declines in the Middle East. As we anticipated, the hospitality sector, particularly in Turkey, continues to struggle as a result of significant decline in tourism and occupancy rates. 
For the fourth quarter, we expect the positive trend in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific to continue and more than offset challenges in Latin America and Middle East. Customer rollouts are on schedule, and our list of strategic wins across all sectors continues to grow. 
Now let me pass the call back to Carol to review our free cash flow and our outlook for 2016. Carol?"

CapEx increased to $190 million, which includes $71 million related to the investment we are making in our Charlotte campus and $23 million related to other CapEx restructuring activities. CapEx during the same period last year was $112 million. 
Now turning to our outlook on Slide 17. Net sales are expected to be approximately $6.8 billion. The impact from the Food Care divestitures on 2016 net sales is $102 million. Currency is expected to have an unfavorable impact on sales of approximately $225 million. 
Our outlook for adjusted EBITDA is now at $1.17 billion. Impact from the Food Care divestitures on 2016 EBITDA is $21 million. Currency is expected to have an unfavorable impact on EBITDA of approximately $35 million. 
We continue to anticipate that the fourth quarter will be our strongest quarter of the year with organic sales growth of approximately 3%. As Jerome and Ken highlighted, our growth in the fourth quarter will be primarily driven by accelerated volume in both Food Care and Product Care. 
Our medical and corporate expenses are expected to be a net expense of $90 million for the full year 2016. Our interest expense for 2016 is estimated at $218 million. Depreciation and amortization is forecast to be approximately $275 million. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be approximately $2.60. 
We are maintaining our free cash flow target of approximately $550 million. CapEx is expected to be $275 million, which includes approximately $125 million related to the investment we are making in our Charlotte campus and other capital restructuring activities. Excluding these items, maintenance and growth CapEx combined is estimated at $150 million. 
For the full year, we expect working capital and other current assets and liabilities to be a source of cash of approximately $80 million. Cash restructuring payments are estimated at $90 million, and we expect to realize restructuring savings of approximately $40 million. Cash interest payments are expected to be $210 million, and cash tax payments are estimated at $125 million. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. Before I open the call to questions, I would like to remind you, our Fourth Quarter Earnings Call is tentatively scheduled for Thursday, February 9.

And obviously, our ability to partner going forward will still be there, but they are 2 different businesses with 2 different sales processes and sales cycles, and we feel it's the most prudent thing to do to include them in the spin. Now in your first question, I wish I could answer Latin America. We thought that Brazil had bottomed out and Argentina was going along relatively well, and they both took a turn for the worse at the end of the quarter, which had an impact. We still have very good positive growth going in the northern cone of Latin America. So we obviously are keeping our pulse on the market and our key customers and having very good introduction of new products and value-added products in Latin America. So as soon as the market does start to turn positive, we expect to get an accelerated growth. But we just have to stay close to that market because it is volatile."

You have to realize that the old Diversey is a -- was a faint shadow of what it is now, and it really woke up a very traditional industry. We're not seeing this yet in sales growth. We're seeing sales growth, but it's nothing compared to what this is -- this New Diversey business is going to be over the years to come. Think about the Internet of Things, 100% biodegradable products, [indiscernible] products, robotics. By the way, at the ISSA this week, we're announcing a new alliance on robotics with Discovery Robotics, and that's going to even increase the pace of our differentiation with our potential competitors.

I have been a little bit disappointed with my -- with our 1% growth in Q3. But this is -- let's say, this is 2 different stories. At that time, I did not anticipate the severity of the Australian reduction in the beef market. At that time, I was coming -- at that time being in July, when I announced the second quarter results, we were coming from a strong Latin American and Brazilian recovery on the beef markets because it was volume was -- growth was there, et cetera, and it didn't continue. It has been just a little positive blip. And as Karl said, by the way, on Food Care, Northern LatAm is very much strong and Southern LatAm is bad. At that time, I was fearing that we would be hurt, as Ilham had clearly said, it was -- that we were going to be impacted by the instability of the Middle East and by the hospitality business in markets like France, Belgium and Germany, and we have been a little bit more. Having said that, I -- and to come to your question, it is -- I am very pleased with what we are seeing in some very key markets where we are executing on Change the Game strategy. North American Food Care has had a 3.5% volume growth in the third quarter. North American Product Care has had -- which is a very key market for us, very big for us in Product Care, has had a 7% volume growth when you exclude the 100 basis points from the divestitures or from the portfolio rationalization. And Diversey Care had a very tough comparable in the third quarter and yet has been positive. That tells me that I -- that we should be confident on Q4, and I am confident on Q4, and what is going to be really the barometer for me is going to be, how are we going to grow volume in Q4 and in each of those 3 divisions? And I can assure you that we are projecting volume growth in Q4 in each of those divisions and solid volume growth. And that definitely, in our minds, is showing the cutoff between the trends in 2015 and '16 into '17."

If we look at restructuring payments, we had originally said cash payments for restructuring would be approximately $100 million, excluding CapEx restructuring.

It is what I really believe it can deliver. So you heard 2 things. You heard me say for a long time, and Dr. Kadri said also, that we are on our way, and we have been improving double digits the EBITDA of the Diversey Care business, by about 12% per year in the last 3 years, all right, on a constant currency basis. What you've heard me also say a few minutes ago in my prepared remarks, is that when you take the New Diversey, which it includes in the hygiene business. Over the last 3 years, we had a 15% compounded annual growth rate in EBITDA, and this is the result of innovation, of rationalization, of new way, go-to-market, et cetera, et cetera. The separation of Diversey has got nothing to do with any disappointments of the situation. I'm actually bullish about the prospect of that. So the 15% target by 2018 is still here, strong and standing. And when you'll compare 2016 with 2015, you'll continue to see the progress, and while it -- and compare it again with 2014, we're seeing that on and on, and very solid."

So we're very, very focused on those things."

Thank you, and good morning everyone. We have definitely a lot to cover on our call today, and in addition to a review of our third quarter results and outlook, we will be discussing the announcement that we made on October 17 to pursue a tax-free spin-off of Diversey Care and our related hygiene business. 
As planned, we have Ken Chrisman, President of our Product Care division, joining Carol for our third quarter discussion. And I also invited Dr. Ilham Kadri, President of Diversey Care; and Karl Deily, President of Food Care, to join us during this important Q&A session. 
So let me get started. In the third quarter, we reported $304 million of adjusted EBITDA on sales of $1.7 billion. Our margin and free cash flow performance in the quarter is a testament to our strong operation and discipline and working capital management despite soft organic sales growth of 1%. We are pleased to report adjusted EBITDA margins of 17.7%, a 50 basis points improvement over last year, and we generated $212 million of free cash flow during Q3 as compared with $191 million for the same quarter last year. I will provide a few comments and leave the details to Carol and Ken. 
Our price/mix discipline came through in the quarter, with all regions delivering favorable trends except North America, primarily due to timing of raw materials cost pass-through in Food Care. 
Let me highlight volume growth, which was largely driven by our execution of our Change the Game strategy. 
Product Care volumes in North America were up 7% if you exclude the 100 basis points of rationalization. Diversey Care delivered positive volume in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific as a result of customer wins; and Food Care protein packaging volumes were led by more than 5% growth in North America and positive trends in the EMEA region. These positive volume trends are very important to us, as they are strong indications of what's to come into year-end and in 2017. 
Unfortunately, our business suffered from some softness in Latin America, Mid-East and Australia and continued weakness in the general industrial GDP. You can see that we have and will continue to take corrective actions to preserve our bottom line guidance and commit to our free cash flow in 2017. Such agility is now in our DNA. With that said, let me turn back to our decision to pursue a tax-free spin of Diversey. 
By separating our Food Care, Product Care and Medical business from our Diversey Care and related hygiene business, we create 2 pure-play, industry-leading companies with strong financial profiles, each with its own unique and compelling investment opportunities. We believe that this is the appropriate next step in our company's transformation and will accelerate profitable growth for both entities. 
Before I get into the rationale, I will quickly highlight the structure of the transaction on Slide 5. Following completion of the tax-free spin, Sealed Air shareholders will own 100% of the common stock of what I would call New Diversey. Both New Sealed Air and New Diversey will be well capitalized with disciplined, returns-based approaches to capital allocation. We anticipate a similar credit rating to existing Sealed Air at both companies. 
The transaction is expected to be completed in the second half of 2017, and we anticipate timing of the Form 10 as early as the first quarter of 2017, which will provide you with independent stand-alone financials for New Diversey. 
So now let's turn into Slide 6, where we highlight the strategic rationale for the separation. This separation will give both entities the ability to tailor their strategic objectives and capitalize on global growth opportunities, both at the core of their businesses and with respect to innovative and disruptive technology. New Sealed Air and New Diversey will have leaner and more streamlined operations and will become even more entrepreneurial. 
I want to spend a few minutes highlighting both New Sealed Air and New Diversey. 
First, New Sealed Air on Slide 7. Many of you have heard me say this before, but I will say it again. We believe that our Food Care and Product Care divisions are, by far, the most innovative leaders in their respective industries with unmatched global scale and reach. In short, we are market makers. Over the last 3-plus years, we extended this leadership globally with new innovative product offerings and consultative services. Adjusted EBITDA for our Food Care division, excluding the hygiene business and our Product Care division, has reported a 3-year compounded annual growth rate of approximately 11% in constant dollars. 
To give you a sense of the size and the margin profile on an as-reported basis, the adjusted EBITDA margin for New Sealed Air reported approximately 20% adjusted EBITDA margins in the last 12 months ended September 30, 2016. New Sealed Air will continue to generate strong free cash flow, which will support future growth initiatives and value-added M&A and consistently return value to shareholders. 
Let me turn to Slide 8 on New Diversey. Under the Sealed Air umbrella, both Diversey Care and our hygiene business streamlined their organizations, revamped their product portfolio and go-to-market strategy, reenergized energy with a renewed focus on disruptive solutions and embraced a truly entrepreneurial culture, which made them be the most innovative player in the industry, all of which have contributed to consistent top line growth -- what will make the New Diversey and has generated a 3-year compounded annual growth rate of approximately 15% in adjusted EBITDA on a constant dollar basis. 
Our innovative platforms, including the Internet of Things, Intellibot Robotics, Clean-in-Place solutions, biodegradable chemistry, dry lube and others, are enabling us to win new customers around the world. 
And in a separate announcement, you saw that our branded licensing agreement with SCJ will expire in May 2017. We have already started working on developing new partnerships, as announced yesterday morning, with Spectrum and Nakoma. We will also look for opportunities to expand existing relationships and grow our own brand into new channels. 
Given the low capital requirements and free cash flow generation, New Diversey will have the flexibility to invest in growth and return value to shareholders. In short, you have instilled there what a renowned industry analyst once called ""the ATM you want to own."" Now you will have 2 ATM machines. With that, let me now turn the call to Carol for a look at the financial results for the third quarter. Carol?"

The 2 regions that delivered constant dollar sales growth were North America and Latin America. Growth in North America was driven by an increase of approximately 4% in volumes, with positive trends across our 3 divisions. In Latin America, constant dollar growth was a result of our pricing efforts to offset currency devaluations. In EMEA, positive trends in Food Care were offset by declines in Diversey Care and Product Care. Performance in Asia Pacific was primarily impacted by a 14% decline in Australia. The Australian beef market is significantly depressed, with slaughter rates at their lowest levels in 20 years. Australia accounts for approximately 6% of Food Care's net sales. 
Turning to Slide 10. We highlight volume and price/mix trends by division and by region. We have already highlighted key volume trend, so I will focus my comments on price/mix. You can see from this slide that, with the exception of North America, we have had positive price/mix in all regions for 3 consecutive quarters. Food Care's price/mix was positive on a global basis despite North America being negatively impacted by the timing of raw material pass-through. Diversey Care delivered favorable price/mix across all regions, which has been consistent throughout the year. In Product Care, strong e-commerce volumes are currently having a negative impact on mix. 
Turning to Slide 11. Let me walk you through our net sales performance on a year-over-year basis. We delivered $1.7 billion in sales on essentially flat volume. Price/mix contributed $15 million to top line growth, unfavorable currency translation was $31 million, and the impact from divestitures was $15 million. 
Now turning to Slide 12. We present our adjusted EBITDA bridge. I would like to note that our adjusted gross margin improved 90 basis points from 36.4% in Q3 2015 to 37.3% in Q3 2016. Our adjusted EBITDA was $304 million or 17.7% of net sales. Mix and price/cost spread was $22 million favorable, and we realized $10 million in restructuring savings. 
Operating expenses had an impact of $21 million, of which salary and wage inflation was $17 million. Currency was a negative $4 million and divestitures were $3 million. 
Adjusted earnings per share was $0.71 in the third quarter. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 23%. For the full year, we continue to expect our tax rate to be approximately 24%. We repurchased 3.5 million shares for approximately $165 million and exited the third quarter with 194 million shares outstanding. 
Let me now turn the call over to Ken to go through our results by division."
382724,403874719,1064451,"Sealed Air Corporation, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 27, 2016",2016-10-27,"Earnings Calls","Sealed Air Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Carol.

Product Care net sales on a constant dollar basis were unchanged on a year-over-year basis. Rationalization efforts in North America and Europe had a negative impact on constant dollar sales of approximately 200 basis points. We reported a record level of EBITDA margin of nearly 23%, an increase of 160 basis points, which is notable given the raw material environment and a soft industrial sector. 
As you heard from both Jerome and Carol, our third quarter sales performance was due to strength in e-commerce and fulfillment. We delivered nearly 4% sales growth in North America, adjusted for rationalization. North America accounts for approximately 60% of Product Care's total sales. Volume accelerated throughout the quarter, and we continue to see good growth in October. Our thought leadership in providing solutions to e-commerce and fulfillment sectors is resulting in accelerated adoption of our more profitable, differentiated innovations, including inflatable bubble, Korrvu and B+ Equipment, complemented by record levels of equipment installations. We are also seeing expanded adoption of our protective mailers as customers respond to dimensional weight pricing challenges. 
Heading into year-end, we expect growth in e-commerce and fulfillment to accelerate and drive top and bottom line performance. Our robust equipment installations, fueled by our new offerings, gives us confidence in achieving accelerated growth. While we are not seeing much of a rebound from the industrial sector, our customers in this sector are expressing increased interest in our new offerings as they address the impact of dimensional weight pricing. 
Let's turn now to Slide 14 and review Food Care results. Favorable price/mix, positive volume trends in North America and Europe and disciplined cost management were key contributors to sales and EBITDA performance in the third quarter. On an organic basis, adjusted EBITDA increased 7% on 1% sales growth. EBITDA margins increased 110 basis points to just over 21%. Production of all proteins in North America and Europe were up in the third quarter. 
On one hand, our business is reaping the benefit of higher beef volumes and continued global adoption of our new products. On the other hand, these positive trends are being offset by the challenging business environments in Asia Pacific, particularly in Australia, as Carol mentioned, and Latin America, which took a turn for the worse in September after trends appeared to be stabilizing. 
In the fourth quarter, we expect sequential improvement in sales and adjusted EBITDA, with accelerating volume trends in North America and Europe offsetting continued weakness in Australia and Latin America. 
Let's turn to Diversey Care results on Slide 15. Diversey Care net sales were up 1.5% in constant dollars, and adjusted EBITDA margins were 13%. Growth in the quarter was driven by new customer rollouts in North America and Europe and positive trends in Asia Pacific. We were pleased to see North America deliver growth in light of a tough comparable. In Western Europe, most of our largest countries experienced positive constant dollar sales growth; and in Asia Pacific, growth was led by strength in China and India. These positive trends were partially offset by declines in the Middle East. As we anticipated, the hospitality sector, particularly in Turkey, continues to struggle as a result of significant decline in tourism and occupancy rates. 
For the fourth quarter, we expect the positive trends in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific to continue and more than offset challenges in Latin America and Middle East. Customer rollouts are on schedule, and our list of strategic wins across all sectors continues to grow. 
Now let me pass the call back to Carol to review our free cash flow and our outlook for 2016. Carol?"

CapEx during the same period last year was $112 million. 
Now turning to our outlook on Slide 17. Net sales are expected to be approximately $6.8 billion. The impact from the Food Care divestitures on 2016 net sales is $102 million. Currency is expected to have an unfavorable impact on sales of approximately $225 million. 
Our outlook for adjusted EBITDA is now at $1.17 billion. Impact from the Food Care divestitures on 2016 EBITDA is $21 million. Currency is expected to have an unfavorable impact on EBITDA of approximately $35 million. 
We continue to anticipate that the fourth quarter will be our strongest quarter of the year with organic sales growth of approximately 3%. As Jerome and Ken highlighted, our growth in the fourth quarter will be primarily driven by accelerated volume in both Food Care and Product Care. 
Our medical and corporate expenses are expected to be a net expense of $90 million for the full year 2016. Our interest expense for 2016 is estimated at $218 million. Depreciation and amortization is forecast to be approximately $275 million. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be approximately $2.60. 
We are maintaining our free cash flow target of approximately $550 million. CapEx is expected to be $275 million, which includes approximately $125 million related to the investment we are making in our Charlotte campus and other capital restructuring activities. Excluding these items, maintenance and growth CapEx combined is estimated at $150 million. 
For the full year, we expect working capital and other current assets and liabilities to be a source of cash of approximately $80 million. Cash restructuring payments are estimated at $90 million, and we expect to realize restructuring savings of approximately $40 million. Cash interest payments are expected to be $210 million, and cash tax payments are estimated at $125 million.

Now in your first question, I wish I could answer Latin America. We thought that Brazil had bottomed out and Argentina was going along relatively well, and they both took a turn for the worse at the end of the quarter, which had an impact. We still have very good positive growth going in the northern cone of Latin America. So we obviously are keeping our pulse on the market and our key customers and having very good introduction of new products and value-added products in Latin America. So as soon as the market does start to turn positive, we expect to get an accelerated growth. But we just have to stay close to that market because it is volatile."

By the way, at the ISSA this week, we're announcing a new alliance on robotics with Discovery Robotics, and that's going to even increase the pace of our differentiation with our potential competitors. Think about dry lube and this -- and Ciptec. This is a very strong, self-standing entity. And when you think about what we have done in the past 3 years, we have an improvement of products -- or profitability of the what is now to be called the New Diversey of -- on over 15% EBITDA improvement on a compounded annual growth rates in the last 3 years. Very frankly, it's ready to fly from its own wings. It is an -- it is going to enable an even more entrepreneurial approach. So I really believe it is the right time."

I have been a little bit disappointed with my -- with our 1% growth in Q3. But this is -- let's say, this is 2 different stories. At that time, I did not anticipate the severity of the Australian reduction in the beef market. At that time, I was coming -- at that time being in July, when I announced the second quarter results -- we were coming from a strong Latin American and Brazilian recovery on the beef markets because it was volume was -- growth was there, et cetera, and it didn't continue. It has been just a little positive blip. And as Karl said, by the way, on Food Care, Northern LatAm is very much strong and Southern LatAm is bad. At that time, I was fearing that we would be hurt, as Ilham had clearly said, it was -- that we were going to be impacted by the instability of the Middle East and by the hospitality business in markets like France, Belgium and Germany, and we have been a little bit more. Having said that, I -- and to come to your question, it is -- I am very pleased with what we are seeing in some very key markets where we are executing on Change the Game strategy. North American Food Care has had a 3.5% volume growth in the third quarter. North American Product Care has had -- which is a very key market for us, very big for us in Product Care -- has had a 7% volume growth when you exclude the 100 basis points from the divestitures or from the portfolio rationalization. And Diversey Care had a very tough comparable in the third quarter and yet has been positive. That tells me that I -- that we should be confident on Q4, and I am confident on Q4, and what is going to be really the barometer for me is going to be, how are we going to grow volume in Q4 and in each of those 3 divisions? And I can assure you that we are projecting volume growth in Q4 in each of those divisions and solid volume growth. And that definitely, in our minds, is showing the cutoff between the trends in 2015 and '16 into '17."

We had not given specific guidance relative to tax payment for 2015. We're projecting $125 million for 2016. They will be slightly higher than that as we move forward. If we look at restructuring payments, we had originally said cash payments for restructuring would be approximately $100 million, excluding CapEx restructuring. As we've reduced the amount that we anticipate to spend in 2016 to $90 million, that difference, because we were previously at $110 million, we would increase 2017 by $20 million. So in total, the 2016 and '17, we would stay at the $210 million. But we will have a shift into 2017."

You heard me say for a long time, and Dr. Kadri said also, that we are on our way, and we have been improving double digits the EBITDA of the Diversey Care business, by about 12% per year in the last 3 years, all right, on a constant currency basis. What you've heard me also say a few minutes ago in my prepared remarks, is that when you take the New Diversey, which it includes in the hygiene business. Over the last 3 years, we had a 15% compounded annual growth rate in EBITDA, and this is the result of innovation, of rationalization, of new way, go-to-market, et cetera, et cetera. The separation of Diversey has got nothing to do with any disappointments of the situation. I'm actually bullish about the prospect of that.

When you look at us -- if I just tell you that in -- for a meat processor, packaging is less than 1% of their cost. It's nothing compared to the value that we create to them. And we create value to the meat processors. We create value to the retailers by reducing food waste, meat waste, et cetera, et cetera. So we're just not pricing based on our cost. So this concept that the tide goes up when resin prices go up. And that the tide goes down when resin prices go down is not the right concept. With some customers, we do have formulas, and we apply those formulas. But I think it's very important to see that we -- like every company, we do have a commodity business, and we make sure that we are competitive in the commodity business. And in the solutions business, we just don't price according to our costs."

So from then on, you've got to go and wonder whether -- you go and wonder whether there are things which -- what is the best solution? The best solution, for us, was to really look at how we can improve this business. And as I said, the old Diversey is a faint shadow of what it is now. We now have a winning company in the marketplace. We have value-added solution for our customers, and when we switch a customer to us, it is because they see the differential advantage of our solution, the -- and this is why. So it was not so much a question of if; it would be a question of when. And the reason why we decided to do it now is because, no kidding, under the leadership of Dr. Kadri, this -- New Diversey is going to fly very nicely under -- by its own wing. If there was one thing which has been the positive is the creation of one culture. And this is why we have -- leverage all of those kinds of things.

Thank you, and good morning everyone. We have definitely a lot to cover on our call today, and in addition to a review of our third quarter results and outlook, we will be discussing the announcement that we made on October 17 to pursue a tax-free spin-off of Diversey Care and our related hygiene business. 
As planned, we have Ken Chrisman, President of our Product Care division, joining Carol for our third quarter discussion. And I also invited Dr. Ilham Kadri, President of Diversey Care; and Karl Deily, President of Food Care, to join us during this important Q&A session. 
So let me get started. In the third quarter, we reported $304 million of adjusted EBITDA on sales of $1.7 billion. Our margin and free cash flow performance in the quarter is a testament to our strong operation and discipline and working capital management despite soft organic sales growth of 1%. We are pleased to report adjusted EBITDA margins of 17.7%, a 50 basis points improvement over last year, and we generated $212 million of free cash flow during Q3 as compared with $191 million for the same quarter last year. I will provide a few comments and leave the details to Carol and Ken. 
Our price/mix discipline came through in the quarter, with all regions delivering favorable trends except North America, primarily due to timing of raw materials cost pass-through in Food Care. 
Let me highlight volume growth, which was largely driven by our execution of our Change the Game strategy. 
Product Care volumes in North America were up 7% if you exclude the 100 basis points of rationalization. Diversey Care delivered positive volume in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific as a result of customer wins; and Food Care protein packaging volumes were led by more than 5% growth in North America and positive trends in the EMEA region. These positive volume trends are very important to us, as they are strong indications of what's to come into year-end and in 2017. 
Unfortunately, our business suffered from some softness in Latin America, Mid-East and Australia and continued weakness in the general industrial GDP. You can see that we have and will continue to take corrective actions to preserve our bottom line guidance and commit to our free cash flow in 2017. Such agility is now in our DNA. With that said, let me turn back to our decision to pursue a tax-free spin of Diversey. 
By separating our Food Care, Product Care and Medical business from our Diversey Care and related hygiene business, we create 2 pure-play, industry-leading companies with strong financial profiles, each with its own unique and compelling investment opportunities. We believe that this is the appropriate next step in our company's transformation and will accelerate profitable growth for both entities. 
Before I get into the rationale, I will quickly highlight the structure of the transaction on Slide 5. Following completion of the tax-free spin, Sealed Air shareholders will own 100% of the common stock of what I would call New Diversey. Both New Sealed Air and New Diversey will be well capitalized with disciplined, returns-based approaches to capital allocation. We anticipate a similar credit rating to existing Sealed Air at both companies. 
The transaction is expected to be completed in the second half of 2017, and we anticipate timing of the Form 10 as early as the first quarter of 2017, which will provide you with independent stand-alone financials for New Diversey. 
So now let's turn into Slide 6, where we highlight the strategic rationale for the separation. This separation will give both entities the ability to tailor their strategic objectives and capitalize on global growth opportunities, both at the core of their businesses and with respect to innovative and disruptive technology. New Sealed Air and New Diversey will have leaner and more streamlined operations and will become even more entrepreneurial. 
I want to spend a few minutes highlighting both New Sealed Air and New Diversey. 
First, New Sealed Air on Slide 7. Many of you have heard me say this before, but I will say it again. We believe that our Food Care and Product Care divisions are, by far, the most innovative leaders in their respective industries with unmatched global scale and reach. In short, we are market makers. Over the last 3-plus years, we extended this leadership globally with new innovative product offerings and consultative services. Adjusted EBITDA for our Food Care division, excluding the hygiene business and our Product Care division, has reported a 3-year compounded annual growth rate of approximately 11% in constant dollars. 
To give you a sense of the size and the margin profile on an as-reported basis, the adjusted EBITDA margin for New Sealed Air reported approximately 20% adjusted EBITDA margins in the last 12 months ended September 30, 2016. New Sealed Air will continue to generate strong free cash flow, which will support future growth initiatives and value-added M&A and consistently return value to shareholders. 
Let me turn to Slide 8 on New Diversey. Under the Sealed Air umbrella, both Diversey Care and our hygiene business streamlined their organizations, revamped their product portfolio and go-to-market strategy, reenergized energy with a renewed focus on disruptive solutions and embraced a truly entrepreneurial culture, which made them be the most innovative player in the industry, all of which have contributed to consistent top line growth -- what will make the New Diversey and has generated a 3-year compounded annual growth rate of approximately 15% in adjusted EBITDA on a constant dollar basis. 
Our innovative platforms, including the Internet of Things, Intellibot Robotics, Clean-in-Place solutions, biodegradable chemistry, dry lube and others, are enabling us to win new customers around the world. 
And in a separate announcement, you saw that our branded licensing agreement with SCJ will expire in May 2017. We have already started working on developing new partnerships, as announced yesterday morning, with Spectrum and Nakoma. We will also look for opportunities to expand existing relationships and grow our own brand into new channels. 
Given the low capital requirements and free cash flow generation, New Diversey will have the flexibility to invest in growth and return value to shareholders. In short, you have instilled there what a renowned industry analyst once called ""the ATM you want to own."" Now you will have 2 ATM machines. With that, let me now turn the call to Carol for a look at the financial results for the third quarter. Carol?"

On Slide 9 of our presentation, you can see our performance by region for the third quarter. The 2 regions that delivered constant dollar sales growth were North America and Latin America. Growth in North America was driven by an increa",444,"Thank you, Jerome. On Slide 9 of our presentation, you can see our performance by region for the third quarter. The 2 regions that delivered constant dollar sales growth were North America and Latin America. Growth in North America was driven by an increase of approximately 4% in volumes, with positive trends across our 3 divisions. In Latin America, constant dollar growth was a result of our pricing efforts to offset currency devaluations. In EMEA, positive trends in Food Care were offset by declines in Diversey Care and Product Care. Performance in Asia Pacific was primarily impacted by a 14% decline in Australia. The Australian beef market is significantly depressed, with slaughter rates at their lowest levels in 20 years. Australia accounts for approximately 6% of Food Care's net sales. 
Turning to Slide 10. We highlight volume and price/mix trends by division and by region. We have already highlighted key volume trend, so I will focus my comments on price/mix. You can see from this slide that, with the exception of North America, we have had positive price/mix in all regions for 3 consecutive quarters. Food Care's price/mix was positive on a global basis despite North America being negatively impacted by the timing of raw material pass-through. Diversey Care delivered favorable price/mix across all regions, which has been consistent throughout the year. In Product Care, strong e-commerce volumes are currently having a negative impact on mix. 
Turning to Slide 11. Let me walk you through our net sales performance on a year-over-year basis. We delivered $1.7 billion in sales on essentially flat volume. Price/mix contributed $15 million to top line growth, unfavorable currency translation was $31 million, and the impact from divestitures was $15 million. 
Now turning to Slide 12. We present our adjusted EBITDA bridge. I would like to note that our adjusted gross margin improved 90 basis points from 36.4% in Q3 2015 to 37.3% in Q3 2016. Our adjusted EBITDA was $304 million or 17.7% of net sales. Mix and price/cost spread was $22 million favorable, and we realized $10 million in restructuring savings. 
Operating expenses had an impact of $21 million, of which salary and wage inflation was $17 million. Currency was a negative $4 million and divestitures were $3 million. 
Adjusted earnings per share was $0.71 in the third quarter. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 23%. For the full year, we continue to expect our tax rate to be approximately 24%. We repurchased 3.5 million shares for approximately $165 million and exited the third quarter with 194 million shares outstanding. 
Let me now turn the call over to Ken to go through our results by division."

Product Care net sales on a constant dollar basis were unchanged on a year-over-year basis. Rationalization efforts in North America and Europe had a negative impact on constant dollar sales of approximately 200 basis points. We reported a record level of EBITDA margin of nearly 23%, an increase of 160 basis points, which is notable given the raw material environment and a soft industrial sector. 
As you heard from both Jerome and Carol, our third quarter sales performance was due to strength in e-commerce and fulfillment. We delivered nearly 4% sales growth in North America, adjusted for rationalization. North America accounts for approximately 60% of Product Care's total sales. Volume accelerated throughout the quarter, and we continue to see good growth in October. Our thought leadership in providing solutions to e-commerce and fulfillment sectors is resulting in accelerated adoption of our more profitable, differentiated innovations, including inflatable bubble, Korrvu and B+ Equipment, complemented by record levels of equipment installations. We are also seeing expanded adoption of our protective mailers as customers respond to dimensional weight pricing challenges. 
Heading into year-end, we expect growth in e-commerce and fulfillment to accelerate and drive top and bottom line performance. Our robust equipment installations, fueled by our new offerings, gives us confidence in achieving accelerated growth. While we are not seeing much of a rebound from the industrial sector, our customers in this sector are expressing increased interest in our new offerings as they address the impact of dimensional weight pricing. 
Let's turn now to Slide 14 and review Food Care results. Favorable price/mix, positive volume trends in North America and Europe and disciplined cost management were key contributors to sales and EBITDA performance in the third quarter. On an organic basis, adjusted EBITDA increased 7% on 1% sales growth. EBITDA margins increased 110 basis points to just over 21%. Production of all proteins in North America and Europe were up in the third quarter. 
On one hand, our business is reaping the benefit of higher beef volumes and continued global adoption of our new products. On the other hand, these positive trends are being offset by the challenging business environments in Asia Pacific, particularly in Australia, as Carol mentioned, and Latin America, which took a turn for the worse in September after trends appeared to be stabilizing. 
In the fourth quarter, we expect sequential improvement in sales and adjusted EBITDA, with accelerating volume trends in North America and Europe offsetting continued weakness in Australia and Latin America. 
Let's turn to Diversey Care results on Slide 15. Diversey Care net sales were up 1.5% in constant dollars, and adjusted EBITDA margins were 13%. Growth in the quarter was driven by new customer rollouts in North America and Europe and positive trends in Asia Pacific. We were pleased to see North America deliver growth in light of a tough comparable. In Western Europe, most of our largest countries experienced positive constant dollar sales growth; and in Asia Pacific, growth was led by strength in China and India. These positive trends were partially offset by declines in the Middle East. As we anticipated, the hospitality sector, particularly in Turkey, continues to struggle as a result of significant decline in tourism and occupancy rates. 
For the fourth quarter, we expect the positive trends in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific to continue and more than offset challenges in Latin America and Middle East. Customer rollouts are on schedule, and our list of strategic wins across all sectors continues to grow. 
Now let me pass the call back to Carol to review our free cash flow and our outlook for 2016. Carol?"

Working capital and other assets and liabilities were a use of cash of $82 million for the 9 months ended September 30. CapEx increased to $190 million, which includes $71 million related to the investment we are making in our Charlotte campus and $23 million related to other CapEx restructuring activities. CapEx during the same period last year was $112 million. 
Now turning to our outlook on Slide 17. Net sales are expected to be approximately $6.8 billion. The impact from the Food Care divestitures on 2016 net sales is $102 million. Currency is expected to have an unfavorable impact on sales of approximately $225 million. 
Our outlook for adjusted EBITDA is now at $1.17 billion. Impact from the Food Care divestitures on 2016 EBITDA is $21 million. Currency is expected to have an unfavorable impact on EBITDA of approximately $35 million. 
We continue to anticipate that the fourth quarter will be our strongest quarter of the year with organic sales growth of approximately 3%. As Jerome and Ken highlighted, our growth in the fourth quarter will be primarily driven by accelerated volume in both Food Care and Product Care. 
Our medical and corporate expenses are expected to be a net expense of $90 million for the full year 2016. Our interest expense for 2016 is estimated at $218 million. Depreciation and amortization is forecast to be approximately $275 million. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be approximately $2.60. 
We are maintaining our free cash flow target of approximately $550 million. CapEx is expected to be $275 million, which includes approximately $125 million related to the investment we are making in our Charlotte campus and other capital restructuring activities. Excluding these items, maintenance and growth CapEx combined is estimated at $150 million. 
For the full year, we expect working capital and other current assets and liabilities to be a source of cash of approximately $80 million. Cash restructuring payments are estimated at $90 million, and we expect to realize restructuring savings of approximately $40 million. Cash interest payments are expected to be $210 million, and cash tax payments are estimated at $125 million. 
That concludes our prepared remarks. Before I open the call to questions, I would like to remind you, our Fourth Quarter Earnings Call is tentatively scheduled for Thursday, February 9.

However, the natural fit is to keep the hygiene business with the Diversey Care business due to the synergies of supply chain and a number of other things. And obviously, our ability to partner going forward will still be there, but they are 2 different businesses with 2 different sales processes and sales cycles, and we feel it's the most prudent thing to do to include them in the spin. Now in your first question, I wish I could answer Latin America. We thought that Brazil had bottomed out and Argentina was going along relatively well, and they both took a turn for the worse at the end of the quarter, which had an impact. We still have very good positive growth going in the northern cone of Latin America. So we obviously are keeping our pulse on the market and our key customers and having very good introduction of new products and value-added products in Latin America. So as soon as the market does start to turn positive, we expect to get an accelerated growth. But we just have to stay close to that market because it is volatile."

But I'm just trying to square that with the move to Charlotte. You spent tens of millions, almost $100 million maybe on a new headquarters to create a larger, more centralized organization.

You have to realize that the old Diversey is a -- was a faint shadow of what it is now, and it really woke up a very traditional industry. We're not seeing this yet in sales growth. We're seeing sales growth, but it's nothing compared to what this is -- this New Diversey business is going to be over the years to come. Think about the Internet of Things, 100% biodegradable products, [indiscernible] products, robotics. By the way, at the ISSA this week, we're announcing a new alliance on robotics with Discovery Robotics, and that's going to even increase the pace of our differentiation with our potential competitors. Think about dry lube and this -- and Ciptec. This is a very strong, self-standing entity. And when you think about what we have done in the past 3 years, we have an improvement of products -- or profitability of the what is now to be called the New Diversey of -- on over 15% EBITDA improvement on a compounded annual growth rates in the last 3 years.

I have been a little bit disappointed with my -- with our 1% growth in Q3. But this is -- let's say, this is 2 different stories. At that time, I did not anticipate the severity of the Australian reduction in the beef market. At that time, I was coming -- at that time being in July, when I announced the second quarter results -- we were coming from a strong Latin American and Brazilian recovery on the beef markets because it was volume was -- growth was there, et cetera, and it didn't continue. It has been just a little positive blip. And as Karl said, by the way, on Food Care, Northern LatAm is very much strong and Southern LatAm is bad. At that time, I was fearing that we would be hurt, as Ilham had clearly said, it was -- that we were going to be impacted by the instability of the Middle East and by the hospitality business in markets like France, Belgium and Germany, and we have been a little bit more. Having said that, I -- and to come to your question, it is -- I am very pleased with what we are seeing in some very key markets where we are executing on Change the Game strategy. North American Food Care has had a 3.5% volume growth in the third quarter. North American Product Care has had -- which is a very key market for us, very big for us in Product Care -- has had a 7% volume growth when you exclude the 100 basis points from the divestitures or from the portfolio rationalization. And Diversey Care had a very tough comparable in the third quarter and yet has been positive. That tells me that I -- that we should be confident on Q4, and I am confident on Q4, and what is going to be really the barometer for me is going to be, how are we going to grow volume in Q4 and in each of those 3 divisions? And I can assure you that we are projecting volume growth in Q4 in each of those divisions and solid volume growth. And that definitely, in our minds, is showing the cutoff between the trends in 2015 and '16 into '17."

If we look at restructuring payments, we had originally said cash payments for restructuring would be approximately $100 million, excluding CapEx restructuring.

So this concept that the tide goes up when resin prices go up. And that the tide goes down when resin prices go down is not the right concept. With some customers, we do have formulas, and we apply those formulas.

We have value-added solution for our customers, and when we switch a customer to us, it is because they see the differential advantage of our solution, the -- and this is why. So it was not so much a question of if; it would be a question of when. And the reason why we decided to do it now is because, no kidding, under the leadership of Dr. Kadri, this -- New Diversey is going to fly very nicely under -- by its own wing. If there was one thing which has been the positive is the creation of one culture. And this is why we have -- leverage all of those kinds of things.
