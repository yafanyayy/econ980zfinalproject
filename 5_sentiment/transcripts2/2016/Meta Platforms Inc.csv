Overall, Q4 was a strong quarter and a great end to the year. More than 1.59 billion people now use Facebook each month and 1.04 billion every day, a growth of nearly 200 million people monthl",1770,"Thanks, Deborah, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. 
Overall, Q4 was a strong quarter and a great end to the year. More than 1.59 billion people now use Facebook each month and 1.04 billion every day, a growth of nearly 200 million people monthly and 148 million people daily this year. More than 1.44 billion people use Facebook on mobile devices. 
When it comes to our business, we're also pleased with our continued growth. Total revenue grew by 52% year-over-year to more than $5.8 billion, and advertising revenues grew by 57% to reach more than $5.6 billion. 
But it's important to consider not just our business results, but also how we're improving the lives of people and communities around the world. Next week, Facebook celebrates its 12th birthday. And as I think about our progress and where we go from here, I have reflected on the diverse global moments that Facebook was involved in 2015. 
More than 950 million people received a notification that a friend or a loved one was safe in a crisis. Millions of people supported the people of Nepal after the earthquake and the people of France after the Paris attacks. More than 8 million people used 35,000 Groups and Pages on Facebook to support refugees. And people from all over the world connected around moments from Star Wars to the U.S. presidential election, from the Indian Super League to the Cricket World Cup.
Seeing our global community connecting in all these ways shows the opportunities ahead as we connect the world, but also the challenges. Even as the world has tended towards greater openness over time, in many communities, we also see greater fear over what a connected world and more technological progress means for them. Addressing these concerns is essential for making progress on our mission. And we're going to keep working to give as much voice as we can and advance the benefits of connectivity and bringing the world together.  In 2016 and beyond, we're going to continue doing that by serving our community, working to bring connectivity to billions of people not yet connected and building technologies that give people more ways to express themselves. 
Now let's talk about how we've continued working to do that, and let's start with how we're improving our existing products and businesses.  Our strategy here is to deliver better, more engaging experience for our community and to give people better tools to sharing different types of content with a different groups of people that they care about. Video is an important part of the Facebook experience, and continuing to invest here is important for allowing people to share some of the most engaging content. We've continued to make progress and now, 100 million hours of video are watched daily on Facebook. We've been testing new experiences like Suggested Videos, which enables people to discover more videos that they might be interested in. We're also exploring ways to get people a dedicated place on Facebook for when they just want to watch videos.
With other parts of our core, we've continued to focus on improving the performance and quality of our product to better serve different communities on Facebook. And these efforts are paying off, with growth and engagement for different products reaching an impressive scale. Now more than 500 million people use Events each month, and more than 123 million events were created on Facebook in 2015. 
For the first time, more than 1 billion people used Groups in a single month on Facebook. It's inspiring to see all the different communities using Groups from small family and classroom and church groups to large ones, like the Running Challenge Group that I started a few weeks ago that now has about 100,000 members. 
To serve our entire global community, we're optimizing our services for people in developing countries. We've improved Facebook Lite to offer a better experience in low-bandwidth environments, improving load times and adding features like video. More than 80 million people now use Facebook Lite as of December. 
And when it comes to serving businesses, we've continued to focus on creating better ads and tools for more than 2.5 million active advertisers. More than 50 million small businesses now use Pages on Facebook, and people post than 2.5 billion comments on these pages each month. It's a good example of how the strength and engagement of our community is making Facebook more valuable for businesses every day, as Sheryl is going to talk about this in a minute.
Next, let's talk about how we're building our next generation of services. With Facebook, we've continued to drive the shift towards more visual content online. The community continues to grow. And back in September, we announced a new milestone of 400 million monthly actives. Over the last year, after community has grown, we focused on building engaging new experiences for the community, including by improving search and by introducing trending content. 
We've also worked to develop new experiences to give people more options by creating and sharing different types of content. In March, we launched  app, allowing people to combine images. And in October, the team also launched Boomerang, an app for making videos, which reached #1 in the App Store in more than 70 countries.  We also introduced a new video channel on Instagram to watch moments from big events like New Year's or the college football championship as they happen. 
With Messenger and WhatsApp, we've continued to make progress with building these in two valuable communication services for everyone in the world. More than 800 million people now use Messenger monthly. And in 2015, we grew that number by almost 0.25 billion, while also increasing engagement. We continue to give people who is to communicate by introducing video calling and new options for customizing conversations with fun things like colors and , using apps like Messenger platform.
We also worked to expand Messenger's utility by adding payments, a new way to connect with businesses, and by testing M, a digital assistant powered by AI. In this quarter, we also began testing a transportation platform, allowing people to request an Uber ride. More services will be coming to the platform soon, including airlines.
WhatsApp ended the year with nearly 1 billion monthly actives. As WhatsApp has grown, we worked to keep it fast, simple and reliable. And we've seen many communities come to depend on this as their main communication service. To serve these communities well, this month we announced that WhatsApp will now be free to everyone and will no longer charge subscription fees that many people were charged after their first year. We think this is an important step towards creating an even more ubiquitous product without affecting our plans for building WhatsApp into an important business in the coming years. Later this year, we'll be testing new ways to people use WhatsApp to communicate with businesses and organizations that they want to hear from.
Finally, let's talk about our work on the breakthrough technologies that can help connect more people to the Internet and create transformative new experiences. In 2015, we made significant progress on our efforts to connect more people to the Internet. We launched the first trial of Express WiFi, a product designed to help entrepreneurs bring their communities online. We launched free basics in 33 more countries now connected 19 million people. This year, we expect to hold our first test flight of Aquila, our first solar-powered aircraft designed to beam Internet into communities from the sky. And we're also working on new advances in lasers that can transfer large amounts of data faster and more efficiently than anything today.
With our work in AI, we continue to make progress towards the new generation of computers that can see and understand. Over the last year, we published dozens of research papers, including some of the leading work on image recognition and language understanding. To drive the entire AI community forward, we've also open sourced software and allotted new AI hardware platform. Achieving the scientific breakthroughs to build AI that makes a dramatic visible difference in people's lives is going to take a long time, but already we're seeing opportunities to serve our community. We recently built a prototype AI system that combines language and vision comprehension, so you can show an image that has never been seen before and it can answer questions about that image. And we've even used AI to help blind people experience their friends' photos and News Feed by describing the scenes.
with virtual reality, we've reached some important milestones. The Samsung VR shipped over the holidays with our Oculus software, and we're pleased with the initial reaction. This month, we also opened preorders for Oculus headsets. This will be the world's best VR experience, and we're excited to begin shipping to people in more than 20 countries before the end of March. More than 100 VR games and experiences have come to Oculus this year. And later this year, we'll also be shipping our Oculus touch controllers to give headset virtual reality. These controllers will enhance the VR experience and allow people to communicate more naturally in VR through intuitive hand movements and gestures. 
This Oculus launch is shaping up to be a big moment for the gaming community, but over the long term, VR has the potential to change the way that we live, work and communicate as well. The launch is an important step towards the future, and we're really looking forward to seeing how people use it.
So that's how we've continued to make progress on our strategy. It's been a strong quarter, and we ended 2015 with a great foundation for our efforts going into 2016. Our strategy is working, and we have many more opportunities ahead. So we're going to continue investing to deliver more great results over the long term.
On a more personal note, over the last few months with new addition in my family, I've been reflecting a lot on the legacy that we want to pass on to the next generation. I'm excited about our progress and the chance to build something great for the future. If we continue to focus on solving the fundamental challenges facing the world and bringing the world closer together, we can leave a better world for the whole next generation.
And that's what I think about every day as we continue building Facebook. And I want to thank everyone in our community, replaced, our shareholders from our partners for helping us on this journey. Thanks, and here's Sheryl."

We had a terrific fourth quarter capping off a great 2015. Q4 ad revenue grew 57% or 66% on a constant-currency basis.

We had a terrific fourth quarter capping off a great 2015. Q4 ad revenue grew 57% or 66% on a constant-currency basis. Mobile ad revenue reached $4.5 billion, up 81% year-over-year and is now 80% of total ad revenue.
Facebook and Instagram drive business results for our partners, helping their products off shelves online and off. As a result, we're growing spend from our current clients and attracting new marketers to our platform. We saw strong growth across all verticals and marketer segments and regions. We're also pleased with the growth we're seeing in the emerging markets and countries like China, where businesses are advertising on Facebook and Instagram to reach people internationally. We continue to make progress in our 3 priorities: capitalizing on the shift to mobile, growing the number of marketers using our ad products, and making our ads more relevant and effective.
First, capitalizing on the shift to mobile. Heading into 2016, it's clear that consumers have shifted to mobile and businesses know they need to catch up. Marketers now realize that if they want to reach their customers where they are, mobile is essential. Our conversations with clients have shifted from if they should market on mobile to how. With over 1.44 billion people using Facebook on mobile monthly and over 400 million monthly actives on Instagram, Facebook and Instagram have become the 2 most important mobile advertising platforms. We provide a creative canvas powered by technology, a unique combination of art and science that marketers can use to deliver great creatives with the highest quality targeting at unparalleled scale.
The 2015 holiday season was a defining moment for mobile marketing and demonstrated the power of our mobile platform. According to comScore, total U.S. consumer spending on mobile in November and December was up 59% year-over-year. This holiday season, marketers turned to mobile more than ever before.  To reach a large mobile audience for the launch of Halo 5, Microsoft Xbox used Facebook and Instagram. Working with their agencies and power media team from Network, Eisenberg Group and McCann, they understood that people watch people differently on mobile News Feed and on TV. So they created videos to capture audience attention in the first 3 seconds even without sound. They drove over 380 million impressions and 49 million video views in key markets and increased purchase intent by 10 points in the U.S.
Our second priority is growing the number of marketers using our ad products. Last quarter, we announced that we had over 2.5 million active advertisers, and since then, our growth has remained strong. This represents a small fraction of the over 50 million small businesses now actively using Pages, so we see a big opportunity to continue to grow the number of Facebook advertises going forward. We're also very please with growth in advertiser adoption of Instagram and the positive results that advertisers are seeing from their investments. 98 of the top 100 advertisers on Facebook also advertised on Instagram in Q4.
Our third priority is improving the relevance and effectiveness of our ads. We shipped a lot of new ad products this past year. These products help deliver personalized marketing at scale and drive business for our clients. Leading up to Black Friday, ShopDirect, the U.K.'s second largest online retailer, teased upcoming sales for the cinema graph video to build awareness. They then retargeted people who saw the video with 1-day-only deals. On Black Friday, they used our carousel and PPA ads to promote products people have shown interest in. They saw a 20x return on ad spend from this campaign, helping them achieve their biggest Black Friday and most successful sales day ever. 
To share just a few other product examples and emerging markets, we launched slide show, a video-like ad experience that works with lower connection speeds and feature phones. local awareness at globally to help brick-and-mortar businesses reach people near their stores and started testing canvas ads to help marketers showcase their products in a more immersive way.  We continue to invest in ad tech and are especially pleased with the growth of Audience Network. 
Measurement also remains a critical area of focus. Our measurement tools like conversion lift and the Facebook pixel proved to marketers that we're driving business results and help make their ads more relevant. This year, we saw more advertisers shift from proxy metrics like clicks to business results like digital and in-store sales.
Our results show that the investments we've made over the past few years are paying off, and we see a lot of exciting opportunities ahead. We know we still have a lot of hard work to do. And heading into the new year, we will remain very focused on our top 3 priorities.
I want to take this opportunity to thank our clients around the world for their partnership. Your investment and feedback is critical to making our products better. I also really want to thank the global Facebook teams for your extraordinary dedication to our partner success. hard work and execution is critical to helping us fulfill our mission. Thanks, everyone. 
And now here's Dave."

Q4 was a strong quarter and wed up a phenomenal year for Facebook. Full year 2015 revenue was $17.9 billion, up 44% year-over-year or 53% on a constant-currency basis.

Q4 was a strong quarter and wed up a phenomenal year for Facebook. Full year 2015 revenue was $17.9 billion, up 44% year-over-year or 53% on a constant-currency basis. In 2015, we generated over $6 billion in free cash flow including $2.1 billion in Q4, while continuing to fund important investments for the future growth of the business. 
The strong growth and engagement of our community was a consistent theme throughout 2015 and that continues in the fourth quarter. In December, 1.04 billion people used Facebook on an average day, an increase of 17% compared to last year. This daily number represented 65% of the 1.59 billion people who visited Facebook during the month of December.
Mobile continued to drive the growth of our community. In December, 1.44 billion people accessed Facebook on mobile devices, an increase of 21% compared to last year. And 90% of the people who used Facebook on both a monthly and daily basis accessed us via mobile devices.
Now turning to the financials. All of our comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. Additionally, our non-GAAP measures exclude stock-based compensation and the amortization of intangible.
In Q4, total revenue was $5.8 billion, up 52% or 60% on a constant-currency basis. Q4 ad revenue was $5.6 billion, up over $2 billion from last year. Year-over-year growth was 57% or 66% on a constant-currency basis.
The strengthening of the U.S. dollar continued to have an unfavorable impact on our revenue in the fourth quarter. Had exchange rates remained constant with Q4 2014 levels, our total revenue would have been approximately $320 million higher.
U.S. and Canada and Asia Pacific continued to be our 2 strongest regions with ad revenue growth of 64% and 57% respectively. Our rest of world and Europe regions grew at 53% and 45% respectively as they were more heavily impacted by currency headwinds.
Mobile ad revenue was $4.5 billion, up 81% from last year and represented 80% of our advertising revenue. For perspective, 3 years ago, the mobile percentage was just over 20%.  Q4 capped off a remarkably successful year for our mobile advertising business where we were able to combine strong growth in ad inventory supply with strong growth in advertiser demand. 
On the supply side, we grew the number of people using Facebook on mobile time spent and ad load. Our ongoing focus on ad quality and relevance enabled us to deliver a better overall mobile ads experience for our users while increasing the number of ad space. In Q4, we also benefited to a lesser extent from increases in ad inventory from Instagram and the Audience Network.
On the demand side, we believe our efforts on targeting and measurement solutions enabled marketers to achieve better business results at better values. This helped us drive strong growth from a broad array of advertisers, including direct response and brand advertisers, large companies and SMBs and both existing and new advertisers. 
Turning now to the overall price volume metrics. In Q4, the average price per ad increased 21%, while total ad impressions increased 29% on a year-over-year basis. It's worth noting that this was the first quarter since Q3 2013 that total ad impressions increased on a year-over-year basis. This was driven by an increase in mobile ad impressions and was partially offset by a decline in ad impressions delivered on personal computers, consistent with the ongoing declines in PC usage.  The reported increase in price is being driven by the continued mix shift towards mobile, which contains higher-priced News Feed ads, rather than the mix we have on PCs on both News Feed ads and lower-priced right-hand column ads.
Total payments and other fees revenue was $204 million, down 21% compared to last year. The decline was driven by reduction in payments revenue related to to games played on personal computers.
Turning now to expenses. Q4 total GAAP expenses were $3.3 billion, up 21%, and non-GAAP expenses were $2.3 billion, up 42%. Our year-over-year GAAP expense growth rate slowed this quarter as we lapped the introduction of stock-based compensation charges associated with the WhatsApp transaction. Non-GAAP expenses were driven by increases in headcount-related costs, cost of revenue and marketing expenses. We ended the year with nearly 12,700 employees, up 38% compared to last year.
Our GAAP operating margin was -- sorry, our GAAP operating income was approximately $2.6 billion, representing a 44% operating margin. Our non-GAAP operating income was $3.5 billion, representing a 60% operating margin. 
Our Q4 GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were 39% and 36% respectively. Our Q4 GAAP net income was approximately $1.6 billion or $0.54 per share, and our non-GAAP net income was $2.3 billion or $0.79 per share. 
In the full year 2015, capital expenditures were $2.5 billion as we continued to invest in servers, data centers, network infrastructure and office facilities to support the rapid growth of the business.
We ended the year with over $18.4 billion in cash and investments.
Turning now to the outlook. First, some color on revenue. We expect the factors that drove the strong growth of our advertising business in 2015 will continue into 2016. However, we expect to continue to face foreign exchange headwind, especially early in the year, as we will be lapping periods where the dollar was relatively weaker than it is today. More importantly, -- sorry, more broadly, the overall macro environment introduces a level of uncertainty around global growth and exchange rates that could impact our business in 2016. And we do expect to face tougher comparables as the year progresses, given the remarkably strong advertising performance in 2015.
Turning now to expense guidance. 2016 will be another significant investment year for Facebook. In 2015, we continued investing heavily in core. At the same time, we doubled our investment levels in our next-generation services, which includes WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger. And we tripled our investment levels in our long-term areas of focus, which includes our connectivity efforts, Oculus and our AI investments. We will continue investing significantly in all of these areas in 2016.
We expect the year-over-year growth rate for full year 2016 total GAAP expenses to be approximately 30% to 40%, and for full year 2016 total non-GAAP expenses to be approximately 45% to 55%. Note these ranges represent total operating expenses -- sorry, include cost of revenue. These ranges also include the cost of revenue impact of the expected shipments of Oculus Rift, but we expect that impact to be immaterial to our overall total expenses for the year.
We anticipate our 2016 capital expenditures will be in the range of $4 billion to $4.5 billion. We recently announced that we will begin building a new data center in , Ireland, and that project is on top of the new data center being built in Fort Worth, Texas.
We expect our 2016 stock-based compensation to be in the range of $3.1 billion to $3.3 billion, approximately half of which is related to our prior acquisitions, most notably WhatsApp.  We expect 2016 amortization expenses to be approximately $700 million to $800 million. 
And lastly, we anticipate that our Q1 and full year 2016 GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates to be in the low 30s on a percentage basis, down from our 2015 rates. We expect our tax rates will decline further over time and resemble those of our global peers over the next several years. In addition, in 2016, we expect for the first time to pay a significant amount of U.S  income tax on a cash basis.
To conclude, 2015 was an outstanding year for Facebook. Our performance reflects the strong growth and engagement of our community, the momentum we're seeing in our ads business and the significant progress we're making on our mission to correct the world.
With that, Chris, we would like to open up the call for questions."

We didn't see anything in Q4 that indicated broad-based macro weakness beyond, of course, the impact that FX is having, which is pretty significant. I mean we saw the impact in places like Brazil where you're -- you gotten a currency headwind of over 30%. So you're certainly see that impact and become this sort of global macroeconomic and currency factors will continue to impact us. We're obviously benefiting from a strong secular shift to usage of mobile, and we feel we are very well positioned in that. We're seeing more and more advertisers move to mobile. They realize that it's no longer a question of whether they need to be in mobile, but it's how they're going to be in mobile. And we think we've got the best solution for that. We're investing to make it even better. I think from a secular trend point of view, we're very well positioned. But obviously, we'll continue to monitor the macro conditions and currency."

Instagram, we're pleased with the growth on Instagram. And as I mentioned, 98 of our top 100 advertisers in Facebook are now advertising on Instagram. It's also the case in Facebook with remarkably strong growth as well, servicing strong growth across the platforms. I think what's exciting about both platforms is that we combine the art and the science of both a creative canvas that marketers are excited about and targeting. So to share another example from the holiday, shutter glider their Facebook and Instagram both the brand and direct response holiday campaign on mobile. And what they did was just beautiful pictures, but also targeting them specifically to women with specific interests, such as things like weddings and babies. And they saw a 6.4x return on ad spend.

And if you tried out the toy box demo with the hands, Oculus Touch, what you see is when you're in virtual reality with another person, you can interact with environment and use your hands. You can -- it's just not about where you are and the fact that you can instantaneously teleport to another place.

We believe both Facebook and Instagram have this combination of an ability to do great creatives with the best targeting and the most sophisticated measurement, which shows businesses how we help move products off shelves. And we won, and we tell our clients, to want to be the best dollar, the best euro, the best pound and the best minute you spend.

We need to build really compelling ad products with great formats that led marketers be creative and the convincing. I'll share an example of something we did for a emerging market. I've mentioned briefly in my remarks Slide Show, the Slide Show product is enabled video-like experience with of lower connection speeds it would feature phones with series of photos. So Coca-Cola used that in Kenya and Nigeria. they took screen shots of a video ad ads they produced in other markets. They uploaded them with text, and it reached 2 million people with a 10-point lift in ad awareness. So the way we need to drive sales around the world is by understanding markets, launching things like click to missed call ads in India and making sure our products work for markets, but also being able to connect to those advertising metrics and business metrics around the world. Video ads are important for our platform. the most important thing that's going well there is consumer engagement with video is growing. We have 500 million people watching video a day. And the fact that so much video is being consumed in our platform consists room from an ads business to grow because we want the formats to match. Marketers also really love video, and it's a really compelling way to reach people and video contributing  to our growth. It's important to note that it's not just large brand advertisers that are using video but all of our market segments, direct response, SMBs who have uploaded 1.5 million videos, and that's both organic and paid in the last month, and developers. The video ad spend is not all incremental, of course, because every time we put an ad in News Feed, it's taking the place of an ad with another format. In terms of learnings, one of the most important learnings we have is that video formats and different on Facebook. There are certainly people that are watching the whole 30-second video ad ads with sound, but there are people very doing less. They're washing shorter formats and they're watching with sound. on one of the challenges we have in the market is convincing marketers and agencies and people that make the video to experiment with different formats. The good news is that we're getting great results like the Halo 5 example I shared in my remarks, that when people are willing to experiment, this is a pretty unique creative canvas. you can do short form with sound off, you can do longer form with sound on, and everything in between. And our ability to persuade marketers to experiment is going to be a major driver of how much we can do here."

Other platforms, other forms of advertising like TV and other, have very established metrics that people have believed for a very long time. We think targeting can be better and any other platform. We also believe our ability to measure results and the keeper but it's up to us to prove that and to prove that client to client but it's also worth noting that we worked really well with TV. It's not always the choice of TV or Facebook but asked and we can be a compliment but we've done a bunch of work with Nielsen to measure what happens when marketers do big TV campaigns and do campaigns that are broadly targeted on Facebook, and we are able to increase brand favorability.

Reactions is going to roll it in every platform. We're testing it in a handful of countries to start, just to make sure that we have the UI and interaction simple enough that people could express more of what they wanted without getting in their way. It is adding a little bit of complexity to something that is very simple today, just one tap Like button. But the philosophy behind it is that when you only have a Like button, if you share a sad piece of content or something that makes you angry, people may not have the tool to react to it. And therefore, over time, the community feels less comfortable sharing that kind of content on Facebook. And we want people to be up to share all the things that are meaningful to them, not just that are happy and people are going to like when they see it. And we think that just really important to the mission of the company and will increase engagement and sharing and openness and all of the things we care about. And so far, I think there are a few teeth that we needed to make to reactions and initially testing it from but it's going well and I think we plan to roll it out everywhere pretty soon, so that's the plan there. On payments, the basic strategy that we have is to make it, especially in products like Messenger that where the business direction is a bit more transactional to take all the friction out that making the transactions that you need. So we don't view ourselves as a payments business. That's not the type of company that we are. We'll partner with everyone who does payments. When you look at the stuff that Apple is doing with Apple Pay for, really need innovation the space that takes a lot of friction out of transactions as well. And our view is that the less friction, the better the user experience, the more people can easily interact with the businesses that they care about. And ultimately for our business, that will drive up the amount that businesses are willing to pay to advertise.  People into those kinds of direction because they perform well. So it's good for everyone, but that's kind of how we think about that."

With the auto industry, the growth for us helping them figure out who their current customer are, what a potential customers are and why are the segments other have 7 likes interest background demographics to their current customers so that they can serve the right ad to the right people. I kind of thinks we're able to do with targeting and measurement apply across industries and obviously have been industry and vertical specific, and we're working hard on that."

Yes, the 2016 elections is a big deal in terms of ad spend, but so is the World Cup. So is the Super Bowl every year. So are events like . We are excited about the kind of targeting we're able to offer for our ads platform. We believe we have precision that doesn't exist on any other platforms. So for example, using Facebook and Instagram apps, you can target by Congressional district, can target by interest, you can target by demographics or any combination of those. And we're seeing politicians at all level really taking advantage of that targeting. It's also probably worth saying that we're pretty excited about what's happening with the elections organically on Facebook. Facebook's the new town hall. And connecting the people who are running for office, both at and national and the local level, with people directly has been really important. Every member of Congress in the United States is now on Facebook. We're seeing some of them post every vote and explain why they're doing votes. We're seeing a bunch of candidates for president get on Facebook themselves and interact, taking questions from their potential voters directly. And we think that kind of direct engagement where people can hold their elected officials accountable. And elected officials can speak directly to constituent is a really important part of our mission. And we're excited about the 2016 election and what's happening there."

I've never had a conversation with team where we were behind on mobile and I said, ""We need to do this to make money."" That's not really how we operate. What happened is we realized that mobile was growing faster than the stop and that people were shifting their usage and that it was a more important thing for people's consumer experience. And that's what we made a shift, not in our business for us, but in how we deliver their products. And I told all of my product teams, they come in for reviews come in with mobile. If you come in and try to show me a desktop product, then I'm going to kick you out. You have show me a mobile product. And that I think was just crude leadership tactic, somewhat effective in helping to motivate the organization to shift its energy towards focusing on mobile. But it was, if you remember, we actually went through a pretty tough period. Because we went through this period where our mobile experience was not as good as we wanted to be and we had no ads on mobile. And we actually prioritized making the mobile experience good before putting ads there. So there was a long time where people thought our business might not be as good because we had no ads on mobile. And that was because we always prioritized the experience for people above, even if it's going to be a painful thing for the company. So that's how I think about messaging. We know that messaging is going to be increasingly important. That's why we went out and hired David Marcus. He's one of the best product leaders in the field to run Messenger and when we bought WhatsApp, which is the leading messaging product worldwide. And we have a formula for how we build these businesses. First, you build a great consumer experience, like helps people share a new way, and it's really important. And then after that, you can start to introduce organic ways that people can interact with businesses. So that an Facebook is Pages, the businesses that people want to interact with, the public figures, the politicians, not necessarily as but organic interactions around not necessarily just your friends and families but more public figures and businesses. And once you have that ramped up to a good scale can you really start dialing up advertising and having that feel good and the good part of your experience with good content because all this public figures and businesses are already participating in the platform at scale. So you can expect to see that playbook in Instagram. We're pretty far along in terms of having quite a mature public content ecosystem. And ads are ramping with good high-quality ads because a lot of public figures and businesses are already investing and trading that kind of good content that goes in Facebook Instagram. And you're going to see the same playbook in Instagram and WhatsApp and making stuff that figures and that's a bit more of that in WhatsApp already in terms of Messenger and you're catching up on Messenger, but we'll do that on both and once we have the ecosystem built up, we'll build businesses around that. And that's how we think about stuff and we did in all parts and all the different things that we do going forward."

Overall, Q4 was a strong quarter and a great end to the year. More than 1.59 billion people now use Facebook each month and 1.04 billion every day, a growth of nearly 200 million people monthly and 148 million people daily this year. More than 1.44 billion people use Facebook on mobile devices. 
And when it comes to our business, we're also pleased with our continued growth. Total revenue grew by 52% year-over-year to more than $5.8 billion, and advertising revenues grew by 57% to reach more than $5.6 billion. But it's important to consider not just our business results, but also how we're improving the lives of people and communities around the world. Next week, Facebook celebrates its 12th birthday. And as I think about our progress and where we go from here, I have reflected on the diverse global moments that Facebook was involved in, in 2015. 
More than 950 million people received a notification that a friend or a loved one was safe in a crisis. Millions of people supported the people of Nepal after the earthquake and the people of France after the Paris attacks. More than 8 million people used 35,000 Groups and Pages on Facebook to support refugees. And people from all over the world connected around moments from Star Wars to the U.S. presidential election, from the Indian Super League to the Cricket World Cup. Seeing our global community connecting in all these ways shows the opportunities ahead as we connect the world but also the challenges. Even as the world has tended towards greater openness over time, in many communities, we also see greater fear over what a connected world and more technological progress means for them. Addressing these concerns is essential for making progress on our mission, and we're going to keep working to give as much voice as we can and advance the benefits of connectivity and bringing the world together. In 2016 and beyond, we're going to continue doing that by serving our community, working to bring connectivity to billions of people who are not yet connected and building new technologies that give people more ways to express themselves. 
Now let's talk about how we've continued working to do that, and let's start with how we're improving our existing products and businesses. Our strategy here is to deliver better, more engaging experiences for our community and to give people better tools for sharing different types of content with the different groups of people that they care about. Video is an important part of the Facebook experience, and continuing to invest here is important for allowing people to share and consume some of the most engaging content. We've continued to make progress and now, 100 million hours of video are watched daily on Facebook. We've been testing new experiences like Suggested Videos, which enables people to discover more videos they might be interested in. We're also exploring ways to give people a dedicated place on Facebook for when they just want to watch videos.
With other parts of our core, we've continued to focus on improving the performance and quality of our product to better serve different communities on Facebook, and these efforts are paying off, with growth and engagement for different products reaching an impressive scale. Now more than 500 million people use Events each month, and more than 123 million events were created on Facebook in 2015. 
For the first time, more than 1 billion people used Groups in a single month on Facebook. It's inspiring to see all the different communities using Groups from the small family and classroom and church groups to the large ones, like the Running Challenge group that I started a few weeks ago that now has about 100,000 members. 
To serve our entire global community, we're optimizing our services for people in developing countries. We've improved Facebook Lite to offer better experience in low-bandwidth environments, improving load times and adding features like video. More than 80 million people now use Facebook Lite as of December. And when it comes to serving businesses, we've continued to focus on creating better ads and tools for our more than 2.5 million active advertisers. More than 50 million small businesses now use Pages on Facebook, and people post more than 2.5 billion comments on these pages each month. It's a good example of how the strength and engagement of our community is making Facebook more valuable for businesses every day, and Sheryl's going to talk more about this in a minute.
Next, let's talk about how we're building our next generation of services. With Instagram, we've continued to drive the shift towards more visual content online. The community continues to grow, and back in September, we announced the new milestone of 400 million monthly actives. Over the last year, as the community has grown, we focused on building engaging new experiences for the community, including by improving search and by introducing trending content. We've also worked to develop new experiences to give people more options for creating and sharing different types of content. In March, we launched the Layout app, allowing people to easily combine images. And in October, the team also launched Boomerang, an app for making looping videos, which reached #1 in the App Store in more than 70 countries. We also introduced a new video channel on Instagram for people to watch moments from big events like New Year's or the college football championship as they happen. 
With Messenger and WhatsApp, we've continued to make progress with building these into valuable communication services for everyone in the world. More than 800 million people now use Messenger monthly, and in 2015, we grew that number by almost 0.25 billion while also increasing engagement. We continue to give people new ways to communicate by introducing video calling and new options for customizing conversations with fun things like colors and Emoji and by using apps to the Messenger platform. We also worked to expand Messenger's utility by adding Payments, a new way to connect with businesses; and by testing M, a digital assistant powered by AI. In this quarter, we also began testing a transportation platform, allowing people to request an Uber ride through Messenger. More services will be coming to the platform soon, including airlines.
WhatsApp ended the year with nearly 1 billion monthly actives. As WhatsApp has grown, we worked to keep it fast, simple and reliable. And we've seen many communities come to depend on this as their main communication service. To serve these communities well, this month, we announced that WhatsApp will now be free to everyone and will no longer charge subscription fees that many people were charged after their first year. We think this is an important step towards creating an even more ubiquitous product without affecting our plans for building WhatsApp into an important business in the coming years. Later this year, we'll be testing new ways for people to use WhatsApp to communicate with businesses and organizations that they want to hear from.
Finally, let's talk about our work on new breakthrough technologies that can help connect more people to the Internet and create transformative new experiences. In 2015, we made significant progress on our efforts to connect more people to the Internet. We launched the first trial of Express WiFi, a product designed to help entrepreneurs bring their communities online. We launched Free Basics in 33 more countries, and we've now connected 19 million people. This year, we expect to hold our first test flight of Aquila, our first solar-powered aircraft designed to beam Internet into communities from the sky. And we're also working on new advances in lasers that can transfer large amounts of data faster and more efficiently than anything today.
With our work in AI, we continue to make progress towards a new generation of computers that can see and understand. Over the last year, we published dozens of research papers, including some of the leading work on image recognition and language understanding. To drive the entire AI community forward, we've also open-sourced software and allotted new AI hardware platform. Achieving the scientific breakthroughs to build AI that makes a dramatic visible difference in people's lives, it's going to take a long time, but already we're seeing opportunities to serve our community. We recently built a prototype AI system that combines language and vision comprehension, so you can show it an image that it's never seen before and it can answer questions about that image. And we've even used AI to help blind people experience their friends' photos and News Feed by describing the scenes.
With virtual reality, we've reached some important milestones. The Samsung Gear VR shipped over the holidays with our Oculus software, and we're pleased with the initial reaction. This month, we also opened preorders for Oculus headsets. This will be the world's best VR experience, and we're excited to begin shipping to people in more than 20 countries before the end of March. More than 100 VR games and experiences are coming to Oculus this year. And later this year, we'll also be shipping our Oculus touch controllers to get your hands into virtual reality. These controllers will enhance the VR experience and allow people to communicate more naturally in VR through intuitive hand movements and gestures. This Oculus launch is shaping up to be a big moment for the gaming community, but over the long term, VR has the potential to change the way that we live, work and communicate as well. The launch is an important step towards the future, and we're really looking forward to seeing how people use it.
So that's how we've continued to make progress on our strategy. It's been a strong quarter, and we ended 2015 with a great foundation for our efforts going into 2016. Our strategy is working, and we have many more opportunities ahead. So we're going to continue investing to deliver more great results over the long term.
On a more personal note, over the last few months with the new addition in my family, I've been reflecting a lot on the legacy that we want to pass on to the next generation. I'm excited about our progress and the chance to build something great for the future. If we continue to focus on solving the fundamental challenges facing the world and bringing the world closer together, we can leave a better world for the whole next generation. And that's what I think about every day as we continue building Facebook. And I want to thank everyone in our community, our employees, our shareholders, our partners who are helping us on this journey. Thanks, and here's Sheryl."

We had a terrific fourth quarter capping off a great 2015. Q4 ad revenue grew 57% or 66% on a constant-currency basis. Mobile ad revenue reached $4.5 billion, up 81% year-over-year and is now 80% of total ad revenue.
Facebook and Instagram drive business results for our partners, helping move products off shelves online and off. As a result, we're growing spend from our current clients and attracting new marketers to our platform. We saw strong growth across all verticals, marketer segments and regions. We're also pleased with the growth we're seeing in emerging markets and countries like China, where businesses are advertising on Facebook and Instagram to reach people internationally. We continue to make progress on our 3 priorities: capitalizing on the shift to mobile, growing the number of marketers using our ad products and making our ads more relevant and effective.
First, capitalizing on the shift to mobile. Heading into 2016, it's clear that consumers have shifted to mobile, and businesses know they need to catch up. Marketers now realize that if they want to reach their customers where they are, mobile is essential. Our conversations with clients have shifted from if they should market on mobile to how. With over 1.44 billion people using Facebook on mobile monthly and over 400 million monthly actives on Instagram, Facebook and Instagram have become the 2 most important mobile advertising platforms. We provide a creative canvas powered by technology, a unique combination of art and science that marketers can use to deliver great creatives with the highest quality targeting at unparalleled scale.
The 2015 holiday season was a defining moment for mobile marketing and demonstrated the power of our mobile platform. According to comScore, total U.S. consumer spending on mobile in November and December was up 59% year-over-year. This holiday season, marketers turned to mobile more than ever before. To reach a large mobile audience for the launch of Halo 5, Microsoft Xbox used video optimized for Facebook and Instagram. Working with their agencies and power media team from Dentsu Aegis Network, Ayzenberg Group and Twofifteen McCann, they understood that people watch video differently and mobile News Feed than on TV. So they created videos to capture audience attention in the first 3 seconds even without sound. They drove over 380 million impressions and 49 million video views in key markets and increased purchase intent by 10 points in the U.S.
Our second priority is growing the number of marketers using our ad products. Last quarter, we announced that we had over 2.5 million active advertisers, and since then, our growth has remained strong. This represents a small fraction of the over 50 million small businesses now actively using Pages, so we see a big opportunity to continue to grow the number of Facebook advertises going forward. We're also very pleased with the growth in advertiser adoption of Instagram and the positive results that advertisers are seeing from their investments. 98 of the top 100 advertisers on Facebook also advertised on Instagram in Q4.
Our third priority is improving the relevance and effectiveness of our ads. We shipped a lot of new ad products this past year. These products help deliver personalized marketing at scale and drive business for our clients. Leading up to Black Friday, Shop Direct, the U.K.'s second largest online retailer, teased upcoming sales with a cinemagraph video to build awareness. They then retargeted people who saw the video with 1-day-only deals. On Black Friday, they used our Carousel and DPA ads to promote products people had shown interest in. They saw a 20x return on ad spend from this campaign, helping them achieve their biggest Black Friday and their most successful sales day ever. 
To share just a few other product examples, in emerging markets, we launched Slideshow, a video-like ad experience that works with lower connection speeds and feature phones. We introduced local awareness ads globally to help brick-and-mortar businesses reach people near their stores and started testing Canvas ads to help marketers showcase their products in a more immersive way. We continue to invest in ad tech and are especially pleased with the growth of Audience Network. 
Measurement also remains a critical area of focus. Our measurement tools like conversion lift and the Facebook pixel proved to marketers that we're driving business results and help make our ads more relevant. This year, we saw more advertisers shift from proxy metrics like clicks to business results like digital and in-store sales. Our results show that the investments we've made over the past few years are paying off, and we see a lot of exciting opportunities ahead. We know we still have a lot of hard work to do. And heading into the new year, we will remain very focused on our top 3 priorities.
I want to take this opportunity to thank our clients around the world for their partnership. Your investment and feedback is critical to making our products better. I also really want to thank the global Facebook teams for your extraordinary dedication to our partner success. Your hard work and execution is critical to helping us fulfill our mission. Thanks, everyone, and now here's Dave."

Q4 was a strong quarter and wrapped up a phenomenal year for Facebook. Full year 2015 revenue was $17.9 billion, up 44% year-over-year or 53% on a constant-currency basis. In 2015, we generated over $6 billion in free cash flow, including $2.1 billion in Q4, while continuing to fund important investments for the future growth of the business. The strong growth and engagement of our community was a consistent theme throughout 2015 and that continued in the fourth quarter. In December, 1.04 billion people used Facebook on an average day, an increase of 17% compared to last year. This daily number represented 65% of the 1.59 billion people who visited Facebook during the month of December.
Mobile continued to drive the growth of our community. In December, 1.44 billion people accessed Facebook on mobile devices, an increase of 21% compared to last year. And 90% of the people who used Facebook on both a monthly and daily basis accessed us via mobile devices.
Now turning to the financials. All of our comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. Additionally, our non-GAAP measures exclude stock-based compensation and the amortization of intangible.
In Q4, total revenue was $5.8 billion, up 52% or 60% on a constant-currency basis. Q4 ad revenue was $5.6 billion, up over $2 billion from last year. Year-over-year growth was 57% or 66% on a constant-currency basis.
The strengthening of the U.S. dollar continued to have an unfavorable impact on our revenue in the fourth quarter. Had exchange rates remained constant with Q4 2014 levels, our total revenue would have been approximately $320 million higher.
U.S. and Canada and Asia Pacific continued to be our 2 strongest regions with ad revenue growth of 64% and 57%, respectively. Our rest of world and Europe regions grew at 53% and 45%, respectively, as they were more heavily impacted by currency headwinds.
Mobile ad revenue was $4.5 billion, up 81% from last year and represented 80% of our advertising revenue. For perspective, 3 years ago, the mobile percentage was just over 20%. Q4 capped off a remarkably successful year for our mobile advertising business where we were able to combine strong growth in ad inventory supply with strong growth in advertiser demand. 
On the supply side, we grew the number of people using Facebook on mobile, time spent and ad load. Our ongoing focus on ad quality and relevance enabled us to deliver a better overall mobile ads experience for our users while increasing the number of ads they see. In Q4, we also benefited to a lesser extent from increases in ad inventory from Instagram and the Audience Network.
On the demand side, we believe our efforts on targeting and measurement solution enabled marketers to achieve better business results at better values. This helped us drive strong growth from a broad array of advertisers, including direct response and brand advertisers, large companies and SMBs and both existing and new advertisers. 
Turning now to the overall price volume metrics. In Q4, the average price per ad increased 21%, while total ad impressions increased 29% on a year-over-year basis. It's worth noting that this was the first quarter since Q3 2013 that total ad impressions increased on a year-over-year basis. This was driven by an increase in mobile ad impressions and was partially offset by a decline in ad impressions delivered on personal computers, consistent with the ongoing declines in PC usage. The reported increase in price is being driven by the continued mix shift towards mobile, which contains higher-priced News Feed ads, rather than the mix we have on PCs of both News Feed ads and lower-priced, right-hand column ads.
Total Payments and other fees revenue was $204 million, down 21% compared to last year. The decline was driven by a reduction in Payments revenue related to games played on personal computers.
Turning now to expenses. Q4 total GAAP expenses were $3.3 billion, up 21%; and non-GAAP expenses were $2.3 billion, up 42%. Our year-over-year GAAP expense growth rate slowed this quarter as we lapped the introduction of stock-based compensation charges associated with the WhatsApp transaction. Non-GAAP expenses were driven by increases in headcount-related costs, cost of revenue and marketing expenses. We ended the year with nearly 12,700 employees, up 38% compared to last year.
Our GAAP operating margin was -- or sorry, GAAP operating income was approximately $2.6 billion, representing a 44% operating margin. Our non-GAAP operating income was $3.5 billion, representing a 60% operating margin. 
Our Q4 GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were 39% and 36%, respectively. Our Q4 GAAP net income was approximately $1.6 billion or $0.54 per share, and our non-GAAP net income was $2.3 billion or $0.79 per share. In the full year 2015, capital expenditures were $2.5 billion as we continued to invest in servers, data centers, network infrastructure and office facilities to support the rapid growth of the business. We ended the year with over $18.4 billion in cash and investments.
Turning now to the outlook. First, some color on revenue. We expect the factors that drove the strong growth of our advertising business in 2015 will continue into 2016. However, we expect to continue to face foreign exchange headwinds, especially early in the year, as we will be lapping periods where the dollar was relatively weaker than it is today. More importantly -- sorry, more broadly, the overall macro environment introduces a level of uncertainty around global growth and exchange rates that could impact our business in 2016. And we do expect to face tougher comparables as the year progresses, given the remarkably strong advertising performance in 2015.
Turning now to expense guidance. 2016 will be another significant investment year for Facebook. In 2015, we continued investing heavily in the core. At the same time, we doubled our investment levels in our next-generation services, which includes WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger. And we tripled our investment levels in our long-term areas of focus, which includes our connectivity efforts, Oculus and our AI investments. We will continue investing significantly in all of these areas in 2016.
We expect the year-over-year growth rate for full year 2016 total GAAP expenses to be approximately 30% to 40% and for full year 2016 total non-GAAP expenses to be approximately 45% to 55%. Note these ranges represent total operating expenses -- sorry, including cost of revenue. These ranges also include the cost of revenue impact of the expected shipments of Oculus Rift that we expect that impact to be immaterial to our overall total expenses for the year.
We anticipate our 2016 capital expenditures will be in the range of $4 billion to $4.5 billion. We recently announced that we will begin building a new data center in Clonee, Ireland, and that project is on top of the new data center being built in Fort Worth, Texas.
We expect our 2016 stock-based compensation to be in the range of $3.1 billion to $3.3 billion, approximately half of which is related to our prior acquisitions, most notably WhatsApp. We expect 2016 amortization expenses to be approximately $700 million to $800 million. 
And lastly, we anticipate that our Q1 and full year 2016 GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates to be in the low 30s on a percentage basis, down from our 2015 rates. We expect our tax rates will decline further over time and resemble those of our global peers over the next several years. In addition, in 2016, we expect for the first time to pay a significant amount of U.S. income tax on a cash basis.
To conclude, 2015 was an outstanding year for Facebook. Our performance reflects the strong growth and engagement of our community, the momentum we're seeing in our ads business and the significant progress we're making on our mission to connect the world.
With that, Chris, we would like to open up the call for questions."

And we went through this process of integrating that and making sure that it integrated with all these systems well.

Instagram -- and we're pleased with the growth on Instagram. And as I mentioned, 98 of our top 100 advertisers on Facebook are now advertising on Instagram. It's also the case that Facebook grew remarkably -- had remarkably strong growth as well. So we're seeing strong growth across the platforms. I think what's exciting about both platforms is that they combine the art and the science of both a creative canvas that marketers are excited about and targeting. So to share another example from the holiday, Shutterfly did a Facebook and Instagram, both a brand and direct response holiday campaign on mobile. And what they did was just beautiful pictures but also targeting very specifically to women with specific interests, such as things like weddings and babies. And they saw a 6.4x return on ad spend. We think that's what's possible when you combine the creative canvas we have, using the technology and using the platform that we've created."

But overall, I mean, the reason why we're interested in this is the social company is that we think that this is going to be a new way that people interact. Right? And if you've tried out the Toybox demo with the hands, Oculus Touch, what you see is when you're in virtual reality with another person and you can interact with the environment and use your hands, you can -- it's not just about where you are and the fact that you can instantaneously teleport to another place, it's just -- you can interact with people in all these different ways that would be very difficult in the rest of the world.

And we won, and we tell our clients we want to be the best dollar, the best euro, the best pound and the best minute you spend.

We need to build really compelling ad products with great formats that let marketers be creative and be convincing. I'll share an example of something we did for an emerging market. I've mentioned briefly in my remarks Slideshow. The Slideshow product is -- enabled a video-like experience with phones with lower connection speeds and feature phones by a series of photos. So Coca-Cola used that in Kenya and Nigeria. They took screen shots of a video ad they had produced for other markets. They uploaded them with text, and it reached 2 million people with a 10-point lift in ad awareness. So the way we need to drive sales around the world is by understanding markets, launching things like click to missed call ads in India and making sure our products work for markets, but also being able to connect to those advertising metrics and business metrics around the world. Video ads are important on our platform. And the most important thing that's growing well there is consumer engagement with video is growing. We have 500 million people watching video a day. And the fact that so much video is being consumed on our platform gives us room for an ads business to grow because we want the formats to match. Marketers also really love video, and it's a really compelling way to reach people and video is contributing to our growth. It's important to note that it's not just large brand advertisers that are doing video but all of our market segments: direct response; SMBs who have uploaded 1.5 million videos, and that's both organic and paid in the last month; and developers. The video ad spend is not all incremental, of course, because every time we put an ad in News Feed, if it's a video ad, it's taking the place of an ad with another format. In terms of learnings, one of the most important learnings we have is that video formats are different on Facebook. There are certainly people that are watching the whole 30-second video ad with sound, but there are some people that are doing less. They're watching shorter formats, and they're watching with sound. And one of the challenges we have in the market is convincing marketers and agencies and people that make the video to experiment with different formats. The good news is that we're getting great results like the Halo 5 example I shared in my remarks, that when people are willing to experiment, this is a pretty unique creative canvas. You can do short form with sound off. You can do longer form with sound on and everything in between. And our ability to persuade marketers to experiment is going to be a major driver of how much we can do here."

Through [ph] app percentage, we can monetize that. We'll see, but we certainly think that we will continue to benefit from the consumer shift to mobile because businesses are behind. If you ask even our largest clients, our largest clients, if they draw a pie chart of where their consumer spend their time and money and whether they spend their time and money, we are still underindexed. That said, I'll say it again, we have a lot of hard work to do. We really need to prove to clients, particularly as they scale and we become a bigger part of their spend, that we're driving results. Other platforms, other forms of advertising like TV and other, have very established metrics that people have believed for a very long time. We think our targeting can be better than any other platform. We also believe our ability to measure results can be deeper, but it's up to us to prove that and to prove that client to client. It's also worth noting that we work really well with TV. It's not always the choice of TV or Facebook, but often, we can be a compliment. We've done a bunch of work with Nielsen to measure what happens when marketers do big TV campaigns and do campaigns that are broadly targeted on Facebook, and we are able to increase the reach and increase brand favorability. So for the most part when people are doing big campaigns, they're doing them across multiple platforms, and we think that will continue."

We are working with publishers to try to make that content experience better inside of News Feed. The best example of that is probably news with Instant Articles where we figured out that it was the slowest upload experience you could have in News Feed to link off to an outside articles. So we've worked with publishers to upload more news articles natively to Facebook, and we're seeing great engagement from that. Similarly, we had conversations with makers of premium content. I think they're excited by the work they already do with us to use Facebook to distribute their content, and we're interested in doing more.

So Reactions is going to roll out on every platform. We're testing it in a handful of countries to start just to make sure that we have the UI and interaction simple enough that people could express more of what they wanted without getting in their way. It is adding a little bit of complexity to something that is very simple today, just a 1-tap Like button. But the philosophy behind it is that when you only have a Like button, if you share a sad piece of content or something that makes you angry, people may not have the tool to react to it. And therefore, over time, the community feels less comfortable sharing that kind of content on Facebook. And we want people to be able to share all of the things that are meaningful to them, not just the things that are happy and that people are going to like when they see it. And we think that, that's just really important to the mission of the company and will increase engagement and sharing and openness and all of the things that we care about. And so far, I think the -- there are few tweaks that we needed to make to Reactions since initially testing it, but it's going well and I think we plan to roll it out everywhere pretty soon. So that's the game plan there. On Payments, the basic strategy that we have is to make it, especially in products like Messenger that -- where the business interaction may be a bit more transactional, to take all the friction out of making the transactions that you need. So we don't view ourselves as a payments business. That's not the type of company that we are. We'll partner with everyone who does payments. When you look at the stuff that Apple is doing with Apple Pay, for example, a really neat innovation in the space that takes a lot of friction out of transactions as well. And our view is that the less friction, the better the user experience, the more people can easily interact with the businesses that they care about. And ultimately, for our business, that will drive up the amount that businesses are willing to pay to advertise to send people into those kind of interactions because they perform well. So it's good for everyone, but that's kind of how we think about that."

With the auto industry, a really important industry for growth for us, helping them figure out who their current customers are, who their potential customers are and where are the audience segments out there who have similar likes, interest, background demographics to their current customers so that they can serve the right ad to the right people.

Yes, the 2016 elections is a big deal in terms of ad spend, but so is the World Cup, so is Super Bowl every year, so are events like the Olympics. We are excited about the kind of targeting we're able to offer for our ads platform. We believe we have precision that doesn't exist on any other platforms. So for example, using Facebook and Instagram ads, you can target by congressional district. You can target by interests. You can target by demographics or any combination of those. And we're seeing politicians at all level really take advantage of that targeting. It's also probably worth saying that we're pretty excited about what's happening with the elections organically on Facebook. Facebook's really the new town hall. And connecting the people who are running for office, both at the national and the local level, with people directly has been really important. Every member of congress in the United States is now on Facebook. We're seeing some of them post every vote and explain why they're doing votes. We're seeing a bunch of candidates for president get on Facebook themselves and interact, taking questions from their potential voters directly. And we think that kind of direct engagement where people can hold their elected officials accountable and elected officials can speak directly to constituents is a really important part of our mission.

In terms of the story that you said, I think you have it wrong. I don't know where you got that story from. I never had a conversation with the team where we were behind on mobile and then I said, ""We need to do this to make money."" That's not really how we operate. What happened is we realized that mobile was growing faster than desktop and that people were shifting their usage and that it was the more important thing for people's consumer experience. And that's when we made the shift, not in our business first, but in how we develop the product. And I told all of our product teams, when they come in for reviews, really just come in with mobile. If you come in and you try to show me a desktop product, then I'm going to kick you out. You have to come in and show me a mobile product. And that, I think, was just to the crude leadership tactic, somewhat effective in helping to motivate the organization to shift its energy towards focusing on mobile. But it was -- if you remember, we actually went through a pretty tough period. Because we went through this period where our mobile experience was not as good as we wanted to be, and we had no ads on mobile. And we actually prioritized making the mobile experience good before putting ads in. So there was a long time where people thought that our business might not be as good because we had no ads on mobile, and that was because we always prioritized the experience for people above, even if it's going to be a painful thing for the company. So that's how I think about messaging. We know that messaging is going to be increasingly important. That's why we went out and hired David Marcus, who is one of the best product leaders in the field to run Messenger and why we bought WhatsApp, which is the leading messaging product worldwide. And we have a formula for how we build these businesses. First, you build a great consumer experience, right, that helps people share in a new way. That's really important. Then after that, you can start to introduce organic ways that people can interact with businesses. So that -- in Facebook, it's Pages, the businesses that people want to interact with, the public figures, the politicians, not necessarily add, but organic interactions around not necessarily just your friends and families but more public figures and businesses. And then only once you have that ramped up to a good scale can you really start dialing up advertising and having that feel good and be a good part of the experience with good content because all those public figures and businesses are already participating in the platform at scale. So you can expect to see that playbook. In Instagram, we're pretty far along in terms of having a -- quite a mature public content ecosystem. And ads are ramping well with good high-quality ads because a lot of public figures and businesses are already investing and creating that kind of good content that goes in Instagram. And you're going to see the same playbook in Messenger and WhatsApp in terms of making stuff [ph] that are organic businesses and public figures. There's a bit more of that on WhatsApp already in terms of the businesses using it. And on Messenger, we are catching up on Messenger, but we'll do that on both. And once we have those ecosystems built out, we'll build businesses around them. And that's how we think about stuff, and we'll do that in all of our products and the different things that we do going forward."

Overall, Q4 was a strong quarter and a great end to the year. More than 1.59 billion people now use Facebook each month and 1.04 billion every day or growth of nearly 200 million people monthly and 148 million people daily this year. More than 1.44 billion people use Facebook on mobile devices. 
And when it comes to our business, we're also pleased with our continued growth. Total revenue grew by 52% year-over-year to more than $5.8 billion, and advertising revenues grew by 57% to reach more than $5.6 billion. But it's important to consider not just our business results, but also how we're improving the lives of people and communities around the world. Next week, Facebook celebrates its 12th birthday. And as I think about our progress and where we go from here, I have reflected on the diverse global moments that Facebook was involved in, in 2015. 
More than 950 million people received a notification that a friend or a loved one was safe in a crisis. Millions of people supported the people of Nepal after the earthquake and the people of France after the Paris attacks. More than 8 million people used 35,000 Groups and Pages on Facebook to support refugees. And people from all over the world connected around moments from Star Wars to the U.S. presidential election, from the Indian Super League to the Cricket World Cup. Seeing our global community connecting in all these ways shows the opportunities ahead as we connect the world but also the challenges. Even as the world has tended towards greater openness over time, in many communities, we also see greater fear over what a connected world and more technological progress means for them. Addressing these concerns is essential for making progress on our mission, and we're going to keep working to give as much voice as we can and advance the benefits of connectivity and bringing the world together. In 2016 and beyond, we're going to continue doing that by serving our community, working to bring connectivity to billions of people who are not yet connected and building new technologies that give people more ways to express themselves. 
Now let's talk about how we've continued working to do that, and let's start with how we're improving our existing products and businesses. Our strategy here is to deliver better, more engaging experiences for our community and to give people better tools for sharing different types of content with the different groups of people that they care about. Video is an important part of the Facebook experience, and continuing to invest here is important for allowing people to share and consume some of the most engaging content. We've continued to make progress and now, 100 million hours of video are watched daily on Facebook. We've been testing new experiences like Suggested Videos, which enables people to discover more videos they might be interested in. We're also exploring ways to give people a dedicated place on Facebook for when they just want to watch videos.
With other parts of our core, we've continued to focus on improving the performance and quality of our product to better serve different communities on Facebook, and these efforts are paying off, with growth in engagement for different products reaching an impressive scale. Now more than 500 million people use Events each month, and more than 123 million events were created on Facebook in 2015. 
For the first time, more than 1 billion people used Groups in a single month on Facebook. It's inspiring to see all the different communities using Groups from the small family and classroom and church groups to the large ones, like the Running Challenge group that I started a few weeks ago that now has about 100,000 members. 
To serve our entire global community, we're optimizing our services for people in developing countries. We've improved Facebook Lite to offer better experience in low-bandwidth environments, improving load times and adding features like video. More than 80 million people now use Facebook Lite as of December. And when it comes to serving businesses, we've continued to focus on creating better ads and tools for our more than 2.5 million active advertisers. More than 50 million small businesses now use Pages on Facebook, and people post more than 2.5 billion comments on these pages each month. This is a good example of how the strength and engagement of our community is making Facebook more valuable for businesses every day, and Sheryl's going to talk more about this in a minute.
Next, let's talk about how we're building our next generation of services. With Instagram, we've continued to drive the shift towards more visual content online. The community continues to grow, and back in September, we announced the new milestone of 400 million monthly actives. Over the last year, as the community has grown, we've focused on building engaging new experiences for the community, including by improving search and by introducing trending content. We've also worked to develop new experiences to give people more options for creating and sharing different types of content. In March, we launched the Layout app, allowing people to easily combine images. And in October, the team also launched Boomerang, an app for making looping videos, which reached #1 in the App Store in more than 70 countries. We also introduced a new video channel on Instagram for people to watch moments from big events like New Year's or the college football championship as they happen. 
With Messenger and WhatsApp, we've continued to make progress with building these into valuable communication services for everyone in the world. More than 800 million people now use Messenger monthly, and in 2015, we grew that number by almost 0.25 billion while also increasing engagement. We continued to give people new ways to communicate by introducing video calling and new options for customizing conversations with fun things like colors and Emoji and by using apps through the Messenger platform. We also worked to expand Messenger's utility by adding Payments, a new way to connect with businesses; and by testing M, a digital assistant powered by AI. In this quarter, we also began testing a transportation platform, allowing people to request an Uber ride through Messenger. More services will be coming to the platform soon, including airlines.
WhatsApp ended the year with nearly 1 billion monthly actives. As WhatsApp has grown, we've worked to keep it fast, simple and reliable. And we've seen many communities come to depend on this as their main communication service. To serve these communities well, this month, we announced that WhatsApp will now be free to everyone and will no longer charge the subscription fees that many people were charged after their first year. We think this is an important step towards creating an even more ubiquitous product without affecting our plans for building WhatsApp into an important business in the coming years. Later this year, we'll be testing new ways for people to use WhatsApp to communicate with businesses and organizations that they want to hear from.
Finally, let's talk about our work on new breakthrough technologies that can help connect more people to the Internet and create transformative new experiences. In 2015, we made significant progress on our efforts to connect more people to the Internet. We've launched the first trials of Express WiFi, a product designed to help entrepreneurs bring their communities online. We launched Free Basics in 33 more countries, and we've now connected 19 million people. This year, we expect to hold our first test flight of Aquila, our first solar-powered aircraft designed to beam Internet into communities from the sky. And we're also working on new advances in lasers that can transfer large amounts of data faster and more efficiently than anything today.
With our work in AI, we continue to make progress towards a new generation of computers that can see and understand. Over the last year, we've published dozens of research papers, including some of the leading work on image recognition and language understanding. To drive the entire AI community forward, we've also open-sourced software and allotted a new AI hardware platform. Achieving the scientific breakthroughs to build AI that makes a dramatic visible difference in people's lives, it's going to take a long time, but already we're seeing opportunities to serve our community. We recently built a prototype AI system that combines language and vision comprehension, so you can show it an image that it's never seen before and it can answer questions about that image. And we've even used AI to help blind people experience their friends' photos and News Feed by describing the scenes.
With virtual reality, we've reached some important milestones. The Samsung Gear VR shipped over the holidays with our Oculus software, and we're pleased with the initial reaction. This month, we also opened preorders for Oculus headsets. This will be the world's best VR experience, and we're excited to begin shipping to people in more than 20 countries before the end of March. More than 100 VR games and experiences are coming to Oculus this year. And later this year, we'll also be shipping our Oculus touch controllers to get your hands into virtual reality. These controllers will enhance the VR experience and allow people to communicate more naturally in VR through intuitive hand movements and gestures. This Oculus launch is shaping up to be a big moment for the gaming community, but over the long term, VR has the potential to change the way that we live, work and communicate as well. The launch is an important step towards the future, and we're really looking forward to seeing how people use it.
So that's how we've continued to make progress on our strategy. It's been a strong quarter, and we ended 2015 with a great foundation for our efforts going into 2016. Our strategy is working, and we have many more opportunities ahead. So we're going to continue investing to deliver more great results over the long term.
On a more personal note, over the last few months with the new addition in my family, I've been reflecting a lot on the legacy that we want to pass on to the next generation. I'm excited about our progress and the chance to build something great for the future. If we continue to focus on solving the fundamental challenges facing the world and bringing the world closer together, we can leave a better world for the whole next generation. And that's what I think about every day as we continue building Facebook. And I want to thank everyone in our community, our employees, our shareholders, our partners who are helping us on this journey. Thanks, and here's Sheryl."

We had a terrific fourth quarter capping off a great 2015. Q4 ad revenue grew 57% or 66% on a constant-currency basis. Mobile ad revenue reached $4.5 billion, up 81% year-over-year and is now 80% of total ad revenue.
Facebook and Instagram drive business results for our partners, helping move products off shelves online and off. As a result, we're growing spend from our current clients and attracting new marketers to our platform. We saw strong growth across all verticals, marketer segments and regions. We're also pleased with the growth we're seeing in emerging markets and countries like China, where businesses are advertising on Facebook and Instagram to reach people internationally. We continue to make progress on our 3 priorities: capitalizing on the shift to mobile, growing the number of marketers using our ad products and making our ads more relevant and effective.
First, capitalizing on the shift to mobile. Heading into 2016, it's clear that consumers have shifted to mobile, and businesses know they need to catch up. Marketers now realize that if they want to reach their customers where they are, mobile is essential. Our conversations with clients have shifted from if they should market on mobile to how. With over 1.44 billion people using Facebook on mobile monthly and over 400 million monthly actives on Instagram, Facebook and Instagram have become the 2 most important mobile advertising platforms. We provide a creative canvas powered by technology, a unique combination of art and science that marketers can use to deliver great creatives with the highest quality targeting at unparalleled scale.
The 2015 holiday season was a defining moment for mobile marketing and demonstrated the power of our mobile platform. According to comScore, total U.S. consumer spending on mobile in November and December was up 59% year-over-year. This holiday season, marketers turned to mobile more than ever before. To reach a large global audience for the launch of Halo 5, Microsoft Xbox used video optimized for Facebook and Instagram. Working with their agencies and power media team from Dentsu Aegis Network, Ayzenberg Group and Twofifteen McCann, they understood that people watch video differently in mobile News Feed than on TV. So they created videos to capture audience attention in the first 3 seconds even without sound. They drove over 380 million impressions and 49 million video views in key markets and increased purchase intent by 10 points in the U.S.
Our second priority is growing the number of marketers using our ad products. Last quarter, we announced that we had over 2.5 million active advertisers, and since then, our growth has remained strong. This represents a small fraction of the over 50 million small businesses now actively using Pages, so we see a big opportunity to continue to grow the number of Facebook advertises going forward. We're also very pleased with the growth in advertiser adoption of Instagram and the positive results that advertisers are seeing from their investments. 98 of the top 100 advertisers on Facebook also advertised on Instagram in Q4.
Our third priority is improving the relevance and effectiveness of our ads. We shipped a lot of new ad products this past year. These products help deliver personalized marketing at scale and drive business for our clients. Leading up to Black Friday, Shop Direct, the U.K.'s second largest online retailer, teased upcoming sales with a cinemagraph video to build awareness. They then retargeted people who saw the video with 1-day-only deals. On Black Friday, they used our Carousel and DPA ads to promote products people had shown interest in. They saw a 20x return on ad spend from this campaign, helping them achieve their biggest Black Friday and their most successful sales day ever. 
To share just a few other product examples, in emerging markets, we launched Slideshow, a video-like ad experience that works with lower connection speeds and feature phones. We introduced local awareness ads globally to help brick-and-mortar businesses reach people near their stores and started testing Canvas ads to help marketers showcase their products in a more immersive way. We continue to invest in ad tech and are especially pleased with the growth of Audience Network. 
Measurement also remains a critical area of focus. Our measurement tools like conversion lift and the Facebook pixel prove to marketers that we're driving business results and help make our ads more relevant. This year, we saw more advertisers shift from proxy metrics like clicks to business results like digital and in-store sales. Our results show that the investments we've made over the past few years are paying off, and we see a lot of exciting opportunities ahead. We know we still have a lot of hard work to do. And heading into the new year, we will remain very focused on our top 3 priorities.
I want to take this opportunity to thank our clients around the world for their partnership. Your investment and feedback is critical to making our products better. I also really want to thank the global Facebook teams for your extraordinary dedication to our partners' success. Your hard work and execution is critical to helping us fulfill our mission. Thanks, everyone, and now here's Dave."
20765463,321233779,921989,"Facebook, Inc., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 27, 2016",2016-01-27,"Earnings Calls","Meta Platforms, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Sheryl, and good afternoon, everyone. Q4 was a strong quarter and wrapped up a phenomenal year for Facebook. Full year 2015 revenue was $17.9 billion, up 44% year-over-year or 53% on a constant-currency basis. In 2015, we generated over $6 billi",1319,"Thanks, Sheryl, and good afternoon, everyone. 
Q4 was a strong quarter and wrapped up a phenomenal year for Facebook. Full year 2015 revenue was $17.9 billion, up 44% year-over-year or 53% on a constant-currency basis. In 2015, we generated over $6 billion in free cash flow, including $2.1 billion in Q4, while continuing to fund important investments for the future growth of the business. The strong growth and engagement of our community was a consistent theme throughout 2015 and that continued in the fourth quarter. In December, 1.04 billion people used Facebook on an average day, an increase of 17% compared to last year. This daily number represented 65% of the 1.59 billion people who visited Facebook during the month of December.
Mobile continued to drive the growth of our community. In December, 1.44 billion people accessed Facebook on mobile devices, an increase of 21% compared to last year. And 90% of the people who used Facebook on both a monthly and daily basis accessed us via mobile devices.
Now turning to the financials. All of our comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. Additionally, our non-GAAP measures exclude stock-based compensation and the amortization of intangibles.
In Q4, total revenue was $5.8 billion, up 52% or 60% on a constant-currency basis. Q4 ad revenue was $5.6 billion, up over $2 billion from last year. Year-over-year growth was 57% or 66% on a constant-currency basis.
The strengthening of the U.S. dollar continued to have an unfavorable impact on our revenue in the fourth quarter. Had exchange rates remained constant with Q4 2014 levels, our total revenue would have been approximately $320 million higher.
U.S. and Canada and Asia Pacific continued to be our 2 strongest regions with ad revenue growth of 64% and 57%, respectively. Our rest of world and Europe regions grew at 53% and 45%, respectively, as they were more heavily impacted by currency headwinds.
Mobile ad revenue was $4.5 billion, up 81% from last year and represented 80% of our advertising revenue. For perspective, 3 years ago, the mobile percentage was just over 20%. Q4 capped off a remarkably successful year for our mobile advertising business where we were able to combine strong growth in ad inventory supply with strong growth in advertiser demand. 
On the supply side, we grew the number of people using Facebook on mobile, time spent and ad load. Our ongoing focus on ad quality and relevance enabled us to deliver a better overall mobile ads experience for our users while increasing the number of ads that they see. In Q4, we also benefited to a lesser extent from increases in ad inventory from Instagram and the Audience Network.
On the demand side, we believe our efforts on targeting and measurement solutions enabled marketers to achieve better business results at better values. This helped us drive strong growth from a broad array of advertisers, including direct response and brand advertisers, large companies and SMBs and both existing and new advertisers. 
Turning now to the overall price volume metrics. In Q4, the average price per ad increased 21%, while total ad impressions increased 29% on a year-over-year basis. It's worth noting that this was the first quarter since Q3 2013 that total ad impressions increased on a year-over-year basis. This was driven by an increase in mobile ad impressions and was partially offset by a decline in ad impressions delivered on personal computers, consistent with the ongoing declines in PC usage. The reported increase in price is being driven by the continued mix shift towards mobile, which contains higher-priced News Feed ads, rather than the mix we have on PCs of both News Feed ads and lower-priced, right-hand column ads.
Total Payments and other fees revenue was $204 million, down 21% compared to last year. The decline was driven by a reduction in Payments revenue related to games played on personal computers.
Turning now to expenses. Q4 total GAAP expenses were $3.3 billion, up 21%; and non-GAAP expenses were $2.3 billion, up 42%. Our year-over-year GAAP expense growth rate slowed this quarter as we lapped the introduction of stock-based compensation charges associated with the WhatsApp transaction. Non-GAAP expenses were driven by increases in headcount-related costs, cost of revenue and marketing expenses. We ended the year with nearly 12,700 employees, up 38% compared to last year.
Our GAAP operating margin was -- or sorry, GAAP operating income was approximately $2.6 billion, representing a 44% operating margin. Our non-GAAP operating income was $3.5 billion, representing a 60% operating margin. 
Our Q4 GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were 39% and 36%, respectively. Our Q4 GAAP net income was approximately $1.6 billion or $0.54 per share, and our non-GAAP net income was $2.3 billion or $0.79 per share. In the full year 2015, capital expenditures were $2.5 billion as we continued to invest in servers, data centers, network infrastructure and office facilities to support the rapid growth of the business. We ended the year with over $18.4 billion in cash and investments.
Turning now to the outlook. First, some color on revenue. We expect the factors that drove the strong growth of our advertising business in 2015 will continue into 2016. However, we expect to continue to face foreign exchange headwinds, especially early in the year, as we will be lapping periods where the dollar was relatively weaker than it is today. More importantly -- sorry, more broadly, the overall macro environment introduces a level of uncertainty around global growth and exchange rates that could impact our business in 2016. And we do expect to face tougher comparables as the year progresses, given the remarkably strong advertising performance in 2015.
Turning now to expense guidance. 2016 will be another significant investment year for Facebook. In 2015, we continued investing heavily in the core. At the same time, we doubled our investment levels in our next-generation services, which includes WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger. And we tripled our investment levels in our long-term areas of focus, which includes our connectivity efforts, Oculus and our AI investments. We will continue investing significantly in all of these areas in 2016.
We expect the year-over-year growth rate for full year 2016 total GAAP expenses to be approximately 30% to 40% and for full year 2016 total non-GAAP expenses to be approximately 45% to 55%. Note these ranges represent total operating expenses -- sorry, including cost of revenue. These ranges also include the cost of revenue impact of the expected shipments of Oculus Rift that we expect that impact to be immaterial to our overall total expenses for the year.
We anticipate our 2016 capital expenditures will be in the range of $4 billion to $4.5 billion. We recently announced that we will begin building a new data center in Clonee, Ireland, and that project is on top of the new data center being built in Fort Worth, Texas.
We expect our 2016 stock-based compensation to be in the range of $3.1 billion to $3.3 billion, approximately half of which is related to our prior acquisitions, most notably WhatsApp. We expect 2016 amortization expenses to be approximately $700 million to $800 million. 
And lastly, we anticipate that our Q1 and full year 2016 GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates to be in the low 30s on a percentage basis, down from our 2015 rates. We expect our tax rates will decline further over time and resemble those of our global peers over the next several years. In addition, in 2016, we expect for the first time to pay a significant amount of U.S. income tax on a cash basis.
To conclude, 2015 was an outstanding year for Facebook. Our performance reflects the strong growth and engagement of our community, the momentum we're seeing in our ads business and the significant progress we're making on our mission to connect the world.
With that, Chris, we would like to open up the call for questions."

And we see continued increase in video sharing and photos and stickers and a lot of stuff that you would just call fun but that people really enjoy as different ways to express themselves. But in terms of the business, the more important piece is how people can interact with businesses through Messenger. And we started some early small tests around F8 last year where with some e-commerce services made it so that people who were buying things could follow up with the business and get customer support and buy more things. And we went through this process of integrating that and making sure that it integrated with all these systems well. And I think everyone is really happy with that so far, so -- and we started off pretty slowly, but that's going to be some of the basis for how we look to make Messenger a business going forward, and we're happy with the initial results. There's obviously a lot more there that we need to do, and we'll have more to talk about this year and beyond."

Instagram -- and we're pleased with the growth on Instagram. And as I mentioned, 98 of our top 100 advertisers in Facebook are now advertising on Instagram. It's also the case that Facebook grew remarkably -- had remarkably strong growth as well. So we're seeing strong growth across both platforms. I think what's exciting about both platforms is that they combine the art and the science of both a creative canvas that marketers are excited about and targeting. So to share another example from the holidays, Shutterfly did a Facebook and Instagram, both a brand and direct response holiday campaign on mobile. And what they did was just beautiful pictures but also targeting very specifically to women with specific interests, such as things like weddings and babies. And they saw a 6.4x return on ad spend.

Or there's been some question about whether or not some advertisers might take their spending and just move it over to Instagram. I'm just wondering if you see incremental spending as a result of opening up both platforms. And then the second question would just be to Mark. Just I was wondering -- I know you mentioned Oculus and the preorders. I was just wondering if you could give us your take on whether or not you're happy with the initial launch of Oculus preorders. And also, we obviously all know the big gaming impact, but I'm just wondering from your perspective, as you look out, what industries do you think are -- where this could be the most disruptive, outside of gaming?"

That's the initial market of folks who we think are going to be most interested in the early VR experiences, especially at some of the higher price points. But overall, I mean, the reason why we're interested in this is the social company is that we think that this is going to be a new way that people interact. Right? And if you've tried out the Toybox demo with the hands, Oculus Touch, what you see is when you're in virtual reality with another person and you can interact with the environment and use your hands, you can -- it's not just about where you are and the fact that you can instantaneously teleport to another place, it's just -- you can interact with people in all these different ways that would be very difficult in the rest of the world. So we're very excited about that, and that's going to be a big area of investment for us. And is ultimately, I think, going to change the way that we communicate and live and work in addition to how we play games. But I think we're off to a good start."

Some of our clients approach this where they have a social budget or a Facebook budget, and some of that moves to Instagram. And some people, it's incremental spend. In the medium to long run, however, we believe that we are really well positioned to take share from other platforms out there. We believe both Facebook and Instagram have this combination of an ability to do great creative with the best targeting and the most sophisticated measurement, which shows businesses how we help them move products off shelves. And we won, and we tell our clients we want to be the best dollar, the best euro, the best pound and the best minute you spend. And we really encourage them to measure their ROI and compare us to other platforms. We think that comparison bodes very well for our growth. We also think the continued consumer shift to mobile devices bodes well for our growth as well. That said, we have to continue to execute. We know this won't be easy.

And that's just proven to be an incredibly engaging experience that drives content into the system and is good overall. We have introduced a number of things like that for public figures, for Groups. Messenger has probably been the most successful. It's something that's connected to the Facebook experience that now has more than 800 million people using it.

We need to build really compelling ad products with great formats that let marketers be creative and be convincing. I'll share an example of something we did for an emerging market. I've mentioned briefly in my remarks, Slideshow. The Slideshow product is -- enabled a video-like experience with phones with lower connection speeds and feature phones by a series of photos. So Coca-Cola used that in Kenya and Nigeria. They took screen shots of a video ad they had produced for other markets. They uploaded them with text, and it reached 2 million people with a 10-point lift in ad awareness. So the way we need to drive sales around the world is by understanding markets, launching things like click to missed call ads in India and making sure our products work for markets, but also being able to connect to both advertising metrics and business metrics around the world. Video ads are important on our platform. And the most important thing that's growing well there is consumer engagement with video is growing. We have 500 million people watching video a day. And the fact that so much video is being consumed on our platform gives us room for an ads business to grow because we want the formats to match. Marketers also really love video, and it's a really compelling way to reach people and video is contributing to our growth. It's important to note that it's not just large brand advertisers that are doing video but all of our market segments: direct response; SMBs who have uploaded 1.5 million videos, and that's both organic and paid in the last month; and developers. The video ad spend is not all incremental, of course, because every time we put an ad in News Feed, if it's a video ad, it's taking the place of an ad with another format. In terms of learnings, one of the most important learnings we have is that video formats are different on Facebook. There are certainly people that are watching the whole 30-second video ad with sound, but there are some people that are doing less. They're watching shorter formats, and they're watching with sound. And one of the challenges we have in the market is convincing marketers and agencies and people that make the video to experiment with different formats. The good news is that we're getting great results like the Halo 5 example I shared in my remarks, that when people are willing to experiment, this is a pretty unique creative canvas. You can do short form with sound off. You can do longer form with sound on and everything in between. And our ability to persuade marketers to experiment is going to be a major driver of how much we can do here."

If you ask even our largest clients, our largest clients, if they drew a pie chart of where their consumer spend their time and money and where they spend their time and money, we are still underindexed. That said, I'll say it again, we have a lot of hard work to do. We really need to prove to clients, particularly as they scale and we become a bigger part of their spend, that we're driving results. Other platforms, other forms of advertising like TV and other, have very established metrics that people have believed for a very long time. We think our targeting can be better than any other platform. We also believe our ability to measure results can be deeper, but it's up to us to prove that and to prove that client to client. It's also worth noting that we work really well with TV. It's not always the choice of TV or Facebook, but often, we can be a compliment. We've done a bunch of work with Nielsen to measure what happens when marketers do big TV campaigns and do campaigns that are broadly targeted on Facebook, and we are able to increase the reach and increase brand favorability. So for the most part when people are doing big campaigns, they're doing them across multiple platforms, and we think that will continue."

So Reactions is going to roll out on every platform. We're testing it in a handful of countries to start just to make sure that we have the UI and interaction simple enough that people could express more of what they wanted without getting in their way. It is adding a little bit of complexity to something that is very simple today, just a 1-tap Like button. But the philosophy behind it is that when you only have a Like button, if you share a sad piece of content or something that makes you angry, people may not have the tool to react to it. And therefore, over time, the community feels less comfortable sharing that kind of content on Facebook. And we want people to be able to share all of the things that are meaningful to them, not just the things that are happy and that people are going to like when they see it. And we think that, that's just really important to the mission of the company and will increase engagement and sharing and openness and all of the things that we care about. And so far, I think the -- there are few tweaks that we needed to make to Reactions since initially testing it, but it's going well and I think we plan to roll it out everywhere pretty soon. So that's the game plan there. On Payments, the basic strategy that we have is to make it, especially in products like Messenger that -- where the business interaction may be a bit more transactional, to take all the friction out of making the transactions that you need. So we don't view ourselves as a payments business. That's not the type of company that we are. We'll partner with everyone who does payments. We you look at the stuff that Apple is doing with Apple Pay, for example, as a really neat innovation in the space that takes a lot of friction out of transactions as well. And our view is that the less friction, the better the user experience, the more people can easily interact with the businesses that they care about. And ultimately, for our business, that will drive up the amount that businesses are willing to pay to advertise to send people into those kind of interactions because they perform well. So it's good for everyone, but that's kind of how we think about that."

It's also probably worth saying that we're pretty excited about what's happening with the elections organically on Facebook. Facebook's really the new town hall.

In terms of the story that you said, I think you have it wrong. I don't know where you got that story from. I never had a conversation with the team where we were behind on mobile and then I said, ""We need to",633,"The question on -- I'll answer the other one. In terms of the story that you said, I think you have it wrong. I don't know where you got that story from. I never had a conversation with the team where we were behind on mobile and then I said, ""We need to do this to make money."" That's not really how we operate. What happened is we realized that mobile was growing faster than desktop and that people were shifting their usage and that it was the more important thing for people's consumer experience. And that's when we made the shift, not in our business first, but in how we developed product. And I told all of our product teams, when they come in for reviews, really just come in with mobile. If you come in and you try to show me a desktop product, then I'm going to kick you out. You have to come in and show me a mobile product. And that, I think, was just as a crude leadership tactic, somewhat effective in helping to motivate the organization to shift its energy towards focusing on mobile. But it was -- if you remember, we actually went through a pretty tough period. Because we went through this period where our mobile experience was not as good as we wanted it to be, and we had no ads on mobile. And we actually prioritized making the mobile experience good before putting ads in. So there was a long time where people thought that our business might not be as good because we had no ads on mobile, and that was because we always prioritized the experience for people above, even if it's going to be a painful thing for the company. So that's how I think about messaging. We know that messaging is going to be increasingly important. That's why we went out and hired David Marcus, who is one of the best product leaders in the field to run Messenger and why we bought WhatsApp, which is the leading messaging product worldwide. And we have a formula for how we build these businesses. First, you build a great consumer experience, right, that helps people share in a new way. That's really important. Then after that, you can start to introduce organic ways that people can interact with businesses. So that, in Facebook, is Pages, the businesses that people want to interact with, the public figures, the politicians, not necessarily ads, but organic interactions around not necessarily just your friends and families but more public figures and businesses. And then only once you have that ramped up to a good scale can you really start dialing up advertising and having that feel good and be a good part of the experience with good content because all those public figures and businesses are already participating in the platform at scale. So you can expect to see that playbook. In Instagram, we're pretty far along in terms of having a -- quite a mature public content ecosystem. And ads are ramping well with good high-quality ads because a lot of public figures and businesses are already investing and creating that kind of good content that goes in Instagram. And you're going to see the same playbook in Messenger and WhatsApp in terms of making it so that there are organic businesses and public figures. There's a bit more of that on WhatsApp already in terms of businesses using it than on Messenger. We are catching up on Messenger, but we'll do that on both. And once we have those ecosystems built out, we'll build businesses around them. And that's how we think about stuff, and we'll do that on all of our products and the different things that we do going forward."

Overall, Q4 was a strong quarter and a great end to the year.

Overall, Q4 was a strong quarter and a great end to the year. More than 1.59 billion people now use Facebook each month and 1.04 billion every day or growth of nearly 200 million people monthly and 148 million people daily this year. More than 1.44 billion people use Facebook on mobile devices. 
And when it comes to our business, we're also pleased with our continued growth. Total revenue grew by 52% year-over-year to more than $5.8 billion, and advertising revenues grew by 57% to reach more than $5.6 billion. But it's important to consider not just our business results, but also how we're improving the lives of people and communities around the world. Next week, Facebook celebrates its 12th birthday. And as I think about our progress and where we go from here, I have reflected on the diverse global moments that Facebook was involved in, in 2015. 
More than 950 million people received a notification that a friend or a loved one was safe in a crisis. Millions of people supported the people of Nepal after the earthquake and the people of France after the Paris attacks. More than 8 million people used 35,000 Groups and Pages on Facebook to support refugees. And people from all over the world connected around moments from Star Wars to the U.S. presidential election, from the Indian Super League to the Cricket World Cup. Seeing our global community connecting in all these ways shows the opportunities ahead as we connect the world but also the challenges. Even as the world has tended towards greater openness over time, in many communities, we also see greater fear over what a connected world and more technological progress means for them. Addressing these concerns is essential for making progress on our mission, and we're going to keep working to give as much voice as we can and advance the benefits of connectivity and bringing the world together. In 2016 and beyond, we're going to continue doing that by serving our community, working to bring connectivity to billions of the people who are not yet connected and building new technologies that give people more ways to express themselves. 
Now let's talk about how we've continued working to do that, and let's start with how we're improving our existing products and businesses. Our strategy here is to deliver better, more engaging experiences for our community and to give people better tools for sharing different types of content with the different groups of people that they care about. Video is an important part of the Facebook experience, and continuing to invest here is important for allowing people to share and consume some of the most engaging content. We've continued to make progress and now, 100 million hours of video are watched daily on Facebook. We've been testing new experiences like Suggested Videos, which enables people to discover more videos they might be interested in. We're also exploring ways to give people a dedicated place on Facebook for when they just want to watch videos.
With other parts of our core, we've continued to focus on improving the performance and quality of our products to better serve different communities on Facebook, and these efforts are paying off, with growth and engagement for different products reaching an impressive scale. Now more than 500 million people use Events each month, and more than 123 million events were created on Facebook in 2015. 
For the first time, more than 1 billion people used Groups in a single month on Facebook. It's inspiring to see all the different communities using Groups, from the small family and classroom and church groups to the large ones, like the Running Challenge group that I started a few weeks ago that now has about 100,000 members. 
To serve our entire global community, we're optimizing our services for people in developing countries. We've improved Facebook Lite to offer better experience in low-bandwidth environments, improving load times and adding features like video. More than 80 million people now use Facebook Lite as of December. And when it comes to serving businesses, we've continued to focus on creating better ads and tools for our more than 2.5 million active advertisers. More than 50 million small businesses now use Pages on Facebook, and people post more than 2.5 billion comments on these pages each month. This is a good example of how the strength and engagement of our community is making Facebook more valuable for businesses every day, and Sheryl's going to talk more about this in a minute.
Next, let's talk about how we're building our next generation of services. With Instagram, we've continued to drive the shift towards more visual content online. The community continues to grow, and back in September, we announced the new milestone of 400 million monthly actives. Over the last year, as the community has grown, we've focused on building engaging new experiences for the community, including by improving search and by introducing trending content. We've also worked to develop new experiences to give people more options for creating and sharing different types of content. In March, we launched the Layout app, allowing people to easily combine images. And in October, the team also launched Boomerang, an app for making looping videos, which reached #1 in the App Store in more than 70 countries. We also introduced a new video channel on Instagram for people to watch moments from big events like New Year's or the college football championship as they happen. 
With Messenger and WhatsApp, we've continued to make progress with building these into valuable communication services for everyone in the world. More than 800 million people now use Messenger monthly, and in 2015, we grew that number by almost 0.25 billion while also increasing engagement. We continued to give people new ways to communicate by introducing video calling and new options for customizing conversations with fun things like colors and Emoji and by using apps through the Messenger platform. We also worked to expand Messenger's utility by adding Payments, a new way to connect with businesses; and by testing M, a digital assistant powered by AI. In this quarter, we also began testing a transportation platform, allowing people to request an Uber ride through Messenger. More services will be coming to the platform soon, including airlines.
WhatsApp ended the year with nearly 1 billion monthly actives. As WhatsApp has grown, we've worked to keep it fast, simple and reliable. And we've seen many communities come to depend on this as their main communication service. To serve these communities well, this month, we announced that WhatsApp will now be free to everyone and will no longer charge them subscription fees that many people were charged after their first year. We think this is an important step towards creating an even more ubiquitous product without affecting our plans for building WhatsApp into an important business in the coming years. Later this year, we'll be testing new ways for people to use WhatsApp to communicate with businesses and organizations that they want to hear from.
Finally, let's talk about our work on new breakthrough technologies that can help connect more people to the Internet and create transformative new experiences. In 2015, we made significant progress on our efforts to connect more people to the Internet. We've launched the first trials of Express WiFi, a product designed to help entrepreneurs bring their communities online. We launched Free Basics in 33 more countries, and we've now connected 19 million people. This year, we expect to hold our first test flight of Aquila, our first solar-powered aircraft designed to beam Internet into communities from the sky. And we're also working on new advances in lasers that can transfer large amounts of data faster and more efficiently than anything today.
With our work in AI, we continue to make progress towards a new generation of computers that can see and understand. Over the last year, we've published dozens of research papers, including some of the leading work on image recognition and language understanding. To drive the entire AI community forward, we've also open-sourced software and a lot of AI hardware platform. Achieving the scientific breakthroughs to build AI that makes a dramatic visible difference in people's lives, it's going to take a long time, but already we're seeing opportunities to serve our community. We recently built a prototype AI system that combines language and vision comprehension, so you can show it an image that it's never seen before and it can answer questions about that image. And we've even used AI to help blind people experience their friends' photos and News Feed by describing the scenes.
With virtual reality, we've reached some important milestones. The Samsung Gear VR shipped over the holidays with our Oculus software, and we're pleased with the initial reaction. This month, we also opened preorders for Oculus headsets. This will be the world's best VR experience, and we're excited to begin shipping to people in more than 20 countries before the end of March. More than 100 VR games and experiences are coming to Oculus this year. And later this year, we'll also be shipping our Oculus touch controllers to get your hands into virtual reality. These controllers will enhance the VR experience and allow people to communicate more naturally in VR through intuitive hand movements and gestures. This Oculus launch is shaping up to be a big moment for the gaming community, but over the long term, VR has the potential to change the way that we live, work and communicate as well. The launch is an important step towards the future, and we're really looking forward to seeing how people use it.
So that's how we've continued to make progress on our strategy. It's been a strong quarter, and we ended 2015 with a great foundation for our efforts going into 2016. Our strategy is working, and we have many more opportunities ahead. So we're going to continue investing to deliver more great results over the long term.
On a more personal note, over the last few months with the new addition in my family, I've been reflecting a lot on the legacy that we want to pass on to the next generation. I'm excited about our progress and the chance to build something great for the future. If we continue to focus on solving the fundamental challenges facing the world and bringing the world closer together, we can leave a better world for the whole next generation. And that's what I think about every day as we continue building Facebook. And I want to thank everyone in our community, our employees, our shareholders, our partners who are helping us on this journey. Thanks, and here's Sheryl."

We had a terrific fourth quarter capping off a great 2015. Q4 ad revenue grew 57% or 66% on a constant currency basis. Mobile ad revenue reached $4.5 billion, up 81% year-over-year and is now 80% of total ad revenue.
Facebook and Instagram drive business results for our partners, helping move products off shelves online and off. As a result, we're growing spend from our current clients and attracting new marketers to our platform. We saw strong growth across all verticals, marketer segments and regions. We're also pleased with the growth we're seeing in emerging markets in countries like China, where businesses are advertising on Facebook and Instagram to reach people internationally. We continue to make progress on our 3 priorities: capitalizing on the shift to mobile, growing the number of marketers using our ad products and making our ads more relevant and effective.
First, capitalizing on the shift to mobile. Heading into 2016, it's clear that consumers have shifted to mobile, and businesses know they need to catch up. Marketers now realize that if they want to reach their customers where they are, mobile is essential. Our conversations with clients have shifted from if they should market on mobile to how. With over 1.44 billion people using Facebook on mobile monthly and over 400 million monthly actives on Instagram, Facebook and Instagram have become the 2 most important mobile advertising platforms. We provide a creative canvas powered by technology, a unique combination of art and science that marketers can use to deliver great creatives with the highest quality targeting at unparalleled scale.
The 2015 holiday season was a defining moment for mobile marketing and demonstrated the power of our mobile platform. According to comScore, total U.S. consumer spending on mobile in November and December was up 59% year-over-year. This holiday season, marketers turned to mobile more than ever before. To reach a large global audience for the launch of Halo 5, Microsoft Xbox used video optimized for Facebook and Instagram. Working with their agencies and power media team from Dentsu Aegis Network, Ayzenberg Group and Twofifteenmccann, they understood that people watch video differently in mobile news feed than on TV. So they created videos to capture audience attention in the first 3 seconds even without sound. They drove over 380 million impressions and 49 million video views in key markets and increased purchase intent by 10 points in the U.S.
Our second priority is growing the number of marketers using our ad products. Last quarter, we announced that we had over 2.5 million active advertisers, and since then, our growth has remained strong. This represents a small fraction of the over 50 million small businesses now actively using Pages, so we see a big opportunity to continue to grow the number of Facebook advertisers going forward. We're also very pleased with the growth in advertiser adoption of Instagram and the positive results that advertisers are seeing from their investments. 98 of the top 100 advertisers on Facebook also advertised on Instagram in Q4.
Our third priority is improving the relevance and effectiveness of our ads. We shipped a lot of new ad products this past year. These products help deliver personalized marketing at scale and drive business for our clients. Leading up to Black Friday, Shop Direct, the U.K.'s second largest online retailer, teased upcoming sales with a cinemagraph video to build awareness. They then retargeted people who saw the video with 1-day-only deals. On Black Friday, they used our Carousel and DPA ads to promote products people had shown interest in. They saw a 20x return on ad spend from this campaign, helping them achieve their biggest Black Friday and their most successful sales day ever. 
To share just a few other product examples, in emerging markets, we launched Slideshow, a video-like ad experience that works with lower connection speeds and feature phones. We introduced local awareness ads globally to help brick-and-mortar businesses reach people near their stores and started testing Canvas ads to help marketers showcase their products in a more immersive way. We continue to invest in ad tech and are especially pleased with the growth of Audience Network. 
Measurement also remains a critical area of focus. Our measurement tools like conversion lift and the Facebook pixel prove to marketers that we're driving business results and help make our ads more relevant. This year, we saw more advertisers shift from proxy metrics like clicks to business results like digital and in-store sales. Our results show that the investments we've made over the past few years are paying off, and we see a lot of exciting opportunities ahead. We know we still have a lot of hard work to do. And heading into the new year, we will remain very focused on our top 3 priorities.
I want to take this opportunity to thank our clients around the world for their partnership. Your investment and feedback is critical to making our products better. I also really want to thank the global Facebook teams for your extraordinary dedication to our partners' success. Your hard work and execution is critical to helping us fulfill our mission. Thanks, everyone, and now here's Dave."

Q4 was a strong quarter and wrapped up a phenomenal year for Facebook. Full year 2015 revenue was $17.9 billion, up 44% year-over-year or 53% on a constant currency basis. In 2015, we generated over $6 billion in free cash flow, including $2.1 billion in Q4, while continuing to fund important investments for the future growth of the business. The strong growth and engagement of our community was a consistent theme throughout 2015 and that continued in the fourth quarter. In December, 1.04 billion people used Facebook on an average day, an increase of 17% compared to last year. This daily number represented 65% of the 1.59 billion people who visited Facebook during the month of December.
Mobile continued to drive the growth of our community. In December, 1.44 billion people accessed Facebook on mobile devices, an increase of 21% compared to last year. And 90% of the people who used Facebook on both a monthly and daily basis accessed us via mobile devices.
Now turning to the financials. All of our comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. Additionally, our non-GAAP measures exclude stock-based compensation and the amortization of intangibles.
In Q4, total revenue was $5.8 billion, up 52% or 60% on a constant currency basis. Q4 ad revenue was $5.6 billion, up over $2 billion from last year. Year-over-year growth was 57% or 66% on a constant currency basis.
The strengthening of the U.S. dollar continued to have an unfavorable impact on our revenue in the fourth quarter. Had exchange rates remained constant with Q4 2014 levels, our total revenue would have been approximately $320 million higher.
U.S. and Canada and Asia Pacific continued to be our 2 strongest regions with ad revenue growth of 64% and 57%, respectively. Our Rest of World and Europe regions grew at 53% and 45%, respectively, as they were more heavily impacted by currency headwinds.
Mobile ad revenue was $4.5 billion, up 81% from last year and represented 80% of our advertising revenue. For perspective, 3 years ago, the mobile percentage was just over 20%. Q4 capped off a remarkably successful year for our mobile advertising business where we were able to combine strong growth in ad inventory supply with strong growth in advertiser demand. 
On the supply side, we grew the number of people using Facebook on mobile, time spent and ad load. Our ongoing focus on ad quality and relevance enabled us to deliver a better overall mobile ads experience for our users while increasing the number of ads that they see. In Q4, we also benefited to a lesser extent from increases in ad inventory from Instagram and the Audience Network.
On the demand side, we believe our efforts on targeting and measurement solution enabled marketers to achieve better business results at better values. This helped us drive strong growth from a broad array of advertisers, including direct response and brand advertisers, large companies and SMBs and both existing and new advertisers. 
Turning now to the overall price volume metrics. In Q4, the average price per ad increased 21%, while total ad impressions increased 29% on a year-over-year basis. It's worth noting that this was the first quarter since Q3 2013 that total ad impressions increased on a year-over-year basis. This was driven by an increase in mobile ad impressions and was partially offset by a decline in ad impressions delivered on personal computers, consistent with the ongoing declines in PC usage. The reported increase in price is being driven by the continued mix shift towards mobile, which contains higher-priced News Feed ads, rather than the mix we have on PCs of both News Feed ads and lower-priced, right-hand column ads.
Total payments and other fees revenue was $204 million, down 21% compared to last year. The decline was driven by a reduction in Payments revenue related to games played on personal computers.
Turning now to expenses. Q4 total GAAP expenses were $3.3 billion, up 21%; and non-GAAP expenses were $2.3 billion, up 42%. Our year-over-year GAAP expense growth rate slowed this quarter as we lapped the introduction of stock-based compensation charges associated with the WhatsApp transaction. Non-GAAP expenses were driven by increases in headcount-related costs, cost of revenue and marketing expenses. We ended the year with nearly 12,700 employees, up 38% compared to last year.
Our GAAP operating margin was -- or sorry, GAAP operating income was approximately $2.6 billion, representing a 44% operating margin. Our non-GAAP operating income was $3.5 billion, representing a 60% operating margin. 
Our Q4 GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates were 39% and 36%, respectively. Our Q4 GAAP net income was approximately $1.6 billion or $0.54 per share, and our non-GAAP net income was $2.3 billion or $0.79 per share. In the full year 2015, capital expenditures were $2.5 billion as we continued to invest in servers, data centers, network infrastructure and office facilities to support the rapid growth of the business. We ended the year with over $18.4 billion in cash and investments.
Turning now to the outlook. First, some color on revenue. We expect the factors that drove the strong growth of our advertising business in 2015 will continue into 2016. However, we expect to continue to face foreign exchange headwinds, especially early in the year, as we will be lapping periods where the dollar was relatively weaker than it is today. More importantly -- sorry, more broadly, the overall macro environment introduces a level of uncertainty around global growth and exchange rates that could impact our business in 2016. And we do expect to face tougher comparables as the year progresses, given the remarkably strong advertising performance in 2015.
Turning now to expense guidance. 2016 will be another significant investment year for Facebook. In 2015, we continued investing heavily in the core. At the same time, we doubled our investment levels in our next-generation services, which includes WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger. And we tripled our investment levels in our long-term areas of focus, which includes our connectivity efforts, Oculus and our AI investments. We will continue investing significantly in all of these areas in 2016.
We expect the year-over-year growth rate for full year 2016 total GAAP expenses to be approximately 30% to 40% and for full year 2016 total non-GAAP expenses to be approximately 45% to 55%. Note these ranges represent total operating expenses -- sorry, including cost of revenue. These ranges also include the cost of revenue impact of the expected shipments of Oculus Rift that we expect that impact to be immaterial to our overall total expenses for the year.
We anticipate our 2016 capital expenditures will be in the range of $4 billion to $4.5 billion. We recently announced that we will begin building a new data center in Clonee, Ireland, and that project is on top of the new data center being built in Fort Worth, Texas.
We expect our 2016 stock-based compensation to be in the range of $3.1 billion to $3.3 billion, approximately half of which is related to our prior acquisitions, most notably WhatsApp. We expect 2016 amortization expenses to be approximately $700 million to $800 million. 
And lastly, we anticipate that our Q1 and full year 2016 GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates to be in the low 30s on a percentage basis, down from our 2015 rates. We expect our tax rates will decline further over time and resemble those of our global peers over the next several years. In addition, in 2016, we expect for the first time to pay a significant amount of U.S. income tax on a cash basis.
To conclude, 2015 was an outstanding year for Facebook. Our performance reflects the strong growth and engagement of our community, the momentum we're seeing in our ads business and the significant progress we're making on our mission to connect the world.
With that, Chris, we would like to open up the call for questions."

But in terms of the business, the more important piece is how people can interact with businesses through Messenger. And we started some early small tests around F8 last year where with some e-commerce services made it so that people who were buying things could follow up with the business and get customer support and buy more things. And we went through this process of integrating that and making sure that it integrated with all these systems well. And I think everyone is really happy with that so far, so -- and we started off pretty slowly, but that's going to be some of the basis for how we look to make Messenger a business going forward, and we're happy with the initial results.

Instagram -- and we're pleased with the growth on Instagram. And as I mentioned, 98 of our top 100 advertisers in Facebook are now advertising on Instagram. It's also the case that Facebook grew remarkably -- had remarkably strong growth as well. So we're seeing strong growth across both platforms. I think what's exciting about both platforms is that they combine the art and the science of both a creative canvas that marketers are excited about and targeting. So to share another example from the holidays, Shutterfly did a Facebook and Instagram, both a brand and direct response holiday campaign on mobile. And what they did was just beautiful pictures but also targeting very specifically to women with specific interests, such as things like weddings and babies. And they saw a 6.4x return on ad spend.

But overall, I mean, the reason why we're interested in this as a social company is that we think that this is going to be a new way that people interact. Right? And if you've tried out the Toybox demo with the hands, Oculus Touch, what you see is when you're in virtual reality with another person and you can interact with the environment and use your hands, you can -- it's not just about where you are and the fact that you can instantaneously teleport to another place, it's just -- you can interact with people in all these different ways that would be very difficult in the rest of the world.

And we want -- and we tell our clients we want to be the best dollar, the best euro, the best pound and the best minute you spend.

We need to build really compelling ad products with great formats that let marketers be creative and be convincing. I'll share an example of something we did for an emerging market. I've mentioned briefly in my remarks, Slideshow. The Slideshow product is -- enabled a video-like experience with phones with lower connection speeds and feature phones by a series of photos. So Coca-Cola used that in Kenya and Nigeria. They took screen shots of a video ad they had produced for other markets. They uploaded them with text, and it reached 2 million people with a 10-point lift in ad awareness. So the way we need to drive sales around the world is by understanding markets, launching things like click to missed call ads in India and making sure our products work for markets, but also being able to connect to both advertising metrics and business metrics around the world. Video ads are important on our platform. And the most important thing that's growing well there is consumer engagement with video is growing. We have 500 million people watching video a day. And the fact that so much video is being consumed on our platform gives us room for an ads business to grow because we want the formats to match. Marketers also really love video, and it's a really compelling way to reach people and video is contributing to our growth. It's important to note that it's not just large brand advertisers that are doing video but all of our market segments: direct response; SMBs who have uploaded 1.5 million videos, and that's both organic and paid in the last month; and developers. The video ad spend is not all incremental, of course, because every time we put an ad in News Feed, if it's a video ad, it's taking the place of an ad with another format. In terms of learnings, one of the most important learnings we have is that video formats are different on Facebook. There are certainly people that are watching the whole 30-second video ad with sound, but there are some people that are doing less. They're watching shorter formats, and they're watching with sound. And one of the challenges we have in the market is convincing marketers and agencies and people that make the video to experiment with different formats. The good news is that we're getting great results like the Halo 5 example I shared in my remarks, that when people are willing to experiment, this is a pretty unique creative canvas. You can do short form with sound off. You can do longer form with sound on and everything in between. And our ability to persuade marketers to experiment is going to be a major driver of how much we can do here."

If you ask even our largest clients, our largest clients, if they drew a pie chart of where their consumer spend their time and money and where they spend their time and money, we are still underindexed. That said, I'll say it again, we have a lot of hard work to do. We really need to prove to clients, particularly as they scale and we become a bigger part of their spend, that we're driving results. Other platforms, other forms of advertising like TV and other, have very established metrics that people have believed for a very long time. We think our targeting can be better than any other platform. We also believe our ability to measure results can be deeper, but it's up to us to prove that and to prove that client to client. It's also worth noting that we work really well with TV. It's not always the choice of TV or Facebook, but often, we can be a complement. We've done a bunch of work with Nielsen to measure what happens when marketers do big TV campaigns and do campaigns that are broadly targeted on Facebook, and we are able to increase the reach and increase brand favorability. So for the most part when people are doing big campaigns, they're doing them across multiple platforms, and we think that will continue."

What we're seeing is that users are generating a lot of really high-quality content, often pretty short form that people are really happy to consume. And we believe that trend will continue because we're at the very beginning with people really understanding the power of the smartphones that most -- a lot of people are walking around with, particularly in developed markets. We are working with publishers to try to make the content experience better inside of News Feed. The best example of that is probably news with Instant Articles where we figured out that it was the slowest upload experience you could have in News Feed to link off to an outside article. So we've worked with publishers to upload more news articles natively to Facebook, and we're seeing great engagement from that. Similarly, we've had conversations with makers of premium content. I think they're excited by the work they already do with us to use Facebook to distribute their content, and we're interested in doing more. It's probably worth noting that much of the engagement and consumption we have is short form, not long form."

So Reactions is going to roll out on every platform. We're testing it in a handful of countries to start just to make sure that we have the UI and interaction simple enough that people could express more of what they wanted without getting in their way. It is adding a little bit of complexity to something that is very simple today, just a 1-tap Like button. But the philosophy behind it is that when you only have a Like button, if you share a sad piece of content or something that makes you angry, people may not have the tool to react to it. And therefore, over time, the community feels less comfortable sharing that kind of content on Facebook. And we want people to be able to share all of the things that are meaningful to them, not just the things that are happy and that people are going to like when they see it. And we think that, that's just really important to the mission of the company and will increase engagement and sharing and openness and all of the things that we care about. And so far, I think the -- there are few tweaks that we needed to make to Reactions since initially testing it, but it's going well and I think we plan to roll it out everywhere pretty soon. So that's the game plan there. On Payments, the basic strategy that we have is to make it, especially in products like Messenger that -- where the business interaction may be a bit more transactional, to take all the friction out of making the transactions that you need. So we don't view ourselves as a payments business. That's not the type of company that we are. We'll partner with everyone who does payments. We look at the stuff that Apple is doing with Apple Pay, for example, as a really neat innovation in the space that takes a lot of friction out of transactions as well. And our view is that the less friction, the better the user experience, the more people can easily interact with the businesses that they care about. And ultimately, for our business, that will drive up the amount that businesses are willing to pay to advertise to send people into those kind of interactions because they perform well. So it's good for everyone, but that's kind of how we think about that."

With the auto industry, a really important industry for growth for us, helping them figure out who their current customers are, who their potential customers are and where are the audience segments out there who have similar likes, interests, backgrounds, demographics to their current customers so that they can serve the right ad to the right people.

Yes, the 2016 elections is a big deal in terms of ad spend, but so is the World Cup, so is Super Bowl every year, so are events like the Olympics. We are excited about the kind of targeting we're able to offer for our ads platform. We believe we have precision that doesn't exist on any other platforms. So for example, using Facebook and Instagram ads, you can target by congressional district. You can target by interests. You can target by demographics or any combination of those. And we're seeing politicians at all levels really take advantage of that targeting. It's also probably worth saying that we're pretty excited about what's happening with the elections organically on Facebook. Facebook's really the new town hall. And connecting the people who are running for office, both at the national and the local level, with people directly has been really important. Every member of Congress in the United States is now on Facebook. We're seeing some of them post every vote and explain why they're doing votes. We're seeing a bunch of the candidates for President get on Facebook themselves and interact, taking questions from their potential voters directly.

In terms of the story that you said, I think you have it wrong. I don't know where you got that story from. I never had a conversation with the team where we were behind on mobile and then I said, ""We need to do this to make money."" That's not really how we operate. What happened is we realized that mobile was growing faster than desktop and that people were shifting their usage and that it was the more important thing for people's consumer experience. And that's when we made the shift, not in our business first, but in how we developed product. And I told all of our product teams, when they come in for reviews, really just come in with mobile. If you come in and you try to show me a desktop product, then I'm going to kick you out. You have to come in and show me a mobile product. And that, I think, was just as a crude leadership tactic, somewhat effective in helping to motivate the organization to shift its energy towards focusing on mobile. But it was -- if you remember, we actually went through a pretty tough period because we went through this period where our mobile experience was not as good as we wanted it to be, and we had no ads on mobile. And we actually prioritized making the mobile experience good before putting ads in. So there was a long time where people thought that our business might not be as good because we had no ads on mobile, and that was because we always prioritized the experience for people above, even if it's going to be a painful thing for the company. So that's how I think about messaging. We know that messaging is going to be increasingly important. That's why we went out and hired David Marcus, who is one of the best product leaders in the field to run Messenger, and why we bought WhatsApp, which is the leading messaging product worldwide. And we have a formula for how we build these businesses. First, you build a great consumer experience, right, that helps people share in a new way. That's really important. Then after that, you can start to introduce organic ways that people can interact with businesses. So that, in Facebook, is Pages, the businesses that people want to interact with, the public figures, the politicians, not necessarily ads, but organic interactions around not necessarily just your friends and families but more public figures and businesses. And then only once you have that ramped up to a good scale can you really start dialing up advertising and having that feel good and be a good part of the experience with good content because all those public figures and businesses are already participating in the platform at scale. So you can expect to see that playbook. In Instagram, we're pretty far along in terms of having a -- quite a mature public content ecosystem. And ads are ramping well with good high-quality ads because a lot of public figures and businesses are already investing and creating that kind of good content that goes in Instagram. And you're going to see the same playbook in Messenger and WhatsApp in terms of making it so that there are organic businesses and public figures. There's a bit more of that on WhatsApp already in terms of businesses using it than on Messenger. We are catching up on Messenger, but we'll do that on both. And once we have those ecosystems built out, we'll build businesses around them. And that's how we think about stuff, and we'll do that on all of our products and the different things that we do going forward."

We started 2016 off well. 1.65 billion people now use Facebook every month and 1.09 billion people use Facebook every day. In recent weeks, we're also consistently seeing more than 1 billion people using Facebook on mobile every day. 
We're also pleased with our business results. Total revenue this quarter grew by 52% year-on-year to $5.4 billion, and advertising revenue grew by 57% to $5.2 billion. I'll have more to say about these results in a minute, but first, I want to talk about a proposal by our Board of Directors to reclassify Facebook's stock. 
At F8, I talked about our mission and how the work we're doing to connect the world is more important today than it's ever been. I walked through our 10-year roadmap, focused on building the technology to give everyone the power to share anything with anyone. Bringing people together and giving everyone a voice takes long-term commitment not just over the next few years but over the next few decades. 
We're focused on the long term. And that's the main reason for today's proposal. Facebook has always been a founder-like company so we can focus on our mission and build long-term value. This structure has served our shareholders well. Early on, we received some generous offers for companies trying to buy Facebook, and our structure helped us resist that pressure. 
More recently, we navigated a challenging transition to mobile, but because we were a controlled company, we were able to focus on improving the user and product experience for our apps first and then build a strong mobile business over time rather than being forced to do something shortsighted. And over the years, our structure has helped us make big bets on acquisitions like Instagram that were very controversial initially but were good decisions for our community and our business. 
Facebook has been built by a series of bold moves. And when I look out at the future, I see more bold moves ahead of us than behind us. We're focused not on what Facebook is but on what it can be and on what it needs to be. And that means doing bold things. A lot of what we're building today in areas like connectivity, artificial intelligence and virtual and augmented reality may not pay off for years. But they're important to our mission of connecting the world. And I'm committed to seeing this mission through and to leading Facebook there over the long term.
Personally, there's another element to this. While helping to connect the world will always be the most important thing that I do, there are more global challenges that I also feel a responsibility to help solve to create a better world for my daughter and all future generations. Things like helping to cure all disease by the end of the century, upgrading our education system so it's personalized for each student and protecting our environment from climate change. That's why Priscilla and I created the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and committed to give 99% of our Facebook shares to advance human potential and promote equality.
Today's Board proposal will allow us to maintain and improve the voting structure that has served us well and allow me to fund the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. In December, I also announced that I won't sell more than $1 billion worth of stock -- Facebook shares per year over the next 3 years. That's still my commitment and I'll update our shareholders on future plans beyond that.
Dave will talk more about the mechanics of this proposal in his comments in just a few minutes. But before we get there, I want to also share a few more thoughts on the progress we've made this quarter. As I said before, our roadmap has 3 horizons: over the next 3 years, we're going to keep investing in our most developed ecosystem, the Facebook app and platform. Today, people around the world spend on average more than 50 minutes a day using Facebook, Instagram and Messenger and that doesn't even include WhatsApp yet. This growth isn't happening because we came up with just 1 or 2 big changes. Our team has just worked day after day on lots of improvements over a long period of time. And that progress continued in the first quarter. We launched Reactions to help people express themselves in more ways, and we improved our product to work on different mobile networks and devices all over the world. 
Sheryl will talk more about this in a minute, but now, more than 3 million businesses are using our advertising products every month. We've expanded our measurement capabilities so more businesses can see the results they get from ads. We've made it easier for small and medium businesses to use the same targeting tools and ad formats that our larger advertisers use. 
Over the next 5 years, we're going to build the ecosystems around our products that are already being used by a lot of people. We're at the beginning of a golden age of online video. Video isn't just a single kind of content. We think it's a medium that allows people to interact in a lot of new ways. So that's why in addition to normal Internet video, we're also focusing on more interactive video experiences like Live and 360 video. 
I'm a big Game of Thrones fan, and the other week, HBO and our Oculus team came out with a 360 video of the opening sequence of the show, and it's now the most-watched 360 video on Facebook in any 24-hour period with more than 12 million total views. 
Earlier this month, we opened up Live to everyone. Live is just one part of our overall video effort, but we think it has a lot of potential. Friends go live because it's unfiltered and personal. Actors and news anchors go live because they can reach bigger audiences, in some cases, than they can even on their own shows. And if we do a good job, we think it's something that people will associate with Facebook with interacting with people and not just watching content. But it's also a very new and small part of all of the videos that we see on Facebook today.
I'm also really excited about what we're building around messaging. Right now, we have 2 of the top messaging apps in the world. 900 million people use Messenger every month and 1 billion people use WhatsApp every month. Between Messenger and WhatsApp, people send around 60 billion messages every day. That's almost 3x as many messages as SMS handled at its peak. 
Over the past couple of weeks, we've talked about steps we're taking to build messaging into a platform that developers and businesses can build on. We announced for Messenger that let you do things like order flowers or get news without leaving your messenger thread. So this is all very early, and we're rolling these experiences out carefully and slowly over time. 
We're also very happy with the way that Instagram is growing, with more than 400 million actives and more than 200,000 businesses advertising every month. Now we're focused on making the user experience even more engaging. With more content on Instagram all the time, people are currently missing about 70% of what's in their feed. So that's why in the first quarter, we started rolling out to help you see more of the posts that you care about. 
And this is a long-term effort, but News Feed shows that ranking creates the best and most engaging experiences for our community. Over the next 10 years, we're going to keep investing in new technology to help everyone connect. As part of internet.org, we're building an open-source telco infrastructure project called TIP to make it cheaper to operate mobile networks. Free Basics, which helps people access tools for education, health information and communication for free, now features more than 600 services, and it has brought more than 25 million people online. That makes it one of the most successful connectivity initiatives in the world.
We're also working to help people connect and share in a more natural and intuitive way. Artificial intelligence is a long-term effort for us but we're already using it in lots of ways. Right now, our Moments app is using face recognition to help you share pictures with your friends. 
We're using AIs to show the most relevant content in News Feed, filter spam and messaging and even help people understand what's in their friend's photos by reading explanations of them aloud. 
Finally, we're building technology in virtual and augmented reality that can change the way that we all experience of the world. Gear VR started shipping late last year and the response so far has been great. There are now hundreds of apps built specifically for Gear, and people have watched more than 2 million hours of video on it. 
In Q1, we also started shipping Oculus Rift. We've got a lot of great content with more than 50 games and apps built for Rift. And again, this is very early and we don't expect VR to take off as a mainstream success right away. I really want to emphasize that. Most Rift early adopters are gamers and developers but eventually, we believe that VR is going to be the next big computing platform, and we're making the investments necessary to lead the way there.
So that's our update for the quarter. As always, everything we do is focused on our mission to make the world more open and connected. And to get there, we're building technology that brings people together and that helps everyone in the world share anything they want with anyone. It takes a long-term commitment and it won't happen overnight, but we're in a strong position, an I'm excited about what's next. So thank you to everyone in our community, to all of our teams, all of our partners and all of our shareholders for everything you're doing to help connect the world. And now here's Sheryl."
20765463,330038583,964949,"Facebook, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2016",2016-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Meta Platforms, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mark, and hi, everyone. We had great first quarter and a strong start to the year. Q1 ad revenue grew 57% or 63% on a constant currency basis. Mobile ad revenue reached $4.2 billion, up 75% year-over-year and is now approximately 82% of total ad r",783,"Thanks, Mark, and hi, everyone. We had great first quarter and a strong start to the year. Q1 ad revenue grew 57% or 63% on a constant currency basis. Mobile ad revenue reached $4.2 billion, up 75% year-over-year and is now approximately 82% of total ad revenue. Our growth was strong across all verticals, marketer segments and regions particularly North America and APAC. 
We remain focused on driving our clients businesses, moving their products off shelves both in stores and online. A big focus for us in 2016 is helping our clients understand the true business impact of their ads, especially on digital. 
We're pleased with the progress we made in Q1 across our 3 priorities: capitalizing on the shift to mobile; growing the number of marketers using our ad products; and making our ads more relevant and effective. 
First, capitalizing on the shift to mobile. Consumers have shifted to mobile and businesses know they need to catch up. We hear from marketers that figuring out mobile today is like figuring out TV in its early days. But given where consumers spend their time, the question now is not if they should market on mobile but how. 
One of the drivers of the consumer shift to mobile is video. People are sharing and creating nearly 3x more video on Facebook than they were a year ago. And as of February, the time people spend watching videos on Instagram increased by more than 40% over the preceding 6 months. This presents a big opportunity for marketers. 
The best marketers understand that people watch video differently in mobile feed than on TV. They create ads that grab attention in the first few seconds, sometimes even without sound, what we now call stopping creative. For example, Nestle took their TV ad for Natural Bliss Coffee Creamer and in less than a day, added it for mobile feed by creating a new opening and adding text overlays to relay their message without sound. They showed both the original TV ad and the mobile ad on Facebook. The original TV ad drove a 4-point increase in ad recall. The mobile-optimized version, however, drove an even stronger 10-point increase in ad recall and a 7-point increase in product awareness. 
We want to help marketers optimize their video ads. For example, we know that on average, captioned videos increase view time by 12%, so we introduced auto captions to generate captions for video ads. In Q1, we introduced new ad formats like Canvas ads. Canvas ads showcase products by combining video images and call an action button. While it's still early, we're pleased with the results and are seeing adoption across many verticals. 
To motivate millennials to take on do-it-yourself projects, and video targeted 25- to 34-year-old homeowners with Canvas ads that let them design, discover the products in each design and tap to purchase. The ads were so engaging that people spent an average of 28 seconds interacting with them and load saw a 6.7x return on ad spend.
Our second priority is growing the number of marketers using our ad products. This quarter, we announced that we have over 3 million active advertisers on Facebook and over 200,000 on Instagram. A significant number of these advertisers are small and medium businesses. These businesses use our platform because it's easy and affordable for them to connect with their consumers on mobile. 
We're also making it easier for SMEs to use the same targeting tools and ad formats that our most sophisticated advertisers use. We're seeing even small businesses use lead ads, Slideshow and Dynamic Product Ads. 
Our third priority is improving the relevance and effectiveness of our ads. Last year, we introduced conversion lift to measure how Facebook and Instagram campaigns drive business objectives like sales. We've seen clients across verticals from retail to auto use conversion lift to measure and improve the return on their ad investment. 
Chase Bank used conversion lift to measure how effectively their Super Bowl ad drove credit card application. They found that combining Facebook video ads with their TV ads drove 1.5x more conversion than TV ads alone. In Q1, we expanded our lift capabilities by testing lift APIs, enabling more partners to measure the effectiveness of more of their campaigns. 
We're pleased with the value we're driving for our partners and the progress we're making across our 3 priorities. Helping marketers make the shift to mobile will take time. We have a lot of hard work ahead and will continue to invest. I want to thank our clients around the world for their partnership and congratulate our global team on the results of their hard work. Thanks, everyone, and now here's Dave."
20765463,330038583,964949,"Facebook, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2016",2016-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Meta Platforms, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Sheryl, and good afternoon, everyone. We're off to a great start in 2016, led by the ongoing growth and engagement in our community and continued momentum in our ads business. In Q1, we generated $5.4 billion in total revenue and delivered over $1",1373,"Thanks, Sheryl, and good afternoon, everyone. We're off to a great start in 2016, led by the ongoing growth and engagement in our community and continued momentum in our ads business. In Q1, we generated $5.4 billion in total revenue and delivered over $1.8 billion in free cash flow. Let's begin with our community metrics.
In March, 1.09 billion people used Facebook on an average day, up 16% compared to last year. This daily number represents 66% of the 1.65 billion people who visited Facebook in the month of March. Mobile continues to drive our growth. Over 1.5 billion people accessed Facebook for mobile devices in March, up 21% from last year. 
Before diving into our quarterly financial results, I wanted to highlight that beginning this quarter, I will focus my prepared remarks on our GAAP results and our -- all financial metrics our GAAP, unless otherwise noted. The primary difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP metric is stock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation plays an important role in how we compensate our employees, and therefore, we review it at a real expense for the business. We will continue to provide a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial metrics in our press release and earnings slide. All of our comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted.
Q1 total revenue was $5.4 billion, up 52% or 58% on a constant currency basis. Ad revenue in Q1 was $5.2 billion, up 57% or 63% on a constant currency basis. This marks a slight decline from the 66% constant currency ad growth rate we experienced in Q4. 
In Q1 this year, we benefited from an additional day due to the leap year, which contributed approximately 2 percentage points to our year-over-year ad revenue growth rate. North America and Asia-Pacific were our fastest-growing regions with advertising revenue growth of 64% and 62%, respectively. Europe and Rest of World grew advertising revenue more slowly at 49% and 35%, respectively, with the latter particularly impacted by foreign exchange headwinds. Setting aside currency headwinds, all regions exceeded 50% constant currency ad revenue growth. 
Mobile ad revenue was $4.2 billion, representing approximately 82% of total ad revenue. Mobile ad revenue grew 75%, driven by strength from Facebook's Newsfeed. Our mobile aps business continues to be driven by the combination of both supply-side and demand-side factors. 
On the supply side, we continue to see healthy growth in the number of people using Facebook, time spent across our product and ad loads. On the demand side, we believe the investments we have made to improve our mobile advertising solutions are helping drive value for both people and marketers. We are seeing growth in both new customers as well as existing customers who are spending more with us on average compared to last year.
In Q1, the average price per ad increased 5% while total ad impressions increased 50%. The reported increase in price is being driven by the continued mix shift towards mobile, which contains higher-priced News Feed ads rather than the mix we have on PCs of both News Feed ads and lower-priced right-hand column ads. 
The increase in impressions was driven by strong growth in mobile ad impressions and was offset partially by a decline in ad impressions delivered on personal computers consistent with the ongoing declines in PC usage. 
The increase in -- sorry, total payments and other fees revenue was $181 million, down 20% compared to last year. This decline was mainly driven by a reduction of payments revenue related to games played on personal computers. 
Q1 total cost and expenses were $3.4 billion, up 29%. We ended the quarter with approximately 13,600 employees, up 35% compared to last year. Q1 operating income was $2 billion, representing a 37% operating margin. Our Q1 tax rate was 27%, down from our full year 2015 tax rate of 40%. Our Q1 net income was approximately $1.5 billion or $0.52 per share.
In Q1, capital expenditures were $1.1 billion, more than double compared to Q1 of last year. Server purchases and data center construction were the largest contributors to year-over-year growth. New builds in Texas and Ireland, along with the expansion of existing facilities, will nearly double our current data center footprint when completed. In addition to servers and data centers, investments in office facilities also contributed to the year-over-year growth. We ended the quarter with $20.6 billion in cash and investments.
Turning now to the outlook. First, some color on revenue. We remain focused on creating value for the people and marketers who use our services. We expect that the main drivers of advertising revenue growth will continue throughout 2016, but we will face tougher comparables as the year progresses, given the accelerating ad revenue growth we experienced throughout 2015. 
Payments and other fees revenues will continue to face headwinds throughout the year given that the substantial majority of that revenue relates to payments from games played on personal computers. Even with the expected contribution from Oculus, we anticipate that our payments and other fees revenue for the full year 2016 will come in lower than the level in 2015.
Next, onto the expense outlook. Our expense guidance remains unchanged. We expect that full year 2016 total GAAP expense growth will be approximately 30% to 40%. We expect full year 2016 amortization expenses to be approximately $700 million to $800 million and full year 2016 stock-based compensation expenses to be approximately $3.1 billion to $3.3 billion. 
If you take into account our GAAP expense guidance as well as our amortization and SEC guidance, you'll see that our full year 2016 total non-GAAP expense growth guidance range remains unchanged at 45% to 55%. We anticipate full year 2016 capital expenditures to be at the high end of the $4 billion to $4.5 billion range we gave last quarter as we invest to support the rapid growth of the business. We expect our Q2 and full year 2016 tax rates to be similar to our Q1 rates.
In summary, 2016 is off to a great start for Facebook. Our results reflect healthy growth and engagement in our committee, strength in our ads business and investments we're making to capitalize on the long-term opportunities we see ahead. 
Before going to questions, I wanted to touch briefly on the share reclassification that Mark discussed at the beginning of the call. As we disclosed in the proxy statement we filed today, our Board of Directors has approved a proposal for the reclassification of our capital stock that would involve the creation of a newly -- of a new class of publicly listed nonvoting Class C capital stock. 
Pending stockholder approval, we intend to issue 2 Class C shares as a one-time stock dividend for each outstanding Class A and Class B share, resulting in a tripling of the pre-reclassification total shares outstanding. All stockholders would be treated equally. 
The net effect of this transaction would be to establish to 2 publicly traded classes of Facebook stock, one representing the current Class A shares and the other representing the nonvoting Class B shares. Since the Class C shares would have the same economic right as the Class A and Class B shares, we would expect that after the payment of the stock dividend, the share price of the Class A common stock would generally reflect a 3-for-1 stock split.
This will have no effect on the voting interests related to shares that investors currently hold. As Mark mentioned, this structure will allow for the preservation of the voting structure that has served the company well to date while allowing for Mark to fund the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative over the course of his lifetime. Importantly, as part of this proposal, the preservation of the multiclass capital structure would be generally predicated on Mark continuing to maintain an active leadership role at Facebook. 
Let me talk about next steps. The reclassification would be conditioned on approval by a majority of outstanding books held by company stockholders, and we anticipate a vote on the matter at our annual meeting to be held on June 20 this year. A record date for this dividend will be determined at a later day. With that, Chris, let's open up the call for questions."

SMBs or SMEs, as they're called in different places around the world, we think are very core competitive advantage for us. It's prohibitively expensive from small businesses to reach people digitally. 35% of small businesses in the United States, which is often the most advanced market, don't have a web presence at all. And setting up a mobile app, getting people to find and download a mobile app can be even more expensive. And so what's happening is that SMBs are turning to Facebook pages as their mobile solution. They're free, they're easy to set up, and they already know how to do them because almost all of them are already Facebook users in the first place. And so the onboarding has been incredibly important and incredibly attractive. We announced last year that we have over 50 million small business pages active on a monthly basis. 80% of those are active on mobile. We then worked on helping them use our ad products and upsell them through our paid ads products as well. And we announced this quarter that we hit 3 million active advertisers on Facebook and 200,000 on Instagram. What's interesting is that what you see as SMBs able to use [indiscernible] biggest brands in the world, that over 2 million SMBs have posted a video, both paid and organic in the last month, and that has to be many times the number of SMEs that have or placed a TV commercial. In terms of measurement, your question is important because it's not just getting them to use our platforms to connect to consumers. It's getting them to be able to measure our results. And so we worked hard to build measurement tools into the product, so that when you buy an ad, SMEs very easy interface and decide what their goals are. Are their goals measuring sales? Are their goals [indiscernible] website? Are their goals and mobile app downloads and then measuring all the way through from showing that ad to the purchase? I can continue and we continue to be very bullish on this channel because we have such a broad base because that usage is so active we're because we are very focused on investing and simplifying our products so that all SMEs can use them."

So for example, people can sell out forms on a mobile device, take their contacts on Facebook, we rolled that out fully this quarter.

It's worth noting that video ads take place at another [indiscernible] not all of the revenue [indiscernible] but as consumer engagement in video has continued to grow, that creates more and more of an opportunity for video ads. Marketers have always loved video because it's a really compelling way to reach people. And this now, you can reach them on mobile all day with those kind of messages. Importantly, marketers have to adjust sometimes. While the 30-second ad does perform well in News Feed, we also people understanding that some of the formats are different, creating shorter ads, creating ads that can work even without sound, more personal ads has really mattered. One example is Toyota used Facebook for the launch of the RAV4 Hybrid. [indiscernible] Los Angeles, they used a very broad video to drive brand awareness. They've reached over 36 million people in a target demo within 2 days. Then, and this is where it gets even more interesting. They retargeted people who watch the video with over 500 personalized video ads optimized for Facebook and Instagram. So they were creating a direct response campaign to get people to take specific action like requesting a quote and finding a specific dealer. We saw 14 -- a 14-point lift in ad recall, a 7-point lift in message association. And right now, we're using other tools to continue to measure their sales for the 30 and 60 days campaign to see what happens. And we're pretty excited about what that shows in terms of how videos can be used in a really broad-based way but also more personal way."

So whether that's and messaging people, messaging their friends or Groups, News Feed before that, it was people posting updates and same the same what's going on with, the people that they care about. And then the next step is to create organic activity around public entities so whether that's businesses, public figures, athletes, celebrities and folks people interact with different platforms, we did that on Facebook and pages, and we're working on a number of different ways to do that in Messenger. One of those is box. And one of the good things about Box that we've seen is that it can increase -- or sorry, decrease the amount of time that you have to wait before you get a reply back from interaction with some of the [indiscernible] so what we've seen, we've done some research on this. A lot of people every day in Facebook today are already messaging pages and businesses directly. And they -- the businesses respond.

And when we can do that, then that decreases the latency and predictably, people want to do more of that activity. So that's one way that I think you're going to see Box work between people who are actually driving the businesses directly will need to, in some way, train or answer questions for people. But we can build artificial intelligence that can learn from people, how to automate a lot of that and make that experience a lot faster for people who want to interact with businesses and public figures.

So overall sharing is up across Facebook, and people are spending more time on Facebook and the whole family of apps. And not that is not just the case for the aggregate of the growing community, but it's actually also the case on a per person basis as well in terms of people sharing more and spending more time individually. Now one of the things that we see is that the way that we are sharing is always changing, right? And some of this is because of underlying that the call transition. So on desktop, for example, easier to type so we sell more text posts. In mobile, it's easier to take video so we see more videos. On desktop, people would have more commonly uploaded an album of photos that they took from their digital camera and downloaded onto their computer as a mobile the more common behavior is to take a single photo or a couple and just post those. So all these transitions -- and that's our job, right, is to make it so that we build great tools that people, everyone around the world can share everything they want with everyone. Now the other thing that's also true is that people want to share with lots of different kinds of audience. So Facebook gives you the ability to share with all of your friends and publicly if you want and groups. But we're also investing in things like Messenger and WhatsApp because a lot of people want to share increasingly messages, privately one-on-one with very small groups. So in addition to Messenger, which is at 900 million people a month and WhatsApp, which is at more than 1 billion people a month. Facebook Groups is also at more than 1 billion people a month, which I think represents the increasing diversity of the different types of audiences that people want to share with. But ultimately, I think that humans have such a deep desire to express themselves and want to connect with the people around them that I think that all of these audiences and all of these different types of media should grow over time. And it's our job to basically make sure that we build good products and get rid of all the bugs and make it that the performance is fast and all the basic stuff works that [indiscernible] at there. But in general, right now, all the high level trend looked pretty positive on that. I think I'll kick it off to Dave to go through your questions about some of the technical pieces about the reclassification."

And that's enabled us to show more of them without harming the user experience at all. So that's been really key. Over time, we would expect that ad load growth will be a less significant factor driving overall revenue growth, but we remain confident that we've got opportunity to grow supply so that continued growth in people and engagement on Facebook as well as on our other apps such as Instagram. On the question regarding what would happen to Mark's shares if he were to leave Facebook, I would -- I just kind of refer that the new multiclass capital structure is generally dependent on Mark continuing to maintain an active leadership role at Facebook.

And the basic theory that we have is that there are small number of services that are going to be ubiquitous utilities that 1 billion or 2 billion or more people are going to want to use, right? So that's kind of core basic messaging, right? The core functionality around having your real identity and connecting with all of your real friends and family online. Those are things that we think are going to be ubiquitous. And we want to build those. At the same time, we also think that there are going to be many, many good businesses and different other social use cases where there are people doing good work and building different companies that  we feel no need to own those things. So when I think people come up from time to time and suggest that I should buy this company or that, and we look out what are the things that we think are going to be ubiquitous tools and who are the most talented people in the world to build this. And so when you think about something like virtual and augmented reality, that's how we thought about that. This is -- those are going to be important platforms over time. It's very early obviously because it can take a long time to get there. And a lot of what we felt like we were buying there was a critical mass, the best people and the best technology to go do all the things that we needed to go do over the next 10 years to drive that home and turn that into a big platform. And you asked a question about virtual and augmented reality, what are going to be the big use cases? I mean, for the first few years of virtual reality, I think gaming and video are going to be the big one. The initial market that we look at are all the people have Xbox and PlayStation the people who are excited to have an immersive media experience sitting in their living room for a long period of time. And that's a pretty big market. And even though that's not all of what we hope to eventually serve and that's not the full potential of these new platforms, I think that is one case where you can obviously deliver better and richer experiences than what you can with the current generation of technology. Video is going really well. I shared a stat for in some of my comments that on Gear VR alone, we're now at more than 2 million hours of video have been watched into the platform so that's really exciting. And that, of course, will be bolstered by the fact that these new kind of 360 videos can not only be watched in VR so in the headset, but we're building tools that you can share them on News Feed and through our product elsewhere as well. So I think that's exciting over time there will be even more but that I should be enough to have some initial use. But again, I do really want to reemphasize, this is early going to take a long time. And I know there's a lot of hype around this, and we are just focused on building this to be very good over the long term."

So the basic human senses seeing, hearing, language kind of core thing is that we do. I think it's possible to get to the point in the next 5 to 10 years where we have computer systems that are better than people at each of those things. That doesn't mean that the computers will be thinking or be generally better but that is useful for a number of things. So for example, I talked about earlier, we are building this moment so that way, you can take photos on your phone and if you use this app, our face recognition can look at the photos that you take and suggest that you might want to share photos that you took with a friend of them with that person so that way, all the photos of that might be of you and your friends camera roll, they can share with you. Another example is just spam filtering and making sure that we can actually reach the content and understand what's interesting to you or not and not show that. One obvious thing, I think, over time is if you just look at the way that we rack News Feed. Today, we use some basic signals like who you're friends with and what pages you like as some of the most important things for figuring out what, out of all of the millions and millions of pieces of content that are on Facebook, what we're going to show and what are going to be the most interesting things to you. That's today, our systems can actually understand what the content mean. We don't actually look at the photo and understand what and/or look at the videos and understand what's in it or links that per share and understand what's in them. But in the future, we'll be able to, I think, on a 5- or 10-year period. So all of these millions and millions of content that are out there, whether or not you've added some of friend or have liked a page, we'll be able to know a lot better what types of things are going to be interesting to you to produce a much better feed of content. So that's just some basic example of where have a human level perception broadly is going to yield better experiences and a lot of the things that people care about today."

We're also testing some incremental features and pages, which enable businesses to drive purchases on a page or direct people directly to their website. These are really early but we've had some positive feedback. Our focus however continues to be on our ad products because we think we can take people all the way from the top of the funnel where they can really get a brand awareness or product awareness and go all the way down to purchase, not necessarily the purchases happening on Facebook but because we can work on the measurement system to understand how the advertising both at the top and lower down in the funnel is influencing those purchases. We've been really excited by what we've seen in the commerce vertical of our ad products. The products like dynamic product ads, carousel ads are working really well for us. This quarter, we launched Canvas ads, which are very fast-loading immersive mobile adds. They're easy to build, you can use a self-service tool to write any code. They are native format so they decrease that initial dropoff you see when people click off to another site. Very early days but the average viewing time is over 30 seconds, which shows how immersive that is. I'll share one example of how ads are driving a small business on Facebook through ads, which is company called Sparkle and Paint. They're a Utah-based SMB, they're selling girls' clothing. They did it a slide show ad that included a Shop Now button, which enabled you to take action on their site. They were able to increase sales by 9% per month. And more exciting for us, this was 6x more efficient in terms of acquisitions than any other digital media channel. And that shows how you can use our ad products to go all the way from awareness, measuring through to a sale and show how important our ads can be commerce on our platform."

So before the game, they targeted their 30-second Super Bowl ad that featured Drake to NFL and people with NFL and celebrity interest. It performed so well that they decided to run a 60-second version on Facebook and Instagram. That and Facebook and Instagram that they ran the 60-second ad on TV instead of their 30-second ad. So as people invest, they can use these different platforms together, and we're pretty excited to see that progress."

And I think I need to huge opportunity not just in live video but a lot of things were talking about. And one interesting example recently that I touched on earlier is between Messenger and WhatsApp, we're around 60 billion messages a day. And sorry -- SMS at its peak, we think, was around 20 billion messages a day. And just unlocking some of the friction that existed in SMS and improving the product a little bit and removing the small fee that was there has just unlocked a huge amount of expression. And we think that this is going to be the case in all different types of media and with all different audiences that the person would share with. So in video, there are billions and billions of videos that are viewed every day on Facebook. Live is a very small part of it. The reason why we give disproportionate attention to it is because we're trying to help push forward new formats that are not just about consuming content but really about interacting so Live, 360 video and there will be others in the future. And so yes, I mean, to answer your question, I do think that multiple products and companies can succeed in building these things. I also think that there are going to be a lot more interactive forms of video than just Live and 360 like we're talking about now. And I think not just to video but for all of the different types of media and audiences that we're serving. So we are -- we're very excited about continuing to do our work to help unlock all the expression and connection that people want to do."

We started 2016 off well. 1.65 billion people now use Facebook every month and 1.09 billion people use Facebook every day. In recent weeks, we're also consistently seeing more than 1 billion people using Facebook on mobile every day. 
We're also pleased with our business results. Total revenue this quarter grew by 52% year-on-year to $5.4 billion, and advertising revenue grew by 57% to $5.2 billion. I'll have more to say about these results in a minute, but first I want to talk about a proposal by our Board of Directors to reclassify Facebook's stock. 
At F8, I talked about our mission and how the work we're doing to connect the world is more important today than it's ever been. I walked through our 10-year roadmap, focused on building the technology to give everyone in world the power to share anything with anyone. Bringing people together and giving everyone a voice takes a long-term commitment, not just over the next few years but over the next few decades. 
We're focused on the long term. And that's the main reason for today's proposal. Facebook has always been a founder-like company, so we can focus on our mission and build long-term value. This structure has served our shareholders well. Early on, we received some generous offers for companies trying to buy Facebook, and our structure helped us resist that pressure. 
More recently, we navigated a challenging transition to mobile, but because we were a controlled company, we were able to focus on improving the user and product experience for our apps first, and then build a strong mobile business over time rather than being forced to do something shortsighted. And over the years, our structure has helped us make big bets on acquisitions like Instagram that were very controversial initially but were good decisions for our community and our business. 
Facebook has been built by a series of bold moves. And when I look out at the future, I see more bold moves ahead of us than behind us. We're focused not on what Facebook is, but on what it can be, and on what it needs to be. And that means doing bold things. A lot of what we're building today in the areas like connectivity, artificial intelligence and virtual and augmented reality may not pay off for years. But they're important to our mission of connecting the world. And I'm committed to seeing this mission through and to leading Facebook there over the long term.
Personally, there's another element to this. While helping to connect the world will always be the most important thing that I do, there are more global challenges that I also feel a responsibility to help solve, to create a better world for my daughter and all future generation. Things like helping to cure all disease by the end of the century, upgrading our education system so it's personalized for each student and protecting our environment from climate change. That's why Priscilla and I created the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and committed to give 99% of our Facebook shares to advance human potential and promote equality.
Today's Board proposal will allow us to maintain and improve the voting structure that has served us well and allow me to fund the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. In December, I also announced that I won't sell more than $1 billion worth of stock -- Facebook shares per year over the next 3 years. That's still my commitment, and I'll update our shareholders on the future plans beyond that.
Dave will talk more about the mechanics of this proposal in his comments in just a few minutes. But before we get there, I want to also share a few more thoughts on the progress we've made this quarter. As I said before, our roadmap has 3 horizons: over the next 3 years, we're going to keep investing in our most developed ecosystem, the Facebook app and platform. Today, people around the world spend on average more than 50 minutes a day using Facebook, Instagram and Messenger, and that doesn't even include WhatsApp yet. This growth isn't happening because we came up with just 1 or 2 big changes. Our team has just worked day after day on lots of improvements over a long period of time. And that progress continued in the first quarter. We launched Reactions to help people express themselves in more ways, and we improved our product to work on different mobile networks and devices all over the world. 
Sheryl will talk more about this in a minute, but now, more than 3 million businesses are using our advertising products every month. We've expanded our measurement capabilities, so more businesses can see the results they get from ads. We've made it easier for small and medium businesses to use the same targeting tools and ad formats that our larger advertisers use. 
Over the next 5 years, we're going to build the ecosystems around our products that are already being used by a lot of people. We're at the beginning of a golden age of online video. Video isn't just a single kind of content. We think it's a medium that allows people to interact in a lot of new ways. So that's why in addition to normal Internet video, we're also focusing on more interactive video experiences like Live and 360 video. 
I'm a big Game of Thrones fan, and the other week, HBO and our Oculus team came out with a 360 video of the opening sequence of the show, and it's now the most-watched 360 video on Facebook in any 24-hour period, with more than 12 million total views. 
Earlier this month, we opened up Live to everyone. Live is just one part of our overall video effort, but we think it has a lot of potential. Friends go live because it's unfiltered and personal. Actors and news anchors go live because they can reach bigger audiences, in some cases, than they can on, even on their own show. And if we do a good job, we think it's something that people will associate with Facebook, with interacting with people and not just watching content. But it's also a very new and a small part of all of the videos that we see on Facebook today.
I'm also really excited about what we're building around messaging. Right now, we have 2 of the top messaging apps in the world. 900 million people use Messenger every month and 1 billion people use WhatsApp every month. Between Messenger and WhatsApp, people send around 60 billion messages every day. That's almost 3x as many messages as SMS handled at its peak. 
Over the past couple of weeks, we've talked about steps we're taking to build messaging into a platform that developers and businesses can build on. We announced bots for Messenger, that let you do things like order flowers or get news without leaving your messenger thread. So this is all very early, and we're rolling these experiences out carefully and slowly over time. 
We're also very happy with the way that Instagram is growing, with more than 400 million actives and more than 200,000 businesses advertising every month. Now we're focused on making the user experience even more engaging. With more content on Instagram all the time, people are currently missing about 70% of what's in their feed. So that's why in the first quarter, we started rolling out feed ranking to help you see more of the posts that you care about. 
And this is a long-term effort, but News Feed shows that ranking creates the best and most engaging experiences for our community. Over the next 10 years, we're going to keep investing in new technology to help everyone connect. As part of internet.org, we're building an open-source telco infrastructure project called TIP to make it cheaper to operate mobile networks. Free Basics, which helps people access tools for education, health information and communication for free, now features more than 600 services, and it has brought more than 25 million people online. That makes it one of the most successful connectivity initiatives in the world.
We're also working to help people connect and share in a more natural and intuitive way. Artificial intelligence is a long-term effort for us but we're already using it in lots of ways. Right now, our Moments app is using face recognition to help you share pictures with your friends. 
We're using AIs to show the most relevant content in News Feeds, filter spam and messaging and even help blind people understand what's in their friend's photos by reading explanations of them aloud. 
Finally, we're building technology in virtual and augmented reality that can change the way that we all experience of the world. Gear VR started shipping late last year and the response so far has been great. There are now hundreds of apps built specifically for Gear, and people have watched more than 2 million hours of video on it. 
In Q1, we also started shipping Oculus Rift. Now we've got a lot of great content with more than 50 games and apps built for Rift. And again, this is very early and we don't expect VR to take off as a mainstream success right away. I really want to emphasize that. Most Rift early adopters are gamers and developers, but eventually, we believe that VR is going to be the next big computing platform, and we're making the investments necessary to lead the way there.
So that's our update for the quarter. As always, everything we do is focused on our mission to make the world more open and connected. And to get there, we're building technology that brings people together and that helps everyone in the world share anything they want with anyone. It takes a long-term commitment and it won't happen overnight, but we're in a strong position, and I'm excited about what's next. So thank you to everyone in our community, to all of our teams, all of our partners and all of our shareholders for everything you're doing to help connect the world. And now here's Sheryl."
20765463,330038583,965147,"Facebook, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2016",2016-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Meta Platforms, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Mark, and hi, everyone. We had a great first quarter and a strong start to the year. Q1 ad revenue grew 57% or 63% on a constant currency basis. Mobile ad revenue reached $4.2 billion, up 75% year-over-year, and is now approximately 82% of total",791,"Thanks, Mark, and hi, everyone. 
We had a great first quarter and a strong start to the year. Q1 ad revenue grew 57% or 63% on a constant currency basis. Mobile ad revenue reached $4.2 billion, up 75% year-over-year, and is now approximately 82% of total ad revenue. Our growth was strong across all verticals, marketer segments and regions, particularly North America and APAC. 
We remained focused on driving our clients businesses, moving their products off shelves both in stores and online. A big focus for us in 2016 is helping our clients understand the true business impact of their ads, especially on digital. 
We're pleased with the progress we made in Q1 across our 3 priorities: capitalizing on the shift to mobile; growing the number of marketers using our ad products; and making our ads more relevant and effective. 
First, capitalizing on the shift to mobile. Consumers have shifted to mobile, and businesses know they need to catch up. We hear from marketers that figuring out mobile today is like figuring out TV in its early days. But given where consumers spend their time, the question now is not if they should market on mobile, but how. 
One of the drivers of the consumer shift to mobile is video. People are sharing and creating nearly 3x more video on Facebook than they were a year ago. And as of February, the time people spend watching videos on Instagram increased by more than 40% over the preceding 6 months. This presents a big opportunity for marketers. 
The best marketers understand that people watch video differently in mobile feed than on TV. They create ads that grab attention in the first few seconds, sometimes even without sounds, what we now call [indiscernible] stopping creative. For example, Nestle took their TV ad for Natural Bliss Coffee Creamer, and in less than a day, edited it for mobile feed by creating a new opening and adding text overlays to relay their message without sound. They showed both the original TV ad and the mobile ad on Facebook. The original TV ad drove a 4-point increase in ad recall. The mobile-optimized version, however, drove an even stronger 10-point increase in ad recall and a 7-point increase in product awareness. 
We want to help marketers optimize their video ads. For example, we know that on average, captioned videos increase view time by 12%, so we introduced auto captions to generate captions for video ads. In Q1, we introduced new ad formats like Canvas ads. Canvas ads showcase products by combining video images and call for action button. While it's still early, we're pleased with the results and are seeing adoption across many verticals. 
To motivate millennials to take on do-it-yourself projects, [indiscernible] and [indiscernible] targeted 25- to 34-year-old homeowners with Canvas ads that let them see bathroom designs, discover the products in each design and tap to purchase. The ads were so engaging that people spent an average of 28 seconds interacting with them and loads saw a 6.7x return on ad spend.
Our second priority is growing the number of marketers using our ad products. This quarter, we announced that we have over 3 million active advertisers on Facebook and over 200,000 on Instagram. A significant number of these advertisers are small and medium businesses. These businesses use our platform because it's easy and affordable for them to connect with their consumers on mobile. 
We're also making it easier for SMBs to use the same targeting tools and ad formats that our most sophisticated advertisers use. We're seeing even small businesses use products like lead ads, Slideshow and Dynamic Product Ad. [ph] 
Our third priority is improving the relevance and effectiveness of our ads. Last year, we introduced conversion lift to measure how Facebook and Instagram campaigns drive business objectives like sales. We've seen clients across verticals from retail to auto use conversion lift to measure and improve the return on their ad investment. 
Chase Bank used conversion lift to measure how effectively their Super Bowl ad drove credit card applications. They found that combining Facebook video ads with their TV ads drove 1.5x more conversion than TV ads alone. In Q1, we expanded our lift capabilities by testing lift API, enabling more partners to measure the effectiveness of more of their campaigns. 
We're pleased with the value we're driving for our partners and the progress we're making across our 3 priorities. Helping marketers make the shift to mobile will take time. We have a lot of hard work ahead and will continue to invest. I want to thank our clients around the world for their partnership and congratulate our global team on the results of their hard work. Thanks, everyone, and now here's Dave."
20765463,330038583,965147,"Facebook, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2016",2016-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Meta Platforms, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Sheryl, and good afternoon, everyone. We're off to a great start in 2016, led by the ongoing growth and engagement in our community and continued momentum in our ads business. In Q1, we generated $5.4 billion in total revenue and delivered over $1",1371,"Thanks, Sheryl, and good afternoon, everyone. We're off to a great start in 2016, led by the ongoing growth and engagement in our community and continued momentum in our ads business. In Q1, we generated $5.4 billion in total revenue and delivered over $1.8 billion in free cash flow. Let's begin with our community metrics.
In March, 1.09 billion people used Facebook on an average day, up 16% compared to last year. This daily number represents 66% of the 1.65 billion people who visited Facebook in the month of March. Mobile continues to drive our growth. Over 1.5 billion people accessed Facebook for mobile devices in March, up 21% from last year. 
Before diving into our quarterly financial results, I wanted to highlight that beginning this quarter, I will focus my prepared remarks on our GAAP results and our -- all financial metrics are GAAP, unless otherwise noted. The primary difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP metrics is stock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation plays an important role in how we compensate our employees, and therefore, we view it as a real expense for the business. We will continue to provide a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial metrics in our press release and earnings slides. All of our comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted.
Q1 total revenue was $5.4 billion, up 52% or 58% on a constant currency basis. Ad revenue in Q1 was $5.2 billion, up 57% or 63% on a constant currency basis. This marks a slight decline from the 66% constant currency ad growth rate we experienced in Q4. 
In Q1 this year, we benefited from an additional day due to the leap year, which contributed approximately 2 percentage points to our year-over-year ad revenue growth rate. North America and Asia-Pacific were our fastest-growing regions, with advertising revenue growth of 64% and 62%, respectively. Europe and Rest of World grew advertising revenue more slowly at 49% and 35%, respectively, with the latter particularly impacted by foreign exchange headwinds. Setting aside currency headwinds, all regions exceeded 50% constant currency ad revenue growth. 
Mobile ad revenue was $4.2 billion, representing approximately 82% of total ad revenue. Mobile ad revenue grew 75%, driven by strength from Facebook's News Feed. Our mobile apps business continues to be driven by the combination of both supply-side and demand-side factors. 
On the supply side, we continue to see healthy growth in the number of people using Facebook, time spent across our products and app loads. On the demand side, we believe the investments we've made to improve our mobile advertising solutions are helping drive value for both people and marketers. We are seeing growth in both new customers as well as existing customers who are spending more with us on average compared to last year.
In Q1, the average price per ad increased 5% while total ad impressions increased 50%. The reported increase in price is being driven by the continued mix shift towards mobile, which contained higher-priced News Feed ads rather than the mix we have on PCs of both News Feed ads and lower-priced right-hand column ads. 
The increase in impressions was driven by strong growth in mobile ad impressions and was offset partially by a decline in ad impressions delivered on personal computers, consistent with the ongoing declines in PC usage. 
The increase in -- sorry, total payments and other fees revenue was $181 million, down 20% compared to last year. This decline was mainly driven by a reduction in payments revenue related to games played on personal computers. 
Q1 total cost and expenses were $3.4 billion, up 29%. We ended the quarter with approximately 13,600 employees, up 35% compared to last year. Q1 operating income was $2 billion, representing a 37% operating margin. Our Q1 tax rate was 27%, down from our full year 2015 tax rate of 40%. Our Q1 net income was approximately $1.5 billion or $0.52 per share.
In Q1, capital expenditures were $1.1 billion, more than double compared to Q1 of last year. Server purchases and data center construction were the largest contributors to year-over-year growth. New builds in Texas and Ireland, along with the expansion of existing facilities, will nearly double our current data center footprint when completed. In addition to servers and data centers, investments in office facilities also contributed to the year-over-year growth. We ended the quarter with $20.6 billion in cash and investments.
Turning now to the outlook. First, some color on revenue. We remained focused on creating value for the people and marketers who use our services. We expect that the main drivers of advertising revenue growth will continue throughout 2016, but we will face tougher comparables as the year progresses, given the accelerating ad revenue growth we experienced throughout 2015. 
Payments and other fees revenues will continue to face headwinds throughout the year given that the substantial majority of that revenue relates to payments from games played on personal computers. Even with the expected contribution from Oculus, we anticipate that our payments and other fees revenue for the full year 2016 will come in lower than the level in 2015.
Next, onto the expense outlook. Our expense guidance remains unchanged. We expect that full year 2016 total GAAP expense growth will be approximately 30% to 40%. We expect full year 2016 amortization expenses to be approximately $700 million to $800 million, and full year 2016 stock-based compensation expenses to be approximately $3.1 billion to $3.3 billion. 
If you take into account our GAAP expense guidance, as well as our amortization and FPC guidance, you'll see that our full year 2016 total non-GAAP expense growth guidance range remains unchanged at 45% to 55%. We anticipate full year 2016 capital expenditures to be at the high end of the $4 billion to $4.5 billion range we gave last quarter as we invested to support the rapid growth of the business. We expect our Q2 and full year 2016 tax rates to be similar to our Q1 rates.
In summary, 2016 is off to a great start for Facebook. Our results reflect healthy growth and engagement in our community, strength in our ads business and investments we're making to capitalize on the long-term opportunities we see ahead. 
Before going to questions, I wanted to touch briefly on the share reclassification that Mark discussed at the beginning of the call. As we disclosed in the proxy statement we filed today, our Board of Directors has approved a proposal for the reclassification of our capital stock that would involve the creation of a newly -- of a new class of publicly listed nonvoting Class C capital stock. 
Pending stockholder approval, we intend to issue 2 Class C shares as a one-time stock dividend for each outstanding Class A and Class B share, resulting in a tripling of the pre-reclassification total shares outstanding. All stockholders would be treated equally. 
The net effect of this transaction would be to establish 2 publicly traded classes of Facebook stock, one representing the current Class A shares and the other representing the nonvoting Class B shares. Since the Class C shares would have the same economic rights as the Class A and Class B shares, we would expect that after the payment of the stock dividend, the share price of the Class A common stock would generally reflect a 3-for-1 stock split.
This will have no effect on the voting interests related to shares that investors currently hold. As Mark mentioned, this structure will allow for the preservation of the voting structure that has served the company well to-date, while allowing for Mark to fund the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative over the course of his lifetime. Importantly, as part of this proposal, the preservation of the multi-class capital structure would be generally predicated on Mark continuing to maintain an active leadership role at Facebook. 
Let me talk about next steps. The reclassification would be conditioned on approval by a majority of outstanding votes held by company stockholders, and we anticipate a vote on the matter at our annual meeting to be held on June 20 this year. A record date for this dividend will be determined at a later day. 
With that, Chris, let's open up the call for questions."

SMBs or SMEs, as they're called in different places around the world, we think are very core competitive advantage for us. It's prohibitively expensive for those small businesses to reach people digitally. 35% of small businesses in the United States, which is often the most advanced market, don't have a web presence at all. And setting up a mobile app, getting people to find and download a mobile app can be even more expensive. And so what's happening is that SMBs are turning to Facebook pages as their mobile solution. They're free, they're easy to set up, and they already know how to do them because almost all of them are already Facebook users in the first place. And so the onboarding has been incredibly important and incredibly attractive. We announced last year that we have over 50 million small business pages active on a monthly basis. 80% of those are active on mobile. We then work on helping them use our ad products and upsell them through our paid ads products as well. And we announced this quarter that we hit 3 million active advertisers on Facebook and 200,000 on Instagram. What's interesting is that, what you see is SMBs able to used to go with some of the biggest brands in the world. With over 2 million SMBs have posted a video, both paid and organic, in the last month, and that has to be many times the number of SMBs that have shot or placed a TV commercial. In terms of measurement, your question's important because it's not just getting them to use our platforms to connect to consumers, it's getting them to be able to measure our results. And so we've worked hard to build the measurement tools into the products, so that when you buy an ad, SMBs, in a very easy interface and decide what their goals are. Are their goals measuring sales? Are their goals cross into their website? Are their goals mobile app downloads and then measuring all the way through, from showing that ad to the purchase? I continue and we continue to be very bullish on this channel because we have such a broad base of usage, because that usage is so active, and because we're very focused on investing in simplifying our products, so that all SMBs can use them."

Our growth was really broad-based, and we grew across all of our markets or segments this quarter. That's direct response, brands, SMB and developer. Our direct response business continues to be very strong. It's very ROI-focused and we continue to invest and roll out products that help people. So for example, lead ads, where people can sell out forms on a mobile device, take their contacts itself on Facebook. We rolled that out fully this quarter. And that enabled people to use Facebook in a very direct to response way, and we'll continue to invest there. Video ads are really exciting. It's worth noting that video ads take place at another ad agencies, they're not all of the revenues and incrementals, but as consumer engagement with video has continued to grow, that creates more and more of an opportunity for video ads. Marketers have always loved video because it's a really compelling way to reach people. And this -- now, you can reach them on mobile all day with those kind of messages. Importantly, marketers have to adjust sometimes. While the 30-second ad does perform well in News Feed, we also have people understanding that some of the formats are different, creating shorter ads, creating ads that can work even without sound, more personal ads has really mattered. One example is, Toyota used Facebook for the launch of the RAV4 Hybrid. With Sachi in Los Angeles, they used a very broad video to drive brand awareness. They've reached over 36 million people in their target demo within 3 days. Then, and this is where it gets even more interesting, they retargeted people who watched the video with over 500 personalized video ads that were optimized for Facebook and Instagram. So they were creating a direct response campaign to get people to take specific actions, like requesting a quote and finding a specific dealer. We saw 14 -- a 14-point lift in ad recall, a 7-point lift in message association. And right now, we're using the LIVE tool to continue to measure their sales for the 30 and 60 days beyond this campaign to see what happens. And we're pretty excited about what that shows in terms of how videos can be used in a really broad-based way but also a more personal way."

So part of our playbook for building out these ecosystems of scale is we start with the person-to-person use case, right? So whether that's in messaging, if people are messaging their friends or Groups. In News Feed before that, it was people posting updates and then seeing what is going on with friends and the people that they care about. And then the next step is to create organic activity around public entities, right? So whether that's businesses, public figures -- I don't know like athletes, celebrities and types of folks that people want to interact with on these different platforms, we did that on Facebook and News Feed though pages, and we're working on a number of different ways to do that in Messenger. One of those is bots. And one of the good things about bots that we've seen is that it can increase -- or sorry, decrease the amount of time that you have to wait before you get a reply back from interaction with a message. So what we've seen, we've done some research on this. A lot of people every day, in Facebook today, are already messaging pages and businesses directly. And they -- the businesses respond. But what we've actually also found is that, through some of our AI research, we can look at the responses that businesses give to common questions and can confidently provide the right reply a lot of the time. And when we can do that, then that decreases the latency, and predictably, people want to do more of that activity. So that's one way that I think you're going to see bots work between people who are actually driving the businesses directly will need to, in some way, train or answer questions for people. But we can build artificial intelligence that can learn from people, how to automate a lot of that and make that experience a lot faster for people who want to interact with businesses and public figures. And you know, of course then, after you start building out that segment of businesses and public figures and the platform. Then on top of that, you have just a good amount of intent in these platforms to build a good business on top of that, that's kind of Stage 3."

They're a popular airline in China, but they don't really have -- they're not really as well known overseas. And before working with us, they really only invested in traditional media. They had a goal of providing new flight routes, including one from Mumbai to Beijing in their new aircraft. So the launched a campaign with us in 15 countries globally. They used the reach and frequency and [indiscernible] and video ad targeting. And, for example, they would target in the U.S. age 18 and above, frequent international travelers, living in cities where they had roots or Indian expats living in the U.S. to promote their new route to Mumbai. They reached 30 million people globally, more than 95% on mobile. And here's the best part, they had a 73% sales lift in the United States.

So overall sharing is up across Facebook, and people are spending more time on Facebook and the whole family of apps. And that is not just the case for the aggregate of the growing community, but it's actually also the case on a per person basis as well, in terms of people sharing more and spending more time individually. Now one of the things that we see is that, the way that we are sharing is always changing, right? And some of this is because of underlying technical transitions. So, you know, on desktop, for example, it was easier to type, so we saw more text posts. In mobile, it's easier to take videos, so we see more videos. On desktop, people would have more commonly uploaded an album of photos that they took from their digital camera, and downloaded onto their computer, whereas on mobile the more common behavior is to take a single photo or a couple, and just post those. So all these transitions -- and that's our job, right, is to make it so that we build great tools that people, everyone around the world, can share anything that they want with everyone. Now the other thing that's also true is that people want to share with lots of different kinds of audience. So Facebook gives you the ability to share with all of your friends, and publicly if you want, and with groups. But we're also investing in things like Messenger and WhatsApp, because a lot of people want to share, increasingly, messages, privately one-on-one or with very small groups. So in addition to Messenger, which is a 900 million people a month and WhatsApp, which is at more than 1 billion people a month. Facebook Groups is also at more than 1 billion people a month, which I think represents the increasing diversity of the different types of audiences that people want to share with. But ultimately, I think that -- humans have such a deep desire to express themselves and want to connect with the people around them that I think that all of these audiences and all of these different types of media should grow over time. And it's our job to basically make sure that we build good products, and get rid of all the bugs, and make it that their performance is fast and all the basic stuff works that way we get there. But in general, right now, all the high level trends look pretty positive on that. I think I'll kick it off to Dave to go through your questions about the -- some of the technical pieces about the reclassification."

And then, that's enabled us to show more of them without harming the user experience at all. So that's been really a key. Over time, we would expect that ad load growth will be a less significant factor driving overall revenue growth, but we remain confident that we've got opportunity to grow supply through the continued growth in people and engagement on Facebook, as well as on our other apps such as Instagram. On the question regarding what would happen to Mark's shares if he were to leave Facebook, I would -- I just kind of refer that the new multiclass capital structure is generally dependent on Mark continuing to maintain an active leadership role at Facebook.

And the basic theory that we have is that there are a small number of services that are going to be ubiquitous utilities that 1 billion or 2 billion or more people are going to want to use, right? So that's kind of core basic messaging, right? The core functionality around having your real identity and connecting with all of your real friends and family online. Those are things that we think are going to be ubiquitous. And we want to build those. At the same time, we also think that there are going to be many, many good businesses, and different other social use cases, where there are people doing good work and building different companies that we feel no need to own those things. So when I think -- and people come up from time to time and suggest to us, should we buy this company or that, you know what we look at are, what are the things that we think are going to be ubiquitous tools, and who are the most talented people in the world to build this? And so when you think about something like virtual and augmented reality, that's how we thought about that. This is -- those are going to be important platforms over time. It's very early, obviously, we're going to take a long time to get there. And a lot of what we felt like we were buying there was a critical mass of the best people and the best technology to go do all the things that we needed to go do over the next 10 years to drive that home and turn that into a big platform. And you asked a question about virtual and augmented reality, what are going to be the big use cases? I mean, for the first few years of virtual reality, I think gaming and video are going to be the big one, right. I mean the initial market that we look at are all the people who have Xbox and PlayStation that we use, right. The people who are excited to have an immersive media experience sitting in their living room for a long period of time. And that's a pretty big market. And even though that's not all of what we hope to eventually serve, and that's not the full potential of these new platforms, I think that is one case where you can obviously deliver better and richer experiences than what you can with the current generation of technology. Video is going really well. I shared a stat for in some of my comments that on Gear VR alone, we're now at more than 2 million hours of video have been watched in from the platform, so that's really exciting. And that, of course, will be bolstered by the fact that these new kind of 360 videos can not only be watched in VR, so in the headsets, but we're building tools that you can share them on News Feed and through our products elsewhere as well. So I think that's exciting, over time there will be even more, but that I should be enough to have some initial use. But again, I do want to reemphasize, this is early and it's going to take a long time. And as you know there's a lot of hype around this, and we're just focused on building this to be very good over the long term."

So in the basic human senses seeing, hearing, language, kind of core thing is that we do. I think it's possible to get to the point in the next 5 to 10 years where we have computer systems that are better than people at each of those things. That doesn't mean that the computers will be thinking, or be generally better, but that is useful for a number of things. So for example, I talked about earlier, we are building this moments app, so that way, you can take photos on your phone and if you use this app, our face recognition can look at the photos that you take and suggest that you might want to share photos that you took with a friend of them, with that person, right. So that way, all the photos that might be of you and your friends' camera rolls, they can share with you. Another example is just spam filtering, right, and just making sure that we can actually read the content and understand what's interesting to you or not, and not show that. One obvious thing, I think over time, is if you just look at the way that we rank News Feed. Today, we use some basic signals like who you're friends with, and what pages you like, as some of the most important things for figuring out what, out of all of the millions and millions of pieces of content that are on Facebook, what we're going to show, and what are going to be the most interesting things to you. And you know, that's because today, our systems can actually understand what the content means. We don't actually look at the photo and deeply understand what's in it or look at the videos and understand what's in it or read the links that people share and understand what's in them. But in the future, we'll be able to, I think, on a 5- or 10-year period. So all of these millions and millions of pieces of content that are out there, whether or not you've added some of friend or have liked a page, we'll be able to know a lot better, what types of things are going to be interesting to you to produce a much better feed of content. So that's how just some basic example of where having a human level perception broadly is going to yield better experiences and a lot of the things that people care about today."

Therefore, should we be thinking about a longer-term transition from a platform that's basically all ad to something where more marketplace capability is offered, given that buyers and both sellers are so known and so connected? And if so, can we think about Facebook starting to monetize, maybe on a transaction basis or even through various customer support capabilities via the messaging tools, AI, et cetera that you're beginning to offer businesses. So maybe if you could just kind of provide a little bit of color on how you see that evolution, that would be great."

We're also testing some incremental features in pages, which enable businesses to drive purchases on a page or direct people directly to their website. These are really early, but we've had some positive feedback. Our focus, however, continues to be on our ad products because we think we can take people all the way from the top of the funnel, where they can really get a brand awareness or product awareness, and go all the way down to purchase. Not necessarily because the purchase is happening on Facebook, but because we can work on the measurement system to understand how the advertising, both at the top and lower down in the funnel, is influencing those purchases. We've been really excited by what we've seen in the commerce vertical of our ad products. There are products like dynamic product ads, carousel ads are working really well for us. This quarter, we launched Canvas ads, which are very fast-loading immersive mobile ads. They're easy to build, you can use a self-service tool. You don't have to write any code. They are native format, so they decrease that initial drop off you see when people click off to another site. Very early days, but the average viewing time is over 30 seconds, which shows how immersive that is. I'll share one example of how ads are driving a small business on Facebook through ads, which is a company called Sparkle and Paint. They're a Utah-based SMB, they're selling girls' clothing. They did a slide show ad that included a Shop Now button, which enabled you to take action on their site. They were able to increase sales by 9% per month. And more exciting for us, this was 6x more efficient in terms of acquisitions than any other digital media channel. And that shows how you can use our ad products to go all the way from awareness, measuring through to a sale, and show how important our ads can be to commerce on our platform."

We are not rolling out any monetization products on WhatsApp right now, but we did start that process at F8 on Messenger. And what we're doing is following the organic activity that's happening on the Messenger platform. Businesses and consumers are using Messenger to connect to each other in a more personal, more immediate way. And we rolled out a platform data, which gives new opportunities to build compelling experiences. Bots, very early, but giving the opportunity for more personal interactions between businesses and mobile. They tend to [ph] receive API so that businesses could send immediate responses to common questions, including engaging images and call to action as well as text. In terms of the timing, this is really early. We have a lot of opportunity to invest in advertising across our different platforms. And so we want to make sure we get this right, as we focus on continued engagement. You're right that over time, when we make these investments, we are going to be able to rely on some of the core aspects of the ads infrastructure. Certainly, our long ad -- our base of advertisers, some of the things that we understand about how ads perform and the functionality, will be an important part of the product offerings in the future.

So I wonder if you could just comment on where your share gains are coming from in your view? And then, Mark, on Live video, I realize it's just a small part of overall video. But I wonder, do you think multiple platforms can succeed in live streaming over time, given the size of the market longer term? Or do you think it's more of a network effect business, where a vast majority of the traffic and economics will ultimately accrue to the leader in the live streaming space?"

I don't think this means that all of our expense comes and -- that all of our growth comes at the expense of any one channel, but it's broad-based. And often, TV and Facebook and Instagram can work really well together. I'll give a fun example from this Super Bowl. T-Mobile wanted to use their Super Bowl campaign to increase their brand awareness and increase their reach. So before the game, they targeted their 30-second Super Bowl ad that featured Drake to NFL and people with NFL and celebrity interest. It performed so well that they decided to run a 60-second version on Facebook and Instagram. That ad was so successful on Facebook and Instagram that they then ran the 60-second ad on TV, instead of their 30-second ad. So as people invest, they can use these different platforms together, and we're pretty excited to see that progress."

And I think that, that's a huge opportunity, not just in live video but in a lot of the things that we're talking about. And one interesting example recently, that I touched on earlier is, between Messenger and WhatsApp, we're around 60 billion messages a day. And sorry -- sorry, SMS at its peak, we think, was around 20 billion messages a day. And just unlocking some of the friction that existed in SMS and improving the product a little bit, and removing the small fee that was there has just unlocked a huge amount of expression. And we think that this is going to be the case in all different types of media and with all different audiences that a person would share with. So in video, there are billions and billions of videos that are viewed every day on Facebook. Live is a very small part of it. The reason why we give disproportionate attention to it, is because we're trying to help push forward new formats that are not just about consuming content but are really about interacting. So Live, 360 video and there'll be others in the future. And so, yes, I mean, in terms of your question, I do think that multiple products and companies can succeed in building these things. I also think that there are going to be a lot more interactive forms of video than just Live and 360, like we're talking about now. And I think of this expense not just to video but for all of the different types of media and audiences that we're serving. So we are -- we're very excited about continuing to do our work, to help unlock all the expression and connection that people want to do."

We started 2016 off well. 1.65 billion people now use Facebook every month and 1.09 billion people use Facebook every day. In recent weeks, we're also consistently seeing more than 1 billion people using Facebook on mobile every day. 
We're also pleased with our business results. Total revenue this quarter grew by 52% year-on-year to $5.4 billion, and advertising revenue grew by 57% to $5.2 billion. I'll have more to say about these results in a minute, but first I want to talk about a proposal by our Board of Directors to reclassify Facebook's stock. 
At F8, I talked about our mission and how the work we're doing to connect the world is more important today than it's ever been. I walked through our 10-year roadmap, focused on building the technology to give everyone in world the power to share anything with anyone. Bringing people together and giving everyone a voice takes a long-term commitment, not just over the next few years but over the next few decades. 
We're focused on the long term. And that's the main reason for today's proposal. Facebook has always been a founder-like company, so we can focus on our mission and build long-term value. This structure has served our shareholders well. Early on, we received some generous offers for companies trying to buy Facebook, and our structure helped us resist that pressure. 
More recently, we navigated a challenging transition to mobile, but because we were a controlled company, we were able to focus on improving the user and product experience of our apps first, and then build a strong mobile business over time rather than being forced to do something shortsighted. And over the years, our structure has helped us make big bets on acquisitions like Instagram that were very controversial initially but were good decisions for our community and our business. 
Facebook has been built by a series of bold moves. And when I look out at the future, I see more bold moves ahead of us than behind us. We're focused not on what Facebook is, but on what it can be, and on what it needs to be. And that means doing bold things. A lot of what we're building today in the areas like connectivity, artificial intelligence and virtual and augmented reality may not pay off for years. But they're important to our mission of connecting the world. And I'm committed to seeing this mission through and to leading Facebook there over the long term.
Personally, there's another element to this. While helping to connect the world will always be the most important thing that I do, there are more global challenges that I also feel a responsibility to help solve, to create a better world for my daughter and all future generations. Things like helping to cure all disease by the end of the century, upgrading our education system so it's personalized for each student and protecting our environment from climate change. That's why Priscilla and I created the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and committed to give 99% of our Facebook shares to advance human potential and promote equality.
Today's Board proposal will allow us to maintain and improve the voting structure that has served us well and allow me to fund the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. In December, I also announced that I won't sell more than $1 billion worth of stock -- Facebook shares per year over the next 3 years. That's still my commitment, and I'll update our shareholders on the future plans beyond that.
Dave will talk more about the mechanics of this proposal in his comments in just a few minutes. But before we get there, I want to also share a few more thoughts on the progress we've made this quarter. As I said before, our roadmap has 3 horizons. Over the next 3 years, we're going to keep investing in our most developed ecosystem, the Facebook app and platform. Today, people around the world spend on average more than 50 minutes a day using Facebook, Instagram and Messenger, and that doesn't even include WhatsApp yet. This growth isn't happening because we came up with just 1 or 2 big changes. Our team has just worked day after day on lots of improvements over a long period of time. And that progress continued in the first quarter. We launched Reactions to help people express themselves in more ways, and we improved our product to work on different mobile networks and devices all over the world. 
Sheryl will talk more about this in a minute, but now, more than 3 million businesses are using our advertising products every month. We've expanded our measurement capabilities, so more businesses can see the results they get from ads. We've made it easier for small and medium businesses to use the same targeting tools and ad formats that our larger advertisers use. 
Over the next 5 years, we're going to build the ecosystems around our products that are already being used by a lot of people. We're at the beginning of a golden age of online video. Video isn't just a single kind of content. We think it's a medium that allows people to interact in a lot of new ways. So that's why in addition to normal Internet video, we're also focusing on more interactive video experiences like Live and 360 video. 
I'm a big Game of Thrones fan, and the other week, HBO and our Oculus team came out with a 360 video of the opening sequence of the show, and it's now the most-watched 360 video on Facebook in any 24-hour period, with more than 12 million total views. 
Earlier this month, we opened up Live to everyone. Live is just one part of our overall video effort, but we think it has a lot of potential. Friends go live because it's unfiltered and personal. Actors and news anchors go live because they can reach bigger audiences, in some cases, than they can on, even on their own shows. And if we do a good job, we think it's something that people will associate with Facebook, with interacting with people and not just watching content. But it's also a very new and a small part of all of the videos that we see on Facebook today.
I'm also really excited about what we're building around messaging. Right now, we have 2 of the top messaging apps in the world. 900 million people use Messenger every month and 1 billion people use WhatsApp every month. Between Messenger and WhatsApp, people send around 60 billion messages every day. That's almost 3x as many messages as SMS handled at its peak. 
Over the past couple of weeks, we've talked about steps we're taking to build messaging into a platform that developers and businesses can build on. We have bots for Messenger, that let you do things like order flowers or get news without leaving your messenger thread. So this is all very early, and we're rolling these experiences out carefully and slowly over time. 
We're also very happy with the way that Instagram is growing, with more than 400 million actives and more than 200,000 businesses advertising every month. Now we're focused on making the user experience even more engaging. With more content on Instagram all the time, people are currently missing about 70% of what's in their feed. So that's why in the first quarter, we started rolling out feed ranking to help you see more of the posts that you care about. 
And this is a long-term effort, but News Feed shows that ranking creates the best and most engaging experiences for our community. Over the next 10 years, we're going to keep investing in new technology to help everyone connect. As part of internet.org, we're building an open-source telco infrastructure project called TIP to make it cheaper to operate mobile networks. Free Basics, which helps people access tools for education, health information and communication for free, now features more than 600 services, and it has brought more than 25 million people online. That makes it one of the most successful connectivity initiatives in the world.
We're also working to help people connect and share in a more natural and intuitive way. Artificial intelligence is a long-term effort for us but we're already using it in lots of ways. Right now, our Moments app is using face recognition to help you share pictures with your friends. 
We're using AIs to show the most relevant content in News Feeds, filter spam and messaging and even help blind people understand what's in their friend's photos by reading explanations of them aloud. 
Finally, we're building technology in virtual and augmented reality that can change the way that we all experience of the world. Gear VR started shipping late last year and the response so far has been great. There are now hundreds of apps built specifically for Gear, and people have watched more than 2 million hours of video on it. 
In Q1, we also started shipping Oculus Rift. Now we've got a lot of great content with more than 50 games and apps built for Rift. And again, this is very early and we don't expect VR to take off as a mainstream success right away. I really want to emphasize that. Most Rift early adopters are gamers and developers, but eventually, we believe that VR is going to be the next big computing platform, and we're making the investments necessary to lead the way there.
So that's our update for the quarter. As always, everything we do is focused on our mission to make the world more open and connected. And to get there, we're building technology that brings people together and that helps everyone in the world share anything they want with anyone. It takes a long-term commitment and it won't happen overnight, but we're in a strong position, and I'm excited about what's next. So thank you to everyone in our community, to all of our teams, all of our partners and all of our shareholders for everything you're doing to help connect the world. And now here's Sheryl."

We had a great first quarter and a strong start to the year. Q1 ad revenue grew 57% or 63% on a constant currency basis.

We had a great first quarter and a strong start to the year. Q1 ad revenue grew 57% or 63% on a constant currency basis. Mobile ad revenue reached $4.2 billion, up 75% year-over-year, and is now approximately 82% of total ad revenue. Our growth was strong across all verticals, marketer segments and regions, particularly North America and APAC. 
We remained focused on driving our clients businesses, moving their products off shelves both in stores and online. A big focus for us in 2016 is helping our clients understand the true business impact of their ads, especially on digital. 
We're pleased with the progress we made in Q1 across our 3 priorities: capitalizing on the shift to mobile; growing the number of marketers using our ad products; and making our ads more relevant and effective. 
First, capitalizing on the shift to mobile. Consumers have shifted to mobile, and businesses know they need to catch up. We hear from marketers that figuring out mobile today is like figuring out TV in its early days. But given where consumers spend their time, the question now is not if they should market on mobile, but how. 
One of the drivers of the consumer shift to mobile is video. People are sharing and creating nearly 3x more video on Facebook than they were a year ago. And as of February, the time people spend watching videos on Instagram increased by more than 40% over the preceding 6 months. This presents a big opportunity for marketers. 
The best marketers understand that people watch video differently in mobile feed than on TV. They create ads that grab attention in the first few seconds, sometimes even without sound, what we now call [indiscernible] stopping creative. For example, Nestle took their TV ad for Natural Bliss Coffee Creamer, and in less than a day, edited it for mobile feed by creating a new opening and adding text overlays to relay their message without sound. They showed both the original TV ad and the mobile ad on Facebook. The original TV ad drove a 4-point increase in ad recall. The mobile-optimized version, however, drove an even stronger 10-point increase in ad recall and a 7-point increase in product awareness. 
We want to help marketers optimize their video ads. For example, we know that on average, captioned videos increase view time by 12%, so we introduced auto captions to generate captions for video ads. In Q1, we introduced new ad formats like Canvas ads. Canvas ads showcase products by combining video images and call for action button. While it's still early, we're pleased with the results and are seeing adoption across many verticals. 
To motivate millennials to take on do-it-yourself projects, Lowes and [indiscernible] targeted 25- to 34-year-old homeowners with Canvas ads that let them see bathroom designs, discover the products in each design and tap to purchase. The ads were so engaging that people spent an average of 28 seconds interacting with them and loads saw a 6.7x return on ad spend.
Our second priority is growing the number of marketers using our ad products. This quarter, we announced that we have over 3 million active advertisers on Facebook and over 200,000 on Instagram. A significant number of these advertisers are small and medium businesses. These businesses use our platform because it's easy and affordable for them to connect with their consumers on mobile. 
We're also making it easier for SMBs to use the same targeting tools and ad formats that our most sophisticated advertisers use. We're seeing even small businesses use products like lead ads, Slideshow and Dynamic Product Ad. [ph] 
Our third priority is improving the relevance and effectiveness of our ads. Last year, we introduced conversion lift to measure how Facebook and Instagram campaigns drive business objectives like sales. We've seen clients across verticals from retail to auto use conversion lift to measure and improve the return on their ad investment. 
Chase Bank used conversion lift to measure how effectively their Super Bowl ad drove credit card applications. They found that combining Facebook video ads with their TV ads drove 1.5x more conversion than TV ads alone. In Q1, we expanded our lift capabilities by testing lift API, enabling more partners to measure the effectiveness of more of their campaigns. 
We're pleased with the value we're driving for our partners and the progress we're making across our 3 priorities. Helping marketers make the shift to mobile will take time. We have a lot of hard work ahead and will continue to invest. I want to thank our clients around the world for their partnership and congratulate our global team on the results of their hard work. Thanks, everyone, and now here's Dave."
20765463,330038583,965274,"Facebook, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2016",2016-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Meta Platforms, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Sheryl, and good afternoon, everyone. We're off to a great start in 2016, led by the ongoing growth and engagement in our community and continued momentum in our ads business. In Q1, we generated $5.4 billion in total revenue and delivered over $1",1372,"Thanks, Sheryl, and good afternoon, everyone. We're off to a great start in 2016, led by the ongoing growth and engagement in our community and continued momentum in our ads business. In Q1, we generated $5.4 billion in total revenue and delivered over $1.8 billion in free cash flow. Let's begin with our community metrics.
In March, 1.09 billion people used Facebook on an average day, up 16% compared to last year. This daily number represents 66% of the 1.65 billion people who visited Facebook in the month of March. Mobile continues to drive our growth. Over 1.5 billion people accessed Facebook from mobile devices in March, up 21% from last year. 
Before diving into our quarterly financial results, I wanted to highlight that beginning this quarter, I will focus my prepared remarks on our GAAP results and our -- all financial metrics are GAAP, unless otherwise noted. The primary difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP metrics is stock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation plays an important role in how we compensate our employees, and therefore, we view it as a real expense for the business. We will continue to provide a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial metrics in our press release and earnings slides. All of our comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted.
Q1 total revenue was $5.4 billion, up 52% or 58% on a constant currency basis. Ad revenue in Q1 was $5.2 billion, up 57% or 63% on a constant currency basis. This marks a slight decline from the 66% constant currency ad growth rate we experienced in Q4. 
In Q1 this year, we benefited from an additional day due to the leap year, which contributed approximately 2 percentage points to our year-over-year ad revenue growth rate. North America and Asia-Pacific were our fastest-growing regions, with advertising revenue growth of 64% and 62%, respectively. Europe and Rest of World grew advertising revenue more slowly at 49% and 35%, respectively, with the latter particularly impacted by foreign exchange headwinds. Setting aside currency headwinds, all regions exceeded 50% constant currency ad revenue growth. 
Mobile ad revenue was $4.2 billion, representing approximately 82% of total ad revenue. Mobile ad revenue grew 75%, driven by strength from Facebook's News Feed. Our mobile apps business continues to be driven by the combination of both supply-side and demand-side factors. 
On the supply side, we continue to see healthy growth in the number of people using Facebook, time spent across our products and app loads. On the demand side, we believe the investments we've made to improve our mobile advertising solutions are helping drive value for both people and marketers. We are seeing growth in both new customers as well as existing customers who are spending more with us on average compared to last year.
In Q1, the average price per ad increased 5% while total ad impressions increased 50%. The reported increase in price is being driven by the continued mix shift towards mobile, which contained higher-priced News Feed ads rather than the mix we have on PCs of both News Feed ads and lower-priced right-hand column ads. 
The increase in impressions was driven by strong growth in mobile ad impressions and was offset partially by a decline in ad impressions delivered on personal computers, consistent with the ongoing declines in PC usage. 
The increase in -- sorry, total payments and other fees revenue was $181 million, down 20% compared to last year. This decline was mainly driven by a reduction in payments revenue related to games played on personal computers. 
Q1 total cost and expenses were $3.4 billion, up 29%. We ended the quarter with approximately 13,600 employees, up 35% compared to last year. Q1 operating income was $2 billion, representing a 37% operating margin. Our Q1 tax rate was 27%, down from our full year 2015 tax rate of 40%. Our Q1 net income was approximately $1.5 billion or $0.52 per share.
In Q1, capital expenditures were $1.1 billion, more than double compared to Q1 of last year. Server purchases and data center construction were the largest contributors to year-over-year growth. New builds in Texas and Ireland, along with the expansion of existing facilities, will nearly double our current data center footprint when completed. In addition to servers and data centers, investments in office facilities also contributed to the year-over-year growth. We ended the quarter with $20.6 billion in cash and investments.
Turning now to the outlook. First, some color on revenue. We remain focused on creating value for the people and marketers who use our services. We expect that the main drivers of advertising revenue growth will continue throughout 2016, but we will face tougher comparables as the year progresses, given the accelerating ad revenue growth we experienced throughout 2015. 
Payments and other fees revenues will continue to face headwinds throughout the year given that the substantial majority of that revenue relates to payments from games played on personal computers. Even with the expected contribution from Oculus, we anticipate that our payments and other fees revenue for the full year 2016 will come in lower than the level in 2015.
Next, on to the expense outlook. Our expense guidance remains unchanged. We expect that full year 2016 total GAAP expense growth will be approximately 30% to 40%. We expect full year 2016 amortization expenses to be approximately $700 million to $800 million, and full year 2016 stock-based compensation expenses to be approximately $3.1 billion to $3.3 billion. 
If you take into account our GAAP expense guidance, as well as our amortization and FPC guidance, you'll see that our full year 2016 total non-GAAP expense growth guidance range remains unchanged at 45% to 55%. We anticipate full year 2016 capital expenditures to be at the high end of the $4 billion to $4.5 billion range we gave last quarter as we invest to support the rapid growth of the business. We expect our Q2 and full year 2016 tax rates to be similar to our Q1 rates.
In summary, 2016 is off to a great start for Facebook. Our results reflect healthy growth and engagement in our community, strength in our ads business and investments we're making to capitalize on the long-term opportunities we see ahead. 
Before going to questions, I wanted to touch briefly on the share reclassification that Mark discussed at the beginning of the call. As we disclosed in the proxy statement we filed today, our Board of Directors has approved a proposal for the reclassification of our capital stock that would involve the creation of a newly -- of a new class of publicly listed nonvoting Class C capital stock. 
Pending stockholder approval, we intend to issue 2 Class C shares as a one-time stock dividend for each outstanding Class A and Class B share, resulting in a tripling of the pre-reclassification total shares outstanding. All stockholders would be treated equally. 
The net effect of this transaction would be to establish 2 publicly traded classes of Facebook stock, one representing the current Class A shares and the other representing the nonvoting Class B shares. Since the Class C shares would have the same economic rights as the Class A and Class B shares, we would expect that after the payment of the stock dividend, the share price of the Class A common stock would generally reflect a 3-for-1 stock split.
This will have no effect on the voting interests related to shares that investors currently hold. As Mark mentioned, this structure will allow for the preservation of the voting structure that has served the company well to-date, while allowing for Mark to fund the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative over the course of his lifetime. Importantly, as part of this proposal, the preservation of the multi-class capital structure would be generally predicated on Mark continuing to maintain an active leadership role at Facebook. 
Let me talk about next steps. The reclassification would be conditioned on approval by a majority of outstanding votes held by company stockholders, and we anticipate a vote on the matter at our annual meeting to be held on June 20 this year. A record date for this dividend will be determined at a later day. 
With that, Chris, let's open up the call for questions."

SMBs or SMEs, as they're called in different places around the world, we think are a very core competitive advantage for us. It's prohibitively expensive for most small businesses to reach people digitally. 35% of small businesses in the United States, which is often the most advanced market, don't have a web presence at all. And setting up a mobile app, getting people to find and download a mobile app can be even more expensive. And so what's happening is that SMBs are turning to Facebook pages as their mobile solution. They're free, they're easy to set up, and they already know how to do them because almost all of them are already Facebook users in the first place. And so the onboarding has been incredibly important and incredibly attractive. We announced last year that we have over 50 million small business pages active on a monthly basis. 80% of those are active on mobile. We then work on helping them use our ad products and upsell them through our paid ads products as well. And we announced this quarter that we hit 3 million active advertisers on Facebook and 200,000 on Instagram. What's interesting is that, what you see is SMBs able to use the tools as some of the biggest brands in the world. There are over 2 million SMBs have posted a video, both paid and organic, in the last month, and that has to be many times the number of SMBs that have shot or placed a TV commercial. In terms of measurement, your question's important because it's not just getting them to use our platforms to connect to consumers, it's getting them to be able to measure our results. And so we've worked hard to build the measurement tools into the products, so that when you buy an ad, SMBs, in a very easy interface and decide what their goals are. Are their goals measuring sales? Are their goals to connect to their website? Are their goals mobile app downloads and then measuring all the way through, from showing that ad to the purchase? I continue and we continue to be very bullish on this channel because we have such a broad base of usage, because that usage is so active, and because we're very focused on investing in simplifying our products, so that all SMBs can use them."

Our growth was really broad-based, and we grew across all of our markets or segments this quarter. That's direct response, brands, SMB and developer. Our direct response business continues to be very strong. It's very ROI-focused and we continue to invest and roll out products that help people. So for example, lead ads, where people can fill out forms on a mobile device, take their content and put it up on Facebook. We rolled that out fully this quarter. And that enabled people to use Facebook in a very direct response way, and we'll continue to invest there. Video ads are really exciting. It's worth noting that video ads take the place of other not ad agencies, but not all of the revenues are incremental, but as consumer engagement with video has continued to grow, that creates more and more of an opportunity for video ads. Marketers have always loved video because it's a really compelling way to reach people. And this -- now, you can reach them on mobile all day with those kind of messages. Importantly, marketers have to adjust sometimes. While the 30-second ad does perform well in News Feed, we also see people understanding that some of the formats are different, creating shorter ads, creating ads that can work even without sound, more personal ads has really mattered. One example is Toyota used Facebook for the launch of the RAV4 Hybrid. With Sachi in Los Angeles, they used a very broad video to drive brand awareness. They've reached over 36 million people in their target demo within 3 days. Then, and this is where it gets even more interesting, they retargeted people who watched the video with over 500 personalized video ads that were optimized for Facebook and Instagram. So they were creating a direct response campaign to get people to take specific actions, like requesting a quote and finding a specific dealer. We saw 14 -- a 14-point lift in ad recall, a 7-point lift in message association. And right now, we're using the Live tool to continue to measure their sales for the 30 and 60 days beyond this campaign to see what happens. And we're pretty excited about what that shows in terms of how videos can be used in a really broad-based way but also a more personal way."

So part of our playbook for building out these ecosystems at scale is we start with the person-to-person use case, right? So whether that's in messaging, if people are messaging their friends or Groups. In News Feed before that, it was people posting updates and then seeing what is going on with friends and the people that they care about. And then the next step is to create organic activity around public entities, right? So whether that's businesses, public figures -- I don't know like athletes, celebrities and types of folks that people want to interact with on these different platforms, we did that on Facebook and News Feed though pages, and we're working on a number of different ways to do that in Messenger. One of those is bots. And one of the good things about bots that we've seen is that it can increase -- or sorry, decrease the amount of time that you have to wait before you get a reply back from interaction with a message. So what we've seen, we've done some research on this. A lot of people every day, in Facebook today, are already messaging pages and businesses directly. And they -- the businesses respond. But what we've actually also found is that, through some of our AI research, we can look at the responses that businesses give to common questions and can confidently provide the right reply a lot of the time. And when we can do that, then that decreases the latency, and predictably, people want to do more of that activity. So that's one way that I think you're going to see bots work between people who are actually driving the businesses directly will need to, in some way, train or answer questions for people. But we can build artificial intelligence that can learn from people, how to automate a lot of that and make that experience a lot faster for people who want to interact with businesses and public figures. And you know, of course then, after you start building out that segment of businesses and public figures and the platform. Then on top of that, you have just a good amount of intent in these platforms to build a good business on top of that, that's kind of Stage 3."

They had a goal of promoting their new flight routes, including one from Mumbai to Beijing in their new aircraft. So the launched a campaign with us in 15 countries globally. They used the reach and frequency and Carousel and video ad targeting. And, for example, they would target in the U.S. age 18 and above, frequent international travelers, living in cities where they had roots or Indian expats living in the U.S. to promote their new route to Mumbai. They reached 30 million people globally, more than 95% on mobile. And here's the best part, they had a 73% sales lift in the United States.

So, you know, on desktop, for example, it was easier to type, so we saw more text posts. In mobile, it's easier to take videos, so we see more videos. On desktop, people would have more commonly uploaded an album of photos that they took from their digital camera, and downloaded onto their computer, whereas on mobile the more common behavior is to take a single photo or a couple, and just post those. So there are all these transitions -- and that's our job, right, is to make it so that we build great tools that people, everyone around the world, can share anything that they want with everyone. Now the other thing that's also true is that people want to share with lots of different kinds of audiences. So Facebook gives you the ability to share with all of your friends, and publicly if you want, and with groups. But we're also investing in things like Messenger and WhatsApp, because a lot of people want to share, increasingly, messages, privately one-on-one or with very small groups. So in addition to Messenger, which is a 900 million people a month and WhatsApp, which is at more than 1 billion people a month. Facebook Groups is also at more than 1 billion people a month, which I think represents the increasing diversity of the different types of audiences that people want to share with. But ultimately, I think that -- humans have such a deep desire to express themselves and want to connect with the people around them that I think that all of these audiences and all of these different types of media should grow over time. And it's our job to basically make sure that we build good products, and get rid of all the bugs, and make it that their performance is fast and all the basic stuff works that way we get there. But in general, right now, all the high level trends look pretty positive on that. I think I'll kick it off to Dave to go through your questions about the -- some of the technical pieces about the reclassification."

So on ad load, it's definitely up from where we were a couple of years ago.

And then, that's enabled us to show more of them without harming the user experience at all. So that's been really key. Over time, we would expect that ad load growth will be a less significant factor driving overall revenue growth, but we remain confident that we've got opportunity to grow supply through the continued growth in people and engagement on Facebook, as well as on our other apps such as Instagram. On the question regarding what would happen to Mark's shares if he were to leave Facebook, I would -- I just kind of refer that the new multiclass capital structure is generally dependent on Mark continuing to maintain an active leadership role at Facebook. And if you go into the proxy materials, it goes into more detail on how different things would play out under various other scenarios. So I would just refer you to those."

And the basic theory that we have is that there are a small number of services that are going to be ubiquitous utilities that 1 billion or 2 billion or more people are going to want to use, right? So that's kind of core basic messaging, right? The core functionality around having your real identity and connecting with all of your real friends and family online. Those are things that we think are going to be ubiquitous. And we want to build those. At the same time, we also think that there are going to be many, many good businesses, and different other social use cases, where there are people doing good work and building different companies that we feel no need to own those things. So when I think -- and people come up from time to time and suggest to us, should we buy this company or that, you know what we look at are, what are the things that we think are going to be ubiquitous tools, and who are the most talented people in the world to build this? And so when you think about something like virtual and augmented reality, that's how we thought about that. This is -- those are going to be important platforms over time. It's very early, obviously, we're going to take a long time to get there. And a lot of what we felt like we were buying there was a critical mass of the best people and the best technology to go do all the things that we needed to go do over the next 10 years to drive that home and turn that into a big platform. And you asked a question about virtual and augmented reality, what are going to be the big use cases? I mean, for the first few years of virtual reality, I think gaming and video are going to be the big one, right. I mean the initial market that we look at are all the people who have Xbox and PlayStations that we use, right. The people who are excited to have an immersive media experience sitting in their living room for a long period of time. And that's a pretty big market. And even though that's not all of what we hope to eventually serve, and that's not the full potential of these new platforms, I think that is one case where you can obviously deliver better and richer experiences than what you can with the current generation of technology. Video is going really well. I shared a stat before in some of my comments that on Gear VR alone, we're now at more than 2 million hours of video have been watched in from the platform, so that's really exciting. And that, of course, will be bolstered by the fact that these new kind of 360 videos can not only be watched in VR, so in the headsets, but we're building tools that you can share them on News Feed and through our products elsewhere as well. So I think that's exciting, over time there will be even more, but that I should be enough to have some initial use. But again, I do want to reemphasize, this is early and it's going to take a long time. And as you know there's a lot of hype around this, and we're just focused on building this to be very good over the long term."

We think we're uniquely placed to bring people-based marketing to scale, and solve the measurement problem. And the Audience Network is a place we're really focused, because we feel like we're delivering value for advertisers and publishers. So we're investing behind the growth we've seen. We've seen the growth of native ads, 83% of the overall inventory on the platform is native, and over 50% of our publishers are only using native ads. We've seen great examples of Audience Network really improving people's results. A recent one is eBay Vivanuncios, which is an online real estate destination, working in Latin America and Mexico. When they were using a combination of Facebook, Instagram and the Audience Network, they saw a 57% lower cost per install with place and optimization and 59% more volume, versus running on Facebook alone, which led to 6% incremental revenue. So compared to November a year before, the number of their app installs increased by 115%. So what we're seeing is the results we're able to deliver on Facebook and Instagram, a lot of our marketing partners want more, and our ability to do that is why we're investing in the Audience Network."

So in the basic human senses like seeing, hearing, language, kind of core thing is that we do. I think it's possible to get to the point in the next 5 to 10 years where we have computer systems that are better than people at each of those things. That doesn't mean that the computers will be thinking, or be generally better, but that is useful for a number of things. So for example, I talked about earlier, we are building this moments app, so that way, you can take photos on your phone and if you use this app, our face recognition can look at the photos that you take and suggest that you might want to share photos that you took with a friend of them, with that person, right. So that way, all the photos that might be of you and your friends' camera rolls, they can share with you. Another example is just spam filtering, right, and just making sure that we can actually read the content and understand what's interesting to you or not, and not show that. One obvious thing, I think over time, is if you just look at the way that we rank News Feed. Today, we use some basic signals like who you're friends with, and what pages you like, as some of the most important things for figuring out what, out of all of the millions and millions of pieces of content that are on Facebook, what we're going to show, and what are going to be the most interesting things to you. And you know, that's because today, our systems can't actually understand what the content means. We don't actually look at the photo and deeply understand what's in it or look at the videos and understand what's in it or read the links that people share and understand what's in them. But in the future, we'll be able to, I think, on a 5- or 10-year period. So all of these millions and millions of pieces of content that are out there, whether or not you've added someone as a friend or have liked a page, we'll be able to know a lot better, what types of things are going to be interesting to you to produce a much better feed of content. So that's how just some basic example of where having a human level perception broadly is going to yield better experiences and a lot of the things that people care about today."

We're also testing some incremental features in pages, which enable businesses to drive purchases on a page or direct people directly to their website. These are really early, but we've had some positive feedback. Our focus, however, continues to be on our ad products because we think we can take people all the way from the top of the funnel, where they can really get a brand awareness or product awareness, and go all the way down to purchase. Not necessarily because the purchase is happening on Facebook, but because we can work on the measurement system to understand how the advertising, both at the top and lower down in the funnel, is influencing those purchases. We've been really excited by what we've seen in the commerce vertical of our ad products. There products like dynamic product ads, carousel ads are working really well for us. This quarter, we launched Canvas ads, which are very fast-loading immersive mobile ads. They're easy to build, you can use a self-service tool. You don't have to write any code. They are native format, so they decrease that initial drop off you see when people click off to another site. Very early days, but the average viewing time is over 30 seconds, which shows how immersive that is. I'll share one example of how ads are driving a small business on Facebook through ads, which is a company called Sparkle and Paint. They're a Utah-based SMB, they're selling girls' clothing. They did a slide show ad that included a Shop Now button, which enabled you to take action on their site. They were able to increase sales by 9% per month. And more exciting for us, this was 6x more efficient in terms of acquisitions than any other digital media channel. And that shows how you can use our ad products to go all the way from awareness, measuring through to a sale, and show how important our ads can be to commerce on our platform."

T-Mobile wanted to use their Super Bowl campaign to increase their brand awareness and increase their reach. So before the game, they targeted their 30-second Super Bowl ad that featured Drake to NFL and people with NFL and celebrity interest. It performed so well that they decided to run a 60-second version on Facebook and Instagram.

And I think that, that's a huge opportunity, not just in live video but in a lot of the things that we're talking about. And one interesting example recently, that I touched on earlier is, between Messenger and WhatsApp, we're around 60 billion messages a day. And sorry -- sorry, SMS at its peak, we think, was around 20 billion messages a day. And just unlocking some of the friction that existed in SMS and improving the product a little bit, and removing the small fee that was there has just unlocked a huge amount of expression. And we think that this is going to be the case in all different types of media and with all different audiences that a person would share with. So in video, there are billions and billions of videos that are viewed every day on Facebook. Live is a very small part of it. The reason why we give disproportionate attention to it, is because we're trying to help push forward new formats that are not just about consuming content but are really about interacting. So Live, 360 video and there'll be others in the future. And so, yes, I mean, to answer your question, I do think that multiple products and companies can succeed in building these things. I also think that there are going to be a lot more interactive forms of video than just Live and 360, like we're talking about now. And I think that this extends not just to video but for all of the different types of media and audiences that we're serving. So we are -- we're very excited about continuing to do our work, to help unlock all the expression and connection that people want to do."

We had another good quarter in the first half of the year.

We had another good quarter in the first half of the year. Our community continues to grow around the world. 1.7 billion people now use Facebook every month and 1.1 billion people use it every day. Our business is growing at a healthy rate as well. Total revenue grew by 59% year-over-year to $6.4 billion and advertising revenue was up 63% to $6.2 billion.
Our results show our progress as we work to make the world more open and connected across our 3-, 5- and 10-year horizons. Over the next 3 years, we're focused on continuing to build our community and help people share more of what matters to them. Next 5 years are about building our newer products into full ecosystems, developers and business. And over the next 10 years, we're working to build new technologies to help everyone connect in new ways. I'll give an update on our progress across each of these areas, starting with how we're working to deliver better experiences for our community in more ways for people to share and more what they care about with anyone they want.
We continue to see excellent growth in our community. Over the past year, we've added over 200 million people using Facebook on a monthly basis. And in the second quarter, time spent per person increased double-digit percentages year-over-year across Facebook, Instagram and Messenger and that doesn't even include WhatsApp yet. 
One of the biggest opportunities to grow our community is in developing countries where connectivity is less advanced than what we take for granted here at home. So over the past couple of years, we've been making steady improvement to our apps to make them work regardless of the device or the connection that people are using. 
We've also built a lightweight version of our Android app called Facebook Lite that's tuned to work on 2G networks and is now used by more than 100 million people. We're also working on new tools to help people express themselves and understand what's going on with the people they care about. 10 years ago, most of what we shared and consume online was text. Now it's photos. And soon, most of it will be videos. 
We see a world that is video-first, with video as the heart of all of our apps and services. Over the past 6 months, we've been particularly focused on Live Video. Live represents a new way to share what's happening in more immediate and creative ways. This quarter, Candace Payne's Chewbacca Mask video was viewed almost 160 million times. Live is also changing the way we see politics as news organizations, delegates go live from the Republican and Democratic conventions. And we've seen in Minnesota and Dallas how Live can shine a light on important moments as they happen.
This quarter, we also launched 360 Photos. You don't need a special camera to take them. You just take a panorama or use a 360 camera app on your phone and post it. And since we launched, more than 4 million 360 Photos have been shared on Facebook, with 1 million more being shared every week. 
We're making good progress on core services within the Facebook app like search. A growing way that people use search is to find what people are saying about a topic across the more than 2.5 trillion posts in our network. Now people are doing more than 2 billion searches a day between looking up people, businesses and other things that they care about. Continuous steady improvement of services like search are an important part of helping people connect and realizing our mission.
We're also improving the experience for our community by building our business with more engaging ads. We've always emphasized the importance of measurement and value in driving real results for the businesses that use Facebook. And that means helping them create more relevance and engaging ads. 
Over the next 5 years, we are working hard to build ecosystems around some of our newer products. Instagram now has more than 500 million monthly active, with more than 300 million daily. Now we're working to make that experience even more engaging. Recently, Instagram began to rank its feed, since we know that people have a better experience when they see more of the stories they care about. We're already seeing a positive impact in terms of time spent and the amount of content that people are sharing. We've also introduced our advertising tools on Instagram, and we're seeing marketers engage with people in creative and innovative ways. 
In the 2 years since we separated Messenger from the main Facebook app, which was a pretty controversial decision at the time, we've improved performance and given people new ways to express themselves. And now for the first time, more than 1 billion people are using Messenger every month. 
I'm also happy with the updates we're making to WhatsApp, which also has a community of more than 1 billion people. This quarter, we launched new desktop apps and end-to-end encryption, and millions of people are using WhatsApp for voice calling features. The scale we've achieved with our messaging services makes it clear that there are more than just a way to chat with friends. That's why we're also making it easier for people to connect with groups and businesses as well. We're going to keep focusing on this over the next several years.
I'm also excited about the early progress we're making on our 10-year initiative. We're investing in new technologies to give more people a voice, including, of course, the 4 billion people around the world who aren't yet online. And we're hoping more people take advantage of the opportunities that come with the Internet.
We're still early in our journey with lots of hard work ahead, but we're making good progress. Like the first successful flight of Aquila, our solar-powered aircraft that will beam Internet to places that have never been connected. Eventually, we're going to work with telecom operators and governments around the world to connect people on the outskirts, cities, rural areas and disaster zones, where you can't get traditional connectivity today. 
We've also been making progress with our initiatives around artificial intelligence and virtual reality. This quarter, we announced deep text deep learning-based engine that can understand the context of several thousand posts per second across 20 different languages. This is a long-term project but it also has some near-term benefit like helping show people more of what they want to see it and filtering out less of what they don't want to see. 
We're also investing in new platforms to help people connect and share. We believe that virtual reality can help people share richer experiences and help everyone understand what's going on around the world. It's really early for us in VR but we're hitting some important milestones. As of the second quarter, more than 1 million people a month are now using Oculus on mobile phones through our Gear VR partnership with Samsung. More than 300 apps are already available at the Oculus store for Gear VR. We filled all of our preorders for Oculus Rift, and we're seeing increasing demand from retail as stores plan for the holidays. While it's too early for augmented reality, we're doing AR research and are seeing lightweight versions of AR technology in mobile apps like Masquerade.
So that's a recap of the progress that we're making in our 10-year plan. We have a saying at Facebook that our journey is only 1% done, and while I'm happy with our progress, we have a lot more work to do to grow our community and connect the whole world. That means making big investments and taking risks, focusing not just on what Facebook is but on what it can be. I want to thank everyone in our communities, all of our teams, our partners and our shareholders for being a part of this journey with us. And now here's Sheryl."

Mobile ad revenue reached $5.2 billion, up 81% year-over-year and was approximately 84% of total ad revenues. Our growth was broad-based across verticals, marketer segments and regions.
We're excited to announce that we now have 60 million monthly active business pages on Facebook. We also continue to grow the number of active advertisers on our platform. This shows that both our free and paid products are providing value to marketers of all sizes around the world. 
We continue to focus on our 3 priorities: capitalizing on the shift to mobile; growing the number of marketers using our ad products; and making our ads more relevant and effective. 
First, capitalizing on the shift to mobile. For 32 years, the advertising industry has gathered in to celebrate creativity. People have shifted to mobile and marketers know they need to catch up. Mobile is no longer a nice to-do, it's a must do, and we're working closely with marketers to help them make this transition. 
The best marketers understand that people watch video differently in mobile feeds. The goal is to create what we think of as stop and creative, videos that grab attention the first few seconds even without sound. For example, to drive awareness for Sour Patch Kids gum, Mondelez targeted teams with non-chocolate candy interest. Working with Media, and the Facebook Creator Shop, they created 10-second looping videos tailored for Facebook and Instagram. The campaign helped the Sour Patch Kids portfolio benchmark for the entire candy industry.
We're excited to bring more relevant video ads to people that's on and off Facebook. In May, we expanded Audience Network to include video for brand objective. This means that advertisers can place video, brand video ads not just on Facebook and Instagram but across a network of apps and sites. 
Our second priority is growing the number of marketers using our ad products. Over 1/3 of small and medium businesses in the U.S. don't have a website, and having a mobile presence is even more difficult and expensive. Creating a business page on Facebook is as easy as setting up a personal profile. This is why Facebook pages are the novel solution for many of the 60 million businesses using our products each month in the U.S. and around the world. 
We've made it easy for business owners to manage their Facebook page from a mobile device. Over 85% of active business pages use mobile, and 40% of active advertisers have created a Facebook ad on their mobile device. In Q2, we rolled out new tools to make it easier for businesses to promote posts and track performance directly from the Instagram app. 
We've worked hard to make becoming an advertiser as easy as possible for these businesses. With just a few steps and for as little as a few dollars, businesses can boost their posts to reach more people. Simplifying our ad products is key to advertiser acquisition. Over 80% of new advertisers in Q2 started with simplified products like boosted posts. 
Once these businesses begin advertising with us, we make it easy for them to take advantage of even our most sophisticated capabilities. For example, Lighting, Etc., a third-generation family-owned business used Facebook and Instagram ads to drive in-store sales. They targeted 25- to 45-year-old homeowners interested in interior design living within 35 miles of their showroom in Fort Worth, Texas. 
It was striking to them that on Facebook, the size of our community meant that they can reach over 300,000 people even with such specific targeting. They've seen a 40% increase in revenue in 2016, and they attribute this increase to their ads on Facebook and Instagram.
Our third priority is making our ads more effective and relevant. Our goal is to help our clients grow their businesses, whether it be moving products off shelves, driving online sales or building their brands. Our system constantly looks for the most efficient and effective way to drive these objectives. 
Businesses that want to build their brand need to reach a large audience with a compelling story. And they're seeing strong results from immersive formats like video and canvas ads. Businesses working to acquire new customers need to reach high-quality leads and convert them to action. We introduced lead ads in Q1 to make it easy for people to fill out forms on mobile devices right from News Feed. In Q2, we made it possible for advertisers to retarget people who opened or completed a lead ad form. 
For example, Nissan Turkey and the SEM Agency used lead ads to collect over 20,000 high-quality leads from people interested in buying a new car. They then used retargeting to show relevant ads to people who had completed these lead ads and ultimately drove vehicle sales. The cost of a high-quality lead was 9.3x lower on Facebook than all other online media.
Businesses selling products are getting search-like ROI from dynamic ads. Dynamic ads allow advertisers to upload their product catalogs and target people with specific products in real-time. Over 300 million people see dynamic ads each month and over 2.5 billion unique products have been uploaded by marketers. In Q2, we expanded dynamic ads to Instagram and also launched dynamic ads for travel. For example, you can now advertise specific destinations and dates for hotel rooms.
We're pleased with the value we're driving for our partners and the progress we're making across our 3 priorities. With only a small fraction of our 60 million business pages advertising, we have a lot of opportunity ahead. We also have a lot of hard work to do to help businesses make the shift to mobile and to drive results for our clients. 
I want to thank our clients around the world for their partnership and their ongoing input, which informs our product development. I also want to congratulate our global teams on the results of their hard work and thank them for their dedication to our mission. Thanks, everyone, and now here's Dave."

Total revenue grew 59% to $6.4 billion and we generated over $2 billion in free cash flow. These results highlight the continued growth and engagement of our global community and the strength of our ads business as advertisers benefit from our increasingly broad and deep portfolio of targeting creative and measurement goals. 
Let's start with our community metrics. This past quarter was our strongest [indiscernible] absolute year-over-year growth of monthly and daily actives on Facebook. In June, 1.13 billion people used Facebook on an average day, up 17% compared to last year. This daily number represents 66% of the 1.71 billion people who visited Facebook in the month of June. 
Mobile continued to drive our growth, with over 1 billion people accessing Facebook via mobile devices on an average day in June, up 22% compared to last year. The growth of our other services also continues to be strong. WhatsApp and Messenger now each have over 1 billion monthly actives and Instagram surpassed 500 million.
Turning now to the financials. My comments today will focus on our GAAP financial metrics, and all of our comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial metrics is included in our press release and earnings slides.
Total Q2 revenue was $6.4 billion, up 59%. Q2 ad revenue was $6.2 billion, up 63%. Exchange rates did not impact our overall revenue growth rates this quarter as headwinds in certain currencies were offset by tailwinds and others. U.S. and Canada and Asia Pacific were our fastest-growing regions, with advertising growth rates of 69% and 67%, respectively. Mobile ad revenue was $5.2 billion, up 81% and representing approximately 84% of total ad revenue.
Let's turn to the supply and demand factors that continue to drive our growth. Advertiser demand was particularly strong in Q2 across a broad range of verticals and advertiser objectives. Additionally, supply-side factors, including growth in users, time spent and ad load all contributed to our Q2 revenue growth.
In Q2, the average price per ad increased 9% while total ad impressions increased 49%. The reported increase in price was again driven by the continued mix shift towards mobile where we only show higher-priced News Feed ads compared to the mix of News Feed ads at lower price right-hand column ads on personal computers.
The 49% increase in total ad impressions was driven primarily by growth in ad impressions served in Facebook's mobile News Feed, where the majority of our ads are shown. Payments and other fees revenue was $197 million, down 8%. Remember that payments and other fees revenue is largely generated from games played on personal computers, which has declined as people spend less time on their PCs.
Q2 total expenses were $3.7 billion, up 33%, inclusive of $825 million of share-based compensation-related expenses as well as $193 million of amortization of intangible assets. Q2 operating income was $2.7 billion, representing a 43% operating margin. We continue to be pleased with the profitable growth of the business while we invest for the long term.
We ended Q2 with approximately 14,500 employees, up 32% year-over-year. We added about 900 employees in the quarter, with the majority of those in technical function. We are seeing continued success with our efforts to hire top talent in a market that remains very competitive.
Our Q2 tax rate was 26%. GAAP net income was approximately $2.1 billion or $0.71 per share. Q2 capital expenditures were $1 billion. Year-to-date, capital expenditures totaled $2.1 billion, driven by investments in data centers, servers, office buildings and network infrastructure. Facebook generated over $4 billion in free cash flow in the first half of 2016, and as of June 30, we had over $23 billion in cash and investments.
Turning now to the outlook. First, some color on revenue. We've been pleased with the strength of our advertising revenue in the first half of 2016. As I discussed on our last call, while we expect the main drivers of our advertising revenue growth will continue throughout 2016, we will face tougher comparable as the year progresses, given the accelerating revenue growth rates we experienced in the second half of 2015. Consequently, we anticipate lower advertising revenue growth rates in each successive quarter in 2016. Additionally, we anticipate ad load on Facebook will continue to grow modestly over the next 12 months and then will be a less significant factor driving revenue growth after mid-2017.
Since ad load has been one of the important factors in our recent strong period of revenue growth, we expect the rate at which we are able to grow revenue will be impacted accordingly. 
Turning now to expenses. Based on our updated view of the remainder of the year, we are tightening our expense guidance ranges. We expect that full year 2016 total GAAP expense growth will be approximately 30% to 35%, narrowed from our prior range of 30% to 40%. We expect full year 2016 amortization expenses to be approximately $700 million to $800 million and full year 2016 stock-based compensation-related expenses to be approximately $3.1 billion to $3.3 billion. 
Accordingly, we anticipate that our total non-GAAP expenses, which exclude stock-based compensation and amortization, will grow in the range of 45% to 50%, narrowed from our prior range of 45% to 55%. We anticipate full year 2016 capital expenditures will be approximately $4.5 billion, as we invest to support the rapid growth of our business. Finally, we expect that our Q3 and full year 2016 tax rates will be similar to our Q2 rates.
In summary, Q2 was another great quarter for Facebook, illustrated by the strong growth and engagement of our global community and continued broad-based strength of our ads business. We're pleased with the results, and we will continue to invest in order to best position Facebook for our long-term growth opportunities. 
With that, Chris, let's open up the call for questions."

How should we think about investments that need to be made in video on both technical infrastructure side as well as the sourcing of content type, sort of broaden out the video offering over the next couple of years? And then maybe on the last comment on ad load, just want to go back to that for a minute in terms of what you're seeing on ad load by region because we are seeing a widening gap in revenue per user between U.S. and Canada and the rest of the world. How much of that might be driven by ad load or ad products?"

I can take the question on video distribution as it relates to CapEx and the ad load question and then maybe on the sourcing of content, I'll pass it back to Sheryl. So on the video platform, clearly from an investment perspective, you've seen us step up our CapEx this year pretty substantially, and that's baked into the guidance of $4.5 billion of CapEx, which if you'll recall is the high end of our prior range. We are investing across our infrastructure to prepare ourselves for growth across all of our different services, and a part of that investment is really to support video. That is definitely more taxing on the network, and we're investing heavily on the network side. And as well, it does also impact our overall needs within the data center servers and the like. So it's certainly an area that we're investing in heavily, and we expect to be investing in heavily going forward, Eric. And then on the ad load question, ad load is not something that varies by region. So you're really looking at a number of factors. Really, what's driving that is just the dispersion of overall ad demand across region, and we're seeing really good strength across the globe on that front. But ad load is not a big driver of discrepancies in ARPU that you see. That's really something that map very closely to the size of the mobile ad markets per population in those countries. So it's not an ad load question. And then I'll hand it over to Sheryl to talk about video on -- from a perspective."

We have, in the past, heard some caution from you guys before in that area and granted it was a few years ago and at a much earlier stage, but I guess my question is if targeting continues to improve, along with click-through rate and then ultimately ROI, why does ad load have to become less of a factor going forward?"

One is DAU and MAU are up sequentially and year-over-year in all regions and with trends that are largely consistent with past quarters, so really good strong growth across the globe on a DAU-to-MAU ratio. We don't use specific breakdowns of those metrics by demographic. We're obviously pleased with our overall level of growth and engagement. On the teen front, younger users, we continue to be the best way to reach the largest global audience of teens and millennials. Teens remain very -- remain engaged on Facebook. Clearly, how they've used our service has evolved over the years, and in addition to Facebook, they're using Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp. So from a teen perspective, that's some color there. On the ad load front, ad load is definitely up from where we were a few years ago. It's been an important driver of inventory growth. And really, I think one of the things that's enabled us to grow ad load has been improving the quality and the relevance of the ads as you mentioned. And we've been able to do that without negatively impacting user experience. We do expect that ad load will be a less significant factor driving overall growth, especially after mid-2017. The optimal ad load is really a mix of art and science. We've carefully tracked the impact of ads on user experience over the last several years. We aren't seeing a cause for concern. We also want to be thoughtful about making sure that each person's overall feed experience has the right balance of organic and ad content. And that factors into how we think about ad load and where that might ultimately be. And that's really why we're talking about our expectation that as you get into mid-2017, ad load will not be a big factor in driving overall inventory growth. We still see the opportunity to grow inventory from the growth of people and engagement on Facebook as well as our other services like Instagram. Instagram does have a lower ad load than Facebook."

We had especially strong growth in APAC and the U.S. and Canada so that was part of the growth. In terms of our marketer segments from brands to direct response to SMBs to developers, the growth is really strong there as well. We're really excited today to announce that we have 60 million small business pages that are using Facebook on a monthly basis. And we're very focused on the opportunity to upsell them to advertising product. I think we have a good track record there. We're also seeing a lot of strength in brands, and I think that's because we have a combination of the creative and the storytelling, so the art with the science of the targeting. And when people do that well together, you see great opportunities. So to share one example, Jack-in-the-Box used our Canvas ads, which are very immersive ads, they're really good for a brand experience, to roll out a new menu item, their Double Jack Burger. They worked with agencies Horizon, David and Goliath and and they targeted millennials on Facebook to create 2 different custom audience groups. One group was customers who had visited the restaurant web page or engaged with previous video ads. And the second group were people that hadn't engaged with them directly but were quick service restaurant purchasers. They had an average view rate of 23 seconds across those canvas ads, so clearly people were very engaged in the brand experience of the ad. And they had a 13-point lift in ad recall and a 9-point lift in purchase impact. And so I think what you're seeing is that across all of the objectives people have from brands, marketers to direct response to SMB to developers, as our ad products get more sophisticated, our targeting and measurement get better. They have an increased opportunity to grow, and that's why we think our growth to date continues to be broad-based."

So you can imagine more photos on people's mobile cameras, fewer photo albums, more ability to capture video, probably a little bit harder to type on mobile. So there's this evolution. The other thing that we see is that now, people have tools to share more privately as well. So when you think about sharing on Facebook, you shouldn't just think about the kind of sharing that you'd see a News Feed, right? They're sharing with all your friends, sharing in Groups on Facebook and public sharing, which the trends that I was just talking about. But another area that's growing incredibly quickly is private messaging, right, where between Messenger and WhatsApp, I think we're around 60 billion messages a day, which I think is something like 3x more than the peak of global SMS traffic. So that is something that's growing pretty quickly and that we're really excited about as well. And we're just going to continue working on giving people the best tools across the spectrum from private to public and across the spectrum from text-based and simple communication to richer type of media like photos, videos and then eventually more immersive forms like VR."

Obviously, just driving the overall business, advertiser demand, that was particularly strong this period. And then also, we match that with supply and the supply, the 2 big drivers are user and time spent and then ad load. And getting the balance and mix right is important. And clearly, how the pricing plays out is the option. And we had a good balance of demand growth and supply growth, and that's led to our good strong financial results and our ability to deliver very strong ROI to advertisers. So we think we're in a good zone on the right ad load. And we do think there's opportunities to grow that modestly. But as we look forward into 2017, we think it will be a less significant factor driving inventory growth. We still think there's opportunities to drive inventory through user growth and time spent. I don't think we would think about necessarily dropping ad load to drive pricing. We're also very cognizant of providing good value to advertisers and getting that balance right is important to driving overall ROI as well as obviously providing better targeting and measurement tools for our advertisers."

So when we talk about our strategy, I often talk about how when we develop new products, we think about it in 3 phases; first, building a consumer use case; then second, making it so that people can organically interact with businesses; and then third, on top of that, once there's a large volume of people are interacting with businesses, give business tools to reach more people and pay, and that's ultimately the business opportunity. So I'd say we're around the second phase of that in search now. We have a pretty big navigational use case where people look up people and pages and groups that want to get to and look out in search. One of the big growing use cases that we're investing a lot in is looking up the content in the ecosystem, and that is an area we're very excited about, which helps people find more content. But certainly, there's a reasonable amount of behavior in there, which is looking for things that over time could be monetizable or commercial intent. And at some point, we will probably want to work on that, but we're still in the phase of just making it easier for people to find all the content they want and connect with businesses organically."

We don't break out revenue by our different platforms. But the opportunity to take not just video ads but other ad formats we have bring them to the rest of the web another with our ability to target and measure. We think it's a big one. And what we're starting to see is that people are using Facebook, Instagram and Audience Network to drive their objective in a cohesive way. So to share an example, Garmin launched the Phoenix 3 Sapphire watch, and they did it with video ads on Facebook that worked without  sound. They targeted outdoor enthusiasts then retargeted people who viewed the Instagram videos that on Facebook that highlighted the product features. Then they extended those ads on Audience Network to maximize reach, and they used the Facebook Pixel to measure the incremental sales and got to a 9.7x return on ad sales. So that's a really good example of how you can take targeting and the ability to target across Audience Network, Facebook and Instagram and drive people all the way down the funnel. And we think more and more people will do that, particularly as we do a better job of combining the interfaces. So for example, you can buy now in one interface on Facebook, Instagram and Audience Network."

I think people will watch a lot less of the organic videos that were posted because of that. But the important thing to keep in mind on this is we don't really -- we don't need to do pre-rolls because our model is not one where you come to Facebook to watch one piece of content.

And if we can make it so that you can have some of those interactions in an automated way where you fire off a text and just get a response that back synchronously so take up your full attention, then I think that's going to be a much better experience that people really enjoy and like. So we're in the experimentation phase, I think, with the platform. Verse seeing a lot of good ideas getting tried out. And I'm -- I personally enjoy a lot of the different bots that people are using or making, especially the news ones where you get these digests at the end of the day, of different kinds of content. And between that and M, which is kind of our own internal bot that we're building, I think this is going to be an interesting area to watch and encourage more interaction between people and businesses in messaging."

So overall, people are spending more and more time on mobile, and that means that there are always more services that people use, right, whether it's YouTube or there's some really interesting ones with younger folks especially like musically and that I think are pretty interesting as well Snapchat, which you mentioned. And part of why I think you see this so many different ways that people want to share, so many different kinds of content ranging from text a photo to video to which are and richer more immersive content. And also, there's a range from private one-on-one type sharing to small groups, all your friends at once, large interest-based communities and then ultimately fully public. And there are different apps that explore different regions of that space and do a good job with it and offer ideas that I think the whole market needs to learn from. Right now, the big theme and strategy that we're executing is we're going to become the video-first. And what I mean by that is that this trend where 10 years back, most of what you saw and shared online was text. And then we went through a phase where most of it is photos, and we really believe that in, call it, 5 years or whatever the period of time it takes to get there, I think most of what people consume online is going to be video. And that means is that there need to be a whole range of new production tools and consumption experiences for enabling that for production I think that means that you need to get the camera experience, the experience for capturing and uploading videos that you've captured to be much better and a more central part of the experience. On consumption, there are innovations had like autoplay in feed but what's the next version of that, that makes it so that people can have an even more native and default video experience when they are in News Feed as well as private areas like Messenger and WhatsApp. So I think you're going to see this across all of our apps, more focused on producing this kind of content and making it first-class to consume as well, both in private and public context. And I think that's a big trend across the market and one of the big things that if we get right, I think it's going to unlock a lot of sharing and opportunity."

One thing to just keep in mind is Instagram is known and operated property is represented growth in our revenue. So whereas as I mentioned, the Audience Network, by and large, is going to be recognized net rather than gross. And so that is going to make it smaller in how it's going to appear in the revenue numbers. The overall growth is still being driven predominantly by Facebook. Instagram is clearly making a contribution and then as is the Audience Network. In terms of ad load, as I said, it's been one of the factors driving supply. It's certainly been helpful but there's also DAU growth and time spent per DAU growth, time spent per person, and we continue to feel that there are opportunities to execute on those and continue to grow inventory in that way. So that's where we would focus as we drive DAU faster than MAU, then that's going to increase that ratio, but we're going to focus on driving DAU and time spent per person."

We had another good quarter in the first half of the year. Our community continues to grow around the world. 1.7 billion people now use Facebook every month and 1.1 billion people use it every day.",1338,"Thanks, Deborah, and thanks, everyone for joining today. We had another good quarter in the first half of the year. Our community continues to grow around the world. 1.7 billion people now use Facebook every month and 1.1 billion people use it every day. Our business is growing at a healthy rate as well. Total revenue grew by 59% year-over-year to $6.4 billion and advertising revenue was up 63% to $6.2 billion.
Our results show our progress as we work to make the world more open and connected across our 3-, 5- and 10-year horizons. Over the next 3 years, we're focused on continuing to build our community and help people share more of what matters to them. Next 5 years are about building our newer products into full ecosystems, developers and business. And over the next 10 years, we're working to build new technologies to help everyone connect in new ways. I'll give an update on our progress across each of these areas, starting with how we're working to deliver better experiences for our community and more ways for people to share more what they care about with anyone they want.
We continue to see excellent growth in our community. Over the past year, we've added over 200 million people using Facebook on a monthly basis. And in the second quarter, time spent per person increased double-digit percentages year-over-year across Facebook, Instagram and Messenger and that doesn't even include WhatsApp yet. 
One of the biggest opportunities to grow our community is in developing countries where connectivity is less advanced than what we take for granted here at home. So over the past couple of years, we've been making steady improvements to our apps to make them work regardless of the device or connection that people are using. 
We've also built a lightweight version of our Android app called Facebook Lite that's tuned to work on 2G networks and is now used by more than 100 million people. We're also working on new tools to help people express themselves and understand what's going on with the people they care about. Ten years ago, most of what we shared and consume online was text. Now it's photos and soon, most of it will be videos. 
We see a world that is video-first, with video at the heart of all of our apps and services. Over the past 6 months, we've been particularly focused on Live Video. Live represents a new way to share what's happening in more immediate and creative ways. This quarter, Candace Payne's Chewbacca Mask video was viewed almost 160 million times. Live is also changing the way we see politics as news organizations and delegates go live from the Republican and Democratic conventions. And we've seen in Minnesota and Dallas how Live can shine a light on important moments as they happen.
This quarter, we also launched 360 Photos. You don't need a special camera to take them. You just take a panorama or use a 360 camera app on your phone and post it. And since we launched, more than 4 million 360  photos have been shared on Facebook with 1 million more being shared every week. 
We're making good progress on core services within the Facebook app like search. A growing way that people use search is to find what people are saying about a topic across the more than 2.5 trillion posts in our network. Now people are doing more than 2 billion searches a day between looking up people, businesses and other things that they care about. Continuous, steady improvement of services like search are an important part of helping people connect and realizing our mission.
We're also improving the experience for our community by building our business with more engaging ads. We've always emphasized the importance of measurement and value in driving real results for the businesses that use Facebook, and that means helping them create more relevance and engaging ads. 
Over the next 5 years, we are working hard to build ecosystems around some of our newer products. Instagram now has more than 500 million monthly active, with more than 300 million daily. Now we're working to make that experience even more engaging. Recently, Instagram began to rank its feed, since we know that people have a better experience when they see more of the stories they care about. We're already seeing a positive impact in terms of time spent and the amount of content that people are sharing. We've also introduced our advertising tools on Instagram, and we're seeing marketers engage with people in creative and innovative ways. 
In the 2 years since we separated Messenger from the main Facebook app which was a pretty controversial decision at the time, we've improved performance and given people new ways to express themselves. And now for the first time, more than 1 billion people are using Messenger every month. 
I'm also happy with the updates we're making to WhatsApp which also has a community of more than 1 billion people. This quarter, we launched new desktop apps, end-to-end encryption and millions of people are using WhatsApp for voice calling features. The scale we've achieved with our messaging services makes it clear that there are more than just a way to chat with friends. That's why we're also making it easier for people to connect with groups and businesses as well. We're going to keep focusing on this over the next several years.
I'm also excited about the early progress we're making on our 10-year initiative. We're investing in new technologies to give more people a voice, including, of course, the 4 billion people around the world who aren't yet online. And we're helping more people take advantage of the opportunities that come with the Internet.
We're still early in our journey with lots of hard work ahead, but we're making good progress. Like the first successful flight of Aquila, our solar-powered aircraft that will beam Internet to places that have never been connected. Eventually, we're going to work with telecom operators and governments around the world to connect people on the outskirts, cities, rural areas and disaster zones, where you can't get traditional connectivity today. 
We've also been making progress with our initiatives around artificial intelligence and virtual reality. This quarter, we announced DeepText, a deep learning-based engine that can understand the context of several thousand posts per second across 20 different languages. This is a long-term project but it also has some near-term benefits like helping show people more of what they want to see and filtering out less of what they don't want to see. 
We're also investing in new platforms to help people connect and share. We believe that virtual reality can help people share richer experiences and help everyone understand what's going on around the world. It's really early for us in VR but we're hitting some important milestones. As of the second quarter, more than 1 million people a month are now using Oculus on mobile phones through our Gear VR partnership with Samsung. More than 300 apps are already available at the Oculus store for Gear VR. We filled all of our preorders for Oculus Rift and we're seeing increasing demand from retail as stores plan for the holidays. While it's still early for augmented reality, we're doing AR research and are seeing lightweight versions of AR technology in mobile apps like MSQRD.
So that's a recap of the progress that we're making in our 10-year plan. We have a saying at Facebook that our journey is only 1% done. And while I'm happy with our progress, we have a lot more work to do to grow our community and connect the whole world. That means making big investments and taking risks, focusing not just on what Facebook is but on what it can be. I want to thank everyone in our communities, all of our teams, our partners and our shareholders for being a part of this journey with us. And now, here's Sheryl."

Mobile ad revenue reached $5.2 billion, up 81% year-over-year and was approximately 84% of total ad revenues. Our growth was broad-based across verticals, marketer segments and regions.
We're excited to announce that we now have 60 million monthly active business pages on Facebook. We also continue to grow the number of active advertisers on our platform. This shows that both our free and paid products are providing value to marketers of all sizes around the world. 
We continue to focus on our 3 priorities: capitalizing on the shift to mobile; growing the number of marketers using our ad products; and making our ads more relevant and effective. 
First, capitalizing on the shift to mobile. For 32 years, the advertising industry has gathered in cons [ph] to celebrate creativity. People have shifted to mobile and marketers know they need to catch up. Mobile is no longer a nice to do, it's a must do, and we're working closely with marketers to help them make this transition. 
The best marketers understand that people watch video differently in mobile feeds. The goal is to create what we think of as thumb-stopping creative, videos that grab attention in the first few seconds even without sound. For example, to drive awareness for Sour Patch Kids gum, Mondelez targeted teams with non-chocolate candy interests. Working with VaynerMedia, Hara [ph] and the Facebook Creative Shop, they created punchy, 10-second looping videos tailored for Facebook and Instagram. The campaign helped the Sour Patch Kids portfolio detail its benchmark for the entire candy industry.
We're excited to bring more relevant video ads to people that's on and off Facebook. In May, we expanded Audience Network to include video for brand objective. This means that advertisers can place video, brand video ads not just on Facebook and Instagram but across a network of apps and sites. 
Our second priority is growing the number of marketers using our ad products. Over 1/3 of small and medium businesses in the U.S. don't have a website, and having a mobile presence is even more difficult and expensive. Creating a business page on Facebook is as easy as setting up a personal profile. This is why Facebook pages are the novel solution for many of the 60 million businesses using our products each month in the U.S. and around the world. 
We've made it easy for business owners to manage their Facebook page from their mobile device. Over 85% of active business pages use mobile and 40% of active advertisers have created a Facebook ad on their mobile device. In Q2, we rolled out new tools to make it easier for businesses to promote posts and track performance directly from the Instagram app. 
We've worked hard to make becoming an advertiser as easy as possible for these businesses. With just a few steps and for as little as a few dollars, businesses can boost their posts to reach more people. Simplifying our ad products is key to advertiser acquisition. Over 80% of new advertisers in Q2 started with simplified products like boosted posts. 
Once these businesses begin advertising with us, we make it easy for them to take advantage of even our most sophisticated capabilities. For example, Lighting Etc., a third-generation family-owned business used Facebook and Instagram ads to drive in-store sales. They targeted 25- to 45-year-old homeowners interested in interior design, living within 35 miles of their showroom in Fort Worth, Texas. 
It was striking to them that on Facebook, the size of our community meant that they can reach over 300,000 people even with such specific targeting. They've seen a 40% increase in revenue in 2016 and they attribute this increase to their ads on Facebook and Instagram.
Our third priority is making our ads more effective and relevant. Our goal is to help our clients grow their businesses, whether it be moving products off shelves, driving online sales or building their brands. Our system constantly looks for the most efficient and effective way to drive these objectives. 
Businesses that want to build their brand need to reach a large audience with a compelling story, and they're seeing strong results from immersive formats like video and canvas ads. Businesses working to acquire new customers need to reach high-quality leads and convert them to action. We introduced lead ads in Q1 to make it easy for people to fill out forms on mobile devices right from News Feed. In Q2, we made it possible for advertisers to retarget people who opened or completed a lead ad form. 
For example, Nissan Turkey and the SEM Agency used lead ads to collect over 20,000 high-quality leads from people interested in buying a new car. They then used retargeting to show relevant ads to people who had completed these lead ads and ultimately drove vehicle sales. The cost of a high-quality lead was 9.3x lower on Facebook than all other online media.
Businesses selling products are getting search-like ROI from dynamic ads. Dynamic ads allow advertisers to upload their product catalogs and target people with specific products in real-time. Over 300 million people see dynamic ads each month and over 2.5 billion unique products have been uploaded by marketers. In Q2, we expanded dynamic ads to Instagram and also launched dynamic ads for travel. For example, you can now advertise specific destinations and dates for hotel rooms.
We're pleased with the value we're driving for our partners and the progress we're making across our 3 priorities. With only a small fraction of our 60 million business pages advertising, we have a lot of opportunity ahead. We also have a lot of hard work to do to help businesses make the shift to mobile and to drive results for our clients. 
I want to thank our clients around the world for their partnership and their ongoing input which informs our product development. I also want to congratulate our global teams on the results of their hard work and thank them for their dedication to our mission. Thanks, everyone, and now here's Dave."

Total revenue grew 59% to $6.4 billion and we generated over $2 billion in free cash flow. These results highlight the continued growth and engagement of our global community and the strength of our ads business as advertisers benefit from our increasingly broad and deep portfolio of targeting creative and measurement goals. 
Let's start with our community metrics. This past quarter was our strongest [indiscernible] absolute year-over-year growth of monthly and daily actives on Facebook. In June, 1.13 billion people used Facebook on an average day, up 17% compared to last year. This daily number represents 66% of the 1.71 billion people who visited Facebook in the month of June. 
Mobile continued to drive our growth, with over 1 billion people accessing Facebook via mobile devices on an average day in June, up 22% compared to last year. The growth of our other services also continues to be strong. WhatsApp and Messenger now each have over 1 billion monthly actives and Instagram surpassed 500 million.
Turning now to the financials. My comments today will focus on our GAAP financial metrics and all of our comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial metrics is included in our press release and earnings slides.
Total Q2 revenue was $6.4 billion, up 59%. Q2 ad revenue was $6.2 billion, up 63%. Exchange rates did not impact our overall revenue growth rates this quarter as headwinds in certain currencies were offset by tailwinds and others. U.S. and Canada and Asia Pacific were our fastest-growing regions, with advertising growth rates of 69% and 67%, respectively. Mobile ad revenue was $5.2 billion, up 81% and representing approximately 84% of total ad revenue.
Let's turn to the supply and demand factors that continue to drive our growth. Advertiser demand was particularly strong in Q2 across a broad range of verticals and advertiser objectives. Additionally, supply-side factors, including growth in users, time spent and ad load all contributed to our Q2 revenue growth.
In Q2, the average price per ad increased 9% while total ad impressions increased 49%. The reported increase in price was again driven by the continued mix shift towards mobile where we only show higher-priced News Feed ads compared to the mix of News Feed ads and lower-priced right-hand column ads on personal computers.
The 49% increase in total ad impressions was driven primarily by growth in ad impressions served in Facebook's mobile News Feed, where the majority of our ads are shown. Payments and other fees revenue was $197 million, down 8%. Remember that payments and other fees revenue is largely generated from games played on personal computers which has declined as people spend less time on their PCs.
Q2 total expenses were $3.7 billion, up 33%, inclusive of $825 million of share-based compensation-related expenses as well as $193 million of amortization of intangible assets. Q2 operating income was $2.7 billion, representing a 43% operating margin. We continue to be pleased with the profitable growth of the business while we invest for the long term.
We ended Q2 with approximately 14,500 employees, up 32% year-over-year. We added about 900 employees in the quarter, with the majority of those in technical function. We are seeing continued success with our efforts to hire top talent in a market that remains very competitive.
Our Q2 tax rate was 26%. GAAP net income was approximately $2.1 billion or $0.71 per share. Q2 capital expenditures were $1 billion. Year-to-date, capital expenditures totaled $2.1 billion, driven by investments in data centers, servers, office buildings and network infrastructure. Facebook generated over $4 billion in free cash flow in the first half of 2016 and as of June 30, we had over $23 billion in cash and investments.
Turning now to the outlook. First, some color on revenue. We have been pleased with the strength of our advertising revenue in the first half of 2016. As I discussed on our last call, while we expect the main drivers of our advertising revenue growth will continue throughout 2016, we will face tougher comparables as the year progresses, given the accelerating revenue growth rates we experienced in the second half of 2015. Consequently, we anticipate lower advertising revenue growth rates in each successive quarter in 2016. Additionally, we anticipate ad load on Facebook will continue to grow modestly over the next 12 months and then will be a less significant factor driving revenue growth after mid-2017.
Since ad load has been one of the important factors in our recent strong period of revenue growth, we expect the rate at which we are able to grow revenue will be impacted accordingly. 
Turning now to expenses. Based on our updated view of the remainder of the year, we are tightening our expense guidance ranges. We expect that full year 2016 total GAAP expense growth will be approximately 30% to 35%, narrowed from our prior range of 30% to 40%. We expect full year 2016 amortization expenses to be approximately $700 million to $800 million and full year 2016 stock-based compensation-related expenses to be approximately $3.1 billion to $3.3 billion. 
Accordingly, we anticipate that our total non-GAAP expenses which exclude stock-based compensation and amortization will grow in the range of 45% to 50%, narrowed from our prior range of 45% to 55%. We anticipate full year 2016 capital expenditures will be approximately $4.5 billion, as we invest to support the rapid growth of our business. Finally, we expect that our Q3 and full year 2016 tax rates will be similar to our Q2 rates.
In summary, Q2 was another great quarter for Facebook, illustrated by the strong growth and engagement of our global community and continued broad-based strength of our ads business. We're pleased with the results and we will continue to invest in order to best position Facebook for our long-term growth opportunities. 
With that, Chris, let's open up the call for questions."

One on the video platform going forward and how you think about video as a distribution mechanism. How should we think about investments that need to be made in video on both the technical infrastructure side as well as the sourcing of content type to sort of broaden out the video offering over the next couple of years? And then maybe on the last comment on ad load, just want to go back to that for a minute in terms of what you're seeing on ad load by region, because we are seeing a widening gap in revenue per user between U.S. and Canada and the rest of the world. How much of that might be driven by ad load or ad products?"

I can take the question on video distribution as it relates to CapEx and the ad load question and then maybe on the sourcing of content, I'll pass it back to Sheryl. So on the video platform, clearly from an investment perspective, you've seen us step up our CapEx this year pretty substantially, and that's baked into the guidance of $4.5 billion of CapEx which if you'll recall, is at the high end of our prior range. We are investing across our infrastructure to prepare ourselves for growth across all of our different services, and a part of that investment is really to support video. That is -- it's definitely more taxing on the network and we're investing heavily on the network side. And as well, it does also impact our overall needs within the data center servers and the like. So it's certainly an area that we're investing in heavily and we expect to be investing in heavily going forward, Eric. And then on the ad load question, ad load is not something that varies that dramatically by region. So you're really looking at a number of factors. Really, what's driving that is just the dispersion of overall ad demand across region, and we're seeing really good strength across the globe on that front. But ad load is not a big driver of discrepancies in ARPU that you see. That's really something that maps very closely to the size of the mobile ad markets per population in those countries. So it's not an ad load question. And then I'll hand it over to Sheryl to talk about video on a -- from a content perspective."

On the DAU and MAU front, a couple of things. One is DAU and MAU are up sequentially and year-over-year in all regions and with trends that are largely consistent with past quarters, so really good, strong growth across the globe on a DAU to MAU ratio. We don't use specific breakdowns of those metrics by demographic. We're obviously pleased with our overall level of growth and engagement. On the teen front, younger users, we continue to be the best way to reach the largest global audience of teens and millennials. Teens remain very -- remain engaged on Facebook. Clearly, how they've used our service has evolved over the years. And in addition to Facebook, they're using Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp. So from a teen perspective, that's some color there. On the ad load front, ad load is definitely up from where we were a few years ago. It's been an important driver of inventory growth. And really, I think one of the things that's enabled us to grow ad load has been improving the quality and the relevance of the ads as you mentioned. And we've been able to do that without negatively impacting user experience. We do expect that ad load will be a less significant factor driving overall growth, especially after mid-2017. The optimal ad load is really a mix of art and science. We've carefully tracked the impact of ads on the user experience over the last several years. We aren't seeing a cause for concern. We also want to be thoughtful about making sure that each person's overall feed experience has the right balance of organic and ad content, and that factors into how we think about ad load and where that might ultimately be. And that's really why we're talking about our expectation that as you get into mid-2017, ad load will not be a big factor in driving overall inventory growth. We still see the opportunity to grow inventory from the growth of people and engagement on Facebook as well as our other services like Instagram. Instagram does have a lower ad load than Facebook."

We had especially strong growth in APAC and the U.S. and Canada, so that was part of the growth. In terms of our marketer segments from brands to direct response to SMBs to developers, the growth is really strong there as well. We're really excited today to announce that we have 60 million small business pages that are using Facebook on a monthly basis. And we're very focused on the opportunity to upsell them to advertising products. I think we have a good track record there. We're also seeing a lot of strength in brands and I think that's because we have a combination of the creative and the storytelling, so the art with the science of the targeting. And when people do that well together, you see great opportunities. So to share one example, Jack in the Box use our canvas ads which are very immersive ads, they're really good for a brand experience, to roll out a new menu item, their Double Jack burger. They worked with agencies Horizon, David&Goliath and Adaptly and they targeted millennials on Facebook to create 2 different custom audience groups. One group was customers who had visited the restaurant web page or engaged with previous video ads. And the second group were people that hadn't engaged with them directly but were quick service restaurant purchasers. They had an average view rate of 23 seconds across those canvas ads, so clearly people were very engaged in the brand experience of the ad. And they had a 13-point lift in ad recall and a 9-point lift in purchase impact. And so I think what you're seeing is that across all of the objectives people have from brands, marketers to direct response to SMB to developers, as our ad products get more sophisticated, our targeting and measurement get better. They have an increased opportunity to grow and that's why we think our growth to date continues to be broad-based."

So the overall level of sharing is up on Facebook and what we're seeing is that how people share is evolving as we move from desktop to mobile, right? So you can imagine more photos on people's mobile cameras, fewer long photo albums, more ability to capture video, probably a little bit harder to type on mobile, so there's this evolution. The other thing that we see is that now, people have tools to share more privately as well. So when you think about sharing on Facebook, you shouldn't just think about the kind of sharing that you'd see a News Feed, right? They're sharing with all your friends, sharing in Groups on Facebook and public sharing which are the trends that I was just talking about. But another area that's growing incredibly quickly is private messaging, right, where between Messenger and WhatsApp, I think we're around 60 billion messages a day which I think is something like 3x more than the peak of global SMS traffic. So that is something that's growing pretty quickly and that we're really excited about as well. And we're just going to continue working on giving people the best tools across the spectrum from private to public and across the spectrum from text-based and simple communication to richer type of media like photos, videos and then eventually, more immersive forms like VR."

And getting the balance and mix right is important and clearly, how the pricing plays out is via the option. And we had a good balance of demand growth and supply growth and that's led to our good strong financial results and our ability to deliver very strong ROI to advertisers. So we think we're in a good zone on the right ad load, and we do think there's opportunities to grow that modestly. But as we look forward into 2017, we think it will be a less significant factor driving inventory growth. But we still think there's opportunities to drive inventory through user growth and time spent. I don't think we would think about necessarily dropping ad load to drive pricing. We're also very cognizant of providing good value to advertisers and getting that balance right is important to driving overall ROI as well as obviously, providing better targeting and measurement tools for our advertisers."

So I'd say we're around the second phase of that in search now. We have a pretty big navigational use case where people look up people and pages and groups that they want to get to and look at and search. One of the big growing use cases that we're investing a lot in is looking up the content in the ecosystem, and that is an area that we're very excited about which helps people find more content. But certainly, there's a reasonable amount of behavior in there which is looking for things that over time, could be monetizable or commercial intent. And at some point, we will probably want to work on that but we're still in the phase of just making it easier for people to find all the content they want and connect with businesses organically."

With our ability to target and measure, we think it's a big one. And what we're starting to see is that people are using Facebook, Instagram and Audience Network to drive their objective in a cohesive way. So to share an example, Garmin launched the fenix 3 Sapphire watch and they did it with video ads on Facebook that worked without sound. They targeted outdoor enthusiasts then retargeted people who viewed the Instagram videos with carousel ads on Facebook that highlighted the product features. Then they extended those ads on Audience Network to maximize reach, and they used the Facebook pixel to measure the incremental sales and got to a 9.7x return on ad sales. So that's a really good example of how you can take targeting and the ability to target across Audience Network, Facebook and Instagram and drive people all the way down the funnel. And we think more and more people will do that, particularly as we do a better job of combining the interfaces. So for example, you can buy now in one interface on Facebook, Instagram and Audience Network."

The second phase is really working on building organic interactions between businesses and consumers. And then finally, the third phase is about building those commercial opportunities. With Messenger, we're really at the beginning of Phase 2. Messenger today has 1 billion organic interactions between businesses and consumers each month. But in terms of where we are in having a -- in terms of actual monetization, incredibly early on that front. We're really in the -- in that Phase 2, we're really talking about building those organic interactions."

And so with all these events taking place along the -- around the world, there's no one event that we think drives a huge portion of revenue. That said, we are pleased by what's happened on Facebook for the elections -- for the election cycle, not just on the pay side but actually on the organic side as well. We really see Facebook being embraced by politicians all over the world to get in touch with their constituents, and we're pleased with that. Every member of Congress right now has a Facebook presence and we're seeing people like one example is Elise Stefanik, she's the youngest person in the Congress. She made a pledge when she was elected that she would explain every vote she takes and she explains every vote she takes on Facebook. With shorter explanations if they're not controversial but longer explanations, that's the kind of mission-based work we're happy about because it brings people closer to the people who are representing them. We don't break out how many advertisers are advertising on the Audience Network but we're seeing solid and growing adoption of the Audience Network across the board as we are with Instagram. And we think all of these platforms together really help give us the ability to serve our clients in a very leveraged way and use the targeting and measurement capabilities we've invested in across multiple platforms."

Does this phenomenon in the end increase -- does this phenomenon lead to increased adoption and use of Facebook, creating more polarization of views and less effective communication at least in some areas of people's lives? Mark, how do you think about this line of thought that because people see things that are already in line with what they believe, communication is hindered? Second, when it comes to video ad formats, are you philosophically opposed to pre-rolls? And if yes, why? And if not, what is missing for you to adopt them?"

And basically, what -- the way to think about this is that even if a lot of your friends come from the same kind of background or of the same political or religious beliefs, if you know a couple hundred people, there's a good chance that even maybe a small percent, maybe 5% or 10% or 15% of them will have a different viewpoints which means that their perspectives are now going to be shown in your News Feed. And if you compare that to traditional media where people will typically pick a newspaper or a TV station that they want to watch and just get 100% of the view from that, people are actually getting exposed to much more different kinds of content through social media than they would have otherwise or have been in the past. So it's a good sounding theory and I can get why people repeat it but it's not true. So I think that's something that if folks read the research that we put out there, then they'll see that.

So we don't think it would be a good experience in News Feed, right? Because a lot of when people are finding videos on Facebook is you're scrolling through your News Feed, you're looking at what stories seem interesting to you which is why we did the autoplay videos so that rather than having to take an action, you can just start experiencing the video automatically and continue watching it if it's something that you're interested in. But if we started playing an ad in the middle of the feed before you got to the video, then that would really go against that. I think people would just watch a lot less of the organic videos that were posted because of that. But the important thing to keep in mind on this is we don't really -- we don't need to do pre-rolls because our model is not one where you come to Facebook to watch one piece of content. You come to look at a feed and putting the ads in between the stories is a much more effective way to do it and better for the user experience."

F8 was the big announcement there and I think since then, I think we've announced -- we have more than 10,000 bots in the system which are basically making it so that different businesses can build automated ways to communicate with people. The way we think about this experience is that qualitatively, I don't know a single person really who wants to call a business to get support or interact with it, right? Whether that's trying to get a reservation for a restaurant or getting customer support our calling to buy something. And those are slow interactions, they're synchronous, they consumer your whole attention while you're doing them. And if we can make it so that you can have some of those interactions in an automated way where you fire off a text and then just get a response back quickly but asynchronously so it doesn't take up your full attention, then I think that, that's going to be a much better experience that people really enjoy and like. So we're in the experimentation phase, I think, with the platform. We're seeing a lot of good ideas getting tried out and I'm -- I personally enjoy a lot of the different bots that people are using or making, especially the news ones where you get these digests at the end of the day of different kinds of content. And between that and M which is kind of our own internal bot that we're building, I think that this is going to be an interesting area to watch and encourage more interaction between people and businesses in messaging."

And part of why I think you see this is that there are just so many different ways that people want to share, so many different kinds of content ranging from text, to photo, to video, to just richer and richer and more immersive content. And also, there's a range from private one-on-one type sharing to small groups, all your friends at once, large interest-based communities and then ultimately, fully public. And there are different apps that explore different regions of that space and do a good job with it and offer ideas that I think the whole market needs to learn from. Right now, the big theme and strategy that we're executing is we're going to become video-first. And what I mean by that is that this trend where 10 years back, most of what you saw and shared online was text. And then we went through a phase where most of it is photos and we really believe that in, call it, 5 years or whatever the period of time that it takes to get there, I think most of what people consume online is going to be video. And that means is that there needs to be a whole range of new production tools and consumption experiences for enabling that. For production, I think that means that you need to get the camera experience and the experience for capturing and uploading videos that you've captured to be much better and a more central part of the experience. On consumption, there are innovations that we've had like autoplay in feed but what's the next version of that, that makes it so that people can have an even more native and default video experience when they're in News Feed as well as private areas like Messenger and WhatsApp. So I think you're going to see this across all of our apps, more focused on producing this kind of content and making it first-class to consume as well, both in private and public context. And I think that that's just the big trend across the market and one of the big things that if we get right, I think it's going to unlock a lot of sharing and opportunity."

One thing to just keep in mind is Instagram as an owned and operated property is represented growth in our revenue. So whereas as I mentioned, the Audience Network, by and large, is going to be recognized net rather than gross. And so that is going to make it smaller in how it's going to appear in the revenue numbers. The overall growth is still being driven predominantly by Facebook. Instagram is clearly making a contribution and then as is, the Audience Network. In terms of ad load, as I said, it's been one of the factors driving supply. It's certainly been helpful but there's also DAU growth and time spent per DAU growth, time spent per person, and we continue to feel that there are opportunities to execute on those and continue to grow inventory in that way. So that's where we would focus. As we drive DAU faster than MAU, then that's going to increase that ratio but we're really focused on driving DAU and time spent per person."

I'll give an update on our progress across each of these areas, starting with how we're working to deliver better experiences for our community and more ways for people to share more what they care about with anyone they want.
We continue to see excellent growth in our community. Over the past year, we've added over 200 million people using Facebook on a monthly basis. And in the second quarter, time spent per person increased double-digit percentages year-over-year across Facebook, Instagram and Messenger and that doesn't even include WhatsApp yet. 
One of the biggest opportunities to grow our community is in developing countries where connectivity is less advanced than what we take for granted here at home. So over the past couple of years, we've been making steady improvements to our apps to make them work regardless of the device or connection that people are using. We've also built a lightweight version of our Android app called Facebook Lite that's tuned to work on 2G networks and is now used by more than 100 million people. 
We're also working on new tools to help people express themselves and understand what's going on with the people they care about. Ten years ago, most of what we shared and consumed online was text. Now it's photos and soon, most of it will be videos. 
We see a world that is video-first, with video at the heart of all of our apps and services. Over the past 6 months, we've been particularly focused on Live video. Live represents a new way to share what's happening in more immediate and creative ways. This quarter, Candace Payne's Chewbacca mask video was viewed almost 160 million times. Live is also changing the way we see politics as news organizations and delegates go live from the Republican and Democratic conventions. And we've seen in Minnesota and Dallas how Live can shine a light on important moments as they happen.
This quarter, we also launched 360 Photos. You don't need a special camera to take them. You just take a panorama or use a 360 camera app on your phone and post it. And since we launched, more than 4 million 360 photos have been shared on Facebook with 1 million more being shared every week. 
We're making good progress on core services within the Facebook app like Search. A growing way that people use Search is to find what people are saying about a topic across the more than 2.5 trillion posts in our network. Now people are doing more than 2 billion searches a day between looking up people, businesses and other things that they care about. Continuous, steady improvement of services like Search are an important part of helping people connect and realizing our mission.
We're also improving the experience for our community by building our business with more engaging ads. We've always emphasized the importance of measurement and value in driving real results for the businesses that use Facebook, and that means helping them create more relevance and engaging ads. 
Over the next 5 years, we are working hard to build ecosystems around some of our newer products. Instagram now has more than 500 million monthly actives, with more than 300 million daily. Now we're working to make that experience even more engaging. Recently, Instagram began to rank its feed, because we know that people have a better experience when they see more of the stories they care about. We're already seeing a positive impact in terms of time spent and the amount of content that people are sharing. We've also introduced our advertising tools on Instagram, and we're seeing marketers engage with people in creative and innovative ways. 
In the 2 years since we separated Messenger from the main Facebook app, which was a pretty controversial decision at the time, we've improved performance and given people new ways to express themselves. And now, for the first time, more than 1 billion people are using Messenger every month. 
I'm also happy with the updates we're making to WhatsApp which also has a community of more than 1 billion people. This quarter, we launched new desktop apps and end-to-end encryption and millions of people are using WhatsApp's voice calling features. 
The scale we've achieved with our messaging services makes it clear that they are more than just a way to chat with friends. That's why we're also making it easier for people to connect with groups and businesses as well. We're going to keep focusing on this over the next several years.
I'm also excited about the early progress we're making on our 10-year initiative. We're investing in new technologies to give more people a voice, including, of course, the 4 billion people around the world who aren't yet online. And we're helping more people take advantage of the opportunities that come with the Internet.
We're still early in our journey with lots of hard work ahead, but we're making good progress. Like the first successful flight of Aquila, our solar-powered aircraft that will beam Internet to places that have never been connected. Eventually, we're going to work with telecom operators and governments around the world to connect people on the outskirts of cities, rural areas and disaster zones, where you can't get traditional connectivity today. 
We've also been making progress with our initiatives around artificial intelligence and virtual reality. This quarter, we announced DeepText, a deep learning-based engine that can understand the context of several thousand posts per second across 20 different languages. This is a long-term project but it also has some near-term benefits like helping show people more of what they want to see and filtering out less of what they don't want to see. 
We're also investing in new platforms to help people connect and share. We believe that virtual reality can help people share richer experiences and help everyone understand what's going on around the world. It's really early for us in VR but we're hitting some important milestones. As of the second quarter, more than 1 million people a month are now using Oculus on mobile phones through our Gear VR partnership with Samsung. More than 300 apps are already available at the Oculus store for Gear VR. We've filled all of our preorders for Oculus Rift and we're seeing increasing demand from retail as stores plan for the holidays. While it's still early for augmented reality, we're doing AR research and are seeing lightweight versions of AR technology in mobile apps like MSQRD.
So that's a recap of the progress that we're making in our 10-year plan. We have a saying at Facebook that our journey is only 1% done. And while I'm happy with our progress, we have a lot more work to do to grow our community and connect the whole world. That means making big investments and taking risks, focusing not just on what Facebook is but on what it can be. 
I want to thank everyone in our community, all of our teams, our partners and our shareholders for being a part of this journey with us. 
And now, here's Sheryl."

Mobile ad revenue reached $5.2 billion, up 81% year-over-year and was approximately 84% of total ad revenues. Our growth was broad-based across verticals, marketer segments and regions.
We're excited to announce that we now have 60 million monthly active business pages on Facebook. We also continue to grow the number of active advertisers on our platform. This shows that both our free and paid products are providing value to marketers of all sizes around the world. 
We continue to focus on our 3 priorities: capitalizing on the shift to mobile; growing the number of marketers using our ad products; and making our ads more relevant and effective. 
First, capitalizing on the shift to mobile. For 32 years, the advertising industry has gathered in Cannes to celebrate creativity. People have shifted to mobile and marketers know they need to catch up. Mobile is no longer a nice to do, it's a must do, and we're working closely with marketers to help them make this transition. 
The best marketers understand that people watch video differently in mobile feeds. The goal is to create what we think of as thumb-stopping creative; videos that grab attention in the first few seconds even without sound. For example, to drive awareness for Sour Patch Kids gum, Mondel?z targeted teams with non-chocolate candy interests. Working with VaynerMedia, CARAT and the Facebook Creative Shop, they created punchy, 10-second looping videos tailored for Facebook and Instagram. The campaign helped the Sour Patch Kids portfolio beat sales benchmarks for the entire candy industry.
We're excited to bring more relevant video ads to people both on and off Facebook. In May, we expanded Audience Network to include video for brand objectives. This means that advertisers can place video, brand video ads not just on Facebook and Instagram, but across a network of apps and sites. 
Our second priority is growing the number of marketers using our ad products. Over 1/3 of small and medium businesses in the U.S. don't have a website, and having a mobile presence is even more difficult and expensive. Creating a business page on Facebook is as easy as setting up a personal profile. This is why Facebook pages are the novel solution for many of the 60 million businesses using our products each month in the U.S. and around the world. 
We've made it easy for business owners to manage their Facebook page from their mobile device. Over 85% of active business pages use mobile and 40% of active advertisers have created a Facebook ad on their mobile device. In Q2, we rolled out new tools to make it easier for businesses to promote posts and track performance directly from the Instagram app. 
We've worked hard to make becoming an advertiser as easy as possible for these businesses. With just a few steps and for as little as a few dollars, businesses can boost their posts to reach more people. Simplifying our ad products is key to advertiser acquisition. Over 80% of new advertisers in Q2 started with simplified products like boosted posts. 
Once these businesses begin advertising with us, we make it easy for them to take advantage of even our most sophisticated capabilities. For example, Lighting Etc., a third-generation family-owned business, used Facebook and Instagram ads to drive in-store sales. They targeted 25- to 45-year-old homeowners interested in interior design, living within 35 miles of their showroom in Fort Worth, Texas. 
It was striking to them that on Facebook, the size of our community meant that they can reach over 300,000 people even with such specific targeting. They've seen a 40% increase in revenue in 2016 and they attribute this increase to their ads on Facebook and Instagram.
Our third priority is making our ads more effective and relevant. Our goal is to help our clients grow their businesses, whether it be moving products off shelves, driving online sales or building their brands. Our system constantly looks for the most efficient and effective way to drive these objectives. 
Businesses that want to build their brands need to reach a large audience with a compelling story, and they're seeing strong results from immersive formats like Video and Canvas ads. Businesses working to acquire new customers need to reach high-quality leads and convert them to action. We introduced lead ads in Q1 to make it easy for people to fill out forms on mobile devices right from News Feed. In Q2, we made it possible for advertisers to retarget people who opened or completed a lead ad form. 
For example, Nissan Turkey and the SEM agency used lead ads to collect over 20,000 high-quality leads from people interested in buying a new car. They then used retargeting to show relevant ads to people who had completed these lead ads and ultimately drove vehicle sales. The cost of a high-quality lead was 9.3x lower on Facebook than all other online media.
Businesses selling products are getting search-like ROI from Dynamic Ads. Dynamic Ads allow advertisers to upload their product catalogs and target people with specific products in real time. Over 300 million people see Dynamic Ads each month and over 2.5 billion unique products have been uploaded by marketers. In Q2, we expanded Dynamic Ads to Instagram and also launched Dynamic Ads for travel. For example, you can now advertise specific destinations and dates for hotel rooms.
We're pleased with the value we're driving for our partners and the progress we're making across our 3 priorities. With only a small fraction of our 60 million business pages advertising, we have a lot of opportunity ahead. We also have a lot of hard work to do to help businesses make the shift to mobile and to drive results for our clients. 
I want to thank our clients around the world for their partnership and their ongoing input which informs our product development. I also want to congratulate our global teams on the results of their hard work and thank them for their dedication to our mission. 
Thanks, everyone, and now here's Dave."

Total revenue grew 59% to $6.4 billion and we generated over $2 billion in free cash flow. These results highlight the continued growth and engagement of our global community and the strength of our ads business as advertisers benefit from our increasingly broad and deep portfolio of targeting creative and measurement tools. 
Let's start with our community metrics. This past quarter was our strongest quarter in over 3 years in terms of absolute year-over-year growth of monthly and daily actives on Facebook. In June, 1.13 billion people used Facebook on an average day, up 17% compared to last year. This daily number represents 66% of the 1.71 billion people who visited Facebook in the month of June. 
Mobile continued to drive our growth, with over 1 billion people accessing Facebook via mobile devices on an average day in June, up 22% compared to last year. The growth of our other services also continues to be strong. WhatsApp and Messenger now each have over 1 billion monthly actives and Instagram surpassed 500 million.
Turning now to the financials. My comments today will focus on our GAAP financial metrics and all of our comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial metrics is included in our press release and earnings slides.
Total Q2 revenue was $6.4 billion, up 59%. Q2 ad revenue was $6.2 billion, up 63%. Exchange rates did not impact our overall revenue growth rates this quarter as headwinds in certain currencies were offset by tailwinds in others. U.S. and Canada and Asia Pacific were our fastest-growing regions, with advertising growth rates of 69% and 67%, respectively. Mobile ad revenue was $5.2 billion, up 81% and representing approximately 84% of total ad revenue.
Let's turn to the supply and demand factors that continue to drive our growth. Advertiser demand was particularly strong in Q2 across a broad range of verticals and advertiser objectives. Additionally, supply-side factors, including growth in users, time spent and ad load, all contributed to our Q2 revenue growth.
In Q2, the average price per ad increased 9%, while total ad impressions increased 49%. The reported increase in price was again driven by the continued mix shift towards mobile where we only show higher-priced News Feed ads compared to the mix of News Feed ads and lower-priced right-hand column ads on personal computers.
The 49% increase in total ad impressions was driven primarily by growth in ad impressions served in Facebook's mobile News Feed, where the majority of our ads are shown. 
Payments and other fees revenue was $197 million, down 8%. Remember that payments and other fees revenue is largely generated from games played on personal computers which has declined as people spend less time on their PCs.
Q2 total expenses were $3.7 billion, up 33%, inclusive of $825 million of share-based compensation-related expenses, as well as $193 million of amortization of intangible assets. 
Q2 operating income was $2.7 billion, representing a 43% operating margin. We continue to be pleased with the profitable growth of the business while we invest for the long term.
We ended Q2 with approximately 14,500 employees, up 32% year-over-year. We added about 900 employees in the quarter, with the majority of those in technical functions. We are seeing continued success with our efforts to hire top talent in a market that remains very competitive.
Our Q2 tax rate was 26%. GAAP net income was approximately $2.1 billion or $0.71 per share. Q2 capital expenditures were $1 billion. Year-to-date, capital expenditures totaled $2.1 billion, driven by investments in data centers, servers, office buildings and network infrastructure. Facebook generated over $4 billion in free cash flow in the first half of 2016 and as of June 30, we had over $23 billion in cash and investments.
Turning now to the outlook. First, some color on revenue. We have been pleased with the strength of our advertising revenue in the first half of 2016. As I discussed on our last call, while we expect the main drivers of our advertising revenue growth will continue throughout 2016, we will face tougher comparables as the year progresses, given the accelerating revenue growth rates we experienced in the second half of 2015. Consequently, we anticipate lower advertising revenue growth rates in each successive quarter in 2016. 
Additionally, we anticipate ad load on Facebook will continue to grow modestly over the next 12 months and then will be a less significant factor driving revenue growth after mid-2017.
Since ad load has been one of the important factors in our recent strong period of revenue growth, we expect the rate at which we are able to grow revenue will be impacted accordingly. 
Turning now to expenses. Based on our updated view of the remainder of the year, we are tightening our expense guidance ranges. We expect that full year 2016 total GAAP expense growth will be approximately 30% to 35%, narrowed from our prior range of 30% to 40%. We expect full year 2016 amortization expenses to be approximately $700 million to $800 million and full year 2016 stock-based compensation-related expenses to be approximately $3.1 billion to $3.3 billion. 
Accordingly, we anticipate that our total non-GAAP expenses which exclude stock-based compensation and amortization, will grow in the range of 45% to 50%, narrowed from our prior range of 45% to 55%. We anticipate full year 2016 capital expenditures will be approximately $4.5 billion, as we invest to support the rapid growth of our business. Finally, we expect that our Q3 and full year 2016 tax rates will be similar to our Q2 rates.
In summary, Q2 was another great quarter for Facebook, illustrated by the strong growth and engagement of our global community and continued broad-based strength of our ads business. We're pleased with the results and we will continue to invest in order to best position Facebook for our long-term growth opportunities. 
With that, Chris, let's open up the call for questions."

One on the video platform going forward and how you think about video as a distribution mechanism. How should we think about investments that need to be made in video on both the technical infrastructure side, as well as the sourcing of content type to sort of broaden out the video offering over the next couple of years? And then maybe on the last comment on ad load, just wanted to go back to that for a minute in terms of what you're seeing on ad load by region, because we are seeing a widening gap in revenue per user between U.S. and Canada and the rest of the world. How much of that might be driven by ad load or ad products?"

I can take the question on video distribution as it relates to CapEx and the ad load question and then maybe on the sourcing of content, I'll pass it back to Sheryl. So on the video platform, clearly from an investment perspective, you've seen us step up our CapEx this year pretty substantially, and that's baked into the guidance of $4.5 billion of CapEx which if you'll recall, is at the high end of our prior range. We are investing across our infrastructure to prepare ourselves for growth across all of our different services, and a part of that investment is really to support video. That is -- it's definitely more taxing on the network and we're investing heavily on the network side. And as well, it does also impact our overall needs within the data center servers and the like. So it's certainly an area that we're investing in heavily and we expect to be investing in heavily going forward, Eric. And then on the ad load question, ad load is not something that varies that dramatically by region. So you're really looking at a number of factors. Really, what's driving that is just the dispersion of overall ad demand across region, and we're seeing really good strength across the globe on that front. But ad load is not a big driver of discrepancies in ARPU that you see. That's really something that maps very closely to the size of the mobile ad markets per population in those countries. So it's not an ad load question. And then I'll hand it over to Sheryl to talk about video on a -- from a content perspective."

The power of what a mobile phone can produce and distribute now is pretty incredible when you compare it to just a few years ago to some of the most sophisticated content producers in the world producing for us. We're experimenting across a wide variety of things. We're doing a partnership with the NBA to stream some U.S. men's Olympics team games in the next couple of weeks.

On the DAU and MAU front, a couple of things. One is DAU and MAU are up sequentially and year-over-year in all regions and with trends that are largely consistent with past quarters, so really good, strong growth across the globe on a DAU to MAU ratio. We don't use specific breakdowns of those metrics by demographic. We're obviously pleased with our overall level of growth and engagement. On the teen front, younger users, we continue to be the best way to reach the largest global audience of teens and millennials. Teens remain very -- remain engaged on Facebook. Clearly, how they've used our service has evolved over the years. And in addition to Facebook, they're using Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp. So from a teen perspective, that's some color there. On the ad load front, ad load is definitely up from where we were a few years ago. It's been an important driver of inventory growth. And really, I think one of the things that's enabled us to grow ad load has been improving the quality and the relevance of the ads as you mentioned. And we've been able to do that without negatively impacting user experience. We do expect that ad load will be a less significant factor driving overall growth, especially after mid-2017. The optimal ad load is really a mix of art and science. We've carefully tracked the impact of ads on the user experience over the last several years. We aren't seeing a cause for concern. We also want to be thoughtful about making sure that each person's overall feed experience has the right balance of organic and ad content, and that factors into how we think about ad load and where that might ultimately be. And that's really why we're talking about our expectation that as you get into mid-2017, ad load will not be a big factor in driving overall inventory growth. We still see the opportunity to grow inventory from the growth of people and engagement on Facebook as well as our other services like Instagram. Instagram does have a lower ad load than Facebook."

We had especially strong growth in APAC and the U.S. and Canada, so that was part of the growth. In terms of our marketer segments from brands to direct response to SMBs to developers, the growth is really strong there as well. We're really excited today to announce that we have 60 million small business pages that are using Facebook on a monthly basis. And we're very focused on the opportunity to upsell them to advertising products. I think we have a good track record there. We're also seeing a lot of strength in brands and I think that's because we have a combination of the creative and the storytelling, so the art with the science of the targeting. And when people do that well together, you see great opportunities. So to share one example, Jack in the Box use our canvas ads which are very immersive ads, they're really good for a brand experience, to roll out a new menu item, their Double Jack burger. They worked with agencies Horizon, David&Goliath and Adaptly and they targeted millennials on Facebook to create 2 different custom audience groups. One group was customers who had visited the restaurant web page or engaged with previous video ads. And the second group were people that hadn't engaged with them directly but were quick-service restaurant purchasers. They had an average view rate of 23 seconds across those canvas ads, so clearly, people were very engaged in the brand experience of the ad. And they had a 13-point lift in ad recall and a 9-point lift in purchase impact. And so I think what you're seeing is that across all of the objectives people have from brands, marketers to direct response, to SMB to developers, as our ad products get more sophisticated, our targeting and measurement get better, they have an increased opportunity to grow and that's why we think our growth to date continues to be broad-based."

And we're really trying to give people the full range of tools to share what they care about with anyone that they want. And Live is really effective there and we've seen experiences both in terms of the lighthearted like Candance Payne and also more serious issues around the U.S. and around the globe. So it's really an important part of what we're offering for people to share real experiences. Video as a whole is making a significant contribution to time spent growth. So when we talk about the time spent for DAU growing worldwide across our family in double-digit percentages, video is making a contribution there more broadly."

So I'll talk about sharing and then I think Dave can probably talk about ad load and pricing. So the overall level of sharing is up on Facebook and what we're seeing is that how people share is evolving as we move from desktop to mobile, right. So you can imagine more photos on people's mobile cameras, fewer long photo albums, more ability to capture video, probably a little bit harder to type on mobile, so there's this evolution. The other thing that we see is that now, people have tools to share more privately as well. So when you think about sharing on Facebook, you shouldn't just think about the kind of sharing that you'd see a News Feed, right, so sharing with all your friends, sharing in Groups on Facebook and public sharing which are the trends that I was just talking about. But another area that's growing incredibly quickly is private messaging, right, where between Messenger and WhatsApp, I think we're around 60 billion messages a day which I think is something like 3x more than the peak of global SMS traffic. So that is something that's growing pretty quickly and that we're really excited about as well. And we're just going to continue working on giving people the best tools across the spectrum from private to public and across the spectrum from text-based and simple communication to richer type of media like photos, videos and then eventually, more immersive forms like VR."

And, Justin, in terms of ad load, we talked about the different factors that go into it, obviously, just in driving the overall business. Advertiser demand, that was particularly strong this period. And then also, we match that with supply. And the supply, the 2 big drivers are user and time spent and then ad load. And getting the balance and mix right is important and clearly, how the pricing plays out is via the auction. And we've had a good balance of demand growth and supply growth and that's led to our good strong financial results and our ability to deliver very strong ROI to advertisers. So we think we're in a good zone on the right ad load, and we do think there's opportunities to grow that modestly. But as we look forward into 2017, we think it will be a less significant factor driving inventory growth. But we still think there's opportunities to drive inventory through user growth and time spent. I don't think we would think about necessarily dropping ad load to drive pricing. We're also very cognizant of providing good value to advertisers and getting that balance right is important to driving overall ROI as well as obviously, providing better targeting and measurement tools for our advertisers."

So I'd say we're around the second phase of that in Search now. We have a pretty big navigational use case where people look up people and pages and groups that they want to get to and look at and search. One of the big growing use cases that we're investing a lot in is looking up the content in the ecosystem, and that is an area that we're very excited about which helps people find more content. But certainly, there's a reasonable amount of behavior in there which is looking for things that over time could be monetizable or commercial intent. And at some point, we will probably want to work on that but we're still in the phase of just making it easier for people to find all the content they want and connect with businesses organically."

We don't break out revenue by our different platforms, but the opportunity to take not just video ads but other ad formats we have, bring them to the rest of the web and other apps. with our ability to target and measure, we think is a big one. And what we're starting to see is that people are using Facebook, Instagram and Audience Network to drive their objectives in a cohesive way. So to share an example, Garmin launched the f?nix 3 Sapphire watch and they did it with video ads on Facebook that worked without sound. They targeted outdoor enthusiasts then retargeted people who viewed the Instagram videos with carousel ads on Facebook that highlighted the product features. Then they extended those ads on Audience Network to maximize reach, and they used the Facebook pixel to measure the incremental sales and got to a 9.7x return on ad sales. So that's a really good example of how you can take targeting and the ability to target across Audience Network, Facebook and Instagram and drive people all the way down the funnel. And we think more and more people will do that, particularly as we do a better job of combining the interfaces. So for example, you can buy now in 1 interface on Facebook, Instagram and Audience Network."

I referenced the MSQRD app that we acquired earlier in my remarks, that's kind of a fun way to augment a social experience that you're having with someone. I think that there's a big opportunity to build out that platform and a lot more functionality around that. And one of the big themes that we're talking about here is becoming video-first, right. And as people look for richer and richer ways to express themselves, just like people in the past have shared a lot of text and photos on Facebook, we think that in the future, more of that is going to be video and more of these augmented reality tools, I think, are going to be an important part of delivering that experience and making that fun to use and expressive as it can be."

Every member of Congress right now has a Facebook presence and we're seeing people like one example is Elise Stefanik, she's the youngest person in the Congress. She made a pledge when she was elected that she would explain every vote she takes and she explains every vote she takes on Facebook. With shorter explanations if they're not controversial but longer explanations, that's the kind of mission-based work we're happy about because it brings people closer to the people who are representing them.

And if you compare that to traditional media where people will typically pick a newspaper or a TV station that they want to watch and just get 100% of the view from that, people are actually getting exposed to much more different kinds of content through social media than they would have otherwise or have been in the past.

So we don't think it would be a good experience in News Feed, right.

But if we started playing an ad in the middle of the feed before you got to the video, then that would really go against that. I think people would just watch a lot less of the organic videos that were posted because of that. But the important thing to keep in mind on this is we don't really -- we don't need to do pre-rolls because our model is not one where you come to Facebook to watch one piece of content. You come to look at a feed and putting the ads in between the stories is a much more effective way to do it and better for the user experience."

The way we think about this experience is that qualitatively, I don't know a single person really who wants to call a business to get support or interact with it, right. Whether that's trying to get a reservation for a restaurant or getting customer support our calling to buy something. And those are slow interactions, they're synchronous, they consume your whole attention while you're doing them. And if we can make it so that you can have some of those interactions in an automated way where you fire off a text and then just get a response back quickly but asynchronously so it doesn't take up your full attention, then I think that that's going to be a much better experience that people really enjoy and like. So we're in the experimentation phase, I think, with the platform. We're seeing a lot of good ideas getting tried out and I'm -- I personally enjoy a lot of the different bots that people are using or making, especially the news ones where you get these digests at the end of the day of different kinds of content.

So overall, people are spending more and more time on mobile and that means that there are always more services that people use, right, whether it's YouTube or there's some really interesting ones with younger folks, especially like Musical.ly and Live.ly that I think are pretty interesting as well, Snapchat which you mentioned. And part of why I think you see this is that there are just so many different ways that people want to share, so many different kinds of content ranging from text, to photo, to video, to just richer and richer and more immersive content. And also, there's a range from private one-on-one type sharing to small groups, all your friends at once, large interest-based communities and then ultimately, fully public. And there are different apps that explore different regions of that space and do a good job with it and offer ideas that I think the whole market needs to learn from. Right now, the big theme and strategy that we're executing is we're going to become video-first. And what I mean by that is that this trend where 10 years back, most of what you saw and shared online was text. And then we went through a phase where most of it is photos and we really believe that in, call it, 5 years or whatever the period of time that it takes to get there, I think most of what people consume online is going to be video. And that means that there needs to be a whole range of new production tools and consumption experiences for enabling that. For production, I think that means that you need to get the camera experience and the experience for capturing and uploading videos that you've captured to be much better and a more central part of the experience. On consumption, there are innovations that we've had like autoplay in feed but what's the next version of that, that makes it so that people can have an even more native and default video experience when they're in News Feed, as well as private areas like Messenger and WhatsApp. So I think you're going to see this across all of our apps, more focused on producing this kind of content and making it first-class to consume as well, both in private and public context. And I think that that's just a big trend across the market and one of the big things that if we get right, I think it's going to unlock a lot of sharing and opportunity."

Like you said, we're not specifically breaking out revenue numbers. One thing to just keep in mind is Instagram as an owned and operated property is represented growth in our revenue, so whereas, as I mentioned, the Audience Network, by and large, is going to be recognized net rather than gross. And so that is going to make it smaller in how it's going to appear in the revenue numbers. The overall growth is still being driven predominantly by Facebook. Instagram is clearly making a contribution and then as is the Audience Network. In terms of ad load, as I said, it's been one of the factors driving supply. It's certainly been helpful but there's also DAU growth and time spent per DAU growth, time spent per person, and we continue to feel that there are opportunities to execute on those and continue to grow inventory in that way. So that's where we would focus. As we drive DAU faster than MAU, then that's going to increase that ratio but we're really focused on driving DAU and time spent per person."

We had another good quarter in the first half of the year.

We had another good quarter in the first half of the year. Our community continues to grow around the world. 1.7 billion people now use Facebook every month and 1.1 billion people use it every day. Our business is growing at a healthy rate as well. Total revenue grew by 59% year-over-year to $6.4 billion and advertising revenue was up 63% to $6.2 billion.
Our results show our progress as we work to make the world more open and connected across our 3-, 5- and 10-year horizons. Over the next 3 years, we're focused on continuing to build our community and help people share more of what matters to them. The next 5 years are about building our newer products into full ecosystems with developers and business. And over the next 10 years, we're working to build new technologies to help everyone connect in new ways. 
I'll give an update on our progress across each of these areas, starting with how we're working to deliver better experiences for our community and more ways for people to share more what they care about with anyone they want.
We continue to see excellent growth in our community. Over the past year, we've added over 200 million people using Facebook on a monthly basis. And in the second quarter, time spent per person increased double-digit percentages year-over-year across Facebook, Instagram and Messenger and that doesn't even include WhatsApp yet. 
One of the biggest opportunities to grow our community is in developing countries where connectivity is less advanced than what we take for granted here at home. So over the past couple of years, we've been making steady improvements to our apps to make them work regardless of the device or connection that people are using. We've also built a lightweight version of our Android app called Facebook Lite that's tuned to work on 2G networks and is now used by more than 100 million people. 
We're also working on new tools to help people express themselves and understand what's going on with the people they care about. Ten years ago, most of what we shared and consumed online was text. Now it's photos and soon, most of it will be videos. 
We see a world that is video-first, with video at the heart of all of our apps and services. Over the past 6 months, we've been particularly focused on Live video. Live represents a new way to share what's happening in more immediate and creative ways. This quarter, Candace Payne's Chewbacca mask video was viewed almost 160 million times. Live is also changing the way we see politics as news organizations and delegates go live from the Republican and Democratic conventions. And we've seen in Minnesota and Dallas how Live can shine a light on important moments as they happen.
This quarter, we also launched 360 Photos. You don't need a special camera to take them. You just take a panorama or use a 360 camera app on your phone and post it. And since we launched, more than 4 million 360 photos have been shared on Facebook with 1 million more being shared every week. 
We're making good progress on core services within the Facebook app like Search. A growing way that people use Search is to find what people are saying about a topic across the more than 2.5 trillion posts in our network. Now people are doing more than 2 billion searches a day between looking up people, businesses and other things that they care about. Continuous, steady improvement of services like Search are an important part of helping people connect and realizing our mission.
We're also improving the experience for our community by building our business with more engaging ads. We've always emphasized the importance of measurement and value in driving real results for the businesses that use Facebook, and that means helping them create more relevance and engaging ads. 
Over the next 5 years, we are working hard to build ecosystems around some of our newer products. Instagram now has more than 500 million monthly actives, with more than 300 million daily. Now we're working to make that experience even more engaging. Recently, Instagram began to rank its feed, because we know that people have a better experience when they see more of the stories they care about. We're already seeing a positive impact in terms of time spent and the amount of content that people are sharing. We've also introduced our advertising tools on Instagram, and we're seeing marketers engage with people in creative and innovative ways. 
In the 2 years since we separated Messenger from the main Facebook app, which was a pretty controversial decision at the time, we've improved performance and given people new ways to express themselves. And now, for the first time, more than 1 billion people are using Messenger every month. 
I'm also happy with the updates we're making to WhatsApp which also has a community of more than 1 billion people. This quarter, we launched new desktop apps and end-to-end encryption and millions of people are using WhatsApp's voice calling features. 
The scale we've achieved with our messaging services makes it clear that they are more than just a way to chat with friends. That's why we're also making it easier for people to connect with groups and businesses as well. We're going to keep focusing on this over the next several years.
I'm also excited about the early progress we're making on our 10-year initiative. We're investing in new technologies to give more people a voice, including, of course, the 4 billion people around the world who aren't yet online. And we're helping more people take advantage of the opportunities that come with the Internet.
We're still early in our journey with lots of hard work ahead, but we're making good progress. Like the first successful flight of Aquila, our solar-powered aircraft that will beam Internet to places that have never been connected. Eventually, we're going to work with telecom operators and governments around the world to connect people on the outskirts of cities, rural areas and disaster zones, where you can't get traditional connectivity today. 
We've also been making progress with our initiatives around artificial intelligence and virtual reality. This quarter, we announced DeepText, a deep learning-based engine that can understand the context of several thousand posts per second across 20 different languages. This is a long-term project but it also has some near-term benefits like helping show people more of what they want to see and filtering out less of what they don't want to see. 
We're also investing in new platforms to help people connect and share. We believe that virtual reality can help people share richer experiences and help everyone understand what's going on around the world. It's really early for us in VR but we're hitting some important milestones. As of the second quarter, more than 1 million people a month are now using Oculus on mobile phones through our Gear VR partnership with Samsung. More than 300 apps are already available at the Oculus store for Gear VR. We've filled all of our preorders for Oculus Rift and we're seeing increasing demand from retail as stores plan for the holidays. While it's still early for augmented reality, we're doing AR research and are seeing lightweight versions of AR technology in mobile apps like MSQRD.
So that's a recap of the progress that we're making in our 10-year plan. We have a saying at Facebook that our journey is only 1% done. And while I'm happy with our progress, we have a lot more work to do to grow our community and connect the whole world. That means making big investments and taking risks, focusing not just on what Facebook is but on what it can be. 
I want to thank everyone in our community, all of our teams, our partners and our shareholders for being a part of this journey with us. 
And now, here's Sheryl."

Our growth was broad-based across verticals, marketer segm",1020,"Thanks, Mark, and hi, everyone. We had a great second quarter. Q2 ad revenue grew 63%. Mobile ad revenue reached $5.2 billion, up 81% year-over-year and was approximately 84% of total ad revenues. Our growth was broad-based across verticals, marketer segments and regions.
We're excited to announce that we now have 60 million monthly active business pages on Facebook. We also continue to grow the number of active advertisers on our platform. This shows that both our free and paid products are providing value to marketers of all sizes around the world. 
We continue to focus on our 3 priorities: capitalizing on the shift to mobile; growing the number of marketers using our ad products; and making our ads more relevant and effective. 
First, capitalizing on the shift to mobile. For 32 years, the advertising industry has gathered in Cannes to celebrate creativity. People have shifted to mobile and marketers know they need to catch up. Mobile is no longer a nice to do, it's a must do, and we're working closely with marketers to help them make this transition. 
The best marketers understand that people watch video differently in mobile feeds. The goal is to create what we think of as thumb-stopping creative; videos that grab attention in the first few seconds even without sound. For example, to drive awareness for Sour Patch Kids gum, Mondelez targeted teams with non-chocolate candy interests. Working with VaynerMedia, CARAT and the Facebook Creative Shop, they created punchy, 10-second looping videos tailored for Facebook and Instagram. The campaign helped the Sour Patch Kids portfolio beat sales benchmarks for the entire candy industry.
We're excited to bring more relevant video ads to people both on and off Facebook. In May, we expanded Audience Network to include video for brand objectives. This means that advertisers can place video, brand video ads not just on Facebook and Instagram, but across a network of apps and sites. 
Our second priority is growing the number of marketers using our ad products. Over 1/3 of small and medium businesses in the U.S. don't have a website, and having a mobile presence is even more difficult and expensive. Creating a business page on Facebook is as easy as setting up a personal profile. This is why Facebook pages are the novel solution for many of the 60 million businesses using our products each month in the U.S. and around the world. 
We've made it easy for business owners to manage their Facebook page from their mobile device. Over 85% of active business pages use mobile and 40% of active advertisers have created a Facebook ad on their mobile device. In Q2, we rolled out new tools to make it easier for businesses to promote posts and track performance directly from the Instagram app. 
We've worked hard to make becoming an advertiser as easy as possible for these businesses. With just a few steps and for as little as a few dollars, businesses can boost their posts to reach more people. Simplifying our ad products is key to advertiser acquisition. Over 80% of new advertisers in Q2 started with simplified products like boosted posts. 
Once these businesses begin advertising with us, we make it easy for them to take advantage of even our most sophisticated capabilities. For example, Lighting Etc., a third-generation family-owned business, used Facebook and Instagram ads to drive in-store sales. They targeted 25- to 45-year-old homeowners interested in interior design, living within 35 miles of their showroom in Fort Worth, Texas. 
It was striking to them that on Facebook, the size of our community meant that they can reach over 300,000 people even with such specific targeting. They've seen a 40% increase in revenue in 2016 and they attribute this increase to their ads on Facebook and Instagram.
Our third priority is making our ads more effective and relevant. Our goal is to help our clients grow their businesses, whether it be moving products off shelves, driving online sales or building their brands. Our system constantly looks for the most efficient and effective way to drive these objectives. 
Businesses that want to build their brands need to reach a large audience with a compelling story, and they're seeing strong results from immersive formats like Video and Canvas ads. Businesses working to acquire new customers need to reach high-quality leads and convert them to action. We introduced lead ads in Q1 to make it easy for people to fill out forms on mobile devices right from News Feed. In Q2, we made it possible for advertisers to retarget people who opened or completed a lead ad form. 
For example, Nissan Turkey and the SEM agency used lead ads to collect over 20,000 high-quality leads from people interested in buying a new car. They then used retargeting to show relevant ads to people who had completed these lead ads and ultimately drove vehicle sales. The cost of a high-quality lead was 9.3x lower on Facebook than all other online media.
Businesses selling products are getting search-like ROI from Dynamic Ads. Dynamic Ads allow advertisers to upload their product catalogs and target people with specific products in real time. Over 300 million people see Dynamic Ads each month and over 2.5 billion unique products have been uploaded by marketers. In Q2, we expanded Dynamic Ads to Instagram and also launched Dynamic Ads for travel. For example, you can now advertise specific destinations and dates for hotel rooms.
We're pleased with the value we're driving for our partners and the progress we're making across our 3 priorities. With only a small fraction of our 60 million business pages advertising, we have a lot of opportunity ahead. We also have a lot of hard work to do to help businesses make the shift to mobile and to drive results for our clients. 
I want to thank our clients around the world for their partnership and their ongoing input which informs our product development. I also want to congratulate our global teams on the results of their hard work and thank them for their dedication to our mission. 
Thanks, everyone, and now here's Dave."

Total revenue grew 59% to $6.4 billion and we generated over $2 billion in free cash flow. These results highlight the continued growth and engagement of our global community and the strength of our ads business as advertisers benefit from our increasingly broad and deep portfolio of targeting creative and measurement tools. 
Let's start with our community metrics. This past quarter was our strongest quarter in over 3 years in terms of absolute year-over-year growth of monthly and daily actives on Facebook. In June, 1.13 billion people used Facebook on an average day, up 17% compared to last year. This daily number represents 66% of the 1.71 billion people who visited Facebook in the month of June. 
Mobile continued to drive our growth, with over 1 billion people accessing Facebook via mobile devices on an average day in June, up 22% compared to last year. The growth of our other services also continues to be strong. WhatsApp and Messenger now each have over 1 billion monthly actives and Instagram surpassed 500 million.
Turning now to the financials. My comments today will focus on our GAAP financial metrics and all of our comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial metrics is included in our press release and earnings slides.
Total Q2 revenue was $6.4 billion, up 59%. Q2 ad revenue was $6.2 billion, up 63%. Exchange rates did not impact our overall revenue growth rates this quarter as headwinds in certain currencies were offset by tailwinds in others. U.S. and Canada and Asia Pacific were our fastest-growing regions, with advertising growth rates of 69% and 67%, respectively. Mobile ad revenue was $5.2 billion, up 81% and representing approximately 84% of total ad revenue.
Let's turn to the supply and demand factors that continue to drive our growth. Advertiser demand was particularly strong in Q2 across a broad range of verticals and advertiser objectives. Additionally, supply-side factors, including growth in users, time spent and ad load, all contributed to our Q2 revenue growth.
In Q2, the average price per ad increased 9%, while total ad impressions increased 49%. The reported increase in price was again driven by the continued mix shift towards mobile where we only show higher-priced News Feed ads compared to the mix of News Feed ads and lower-priced right-hand column ads on personal computers.
The 49% increase in total ad impressions was driven primarily by growth in ad impressions served in Facebook's mobile News Feed, where the majority of our ads are shown. 
Payments and other fees revenue was $197 million, down 8%. Remember that payments and other fees revenue is largely generated from games played on personal computers which has declined as people spend less time on their PCs.
Q2 total expenses were $3.7 billion, up 33%, inclusive of $825 million of share-based compensation-related expenses, as well as $193 million of amortization of intangible assets. 
Q2 operating income was $2.7 billion, representing a 43% operating margin. We continue to be pleased with the profitable growth of the business while we invest for the long term.
We ended Q2 with approximately 14,500 employees, up 32% year-over-year. We added about 900 employees in the quarter, with the majority of those in technical functions. We are seeing continued success with our efforts to hire top talent in a market that remains very competitive.
Our Q2 tax rate was 26%. GAAP net income was approximately $2.1 billion or $0.71 per share. Q2 capital expenditures were $1 billion. Year-to-date, capital expenditures totaled $2.1 billion, driven by investments in data centers, servers, office buildings and network infrastructure. Facebook generated over $4 billion in free cash flow in the first half of 2016 and as of June 30, we had over $23 billion in cash and investments.
Turning now to the outlook. First, some color on revenue. We have been pleased with the strength of our advertising revenue in the first half of 2016. As I discussed on our last call, while we expect the main drivers of our advertising revenue growth will continue throughout 2016, we will face tougher comparables as the year progresses, given the accelerating revenue growth rates we experienced in the second half of 2015. Consequently, we anticipate lower advertising revenue growth rates in each successive quarter in 2016. 
Additionally, we anticipate ad load on Facebook will continue to grow modestly over the next 12 months and then will be a less significant factor driving revenue growth after mid-2017.
Since ad load has been one of the important factors in our recent strong period of revenue growth, we expect the rate at which we are able to grow revenue will be impacted accordingly. 
Turning now to expenses. Based on our updated view of the remainder of the year, we are tightening our expense guidance ranges. We expect that full year 2016 total GAAP expense growth will be approximately 30% to 35%, narrowed from our prior range of 30% to 40%. We expect full year 2016 amortization expenses to be approximately $700 million to $800 million and full year 2016 stock-based compensation-related expenses to be approximately $3.1 billion to $3.3 billion. 
Accordingly, we anticipate that our total non-GAAP expenses which exclude stock-based compensation and amortization, will grow in the range of 45% to 50%, narrowed from our prior range of 45% to 55%. We anticipate full year 2016 capital expenditures will be approximately $4.5 billion, as we invest to support the rapid growth of our business. Finally, we expect that our Q3 and full year 2016 tax rates will be similar to our Q2 rates.
In summary, Q2 was another great quarter for Facebook, illustrated by the strong growth and engagement of our global community and continued broad-based strength of our ads business. We're pleased with the results and we will continue to invest in order to best position Facebook for our long-term growth opportunities. 
With that, Chris, let's open up the call for questions."

One on the video platform going forward and how you think about video as a distribution mechanism. How should we think about investments that need to be made in video on both the technical infrastructure side, as well as the sourcing of content type to sort of broaden out the video offering over the next couple of years? And then maybe on the last comment on ad load, just wanted to go back to that for a minute in terms of what you're seeing on ad load by region, because we are seeing a widening gap in revenue per user between U.S. and Canada and the rest of the world. How much of that might be driven by ad load or ad products?"

I can take the question on video distribution as it relates to CapEx and the ad load question and then maybe on the sourcing of content, I'll pass it back to Sheryl. So on the video platform, clearly from an investment perspective, you've seen us step up our CapEx this year pretty substantially, and that's baked into the guidance of $4.5 billion of CapEx which if you'll recall, is at the high end of our prior range. We are investing across our infrastructure to prepare ourselves for growth across all of our different services, and a part of that investment is really to support video. That is -- it's definitely more taxing on the network and we're investing heavily on the network side. And as well, it does also impact our overall needs within the data center servers and the like. So it's certainly an area that we're investing in heavily and we expect to be investing in heavily going forward, Eric. And then on the ad load question, ad load is not something that varies that dramatically by region. So you're really looking at a number of factors. Really, what's driving that is just the dispersion of overall ad demand across region, and we're seeing really good strength across the globe on that front. But ad load is not a big driver of discrepancies in ARPU that you see. That's really something that maps very closely to the size of the mobile ad markets per population in those countries. So it's not an ad load question. And then I'll hand it over to Sheryl to talk about video on a -- from a content perspective."

On the DAU and MAU front, a couple of things. One is DAU and MAU are up sequentially and year-over-year in all regions and with trends that are largely consistent with past quarters, so really good, strong growth across the globe on a DAU to MAU ratio. We don't use specific breakdowns of those metrics by demographic. We're obviously pleased with our overall level of growth and engagement. On the teen front, younger users, we continue to be the best way to reach the largest global audience of teens and millennials. Teens remain very -- remain engaged on Facebook. Clearly, how they've used our service has evolved over the years. And in addition to Facebook, they're using Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp. So from a teen perspective, that's some color there. On the ad load front, ad load is definitely up from where we were a few years ago. It's been an important driver of inventory growth. And really, I think one of the things that's enabled us to grow ad load has been improving the quality and the relevance of the ads as you mentioned. And we've been able to do that without negatively impacting user experience. We do expect that ad load will be a less significant factor driving overall growth, especially after mid-2017. The optimal ad load is really a mix of art and science. We've carefully tracked the impact of ads on the user experience over the last several years. We aren't seeing a cause for concern. We also want to be thoughtful about making sure that each person's overall feed experience has the right balance of organic and ad content, and that factors into how we think about ad load and where that might ultimately be. And that's really why we're talking about our expectation that as you get into mid-2017, ad load will not be a big factor in driving overall inventory growth. We still see the opportunity to grow inventory from the growth of people and engagement on Facebook as well as our other services like Instagram. Instagram does have a lower ad load than Facebook."

We had especially strong growth in APAC and the U.S. and Canada, so that was part of the growth. In terms of our marketer segments from brands to direct response to SMBs to developers, the growth is really strong there as well. We're really excited today to announce that we have 60 million small business pages that are using Facebook on a monthly basis. And we're very focused on the opportunity to upsell them to advertising products. I think we have a good track record there. We're also seeing a lot of strength in brands and I think that's because we have a combination of the creative and the storytelling, so the art with the science of the targeting. And when people do that well together, you see great opportunities. So to share one example, Jack in the Box use our canvas ads which are very immersive ads, they're really good for a brand experience, to roll out a new menu item, their Double Jack burger. They worked with agencies Horizon, David&Goliath and Adaptly and they targeted millennials on Facebook to create 2 different custom audience groups. One group was customers who had visited the restaurant web page or engaged with previous video ads. And the second group were people that hadn't engaged with them directly but were quick-service restaurant purchasers. They had an average view rate of 23 seconds across those canvas ads, so clearly, people were very engaged in the brand experience of the ad. And they had a 13-point lift in ad recall and a 9-point lift in purchase impact. And so I think what you're seeing is that across all of the objectives people have from brands, marketers to direct response, to SMB to developers, as our ad products get more sophisticated, our targeting and measurement get better, they have an increased opportunity to grow and that's why we think our growth to date continues to be broad-based."

So it's really an important part of what we're offering for people to share real experiences. Video as a whole is making a significant contribution to time spent growth. So when we talk about the time spent for DAU growing worldwide across our family in double-digit percentages, video is making a contribution there more broadly."

So I'll talk about sharing and then I think Dave can probably talk about ad load and pricing. So the overall level of sharing is up on Facebook and what we're seeing is that how people share is evolving as we move from desktop to mobile, right. So you can imagine more photos on people's mobile cameras, fewer long photo albums, more ability to capture video, probably a little bit harder to type on mobile, so there's this evolution. The other thing that we see is that now, people have tools to share more privately as well. So when you think about sharing on Facebook, you shouldn't just think about the kind of sharing that you'd see a News Feed, right, so sharing with all your friends, sharing in Groups on Facebook and public sharing which are the trends that I was just talking about. But another area that's growing incredibly quickly is private messaging, right, where between Messenger and WhatsApp, I think we're around 60 billion messages a day which I think is something like 3x more than the peak of global SMS traffic. So that is something that's growing pretty quickly and that we're really excited about as well. And we're just going to continue working on giving people the best tools across the spectrum from private to public and across the spectrum from text-based and simple communication to richer type of media like photos, videos and then eventually, more immersive forms like VR."

And getting the balance and mix right is important and clearly, how the pricing plays out is via the auction. And we've had a good balance of demand growth and supply growth and that's led to our good strong financial results and our ability to deliver very strong ROI to advertisers. So we think we're in a good zone on the right ad load, and we do think there's opportunities to grow that modestly. But as we look forward into 2017, we think it will be a less significant factor driving inventory growth. But we still think there's opportunities to drive inventory through user growth and time spent. I don't think we would think about necessarily dropping ad load to drive pricing. We're also very cognizant of providing good value to advertisers and getting that balance right is important to driving overall ROI as well as obviously, providing better targeting and measurement tools for our advertisers."

So I'd say we're around the second phase of that in Search now. We have a pretty big navigational use case where people look up people and pages and groups that they want to get to and look at and search. One of the big growing use cases that we're investing a lot in is looking up the content in the ecosystem, and that is an area that we're very excited about which helps people find more content. But certainly, there's a reasonable amount of behavior in there which is looking for things that over time could be monetizable or commercial intent. And at some point, we will probably want to work on that but we're still in the phase of just making it easier for people to find all the content they want and connect with businesses organically."

We don't break out revenue by our different platforms, but the opportunity to take not just video ads but other ad formats we have, bring them to the rest of the web and other apps. with our ability to target and measure, we think is a big one. And what we're starting to see is that people are using Facebook, Instagram and Audience Network to drive their objectives in a cohesive way. So to share an example, Garmin launched the fenix 3 Sapphire watch and they did it with video ads on Facebook that worked without sound. They targeted outdoor enthusiasts then retargeted people who viewed the Instagram videos with carousel ads on Facebook that highlighted the product features. Then they extended those ads on Audience Network to maximize reach, and they used the Facebook pixel to measure the incremental sales and got to a 9.7x return on ad sales. So that's a really good example of how you can take targeting and the ability to target across Audience Network, Facebook and Instagram and drive people all the way down the funnel. And we think more and more people will do that, particularly as we do a better job of combining the interfaces. So for example, you can buy now in 1 interface on Facebook, Instagram and Audience Network."

And while the political campaign obviously, a lot of money is spent in ads, that's also true of an Olympics, it's also true of a World Cup, it's also true of a Super Bowl. And so with all these events taking place along the -- around the world, there's no one event that we think drives a huge portion of revenue. That said, we are pleased by what's happened on Facebook for the elections -- for the election cycle, not just on the pay side but actually on the organic side as well. We really see Facebook being embraced by politicians all over the world to get in touch with their constituents, and we're pleased with that. Every member of Congress right now has a Facebook presence and we're seeing people like one example is Elise Stefanik, she's the youngest person in the Congress. She made a pledge when she was elected that she would explain every vote she takes and she explains every vote she takes on Facebook. With shorter explanations if they're not controversial but longer explanations, that's the kind of mission-based work we're happy about because it brings people closer to the people who are representing them. We don't break out how many advertisers are advertising on the Audience Network but we're seeing solid and growing adoption of the Audience Network across the board as we are with Instagram. And we think all of these platforms together really help give us the ability to serve our clients in a very leveraged way and use the targeting and measurement capabilities we've invested in across multiple platforms."

Does this phenomenon in the end increase -- does this phenomenon lead to increased adoption and use of Facebook, creating more polarization of views and less effective communication at least in some areas of people's lives? Mark, how do you think about this line of thought that because people see things that are already in line with what they believe, communication is hindered? Second, when it comes to video ad formats, are you philosophically opposed to pre-rolls? And if yes, why? And if not, what is missing for you to adopt them?"

And basically, what -- the way to think about this is that even if a lot of your friends come from the same kind of background or of the same political or religious beliefs, if you know a couple hundred people, there's a good chance that even maybe a small percent, maybe 5% or 10% or 15% of them will have a different viewpoints which means that their perspectives are now going to be shown in your News Feed. And if you compare that to traditional media where people will typically pick a newspaper or a TV station that they want to watch and just get 100% of the view from that, people are actually getting exposed to much more different kinds of content through social media than they would have otherwise or have been in the past. So it's a good sounding theory and I can get why people repeat it, but it's not true. So I think that that's something that if folks read the research that we put out there, then they'll see that. What was the other question?"

So we don't think it would be a good experience in News Feed, right. Because a lot of when people are finding videos on Facebook is you're scrolling through your News Feed, you're looking at what stories seem interesting to you which is why we did the autoplay videos so that rather than having to take an action, you can just start experiencing the video automatically and continue watching it if it's something that you're interested in. But if we started playing an ad in the middle of the feed before you got to the video, then that would really go against that. I think people would just watch a lot less of the organic videos that were posted because of that. But the important thing to keep in mind on this is we don't really -- we don't need to do pre-rolls because our model is not one where you come to Facebook to watch one piece of content. You come to look at a feed and putting the ads in between the stories is a much more effective way to do it and better for the user experience."

F8 was the big announcement there and I think since then, I think we've announced -- we have more than 10,000 bots in the system, which are basically making it so that different businesses can build automated ways to communicate with people. The way we think about this experience is that qualitatively, I don't know a single person really who wants to call a business to get support or interact with it, right. Whether that's trying to get a reservation for a restaurant or getting customer support our calling to buy something. And those are slow interactions, they're synchronous, they consume your whole attention while you're doing them. And if we can make it so that you can have some of those interactions in an automated way where you fire off a text and then just get a response back quickly but asynchronously so it doesn't take up your full attention, then I think that that's going to be a much better experience that people really enjoy and like. So we're in the experimentation phase, I think, with the platform. We're seeing a lot of good ideas getting tried out and I'm -- I personally enjoy a lot of the different bots that people are using or making, especially the news ones where you get these digests at the end of the day of different kinds of content. And between that and M which is kind of our own internal bot that we're building, I think that this is going to be an interesting area to watch and encourage more interaction between people and businesses in messaging."

And part of why I think you see this is that there are just so many different ways that people want to share, so many different kinds of content ranging from text, to photo, to video, to just richer and richer and more immersive content. And also, there's a range from private one-on-one type sharing to small groups, all your friends at once, large interest-based communities and then ultimately, fully public. And there are different apps that explore different regions of that space and do a good job with it and offer ideas that I think the whole market needs to learn from. Right now, the big theme and strategy that we're executing is we're going to become video-first. And what I mean by that is that this trend where 10 years back, most of what you saw and shared online was text. And then we went through a phase where most of it is photos and we really believe that in, call it, 5 years or whatever the period of time that it takes to get there, I think most of what people consume online is going to be video. And that means that there needs to be a whole range of new production tools and consumption experiences for enabling that. For production, I think that means that you need to get the camera experience and the experience for capturing and uploading videos that you've captured to be much better and a more central part of the experience. On consumption, there are innovations that we've had like autoplay in feed but what's the next version of that, that makes it so that people can have an even more native and default video experience when they're in News Feed, as well as private areas like Messenger and WhatsApp. So I think you're going to see this across all of our apps, more focused on producing this kind of content and making it first-class to consume as well, both in private and public context. And I think that that's just a big trend across the market and one of the big things that if we get right, I think it's going to unlock a lot of sharing and opportunity."

Like you said, we're not specifically breaking out revenue numbers. One thing to just keep in mind is Instagram as an owned and operated property is represented growth in our revenue, so whereas, as I mentioned, the Audience Network, by and large, is going to be recognized net rather than gross. And so that is going to make it smaller in how it's going to appear in the revenue numbers. The overall growth is still being driven predominantly by Facebook. Instagram is clearly making a contribution and then as is the Audience Network. In terms of ad load, as I said, it's been one of the factors driving supply. It's certainly been helpful but there's also DAU growth and time spent per DAU growth, time spent per person, and we continue to feel that there are opportunities to execute on those and continue to grow inventory in that way. So that's where we would focus. As we drive DAU faster than MAU, then that's going to increase that ratio but we're really focused on driving DAU and time spent per person."

We had another good quarter in the first half of the year. Our community continues to grow around the world. 1.7 billion people now use Facebook every month and 1.1 billion people use it every day. Our business is growing at a healthy rate as well. Total revenue grew by 59% year-over-year to $6.4 billion and advertising revenue was up 63% to $6.2 billion.
Our results show our progress as we work to make the world more open and connected across our 3-, 5- and 10-year horizons. Over the next 3 years, we're focused on continuing to build our community and help people share more of what matters to them. The next 5 years are about building our newer products into full ecosystems with developers and business. And over the next 10 years, we're working to build new technologies to help everyone connect in new ways. 
I'll give an update on our progress across each of these areas, starting with how we're working to deliver better experiences for our community and more ways for people to share more what they care about with anyone they want.
We continue to see excellent growth in our community. Over the past year, we've added over 200 million people using Facebook on a monthly basis. And in the second quarter, time spent per person increased double-digit percentages year-over-year across Facebook, Instagram and Messenger and that doesn't even include WhatsApp yet. 
One of the biggest opportunities to grow our community is in developing countries where connectivity is less advanced than what we take for granted here at home. So over the past couple of years, we've been making steady improvements to our apps to make them work regardless of the device or connection that people are using. We've also built a lightweight version of our Android app called Facebook Lite that's tuned to work on 2G networks and is now used by more than 100 million people. 
We're also working on new tools to help people express themselves and understand what's going on with the people they care about. Ten years ago, most of what we shared and consumed online was text. Now it's photos and soon, most of it will be videos. 
We see a world that is video-first, with video at the heart of all of our apps and services. Over the past 6 months, we've been particularly focused on Live video. Live represents a new way to share what's happening in more immediate and creative ways. This quarter, Candace Payne's Chewbacca mask video was viewed almost 160 million times. Live is also changing the way we see politics as news organizations and delegates go live from the Republican and Democratic conventions. And we've seen in Minnesota and Dallas how Live can shine a light on important moments as they happen.
This quarter, we also launched 360 Photos. You don't need a special camera to take them. You just take a panorama or use a 360 camera app on your phone and post it. And since we launched, more than 4 million 360 photos have been shared on Facebook with 1 million more being shared every week. 
We're making good progress on core services within the Facebook app like Search. A growing way that people use Search is to find what people are saying about a topic across the more than 2.5 trillion posts in our network. Now people are doing more than 2 billion searches a day between looking up people, businesses and other things that they care about. Continuous, steady improvement of services like Search are an important part of helping people connect and realizing our mission.
We're also improving the experience for our community by building our business with more engaging ads. We've always emphasized the importance of measurement and value in driving real results for the businesses that use Facebook, and that means helping them create more relevance and engaging ads. 
Over the next 5 years, we are working hard to build ecosystems around some of our newer products. Instagram now has more than 500 million monthly actives, with more than 300 million daily. Now we're working to make that experience even more engaging. Recently, Instagram began to rank its feed, because we know that people have a better experience when they see more of the stories they care about. We're already seeing a positive impact in terms of time spent and the amount of content that people are sharing. We've also introduced our advertising tools on Instagram, and we're seeing marketers engage with people in creative and innovative ways. 
In the 2 years since we separated Messenger from the main Facebook app, which was a pretty controversial decision at the time, we've improved performance and given people new ways to express themselves. And now, for the first time, more than 1 billion people are using Messenger every month. 
I'm also happy with the updates we're making to WhatsApp which also has a community of more than 1 billion people. This quarter, we launched new desktop apps and end-to-end encryption and millions of people are using WhatsApp's voice calling features. 
The scale we've achieved with our messaging services makes it clear that they are more than just a way to chat with friends. That's why we're also making it easier for people to connect with groups and businesses as well. We're going to keep focusing on this over the next several years.
I'm also excited about the early progress we're making on our 10-year initiative. We're investing in new technologies to give more people a voice, including, of course, the 4 billion people around the world who aren't yet online. And we're helping more people take advantage of the opportunities that come with the Internet.
We're still early in our journey with lots of hard work ahead, but we're making good progress. Like the first successful flight of Aquila, our solar-powered aircraft that will beam Internet to places that have never been connected. Eventually, we're going to work with telecom operators and governments around the world to connect people on the outskirts of cities, rural areas and disaster zones, where you can't get traditional connectivity today. 
We've also been making progress with our initiatives around artificial intelligence and virtual reality. This quarter, we announced DeepText, a deep learning-based engine that can understand the context of several thousand posts per second across 20 different languages. This is a long-term project but it also has some near-term benefits like helping show people more of what they want to see and filtering out less of what they don't want to see. 
We're also investing in new platforms to help people connect and share. We believe that virtual reality can help people share richer experiences and help everyone understand what's going on around the world. It's really early for us in VR but we're hitting some important milestones. As of the second quarter, more than 1 million people a month are now using Oculus on mobile phones through our Gear VR partnership with Samsung. More than 300 apps are already available at the Oculus store for Gear VR. We've filled all of our preorders for Oculus Rift and we're seeing increasing demand from retail as stores plan for the holidays. While it's still early for augmented reality, we're doing AR research and are seeing lightweight versions of AR technology in mobile apps like MSQRD.
So that's a recap of the progress that we're making in our 10-year plan. We have a saying at Facebook that our journey is only 1% done. And while I'm happy with our progress, we have a lot more work to do to grow our community and connect the whole world. That means making big investments and taking risks, focusing not just on what Facebook is but on what it can be. 
I want to thank everyone in our community, all of our teams, our partners and our shareholders for being a part of this journey with us. 
And now, here's Sheryl."

Our growth was broad-based across verticals, marketer segm",1020,"Thanks, Mark, and hi, everyone. We had a great second quarter. Q2 ad revenue grew 63%. Mobile ad revenue reached $5.2 billion, up 81% year-over-year and was approximately 84% of total ad revenues. Our growth was broad-based across verticals, marketer segments and regions.
We're excited to announce that we now have 60 million monthly active business pages on Facebook. We also continue to grow the number of active advertisers on our platform. This shows that both our free and paid products are providing value to marketers of all sizes around the world. 
We continue to focus on our 3 priorities: capitalizing on the shift to mobile; growing the number of marketers using our ad products; and making our ads more relevant and effective. 
First, capitalizing on the shift to mobile. For 32 years, the advertising industry has gathered in Cannes to celebrate creativity. People have shifted to mobile and marketers know they need to catch up. Mobile is no longer a nice to do, it's a must do, and we're working closely with marketers to help them make this transition. 
The best marketers understand that people watch video differently in mobile feeds. The goal is to create what we think of as thumb-stopping creative; videos that grab attention in the first few seconds even without sound. For example, to drive awareness for Sour Patch Kids gum, Mondelez targeted teams with non-chocolate candy interests. Working with VaynerMedia, CARAT and the Facebook Creative Shop, they created punchy, 10-second looping videos tailored for Facebook and Instagram. The campaign helped the Sour Patch Kids portfolio beat sales benchmarks for the entire candy industry.
We're excited to bring more relevant video ads to people both on and off Facebook. In May, we expanded Audience Network to include video for brand objectives. This means that advertisers can place video, brand video ads not just on Facebook and Instagram, but across a network of apps and sites. 
Our second priority is growing the number of marketers using our ad products. Over 1/3 of small and medium businesses in the U.S. don't have a website, and having a mobile presence is even more difficult and expensive. Creating a business page on Facebook is as easy as setting up a personal profile. This is why Facebook pages are the novel solution for many of the 60 million businesses using our products each month in the U.S. and around the world. 
We've made it easy for business owners to manage their Facebook page from their mobile device. Over 85% of active business pages use mobile and 40% of active advertisers have created a Facebook ad on their mobile device. In Q2, we rolled out new tools to make it easier for businesses to promote posts and track performance directly from the Instagram app. 
We've worked hard to make becoming an advertiser as easy as possible for these businesses. With just a few steps and for as little as a few dollars, businesses can boost their posts to reach more people. Simplifying our ad products is key to advertiser acquisition. Over 80% of new advertisers in Q2 started with simplified products like boosted posts. 
Once these businesses begin advertising with us, we make it easy for them to take advantage of even our most sophisticated capabilities. For example, Lighting Etc., a third-generation family-owned business, used Facebook and Instagram ads to drive in-store sales. They targeted 25- to 45-year-old homeowners interested in interior design, living within 35 miles of their showroom in Fort Worth, Texas. 
It was striking to them that on Facebook, the size of our community meant that they can reach over 300,000 people even with such specific targeting. They've seen a 40% increase in revenue in 2016 and they attribute this increase to their ads on Facebook and Instagram.
Our third priority is making our ads more effective and relevant. Our goal is to help our clients grow their businesses, whether it be moving products off shelves, driving online sales or building their brands. Our system constantly looks for the most efficient and effective way to drive these objectives. 
Businesses that want to build their brands need to reach a large audience with a compelling story, and they're seeing strong results from immersive formats like Video and Canvas ads. Businesses working to acquire new customers need to reach high-quality leads and convert them to action. We introduced lead ads in Q1 to make it easy for people to fill out forms on mobile devices right from News Feed. In Q2, we made it possible for advertisers to retarget people who opened or completed a lead ad form. 
For example, Nissan Turkey and the SEM agency used lead ads to collect over 20,000 high-quality leads from people interested in buying a new car. They then used retargeting to show relevant ads to people who had completed these lead ads and ultimately drove vehicle sales. The cost of a high-quality lead was 9.3x lower on Facebook than all other online media.
Businesses selling products are getting search-like ROI from Dynamic Ads. Dynamic Ads allow advertisers to upload their product catalogs and target people with specific products in real time. Over 300 million people see Dynamic Ads each month and over 2.5 billion unique products have been uploaded by marketers. In Q2, we expanded Dynamic Ads to Instagram and also launched Dynamic Ads for travel. For example, you can now advertise specific destinations and dates for hotel rooms.
We're pleased with the value we're driving for our partners and the progress we're making across our 3 priorities. With only a small fraction of our 60 million business pages advertising, we have a lot of opportunity ahead. We also have a lot of hard work to do to help businesses make the shift to mobile and to drive results for our clients. 
I want to thank our clients around the world for their partnership and their ongoing input which informs our product development. I also want to congratulate our global teams on the results of their hard work and thank them for their dedication to our mission. 
Thanks, everyone, and now here's Dave."

Total revenue grew 59% to $6.4 billion and we generated over $2 billion in free cash flow. These results highlight the continued growth and engagement of our global community and the strength of our ads business as advertisers benefit from our increasingly broad and deep portfolio of targeting creative and measurement tools. 
Let's start with our community metrics. This past quarter was our strongest quarter in over 3 years in terms of absolute year-over-year growth of monthly and daily actives on Facebook. In June, 1.13 billion people used Facebook on an average day, up 17% compared to last year. This daily number represents 66% of the 1.71 billion people who visited Facebook in the month of June. 
Mobile continued to drive our growth, with over 1 billion people accessing Facebook via mobile devices on an average day in June, up 22% compared to last year. The growth of our other services also continues to be strong. WhatsApp and Messenger now each have over 1 billion monthly actives and Instagram surpassed 500 million.
Turning now to the financials. My comments today will focus on our GAAP financial metrics and all of our comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial metrics is included in our press release and earnings slides.
Total Q2 revenue was $6.4 billion, up 59%. Q2 ad revenue was $6.2 billion, up 63%. Exchange rates did not impact our overall revenue growth rates this quarter as headwinds in certain currencies were offset by tailwinds in others. U.S. and Canada and Asia Pacific were our fastest-growing regions, with advertising growth rates of 69% and 67%, respectively. Mobile ad revenue was $5.2 billion, up 81% and representing approximately 84% of total ad revenue.
Let's turn to the supply and demand factors that continue to drive our growth. Advertiser demand was particularly strong in Q2 across a broad range of verticals and advertiser objectives. Additionally, supply-side factors, including growth in users, time spent and ad load, all contributed to our Q2 revenue growth.
In Q2, the average price per ad increased 9%, while total ad impressions increased 49%. The reported increase in price was again driven by the continued mix shift towards mobile where we only show higher-priced News Feed ads compared to the mix of News Feed ads and lower-priced right-hand column ads on personal computers.
The 49% increase in total ad impressions was driven primarily by growth in ad impressions served in Facebook's mobile News Feed, where the majority of our ads are shown. 
Payments and other fees revenue was $197 million, down 8%. Remember that payments and other fees revenue is largely generated from games played on personal computers which has declined as people spend less time on their PCs.
Q2 total expenses were $3.7 billion, up 33%, inclusive of $825 million of share-based compensation-related expenses, as well as $193 million of amortization of intangible assets. 
Q2 operating income was $2.7 billion, representing a 43% operating margin. We continue to be pleased with the profitable growth of the business while we invest for the long term.
We ended Q2 with approximately 14,500 employees, up 32% year-over-year. We added about 900 employees in the quarter, with the majority of those in technical functions. We are seeing continued success with our efforts to hire top talent in a market that remains very competitive.
Our Q2 tax rate was 26%. GAAP net income was approximately $2.1 billion or $0.71 per share. Q2 capital expenditures were $1 billion. Year-to-date, capital expenditures totaled $2.1 billion, driven by investments in data centers, servers, office buildings and network infrastructure. Facebook generated over $4 billion in free cash flow in the first half of 2016 and as of June 30, we had over $23 billion in cash and investments.
Turning now to the outlook. First, some color on revenue. We have been pleased with the strength of our advertising revenue in the first half of 2016. As I discussed on our last call, while we expect the main drivers of our advertising revenue growth will continue throughout 2016, we will face tougher comparables as the year progresses, given the accelerating revenue growth rates we experienced in the second half of 2015. Consequently, we anticipate lower advertising revenue growth rates in each successive quarter in 2016. 
Additionally, we anticipate ad load on Facebook will continue to grow modestly over the next 12 months and then will be a less significant factor driving revenue growth after mid-2017.
Since ad load has been one of the important factors in our recent strong period of revenue growth, we expect the rate at which we are able to grow revenue will be impacted accordingly. 
Turning now to expenses. Based on our updated view of the remainder of the year, we are tightening our expense guidance ranges. We expect that full year 2016 total GAAP expense growth will be approximately 30% to 35%, narrowed from our prior range of 30% to 40%. We expect full year 2016 amortization expenses to be approximately $700 million to $800 million and full year 2016 stock-based compensation-related expenses to be approximately $3.1 billion to $3.3 billion. 
Accordingly, we anticipate that our total non-GAAP expenses which exclude stock-based compensation and amortization, will grow in the range of 45% to 50%, narrowed from our prior range of 45% to 55%. We anticipate full year 2016 capital expenditures will be approximately $4.5 billion, as we invest to support the rapid growth of our business. Finally, we expect that our Q3 and full year 2016 tax rates will be similar to our Q2 rates.
In summary, Q2 was another great quarter for Facebook, illustrated by the strong growth and engagement of our global community and continued broad-based strength of our ads business. We're pleased with the results and we will continue to invest in order to best position Facebook for our long-term growth opportunities. 
With that, Chris, let's open up the call for questions."

One on the video platform going forward and how you think about video as a distribution mechanism. How should we think about investments that need to be made in video on both the technical infrastructure side, as well as the sourcing of content type to sort of broaden out the video offering over the next couple of years? And then maybe on the last comment on ad load, just wanted to go back to that for a minute in terms of what you're seeing on ad load by region, because we are seeing a widening gap in revenue per user between U.S. and Canada and the rest of the world. How much of that might be driven by ad load or ad products?"

I can take the question on video distribution as it relates to CapEx and the ad load question and then maybe on the sourcing of content, I'll pass it back to Sheryl. So on the video platform, clearly from an investment perspective, you've seen us step up our CapEx this year pretty substantially, and that's baked into the guidance of $4.5 billion of CapEx which if you'll recall, is at the high end of our prior range. We are investing across our infrastructure to prepare ourselves for growth across all of our different services, and a part of that investment is really to support video. That is -- it's definitely more taxing on the network and we're investing heavily on the network side. And as well, it does also impact our overall needs within the data center servers and the like. So it's certainly an area that we're investing in heavily and we expect to be investing in heavily going forward, Eric. And then on the ad load question, ad load is not something that varies that dramatically by region. So you're really looking at a number of factors. Really, what's driving that is just the dispersion of overall ad demand across region, and we're seeing really good strength across the globe on that front. But ad load is not a big driver of discrepancies in ARPU that you see. That's really something that maps very closely to the size of the mobile ad markets per population in those countries. So it's not an ad load question. And then I'll hand it over to Sheryl to talk about video on a -- from a content perspective."

The power of what a mobile phone can produce and distribute now is pretty incredible when you compare it to just a few years ago to some of the most sophisticated content producers in the world producing for us. We're experimenting across a wide variety of things. We're doing a partnership with the NBA to stream some U.S. men's Olympics team games in the next couple of weeks.

On the DAU and MAU front, a couple of things. One is DAU and MAU are up sequentially and year-over-year in all regions and with trends that are largely consistent with past quarters, so really good, strong growth across the globe on a DAU to MAU ratio. We don't use specific breakdowns of those metrics by demographic. We're obviously pleased with our overall level of growth and engagement. On the teen front, younger users, we continue to be the best way to reach the largest global audience of teens and millennials. Teens remain very -- remain engaged on Facebook. Clearly, how they've used our service has evolved over the years. And in addition to Facebook, they're using Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp. So from a teen perspective, that's some color there. On the ad load front, ad load is definitely up from where we were a few years ago. It's been an important driver of inventory growth. And really, I think one of the things that's enabled us to grow ad load has been improving the quality and the relevance of the ads as you mentioned. And we've been able to do that without negatively impacting user experience. We do expect that ad load will be a less significant factor driving overall growth, especially after mid-2017. The optimal ad load is really a mix of art and science. We've carefully tracked the impact of ads on the user experience over the last several years. We aren't seeing a cause for concern. We also want to be thoughtful about making sure that each person's overall feed experience has the right balance of organic and ad content, and that factors into how we think about ad load and where that might ultimately be. And that's really why we're talking about our expectation that as you get into mid-2017, ad load will not be a big factor in driving overall inventory growth. We still see the opportunity to grow inventory from the growth of people and engagement on Facebook as well as our other services like Instagram. Instagram does have a lower ad load than Facebook."

We had especially strong growth in APAC and the U.S. and Canada, so that was part of the growth. In terms of our marketer segments from brands to direct response to SMBs to developers, the growth is really strong there as well. We're really excited today to announce that we have 60 million small business pages that are using Facebook on a monthly basis. And we're very focused on the opportunity to upsell them to advertising products. I think we have a good track record there. We're also seeing a lot of strength in brands and I think that's because we have a combination of the creative and the storytelling, so the art with the science of the targeting. And when people do that well together, you see great opportunities. So to share one example, Jack in the Box use our canvas ads which are very immersive ads, they're really good for a brand experience, to roll out a new menu item, their Double Jack burger. They worked with agencies Horizon, David&Goliath and Adaptly and they targeted millennials on Facebook to create 2 different custom audience groups. One group was customers who had visited the restaurant web page or engaged with previous video ads. And the second group were people that hadn't engaged with them directly but were quick-service restaurant purchasers. They had an average view rate of 23 seconds across those canvas ads, so clearly, people were very engaged in the brand experience of the ad. And they had a 13-point lift in ad recall and a 9-point lift in purchase impact. And so I think what you're seeing is that across all of the objectives people have from brands, marketers to direct response, to SMB to developers, as our ad products get more sophisticated, our targeting and measurement get better, they have an increased opportunity to grow and that's why we think our growth to date continues to be broad-based."

So I'll talk about sharing and then I think Dave can probably talk about ad load and pricing. So the overall level of sharing is up on Facebook and what we're seeing is that how people share is evolving as we move from desktop to mobile, right. So you can imagine more photos on people's mobile cameras, fewer long photo albums, more ability to capture video, probably a little bit harder to type on mobile, so there's this evolution. The other thing that we see is that now, people have tools to share more privately as well. So when you think about sharing on Facebook, you shouldn't just think about the kind of sharing that you'd see a News Feed, right, so sharing with all your friends, sharing in Groups on Facebook and public sharing which are the trends that I was just talking about. But another area that's growing incredibly quickly is private messaging, right, where between Messenger and WhatsApp, I think we're around 60 billion messages a day which I think is something like 3x more than the peak of global SMS traffic. So that is something that's growing pretty quickly and that we're really excited about as well. And we're just going to continue working on giving people the best tools across the spectrum from private to public and across the spectrum from text-based and simple communication to richer type of media like photos, videos and then eventually, more immersive forms like VR."

And, Justin, in terms of ad load, we talked about the different factors that go into it, obviously, just in driving the overall business. Advertiser demand, that was particularly strong this period. And then also, we match that with supply. And the supply, the 2 big drivers are user and time spent and then ad load. And getting the balance and mix right is important and clearly, how the pricing plays out is via the auction. And we've had a good balance of demand growth and supply growth and that's led to our good strong financial results and our ability to deliver very strong ROI to advertisers. So we think we're in a good zone on the right ad load, and we do think there's opportunities to grow that modestly. But as we look forward into 2017, we think it will be a less significant factor driving inventory growth. But we still think there's opportunities to drive inventory through user growth and time spent. I don't think we would think about necessarily dropping ad load to drive pricing. We're also very cognizant of providing good value to advertisers and getting that balance right is important to driving overall ROI as well as obviously, providing better targeting and measurement tools for our advertisers."

First, building a consumer use case; then second, making it so that people can organically interact with businesses; and then third, on top of that, once there's a large volume of people interacting with businesses, give businesses tools to reach more people and pay, and that's ultimately the business opportunity. So I'd say we're around the second phase of that in Search now. We have a pretty big navigational use case where people look up people and pages and groups that they want to get to and look at and search. One of the big growing use cases that we're investing a lot in is looking up the content in the ecosystem, and that is an area that we're very excited about which helps people find more content. But certainly, there's a reasonable amount of behavior in there which is looking for things that over time could be monetizable or commercial intent. And at some point, we will probably want to work on that but we're still in the phase of just making it easier for people to find all the content they want and connect with businesses organically."

We don't break out revenue by our different platforms, but the opportunity to take not just video ads but other ad formats we have, bring them to the rest of the web and other apps. with our ability to target and measure, we think is a big one. And what we're starting to see is that people are using Facebook, Instagram and Audience Network to drive their objectives in a cohesive way. So to share an example, Garmin launched the fenix 3 Sapphire watch and they did it with video ads on Facebook that worked without sound. They targeted outdoor enthusiasts then retargeted people who viewed the Instagram videos with carousel ads on Facebook that highlighted the product features. Then they extended those ads on Audience Network to maximize reach, and they used the Facebook pixel to measure the incremental sales and got to a 9.7x return on ad sales. So that's a really good example of how you can take targeting and the ability to target across Audience Network, Facebook and Instagram and drive people all the way down the funnel. And we think more and more people will do that, particularly as we do a better job of combining the interfaces. So for example, you can buy now in 1 interface on Facebook, Instagram and Audience Network."

I referenced the MSQRD app that we acquired earlier in my remarks, that's kind of a fun way to augment a social experience that you're having with someone. I think that there's a big opportunity to build out that platform and a lot more functionality around that. And one of the big themes that we're talking about here is becoming video-first, right.

She made a pledge when she was elected that she would explain every vote she takes and she explains every vote she takes on Facebook.

And if you compare that to traditional media where people will typically pick a newspaper or a TV station that they want to watch and just get 100% of the view from that, people are actually getting exposed to much more different kinds of content through social media than they would have otherwise or have been in the past.

So we don't think it would be a good experience in News Feed, right. Because a lot of when people are finding videos on Facebook is you're scrolling through your News Feed, you're looking at what stories seem interesting to you which is why we did the autoplay videos so that rather than having to take an action, you can just start experiencing the video automatically and continue watching it if it's something that you're interested in. But if we started playing an ad in the middle of the feed before you got to the video, then that would really go against that. I think people would just watch a lot less of the organic videos that were posted because of that. But the important thing to keep in mind on this is we don't really -- we don't need to do pre-rolls because our model is not one where you come to Facebook to watch one piece of content. You come to look at a feed and putting the ads in between the stories is a much more effective way to do it and better for the user experience."

The way we think about this experience is that qualitatively, I don't know a single person really who wants to call a business to get support or interact with it, right. Whether that's trying to get a reservation for a restaurant or getting customer support our calling to buy something. And those are slow interactions, they're synchronous, they consume your whole attention while you're doing them. And if we can make it so that you can have some of those interactions in an automated way where you fire off a text and then just get a response back quickly but asynchronously so it doesn't take up your full attention, then I think that that's going to be a much better experience that people really enjoy and like. So we're in the experimentation phase, I think, with the platform. We're seeing a lot of good ideas getting tried out and I'm -- I personally enjoy a lot of the different bots that people are using or making, especially the news ones where you get these digests at the end of the day of different kinds of content.

So overall, people are spending more and more time on mobile and that means that there are always more services that people use, right, whether it's YouTube or there's some really interesting ones with younger folks, especially like Musical.ly and Live.ly that I think are pretty interesting as well, Snapchat which you mentioned. And part of why I think you see this is that there are just so many different ways that people want to share, so many different kinds of content ranging from text, to photo, to video, to just richer and richer and more immersive content. And also, there's a range from private one-on-one type sharing to small groups, all your friends at once, large interest-based communities and then ultimately, fully public. And there are different apps that explore different regions of that space and do a good job with it and offer ideas that I think the whole market needs to learn from. Right now, the big theme and strategy that we're executing is we're going to become video-first. And what I mean by that is that this trend where 10 years back, most of what you saw and shared online was text. And then we went through a phase where most of it is photos and we really believe that in, call it, 5 years or whatever the period of time that it takes to get there, I think most of what people consume online is going to be video. And that means that there needs to be a whole range of new production tools and consumption experiences for enabling that. For production, I think that means that you need to get the camera experience and the experience for capturing and uploading videos that you've captured to be much better and a more central part of the experience. On consumption, there are innovations that we've had like autoplay in feed but what's the next version of that, that makes it so that people can have an even more native and default video experience when they're in News Feed, as well as private areas like Messenger and WhatsApp. So I think you're going to see this across all of our apps, more focused on producing this kind of content and making it first-class to consume as well, both in private and public context. And I think that that's just a big trend across the market and one of the big things that if we get right, I think it's going to unlock a lot of sharing and opportunity."

Like you said, we're not specifically breaking out revenue numbers. One thing to just keep in mind is Instagram as an owned and operated property is represented growth in our revenue, so whereas, as I mentioned, the Audience Network, by and large, is going to be recognized net rather than gross. And so that is going to make it smaller in how it's going to appear in the revenue numbers. The overall growth is still being driven predominantly by Facebook. Instagram is clearly making a contribution and then as is the Audience Network. In terms of ad load, as I said, it's been one of the factors driving supply. It's certainly been helpful but there's also DAU growth and time spent per DAU growth, time spent per person, and we continue to feel that there are opportunities to execute on those and continue to grow inventory in that way. So that's where we would focus. As we drive DAU faster than MAU, then that's going to increase that ratio but we're really focused on driving DAU and time spent per person."

We had another good quarter. Our community continues to grow around the world. We're pleased to see nearly 1.8 billion people now use Facebook every month and nearly 1.2 billion people use it everyday. It's also great to see the continued growth and strength of engagement on our platform, and our ads growth is growing at a healthy rate as well.  Total revenue grew by 56% year-over-year to $7 billion, and advertising revenue was up 59% to $6.8 billion.
I want to start by talking about our work around putting video first across our apps. People are creating and sharing more video, and we think it's pretty clear that video is only going to become more important. So that's why we're prioritizing putting video first across our family of apps and taking steps to make it even easier for people to express themselves in richer ways.
One way we're putting video first is through live video on Facebook. Since May, the number of people going live at any given moment has grown by 4x, and people have gone live from all 7 continents and also from outer space. Another recent example is Instagram Stories, which we launched in August. Instagram Stories is a lightweight way for people to share moments of their day through photos and videos that appear in a slide show format and disappear after 24 hours. Stories now has more than 100 million daily actives. We also improved the Explore tab in Instagram to include more videos and stories, and it has 100 million daily actives now as well.
In addition to making it easy to share video, we also want to make it easier to capture video. In most social apps today, a text box is still the default way we share. Soon, we believe a camera will be the main way that we share.
We're already testing this in our main Facebook app with the version of [indiscernible] camera directly just one swipe away from News Feed and with creative effects for your photos and videos. And in Messenger, we're testing new camera and video features. We'll be experimenting with even more visual messaging tools over the next few months as well. So those are a few examples of some of the things that we're doing to put video first across our family of apps.
Now I'll give you an update on our progress over our 3-, 5- and 10-year time horizon. Over the next 3 years, we're focusing on making our core services more useful and engaging. The 2016 Summer Olympics were huge on Facebook with more than 270 million people creating 1.5 billion interactions. Facebook helped bring the world together, and athletes, fans and media went live throughout the game, including athletes who went live from the Olympic Village and Michael Phelps, who even announced his retirement on our platform.
This election season has also driven a lot of conversations, including on Facebook, where we've made it easier for voters and candidates to communicate with each other. In the first 9 months of this year, 109 million people on Facebook in the U.S. generated over 5.3 billion posts, comments and likes and shares related to the election. During the primaries in September, we also added a Register to Vote link at the top of our Facebook app that we estimate helped more than 2 million people register to vote, some who were registering for the first time. Facebook really is the new town hall, and we're proud of the role that we played in enabling dialogue and increasing civic engagement. That's the 3-year update.
Over the next 5 years, we're going to keep building ecosystems around products that a lot of people already use everyday. Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp each have large communities, but we have a lot more work to do on all of them. I think about our progress here in 3 phases: The first phase is building a great consumer experience and getting it to scale; The second phase is about enabling people to organically interact with businesses; and then the third phase is to give businesses tools to reach more people. And that's where we build our business.
Right now Instagram has moved into that third phase. Instagram has more than 500 million monthly actives and more than 300 million daily actives. We're making good progress helping businesses and marketers use Instagram in new ways, and Sheryl will talk more about that in a few minutes.
Messenger is early in the second phase. We're helping businesses and consumers increasingly interact in richer ways. Today, there are 33,000 bots live on Messenger. We also launched Messenger Lite, which is designed to make messaging fast and easy with a wide variety of Android phones and for people who are on slower networks as well.
A lot of businesses use WhatsApp already, but we're going to really start working on the second phase in the next year. Right now we're testing new camera features, and we're continuing to keep features fast and reliable on multiple devices in every network condition.
Finally, we're starting to build communities around completely new apps. This quarter, we launched the Workplace to help make organizations more connected and productive. Workplace is a communications platform that uses features that people know like News Feed, groups and messages to help them collaborate and share at work the same way that they do everywhere else. Already, more than 1,000 organizations are using Workplace, including Starbucks, Royal Bank of Scotland and Danone, and we're adding more all the time. We're also getting new services to scale in the core app.
In October, we also launched the Marketplace tab to help people discover, buy and sell things with people in their community. While we just launched Marketplace, many millions of people have been buying and selling things in Facebook for sale groups for a while, and we think this is going to be an important tool going forward.
Over the next 10 years, we're going to continue to invest in the platforms and technologies that will connect more people in more places and allow everyone in the world to have a voice. We focused our long-term innovation road map around 3 areas: connectivity initiatives that bring more people online, artificial intelligence, and virtual and augmented reality.
On connectivity, through our efforts with internet.org, we've connected 40 million people based on our best estimate. And we're making good progress with our Express WiFi program, which empowers entrepreneurs to build a business by providing their community with access to the Internet.
On artificial intelligence, we're starting to see the impact that AI can have on enhancing people's experiences on Facebook and showing them more of what they care about. More than 40 teams at Facebook and more than 25% of our engineers are already using AI to power the products and services they build. We've made changes to our -- and improvements to our AI in order to filter out misleading click-bait stories from News Feed. And we're using AI to help find terrorist propaganda on Facebook. It's still early, but we think that AI will help improve the quality of what people see and can share on our platform.
We also took some important steps forward on virtual reality to help people experience the world in richer and more immersive ways. At Oculus Connect, we announced that touch controllers for Rift will ship in early December with 35 games and experiences exclusively built for Touch. And since we believe the next phase of VR is great software experiences, we're investing another $250 million in virtual reality content on top of the money that we've already invested.
So this was a very busy third quarter, and 2016 is shaping up to be a year of important progress for Facebook. Our business is performing well, and while I'm happy about what we've accomplished, we're really just getting started. We want to continue to invest aggressively to accomplish our goals, which is why we're hiring, especially in engineering, which is going to be one of our top priorities going into 2017. And Dave will say more about this in his remarks.
Everything we do is about opening the world to everyone and helping more people to connect and share. So I want to thank our entire community, all of our teams, our partners and our shareholders for being a part of this journey with us. 
Now here's Sheryl."

Mobile ad revenue reached $5.7 billion, up 70% year-over-year and was approximately 84% of total ad revenues. Our growth was broad based across all regions, marketer segments and verticals.
In Q3, we announced that we have over 4 million active advertisers on Facebook and over 500,000 active advertisers on Instagram. The number of advertisers on those platforms continues to grow quickly, and we're pleased to see more and more of them using the full range of our ad products. We continue to focus on our 3 priorities: capitalizing on the shift to mobile, growing the number of marketers using our ad products and making our ads more relevant and effective.
First, capitalizing on the shift to mobile. People have shifted to mobile, and we remain focused on helping businesses catch up. We know that marketing shift takes time. The first TV ad showed people standing in front of microphones reading a radio ad. Similarly, many of the first mobile video ads were TV ads dropped into mobile. Ads optimized for each platform often perform better, so marketers are increasingly tailoring their creative for mobile.
We're excited to see the world's largest advertisers realize that the small screen is big. In September, P&G Chief Brand Officer Marc Pritchard, GM CEO Mary Barra and I addressed the Adweek audience together. Marc described how P&G is creating mobile video ads designed to grab attention in the first few seconds. He shared the example of Tide. In a typical TV ad, they start with a clean dress or shirt, show it getting stained and then cleaned with Tide. On mobile, they need to communicate the product value more quickly, so they start by showing Tide cleaning a stained garment.
Mary shared GM's success with Facebook mobile video ads. In Q3, GM's subsidiary, Holden, used carousel ad plus video to maximize its sponsorship of Australia's premier rugby tournament. Holden created a video series about their support of youth rugby. The ads generated an 8 point lift in brand favorability for the overall audience and a 15 point lift amongst their target audience of women over 35.
For many small businesses, the shift to mobile means leveraging video for the very first time. Rather than needing a camera crew and production budget, anyone with a smartphone can shoot a video and share it on Facebook. In the past month alone, over 3 million small businesses have posted a video on Facebook in creating organic posts and ads.
Our second priority is growing the number of marketers using our ad products. We continue to focus on our advertiser pipeline. In Q2, we announced that over 60 million businesses use our free Facebook pages product each month, and we introduced the Instagram equivalent, business profiles, which are being used by 1.5 million businesses.
On past calls, I've talked about product simplification as a driver of advertiser growth on Facebook. Now with the launch of promoted posts, we are seeing that on Instagram, too. Like boosted posts on Facebook, promoted posts on Instagram are an easy way to start advertising, and we're pleased with adoption.
Over 85% of business pages are active on mobile, so we're making it easier for advertisers to manage campaigns from their phones. In Q3, we added a feature that shows marketers a preview of a potential ad in News Feed just as their customers would see it. They can then [ph] run the ad with just a few taps from their mobile device. Making it easy to advertise from a mobile phone is especially important in emerging markets. For businesses operating in areas with weak network connections, we continue to build advertising tools into Facebook Lite, our low-bandwidth app and are making more of them available offline.
Our third priority is making our ads more relevant and effective. Our goal is to be the #1 driver of growth for our clients. In Q3, we introduced tools to help businesses find people around the world who look like their current customers and target the ones most likely to convert. 
For example, Company, an outdoor gear and apparel business started by a young man out of his parents' home, used international lookalike targeting to reach customers in 32 countries and increased sales by 37%. We're focused on driving purchases online and in stores. In Q2, we launched estimated store visits, which show advertisers how many people came to their store after seeing an ad. And this quarter, we made it possible for advertisers to optimize campaigns for in-store visits. 
We also expanded dynamic ads, a proven way to drive online sales for in-store retail objectives. Businesses can use dynamic ads for retail to show people the products available at their closest location in real-time and reach people likely to visit their store.
To prove the value we're driving for our partners, we continue to invest in measurement. This quarter, we announced new third-party partnerships with Nielsen Datalogix, Visual IQ and Market Share to help our clients measure how Facebook ads drive business results.
We're pleased with the value we're driving for our partners, and we remain focused on helping them make the shift to mobile. With only a small fraction of businesses on Facebook and Instagram advertising, we have a lot of opportunity in front of us. We also have a lot of hard work to do to help our partners around the world use mobile to drive their businesses. 
I want to thank our clients around the world for their partnership and congratulate our global teams on the results of their continued focus and dedication. Thanks, and now here's Dave."

Q3 was another strong quarter for Facebook. Total revenue grew 56% and exceeded $7 billion for the first time, and we delivered $2.4 billion in GAAP net income, up 166%. We saw healthy growth and engagement",1168,"Thanks, Sheryl, and good afternoon, everyone. Q3 was another strong quarter for Facebook. Total revenue grew 56% and exceeded $7 billion for the first time, and we delivered $2.4 billion in GAAP net income, up 166%. 
We saw healthy growth and engagement in our community as well as broad-based strength in our mobile apps business. Let's start with our community metrics. In September, 1.18 billion people used Facebook on an average day, up 172 million or 17% compared to last year. This daily number represents 66% of the 1.79 billion people that use Facebook in the month of September. Mobile continues to drive our growth, with 1.09 billion people accessing Facebook on mobile on an average day in September, up approximately 197 million or 22% compared to last year.
Turning now to the financials. My comments today will focus on our GAAP financial metrics, and all of our comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial metrics is included in our press release and earnings slides.
Q3 total revenue was approximately $7 billion, up 56%. Q3 ad revenue was $6.8 billion, up 59%. Exchange rates did not impact our overall growth this quarter as headwinds in certain currencies were offset by tailwinds in others. 
Asia Pacific and North America were our fastest-growing regions, with ad revenue growth rates of 64% and 62%, respectively. Ad revenue grew at a rate of 50% or more in all regions in Q3. Mobile ad revenue was $5.7 billion, up 70% and representing approximately 84% of total ad revenue.
On prior calls, we have discussed the supply and demand factors that drive our mobile ads business. As Sheryl noted earlier, advertiser demand remained strong in Q3 across all geographies, verticals and marketers segment. We also benefited from growth in users, time spent and ad loads. It is worth noting that desktop ad revenue grew 18%, which is higher growth rates in recent quarters and was aided by our effort to limit the impact of ad blockers on advertising served via web browsers.
Our price volume trends were similar to those we reported last quarter. The average price per ad increased 6% in Q3 while total ad impressions increased 50%. The reported price -- reported increase in price continues to be driven by the ongoing mix shift towards mobile, where we show only higher-priced feed ads. Impression growth was primarily driven by mobile feed ads on Facebook and Instagram. Payments and other fees revenue was $195 million, down 3%. Payments and other fees revenue is largely generated from games played on personal computers, which has declined as people spend less time on their PCs.
Q3 total expenses were $3.9 billion, up 28%. This includes $839 million of share-based compensation expenses and related payroll taxes as well as $195 million of amortization of intangible assets.
In Q3, we hired over 1,200 people and ended the quarter with approximately 15,700 employees, up 31% compared to last year. We remain committed to investing aggressively in hiring, including expanding our technical and recruiting teams globally. 
Q3 operating income was $3.1 billion, representing a 45% margin. Our tax rate was 25%. GAAP net income was $2.4 billion or $0.82 per share. Q3 capital expenditures were $1.1 billion. Year-to-date through September, capital expenditures were $3.2 billion, up 76% driven by investments in data centers, servers, office buildings and network infrastructure. In addition to our new data center projects in Texas and Ireland, we recently broke ground on our seventh data center facility in New Mexico, which we anticipate will come online in late 2018. We generated approximately $2.5 billion of free cash flow and ended the quarter with $26.1 billion in cash and investments.
Turning now to the outlook for the remainder of 2016. First, some color on revenue. We continue to expect that revenue growth rates will decline in Q4 as we lap a strong fourth quarter in 2015. We also continue to expect that our total payments and other fees revenue in Q4 will be lower than it was in the fourth quarter of last year.
Turning now to the 2016 expense outlook. Based on our year-to-date results and our updated view of the remainder of the year, we are adjusting our expense guidance ranges. We now expect that full year 2016 GAAP expense growth will be at the lower end of our prior range of 30% to 35%. We expect full year 2016 amortization expenses to be approximately $700 million to $800 million and the full year 2016 share-based compensation expenses to be approximately $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion. 
Accordingly, we anticipate that our total non-GAAP expenses, which exclude those share-based compensation and amortization expenses, will grow in the range of 40% to 45%, down from our prior range of 45% to 50%. We anticipate full year capital expenditures to be approximately $4.5 billion as we invest aggressively to support the rapid growth of the business. We expect that our Q4 and full year 2016 tax rates will be in line with the year-to-date tax rates. 
I also wanted to provide some brief comments on 2017. First on revenue. As I mentioned, last quarter, we continue to expect that ad load will play a less significant factor driving revenue growth after mid-2017. Over the past 2 years, we've averaged about 50% revenue growth in advertising. Ad load has been 1 of the 3 primary factors fueling that growth. With a much smaller contribution from this important factor going forward, we expect to see ad revenue growth rates come down meaningfully.
Secondly on expenses. Though it's premature to provide specific expense guidance, as Mark mentioned, we anticipate 2017 will be an aggressive investment year. Adding top engineering talent remains one of our key investment priorities as we continue to execute on our 3-, 5- and 10-year road map. We will continue to invest in our ability to recruit top technology talent both in the Bay Area and beyond. In addition, we expect to grow capital expenditures substantially as we continue to fund the ongoing data center expansion effort that we have underway.
Finally, I wanted to share some plans on the use of cash starting in 2017. Beginning in January, we intend to fund withholding taxes due on employee equity awards be a net share settlement rather than our current approach of requiring employees to sell our share common stock to cover taxes upon vesting of such awards. We expect this change will increase our cash flows and correspondingly result in less dilution -- our cash outflows and correspondingly result in less dilution. If we had used this approach in 2016, our cash outflows would have increased by approximately $1.8 billion in the year through September.

There's 60 million small business pages up on Facebook and 1.5 million Instagram business profiles, which are the equivalent for Instagram. And the reason we think people are so active is it's just really expensive and hard to have your own mobile site or your own even webpage. 35% of small businesses in the United States, which is the most developed market, in many cases, don't even have a webpage of any kind. And it's cheaper and easier to build a webpage than it is to build a mobile app and get distribution or downloads. And so what's happening is that people are really using Facebook business pages and increasingly, the Instagram business profile as their mobile presence. And we think that's what's working. And then we're working hard to build products that work in-store visits and then you simplify product that convert them over to advertising."

On that latter point, really the mix of ad units is part of what we're doing, I think, really well. We're developing a number of new ad products as well as enhancing the ad products that we have out in the markets today as we're taking what is a great mobile ad product on Facebook and Instagram and making it even better. And I think the investments that we're doing there will continue to the enable us to drive advertiser demand. So those key factors will continue, we believe, to drive growth next year.

And maybe a related question would be Fox Sports and Sports Illustrator coproducing some original content for Facebook Live. I think they're doing a pre-game show ahead of the big game tonight.

The video-on-demand content is the vast majority of video that is both shared and consumed on Facebook, not Live Video. But Live is growing very quickly. And part of the reason why we're investing in it is we see that video as a medium is not only in the future going to be about people producing content that looks like traditional content and then consuming it in a static rectangle video screen. So Live Video, we think, represents an example of something new, which is video, which is a medium, that's really interacting with other people about whether you're a public figure that is using it to hold a town hall or interact with a lot of people at the same time, or you're hanging out with your friends by going Live, you have 10 people who are just there with you, chatting with you while you're doing something, going about your day. It's not the kind of traditional video experience, it's actually a more social experience. I think 360 videos, in another way, you are another example of this kind of interactive video experience. And my guess will be that we will see more different kinds of video media as time goes on. I think Stories is another example of this, that we're seeing with Instagram Stories and with Messenger and the initial test that we have with Messenger where that is another interesting format where I can put videos together, and that's going to be [indiscernible]. But to put that all in context, the majority of the consumption today is video-on-demand. We are very interested in making sure that the business model that we have works for folks who produce content business to make sure they can make money from it best content comes on Facebook. So we a lot of growth in all of these things and across all of our family of apps."

There are 2 broad sets of improvements that I think we need to make. One are to the capturing sharing tools that we offer. So the example of that is the new camera that we're working on and all the creative tools around that. And then all the other hand, we also need to improve the infrastructure to deliver the best videos to people and do that quickly. So if you think about what is enabling video to become huge right now is that fundamentally, the mobile networks are getting to a point where a large enough people around the world can have a good experience watching a video. If you go back a few years and you try to load a video in News Feed, it might have to buffer for 30 seconds before you watch it, it wasn't a good enough experience for that to be the primary way that people shared. But now you can load instantly, you can take a video and upload it without having to take 5 minutes to do that, so it's a good experience. So we're very focused on creative tools, right? You can see that a little bit in the announcement and launch of Instagram Stories and what we're doing with Messenger and some of the additional tests in Facebook and the camera work we're doing So this is across the whole family of apps. This is a big part of the product experience that we want to deliver. And then on the actual delivery of video side, it's just much more intensive technically, right? So there aren't that many companies that can do this at the scale that we're talking about, and this has been a big advantage for us in rolling things like Live. We've had this infrastructure we've been building out for a decade all around the world, and that allowed us to build a product like Live where stream from their phone to potentially hundreds of thousands of people around the world from a phone. That's a difficult scaling problem. So we've been able to build that off not just because of the ongoing investment in technology and infrastructure here but because we're building on the strong base. That goes not only for being able to deliver the content but being able to understand what it is so we can News Feed better and show people the right content. But all of these things are going to be part of a cohesive experience to get behind our community. And when people are ready and want video to be the primary way that they're sharing and consuming content, we're going to be there ready."

And we expect it got a lot of great opportunities to continue to innovate on that front. But we've also been innovating over the past several years. So demand has been a big factor in what's been driving our growth to date. On top of that, we've grown users and time spent and then we've also grown ad load. So I do think as we look into 2017, we do expect that as you get to mid-2017, ad load will be a less significant factor contributing. We'll continue to get benefits of being able to grow our revenue with advertiser demand and continuing to innovate there.

And that's of the new experience which if you come to Facebook and you specifically want to watch some different kinds of videos or you want to see what videos a recent page that you follow posted or the presidential debate is on, and you want to find a good place to go online to get that, you can go to Video Home and see that. That is the new experience that we're building. And building that is part of Facebook is a great way for people to see it and get exposure to it. And we'll see where that goes over time. I think it's a good experience inside Facebook, but we also have had examples over time like Messenger, for example, where we started them in Facebook and decided that in order to fulfill their potential, it needed to be its own experience over time.

I think the power of what we're able to do really goes to the targeting. And what we're seeing is big brand advertisers, and this is actually a particularly strong growth, for this quarter was particularly strong for brand are really recognizing that they can do big brand on our platform like they would do on TV but make them much more targeted. So for example, Nestlé Purina Pet Care did an ad campaign with Germany in Germany with Media. And they defined 5 distinct cat owner personality types and created different creatives for each group. So that's kind of the big brand thing. The cat food category is big, and they want brand awareness but rather than just run 1 ad, they were able to run 5 based on the kind of interest base and personality targeting that really only we can do. And the results were amazing. They got an 89% increase in brand awareness and a 20% lift in sales. And so we think what we offer is the power of the broad reach of TV but an ability to target much more efficiently."

The strategy is there are 3 phases, right? We build and then build businesses around these apps. The first is build and experience and get it to scale, right?

The second phase is help people not only interact with the people they care about but also the businesses and other public entities that they care about as well. And then the third phase is once there's a good organic interaction between people and those businesses, give those businesses tools that they can pay for to reach more people and amplify those interactions. So I mentioned this stat earlier that we have about 33,000 bots that are live in Messenger, including experiences across a range of verticals from news to e-commerce to local businesses and all kinds of different things, and we're seeing some early progress. I'd say we're still pretty early on and getting this to be widely rolled out. I think we're going to need many more than 33,000 and the number of people using them, I think, is still pretty early, right, in terms of there are more than 1 billion people using Messenger. So we need to get that rolled out pretty widely. So I'm not sure that I have an answer for you just yet on exactly when we're going to move to the third phase. The one thing that I would say in terms of making money through Messenger is we're already driving results for businesses by letting them advertise in News Feed to open up threads in Messenger, which is different from the long-term vision that we have here around creating interactions that start in Messenger. I think that, that will ultimately be most value that's generated. But in the near term, what we found is that a lot of businesses are creating ads in news feeds that then they can off and do transactions with people in Messenger, and that's going to be pretty meaningful over the next few years."

We are using payments in some of our other products in ways that enable some of the interactions we want to see. When we think about Instagram Shopping, it's a very early test, but it really follows the kinds of things we do in other areas of our products and services like Messenger. What we see is that people in Instagram are using Instagram to browse for products and make those connections. And so we then make the product investments to make those a little bit easier. Similarly, to some of those things we've done in Messenger, some of the things we've done in Marketplace, we're watching for what is the organic activity between businesses and consumers, and then we're building products to enhance and enable that organic activity."

Our top verticals this time are e-commerce, CPG, retail and entertainment media. We do see growth in the other verticals as well. You're right that historically, it took us a longer time to break into some of these, particularly travel and auto were things that took us longer. But we are seeing some really nice traction. I talked about Mary Barra and what she and I did together in New York at Ad Week. And we're seeing them not just use a platform for advertising but really use the platform. So earlier this year, they rolled out a car at CES on Facebook Video rather than at a car show and that was a big moment for us, I think, in the auto vertical. And we continue to work with them and lots of other partners. Measurement's really key there. The better we can do with dealers and with auto manufacturers at measuring all the way through to purchase, the better off we are. And I think they know that people are doing research for autos and the purchases they make, which is a very long sales cycle on their mobile phones, and they want us to be part of that. Similarly with travel, this is a vertical that we are really investing in. We have rolled out different types of product ads that we think will help. So in Q2, we rolled out dynamic ads that were specifically focused on the travel vertical. And I'll share one example. Celebrity Cruises used these dynamic ads for travel on both Facebook and Instagram to increase their online bookings. They worked with one of our SMP's feature ads, and they created Custom Audiences who viewed specific itineraries by date. So they looked for people that have a certain data have used specific itineraries and then created dynamic ads, which showed the available cruises and pricing and had a Book Now button. They saw a 3x increase in their online bookings and I think those kind of result are made possible by more vertical specific product and we're going to continue to invest there."

What I wanted to provide was just some color around our thinking about investment going into 2017. Obviously, on the CapEx side, we've got a number of projects underway on the data center front. So clearly, on that front, we've got a lot of projects that are going to need ongoing funding going into 2017. So that, we've got good visibility on. In addition, it's too early to give specifics, I want to give some directional color around expense growth. We've already invested in accelerating our recruiting effort, so I wanted to highlight that. That's primarily around technology, technical recruiting, software engineering. And we have a lot of opportunities that we see to invest in the long-term growth of the business. And so that's our plan going into 2017. On ad blocking, in terms of the impact, I would just point out that this quarter, we had 18% year-over-year desktop revenue growth. If you look at recent quarters, it was about half of that growth rate on a year-over-year basis. So that increment, that acceleration in desktop revenue growth is largely due to our efforts on reducing the impact of ad blocking. So that's what led to the acceleration of desktop revenue growth."

So News Feed is an ongoing work that we're always improving. What we basically are trying to do is work on, over time, adding more and more signals to the News Feed model to help us fully value what people in the community value about the different content that we show them. So what we realized was that the model that we've had previously didn't fully capture the nuance and how people preferred certain content from friends and family, so we ran a bunch of qualitative studies and talked to a bunch of people and incorporated those signals into the model, and that has had the result that people in our community who gave us that feedback and who we worked with on this, what we'd expected. And in terms of both increasing the quality of the content that people see, and therefore, also enabling people to share more with their friends and the people that they want. But one thing that I would clarify is that I think sometimes, people -- in the frame of your question, you asked if we had tweaked News Feed to do this or that. This is an ongoing iterative process. We're constantly learning about what our community wants, and we will constantly be trying to incorporate new information and signals into the model to help value all of the content in the system as accurately as possible. The biggest job that we have is to show people in the community what's going to be meaningful and important to them and that is our goal in all of these changes."

Similarly, aside from the conversational linguistic understanding, there's a whole thread of the work that we're doing on visual understanding, right? So understanding photos, what's in photos, what's in videos, what people are doing. That allows us to not only do things around accessibility to show somebody who's visually-impaired to be able to read to them what might be in a video or a photo, but it also helps us rank News Feed better so that we can help understand what is in the content and show people more of what is going to be meaningful to them. It helps us identify content that might be offensive or graphic that might violate the policies at Facebook so we can flag that and review that better. So these are -- that's the main thread of the AI work that we're doing is trying to understand conversational and linguistic context and computation -- sorry, computer vision, photographic and video signal understand what's going on there. And that will apply across basically every product that we build at the company. And then, of course, there's some deeper AI research that we're doing that feeds into those applications as well that can apply to things like ranking for News Feed and search and ads and all of our systems more broadly."

So yes. On search, there's that. And then, of course, I think that search is often driven by what unique content is in a system and not just the ability to find it. So I think what people are going to search Facebook for are finding people and content that they know is on Facebook and that isn't in other places. And that, I think, is driving most of the volume today and I think can get us to be -- we're already one of the largest search engines in the world, but to be even bigger on that front. You asked about transactions as well. And we spent a lot of time on this call talking about putting video first. That has certainly been the biggest theme over the last quarter and is the biggest part of the product strategy for Facebook and Instagram and as a big part of the broader strategy for Messenger and WhatsApp as well. In terms of transaction, one of the big things that we see happening in messaging long term is that it's a great channel for people to interact with a business one-on-one. And either new transactions in a private space or get support or for businesses to reach out with very personally tailored messages and have an ongoing engagement with the person. So that's something that we're very excited about building. And that is going to be the business that we hope to build on Messenger and WhatsApp over time. So we're looking forward to that. Marketplace, I think it's going to be a great example of this too. What we're seeing in pages and marketers on Facebook is they want to post awareness and drive all the way down to generating transactions and Marketplace, I think, is going to help people do that. We're starting with people being able to sell things to and connect to other people want to buy them just like they've been doing in for sale groups for many years. But I -- we're excited to evolve this and grow it over time as well."

We had another good quarter. Our community continues to grow around the world. We're pleased to see nearly 1.8 billion people now use Facebook every month and nearly 1.2 billion people use it everyday. It's also great to see the continued growth and strength of engagement on our platform, and our ads growth is growing at a healthy rate as well.  Total revenue grew by 56% year-over-year to $7 billion, and advertising revenue was up 59% to $6.8 billion.
I want to start by talking about our work around putting video first across our apps. People are creating and sharing more video, and we think it's pretty clear that video is only going to become more important. So that's why we're prioritizing putting video first across our family of apps and taking steps to make it even easier for people to express themselves in richer ways.
One way we're putting video first is through live video on Facebook. Since May, the number of people going live at any given moment has grown by 4x, and people have gone live from all 7 continents and also from outer space. Another recent example is Instagram Stories, which we launched in August. Instagram Stories is a lightweight way for people to share moments of their day through photos and videos that appear in a slide show format and disappear after 24 hours. Stories now has more than 100 million daily actives. We also improved the Explore tab in Instagram to include more videos and stories, and it has 100 million daily actives now as well.
In addition to making it easy to share video, we also want to make it easier to capture video. In most social apps today, a text box is still the default way we share. Soon, we believe a camera will be the main way that we share.
We're already testing this in our main Facebook app with a version of the [indiscernible] camera directly just one swipe away from News Feed and with creative effects for your photos and videos. And in Messenger, we're testing new camera and video features. We'll be experimenting with even more visual messaging tools over the next few months as well. So those are a few examples of some of the things that we're doing to put video first across our family of apps.
Now I'll give you an update on our progress over our 3-, 5- and 10-year time horizon. Over the next 3 years, we're focusing on making our core services more useful and engaging. The 2016 Summer Olympics were huge on Facebook with more than 270 million people creating 1.5 billion interactions. Facebook helped bring the world together, and athletes, fans and media went live throughout the game, including athletes who went live from the Olympic Village and Michael Phelps, who even announced his retirement on our platform.
This election season has also driven a lot of conversations, including on Facebook, where we've made it easier for voters and candidates to communicate with each other. In the first 9 months of this year, 109 million people on Facebook in the U.S. generated over 5.3 billion posts, comments and likes and shares related to the election. During the primaries in September, we also added a Register to Vote link at the top of our Facebook app that we estimate helped more than 2 million people register to vote, some who were registering for the first time. Facebook really is the new town hall, and we're proud of the role that we played in enabling dialogue and increasing civic engagement. That's the 3-year update.
Over the next 5 years, we're going to keep building ecosystems around products that a lot of people already use everyday. Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp each have large communities, but we have a lot more work to do on all of them. I think about our progress here in 3 phases: The first phase is building a great consumer experience and getting it to scale; The second phase is about enabling people to organically interact with businesses; and then the third phase is to give businesses tools to reach more people. And that's where we build our business.
Right now Instagram has moved into that third phase. Instagram has more than 500 million monthly actives and more than 300 million daily actives. We're making good progress helping businesses and marketers use Instagram in new ways, and Sheryl will talk more about that in a few minutes.
Messenger is early in the second phase. We're helping businesses and consumers increasingly interact in richer ways. Today, there are 33,000 bots live on Messenger. We also launched Messenger Lite, which is designed to make messaging fast and easy with a wide variety of Android phones and for people who are on slower networks as well.
A lot of businesses use WhatsApp already, but we're going to really start working on the second phase in the next year. Right now we're testing new camera features, and we're continuing to keep features fast and reliable on multiple devices in every network condition.
Finally, we're starting to build communities around completely new apps. This quarter, we launched the Workplace to help make organizations more connected and productive. Workplace is a communications platform that uses features that people know like News Feed, groups and messages to help them collaborate and share at work the same way that they do everywhere else. Already, more than 1,000 organizations are using Workplace, including Starbucks, Royal Bank of Scotland and Danone, and we're adding more all the time. We're also getting new services to scale in the core app.
In October, we also launched the Marketplace tab to help people discover, buy and sell things with people in their community. While we just launched Marketplace, many millions of people have been buying and selling things in Facebook for sale groups for a while, and we think this is going to be an important tool going forward.
Over the next 10 years, we're going to continue to invest in the platforms and technologies that will connect more people in more places and allow everyone in the world to have a voice. We focused our long-term innovation road map around 3 areas: connectivity initiatives that bring more people online, artificial intelligence, and virtual and augmented reality.
On connectivity, through our efforts with internet.org, we've connected 40 million people based on our best estimate. And we're making good progress with our Express WiFi program, which empowers entrepreneurs to build a business by providing their community with access to the Internet.
On artificial intelligence, we're starting to see the impact that AI can have on enhancing people's experiences on Facebook and showing them more of what they care about. More than 40 teams at Facebook and more than 25% of our engineers are already using AI to power the products and services they build. We've made changes to our -- and improvements to our AI in order to filter out misleading click-bait stories from News Feed. And we're using AI to help find terrorist propaganda on Facebook. It's still early, but we think that AI will help improve the quality of what people see and can share on our platform.
We also took some important steps forward on virtual reality to help people experience the world in richer and more immersive ways. At Oculus Connect, we announced that touch controllers for Rift will ship in early December with 35 games and experiences exclusively built for Touch. And since we believe the next phase of VR is great software experiences, we're investing another $250 million in virtual reality content on top of the money that we've already invested.
So this was a very busy third quarter, and 2016 is shaping up to be a year of important progress for Facebook. Our business is performing well, and while I'm happy about what we've accomplished, we're really just getting started. We want to continue to invest aggressively to accomplish our goals, which is why we're hiring, especially in engineering, which is going to be one of our top priorities going into 2017. And Dave will say more about this in his remarks.
Everything we do is about opening the world to everyone and helping more people to connect and share. So I want to thank our entire community, all of our teams, our partners and our shareholders for being a part of this journey with us. 
Now here's Sheryl."

We had a great third quarter. Q2 ad revenue grew 59%. Mobile ad revenue reached $5.7 billion, up 70% year-over-year and was approximately 84% of total ad revenues. Our growth was broad based across all regions, marketer seg",950,"Thanks, Mark, and hi, everyone. We had a great third quarter. Q2 ad revenue grew 59%. Mobile ad revenue reached $5.7 billion, up 70% year-over-year and was approximately 84% of total ad revenues. Our growth was broad based across all regions, marketer segments and verticals.
In Q3, we announced that we have over 4 million active advertisers on Facebook and over 500,000 active advertisers on Instagram. The number of advertisers on those platforms continues to grow quickly, and we're pleased to see more and more of them using the full range of our ad products. We continue to focus on our 3 priorities: capitalizing on the shift to mobile, growing the number of marketers using our ad products and making our ads more relevant and effective.
First, capitalizing on the shift to mobile. People have shifted to mobile, and we remain focused on helping businesses catch up. We know that marketing shift takes time. The first TV ad showed people standing in front of microphones reading a radio ad. Similarly, many of the first mobile video ads were TV ads dropped into mobile. Ads optimized for each platform often perform better, so marketers are increasingly tailoring their creative for mobile.
We're excited to see the world's largest advertisers realize that the small screen is big. In September, P&G Chief Brand Officer Marc Pritchard, GM CEO Mary Barra and I addressed the Adweek audience together. Marc described how P&G is creating mobile video ads designed to grab attention in the first few seconds. He shared the example of Tide. In a typical TV ad, they start with a clean dress or shirt, show it getting stained and then cleaned with Tide. On mobile, they need to communicate the product value more quickly, so they start by showing Tide cleaning a stained garment.
Mary shared GM's success with Facebook mobile video ads. In Q3, GM's subsidiary, Holden, used carousel ad plus video to maximize its sponsorship of Australia's premier rugby tournament. Holden created a video series about their support of youth rugby. The ads generated an 8 point lift in brand favorability for the overall audience and a 15 point lift amongst their target audience of women over 35.
For many small businesses, the shift to mobile means leveraging video for the very first time. Rather than needing a camera crew and production budget, anyone with a smartphone can shoot a video and share it on Facebook. In the past month alone, over 3 million small businesses have posted a video on Facebook in creating organic posts and ads.
Our second priority is growing the number of marketers using our ad products. We continue to focus on our advertiser pipeline. In Q2, we announced that over 60 million businesses use our free Facebook pages product each month, and we introduced the Instagram equivalent, business profiles, which are being used by 1.5 million businesses.
On past calls, I've talked about product simplification as a driver of advertiser growth on Facebook. Now with the launch of promoted posts, we are seeing that on Instagram, too. Like boosted posts on Facebook, promoted posts on Instagram are an easy way to start advertising, and we're pleased with adoption.
Over 85% of business pages are active on mobile, so we're making it easier for advertisers to manage campaigns from their phones. In Q3, we added a feature that shows marketers a preview of a potential ad in News Feed just as their customers would see it. They can then run the ad with just a few taps from their mobile device. Making it easy to advertise from a mobile phone is especially important in emerging markets. For businesses operating in areas with weak network connections, we continue to build advertising tools into Facebook Lite, our low-bandwidth app and are making more of them available offline.
Our third priority is making our ads more relevant and effective. Our goal is to be the #1 driver of growth for our clients. In Q3, we introduced tools to help businesses find people around the world who look like their current customers and target the ones most likely to convert.  For example, SA Company, an outdoor gear and apparel business started by a young man out of his parents' home, used international lookalike targeting to reach customers in 32 countries and increase sales by 37%.
We're focused on driving purchases online and in stores. In Q2, we launched estimated store visits, which show advertisers how many people came to their store after seeing an ad. And this quarter, we made it possible for advertisers to optimize campaigns for in-store visits.
We also expanded Dynamic Ads, a proven way to drive online sales for in-store retail objectives. Businesses can use Dynamic Ads for retail to show people the products available at their closest location in real-time and reach people likely to visit their store.
To prove the value we're driving for our partners, we continue to invest in measurement. This quarter, we announced new third-party partnerships with Nielsen, Datalogix, Visual IQ and MarketShare to help our clients measure how Facebook ads drive business results.
We're pleased with the value we're driving for our partners, and we remain focused on helping them make the shift to mobile. With only a small fraction of businesses on Facebook and Instagram advertising, we have a lot of opportunity in front of us. We also have a lot of hard work to do to help our partners around the world use mobile to drive their businesses.
I want to thank our clients around the world for their partnership and congratulate our global teams on the results of their continued focus and dedication.
Thanks. And now here's Dave."

Total revenue grew 56% and exceeded $7 billion for the first time. And we delivered $2.4 billion in GAAP net income, up 166%.
We saw healthy growth and engagement in our community as well as broad-based strength in our mobile apps business. Let's start with our community metrics. In September, 1.18 billion people used Facebook on an average day, up 172 million or 17% compared to last year. This daily number represents 66% of the 1.79 billion people that used Facebook in the month of September. Mobile continues to drive our growth, with 1.09 billion people accessing Facebook on mobile on an average day in September, up approximately 197 million or 22% compared to last year.
Turning now to the financials. My comments today will focus on our GAAP financial metrics, and all of our comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial metrics is included in our press release and earnings slides.
Q3 total revenue was approximately $7 billion, up 56%. Q3 ad revenue was $6.8 billion, up 59%. Exchange rates did not impact our overall growth this quarter as headwinds in certain currencies were offset by tailwinds in others.
Asia Pacific and North America were our fastest growing regions with ad revenue growth rates of 64% and 62%, respectively. Ad revenue grew at a rate of 50% or more in all regions in Q3. Mobile ad revenue was $5.7 billion, up 70% and representing approximately 84% of total ad revenue.
On prior calls, we have discussed the supply and demand factors that drive our mobile ads business. As Sheryl noted earlier, advertiser demand remained strong in Q3 across all geographies, verticals and marketer segments. We also benefited from growth in users, time spent and ad loads.
It is worth noting that desktop ad revenue grew 18%, which is higher than growth rates in recent quarters and was aided by our efforts to limit the impact of ad blockers on advertising served via web browsers. Our price volume trends were similar to those we reported last quarter. The average price per ad increased 6% in Q3, while total ad impressions increased 50%. The reported price -- reported increase in price continues to be driven by the ongoing mix shift towards mobile, where we show only higher-priced feed ads. Impression growth was primarily driven by mobile feed ads on Facebook and Instagram.
Payments and other fees revenue was $195 million, down 3%. Payments and other fees revenue is largely generated from games played on personal computers, which has declined as people spend less time on their PCs.
Q3 total expenses were $3.9 billion, up 28%. This includes $839 million of share-based compensation expenses and related payroll taxes as well as $195 million of amortization of intangible assets.
In Q3, we hired over 1,200 people and ended the quarter with approximately 15,700 employees, up 31% compared to last year. We remain committed to investing aggressively in hiring, including expanding our technical and recruiting teams globally.
Q3 operating income was $3.1 billion, representing a 45% margin. Our tax rate was 25%. GAAP net income was $2.4 billion or $0.82 per share. Q3 capital expenditures were $1.1 billion. Year-to-date through September, capital expenditures were $3.2 billion, up 76%, driven by investments in data centers, servers, office buildings and network infrastructure.
In addition to our new data center projects in Texas and Ireland, we recently broke ground on our seventh data center facility in New Mexico, which we anticipate will come online in late 2018. We generated approximately $2.5 billion of free cash flow and ended the quarter with $26.1 billion in cash and investments.
Turning now to the outlook for the remainder of 2016. First, some color on revenue. We continue to expect that revenue growth rates will decline in Q4 as we lap a strong fourth quarter in 2015. We also continue to expect that our total payments and other fees revenue in Q4 will be lower than it was in the fourth quarter of last year.
Turning now to the 2016 expense outlook. Based on our year-to-date results and our updated view of the remainder of the year, we are adjusting our expense guidance ranges. We now expect that full year 2016 GAAP expense growth will be at the lower end of our prior range of 30% to 35%. We expect full year 2016 amortization expenses to be approximately $700 million to $800 million and the full year 2016 share-based compensation expenses to be approximately $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion.
Accordingly, we anticipate that our total non-GAAP expenses, which exclude those share-based compensation and amortization expenses, will grow in the range of 40% to 45%, down from our prior range of 45% to 50%. We anticipate full year capital expenditures to be approximately $4.5 billion as we invest aggressively to support the rapid growth of the business. We expect that our Q4 and full year 2016 tax rates will be in line with the year-to-date tax rates.
I also wanted to provide some brief comments on 2017. First on revenue. As I mentioned, last quarter, we continued to expect that ad load will play a less significant factor driving revenue growth after mid-2017. Over the past 2 years, we have averaged about 50% revenue growth in advertising. Ad load has been 1 of the 3 primary factors fueling that growth. With a much smaller contribution from this important factor going forward, we expect to see ad revenue growth rates come down meaningfully.
Secondly on expenses. Though it is premature to provide specific expense guidance, as Mark mentioned, we anticipate 2017 will be an aggressive investment year. Adding top engineering talent remains 1 of our key investment priorities as we continue to execute on our 3-, 5- and 10-year road map. We will continue to invest in our ability to recruit top technology talent both in the Bay Area and beyond. In addition, we expect to grow capital expenditures substantially as we continue to fund the ongoing data center expansion efforts that we have underway.
Finally, I wanted to share some plans on the use of cash starting in 2017. Beginning in January, we intend to fund withholding taxes due on employee equity awards via net share settlement rather than our current approach of requiring employees to sell our shares of common stock to cover taxes upon vesting of such awards. We expect this change will increase our cash flows and correspondingly result in less dilution -- our cash outflows and correspondingly result in less dilution. If we had used this approach in 2016, our cash outflows would have increased by approximately $1.8 billion in the year through September.
To wrap things up, Q3 was another strong quarter for Facebook. Our results reflected the continued growth and engagement of our community around the world and the strength of our mobile apps business.
With that, operator, let's open up the call for questions."

There's 60 million small business pages up on Facebook and 1.5 million Instagram business profiles, which are the similar -- the equivalent for Instagram. And the reason we think people are so active is it's just really expensive and hard to have your own mobile site or your own even web page. 35% of small businesses in the United States, which is the most developed market, in many cases, don't even have a web page of any kind. And it's cheaper and easier to build a web page than it is to build a mobile app and get distribution or downloads. And so what's happening is that people are really using the Facebook business pages and increasingly, the Instagram business profiles as their mobile presence. And we think that's what's working. And then we're working hard to build products that work in store visits and then you simplify the ad products that convert them over to advertising."

On that latter point, really, the mix of ad units is part of what we're doing, I think, really well. We're developing a number of new ad products as well as enhancing the ad products that we have out in the market today, so we're taking what is a great mobile ad product on Facebook and Instagram and making it even better. And I think the investments that we're doing there will continue to enable us to drive advertiser demand. So those key factors will continue, we believe, to drive growth next year.

So how do you weigh investing in Live versus, let's call it, on-demand content? And maybe a related question would be Fox Sports and Sports Illustrator (sic) [ Sports Illustrated ] coproducing some original content for Facebook Live. I think they're doing a pregame show ahead of the big game tonight. So that seems like, in some ways, it's an entrée into sports perhaps for Facebook. Could you give us an update on whether or not you see any advantage or any benefit in licensing sports content over time versus having one of the publishers do it on the Facebook platform?"

The video-on-demand content is the vast majority of video that is both shared and consumed on Facebook, not live video. But Live is growing very quickly. And part of the reason why we're investing in it is we see that video as a medium is not only in the future going to be about people producing content that looks like traditional content and then consuming it in a static, rectangle video screen. So live video, we think, represents an example of something new, which is video which is a medium for doing something that's really interacting with other people, right, whether you're a public figure that is using it to hold a town hall or interact with a lot of people at the same time or you're hanging out with your friends by going live, and you have 10 people who are just there with you, chatting with you while you're doing something, going about throughout your day. It's not the kind of traditional video experience. It's actually a more social experience. I think 360 videos, in another way, are another example of this kind of interactive video experience. And my guess will be that we will see more different kinds of video media as time goes on. I think Stories is another example of this, that we're seeing with Instagram Stories and with Messenger and the initial test that we have with Messenger Day, where that is another interesting format, probably you can put videos together. I think that's going to be more and more. So -- but to put that all in context, I mean, the majority of the consumption today is video on demand. We are very interested in making sure that the business model that we have works for folks who produce content in their business to make sure that they can make money from it to -- that their best content comes on Facebook. So it's going to be a lot of growth in all of these things across all of our family of apps."

There are 2 broad sets of improvements that I think we need to make. One are to the capture and sharing tools that we offer. So the example of that is the new camera that we're working on and then all the creative tools around that. And then on the other hand, we also need to improve the infrastructure to deliver the best videos to people and do that quickly. So if you think about what is enabling video to become huge right now is that, fundamentally, the mobile networks are getting to a point where a large enough people around the world can have a good experience watching a video. If you go back a few years and you try to load a video in News Feed, it might have to buffer for 30 seconds before you watch it, which wasn't a good enough experience for that to be the primary way that people shared. But now you can -- it loads instantly. You can take a video and upload it without having to take 5 minutes to do that. So it's a good experience. So we're very focused on creative tools, right? You can see that a little bit in the announcement and launch of Instagram Stories and what we're doing with Messenger and some of the initial tests in Facebook and the camera work that we're doing in WhatsApp. So this is across the whole family of apps. This is a big part of the product experience that we want to deliver. And then on the actual delivery of video side, it's just much more intensive technically, right? So there aren't that many companies that can do this at the scale that we're talking about, and this has been a big advantage for us in rolling out things like Live. We've had this infrastructure that we've been building out for a decade all around the world, and that allowed us to build a product like Live where someone has to stream something live from their phone to potentially hundreds of thousands of people around the world from a phone. That's a difficult scaling problem. So we've been able to build that up not just because of the ongoing investment in technology and infrastructure here but because we're building on the strong base. That goes not only for just being able to deliver the content but being able to understand what it is, so we can rank it at News Feed better and show people the right content. But all of these things are going to be part of a cohesive experience to get behind our community. And when people are ready and want video to be the primary way that they're sharing and consuming content, we're going to be there ready."

We'll continue to get benefits of being able to grow our revenue with advertiser demand and continuing to innovate there. But I do think that as we slow ad load growth, we're going have a slowing in revenue as well.

Like I do see much more prevalence of live video, and it doesn't seem to me yet a perfect experience. But just in terms of other features and putting the camera at centerpiece, do you think this is something that's going to be obvious to people in the next year, couple of months? Just what's the timing of the innovations? And then real quickly, MAU growth seemed to accelerate in both Asia and rest of world. Any color on what would have caused that or any particular markets?"

One is that video is naturally becoming a larger share of the content in News Feed because both people and pages are sharing more videos as  a mix, and people want to consume that content. So that -- there's not really a question of whether that should be a separate app. This is what people want News Feed to be increasingly, so this is what it will become. There is a second experience called the video home, which we started talking about earlier in the year, and we've rolled out again in a few markets. And those tests have gone well, so we're also hoping to roll that out pretty soon widely. And that's the new experience, which, if you come to Facebook and you specifically want to watch some different kinds of videos or you want to see what videos a recent page that you follow has posted, or the presidential debate is on, and you want to find a good place to go online to get that, you can go to video home and see that. That is the new experience that we're building. And building that as part of Facebook is a great way for people to see it and get exposure to it. And we'll see where that goes over time. I think it's a good experience inside Facebook, but we also have had examples over time like Messenger, for example, where we started them in Facebook and decided that in order to fulfill their potential, it needed to be its own experience over time. So we'll look at all those options. But for now I really think that video home is going to be a great experience, and I'm excited to roll that out."

It's definitely true that most of our advertisers are advertising on TV and advertising with us on mobile, and they should be. And we've done studies that show with Nielsen that our ads can be a really big complement to TV, particularly enabling you to reach people who really aren't on TV and you can't reach. I think the power of what we're able to do really goes to the targeting, and what we're seeing is big brand advertisers, and this is actually a particularly strong growth for -- this quarter was particularly strong for brand, are really recognizing that they can do big brand buys on our platform like they would do on TV but make them much more targeted. So for example, Nestlé Purina PetCare did an ad campaign with Germany -- in Germany with ZenithOptimedia. And they defined 5 distinct cat owner personality types and created different creatives for each group. So that's kind of a big brand thing. There's the cat food category is big, and they want brand awareness. But rather than just run 1 ad, they were able to run 5 based on the kind of interest base and personality targeting that really only we can do. And the results were amazing. They got an 89% increase in brand awareness and a 20% lift in sales. And so we think what we offer is the power of the broad reach of TV but an ability to target much more efficiently."

Just to recap the framework that we have here, the strategy is there are 3 phases, right? We build and then build businesses around these apps. The first is build an experience and get it to scale, right, to build a community that can get to hundreds of millions or 1 billion people or more. The second phase is help people not only interact with the people they care about but also the businesses and other public entities that they care about as well. And then the third phase is, once there's good organic interaction between people and those businesses, give those businesses tools that they can pay for to reach more people and amplify those interactions. So I mentioned this stat earlier, that we have about 33,000 bots are live in Messenger, including experiences across a range of verticals from news to e-commerce to local businesses and all kinds of different things. And we're seeing some early progress. I'd say, we're still pretty early on in getting this to be widely rolled out. I think we're going to need many more than 33,000, and the number of people using them, I think, is still pretty early, right, in terms of there are more than 1 billion people using Messenger. So we need to get that rolled out pretty widely. So I'm not sure that I have an answer for you just yet on exactly when we're going to move to the third phase. The one thing that I would say in terms of making money through Messenger is we're already driving results for businesses by letting them advertise in News Feed to open up threads in Messenger, which is different from the long-term vision that we have here around creating interactions that start in Messenger. I think that, that will ultimately be most of the value that's generated. But in the near term, what we found is that a lot of businesses are creating ads in news feeds that then they can follow off and do transactions with people in Messenger. And I think that's going to be pretty meaningful over the next few years."

You're right that, historically, it took us a longer time to break into some of these, particularly travel and auto where things that took us -- that took us longer. But we are seeing some really nice traction. I talked about Mary Barra and what she and I did together in New York at Adweek. And we're seeing them not just use the platform for advertising but really use the platform. So earlier this year, they rolled out a car at CES on Facebook video rather than at a car show, and that was a big moment for us, I think, in the auto vertical. And we continue to work with them and lots of other partners. Measurement's really key there. The better we can do with dealers and with auto manufacturers at measuring all the way through to purchase, the better off we are. And I think they know that people are doing research for autos and the purchases they make, which is a very long sales cycle on their mobile phones, and they want us to be part of that. Similarly with travel, this is a vertical that we are really investing in. We have rolled out different types of product ads that we think will help. So in Q2, we rolled out Dynamic Ads that were specifically focused on the travel vertical. And I'll share one example. Celebrity Cruises use these Dynamic Ads for travel on both Facebook and Instagram to increase their online bookings. They worked with one of our SMPs, StitcherAds, and they created Custom Audiences viewed -- who viewed specific itineraries by date. So they looked for people that at a certain date have used specific itineraries and then created Dynamic Ads, which showed the available cruises and pricing and had a Book Now button. They saw a 3x increase in their online bookings. And I think those kind of results are made possible by more vertical-specific products, and we're going to continue to invest there."

And we have a lot of opportunities that we see to invest in the long-term growth of the business, and so that's our plan going into 2017. On ad blocking, in terms of the impact, I would just point out that, this quarter, we had 18% year-over-year desktop revenue growth. If you look at recent quarters, it was about half of that growth rate on a year-over-year basis, so that increment, that acceleration in desktop revenue growth is largely due to our efforts on reducing the impact of ad blocking.

Similarly, aside from the conversational linguistic understanding, we -- there's a whole thread of the work that we're doing on visual understanding, right, so understanding photos, what's in photos, what's in videos, what people are doing. That allows us to not only do things around accessibility to show somebody who's visually impaired, to be able to read to them what might be in a video or a photo, but it also helps us rank News Feed better, so that way, we can help understand what is in the content and show people more of what is going to be meaningful to them.

I don't know what the most recent public status is on that, so I'm not going to say it's that. But it's grown a lot, so we're happy with that. And we think that, that reflects that people are getting value from the search experience, which a lot of the growth comes from people searching for posts and content in the system, not just looking up people and pages in the system. So yes -- on search, that's -- there's that. And then, of course, I think that search is often driven by what unique content is in a system and not just the ability to find it. So I think what people are going to search Facebook for are finding people and content that they know is on Facebook and that isn't in other places. Then that, I think, is driving most of the volume today and I think can get us to be -- we're already one of the largest search engines in the world but to be even bigger on that front. You asked about transactions as well. And we spent a lot of time on this call talking about putting video first. That has certainly been the biggest theme of the last quarter and is the biggest part of the product strategy for Facebook and Instagram and is a big part of the product strategy for Messenger and WhatsApp as well. In terms of transaction, one of the big things that we see happening in messaging long term is that it's a great channel for people to interact with a business one on one and either do transactions in a private space or get support or for businesses to reach out with very personally tailored messages and have an ongoing engagement with a person. So that's something that we're very excited about building, and that is going to be the business that we hope to build on Messenger and WhatsApp over time. So we're looking forward to that. Marketplace, I think, is going to be a great example of this, too. What we're seeing in pages and marketers on Facebook is they want to both get awareness and drive all the way down to generating transactions, and Marketplace, I think, is going to help people do that. We're starting with people being able to sell things to and connect to other people who want to buy them just like they've been doing in for sale groups for many years. But I -- we're excited to evolve this and grow it over time as well."

We had another good quarter. Our community continues to grow around the world. We're pleased to see nearly 1.8 billion people now use Facebook every month and nearly 1.2 billion people use it every day. It's also great to see the continued growth and strength of engagement on our platform, and our ads growth is growing at a healthy rate as well.  Total revenue grew by 56% year-over-year to $7 billion, and advertising revenue was up 59% to $6.8 billion.
I want to start by talking about our work around putting video first across our apps. People are creating and sharing more video, and we think it's pretty clear that video is only going to become more important. So that's why we're prioritizing putting video first across our family of apps and taking steps to make it even easier for people to express themselves in richer ways.
One way we're putting video first is through live video on Facebook. Since May, the number of people going live at any given moment has grown by 4x, and people have gone live from all 7 continents and also from outer space. Another recent example is Instagram Stories, which we launched in August. Instagram Stories is a lightweight way for people to share moments of their day through photos and videos that appear in a slide show format and disappear after 24 hours. Stories now has more than 100 million daily actives. We also improved the Explore tab in Instagram to include more videos and stories, and it has 100 million daily actives now as well.
In addition to making it easy to share video, we also want to make it easier to capture video. In most social apps today, a text box is still the default way we share. Soon, we believe a camera will be the main way that we share.
We're already testing this in our main Facebook app with a version of the -- that has a camera directly, just one swipe away from News Feed and with creative effects for your photos and videos. And in Messenger, we're testing new camera and video features. We'll be experimenting with even more visual messaging tools over the next few months as well. So those are a few examples of some of the things that we're doing to put video first across our family of apps.
Now I'll give you an update on our progress over our 3-, 5- and 10-year time horizon. Over the next 3 years, we're focusing on making our core services more useful and engaging. The 2016 Summer Olympics were huge on Facebook, with more than 270 million people creating 1.5 billion interactions. Facebook helped bring the world together, and athletes, fans and media went live throughout the games, including athletes who went live from the Olympic Village and Michael Phelps, who even announced his retirement on our platform.
This election season has also driven a lot of conversations, including on Facebook, where we've made it easier for voters and candidates to communicate with each other. In the first 9 months of this year, 109 million people on Facebook in the U.S. generated over 5.3 billion posts, comments and likes and shares related to the election. During the primaries in September, we also added a Register to Vote link at the top of our Facebook app that we estimate helped more than 2 million people register to vote, some who were registering for the first time. Facebook really is the new town hall, and we're proud of the role that we played in enabling dialogue and increasing civic engagement. That's the 3-year update.
Over the next 5 years, we're going to keep building ecosystems around products that a lot of people already use every day. Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp each have large communities, but we have a lot more work to do on all of them. I think about our progress here in 3 phases: The first phase is building a great consumer experience and getting it to scale; the second phase is about enabling people to organically interact with businesses; and then the third phase is to give businesses tools to reach more people. And that's where we build our business.
Right now Instagram has moved into that third phase. Instagram has more than 500 million monthly actives and more than 300 million daily actives. We're making good progress helping businesses and marketers use Instagram in new ways, and Sheryl will talk more about that in a few minutes.
Messenger is early in the second phase. We're helping businesses and consumers increasingly interact in richer ways. Today, there are 33,000 bots live on Messenger. We also launched Messenger Lite, which is designed to make messaging fast and easy with a wide variety of Android phones and for people who are on slower networks as well.
A lot of businesses use WhatsApp already, but we're going to really start working on the second phase in the next year. Right now we're testing new camera features, and we're continuing to keep features fast and reliable on multiple devices in every network condition.
Finally, we're starting to build communities around completely new apps. This quarter, we launched the Workplace to help make organizations more connected and productive. Workplace is a communications platform that uses features that people know like News Feed, groups and messages to help them collaborate and share at work the same way that they do everywhere else. Already, more than 1,000 organizations are using Workplace, including Starbucks, Royal Bank of Scotland and Danone, and we're adding more all the time. We're also getting new services to scale in the core app.
In October, we also launched the Marketplace tab to help people discover, buy and sell things with people in their community. While we just launched Marketplace, many millions of people have been buying and selling things in Facebook for sale groups for a while, and we think this is going to be an important tool going forward.
Over the next 10 years, we're going to continue to invest in the platforms and technologies that will connect more people in more places and allow everyone in the world to have a voice. We focused our long-term innovation road map around 3 areas: connectivity initiatives that bring more people online, artificial intelligence, and virtual and augmented reality.
On connectivity, through our efforts with internet.org, we've connected 40 million people based on our best estimate. And we're making good progress with our Express WiFi program, which empowers entrepreneurs to build a business by providing their community with access to the Internet.
On artificial intelligence, we're starting to see the impact that AI can have on enhancing people's experiences on Facebook and showing them more of what they care about. More than 40 teams at Facebook and more than 25% of our engineers are already using AI to power the products and services they build. We've made changes to our -- and improvements to our AI in order to filter out misleading click-bait stories from News Feed. And we're using AI to help find terrorist propaganda on Facebook. It's still early, but we think that AI will help improve the quality of what people see and can share on our platform.
We also took some important steps forward on virtual reality to help people experience the world in richer and more immersive ways. At Oculus Connect, we announced that touch controllers for Rift will ship in early December, with 35 games and experiences exclusively built for Touch. And since we believe the next phase of VR is great software experiences, we're investing another $250 million in virtual reality content on top of the money that we've already invested.
So this was a very busy third quarter, and 2016 is shaping up to be a year of important progress for Facebook. Our business is performing well, and while I'm happy about what we've accomplished, we're really just getting started. We want to continue to invest aggressively to accomplish our goals, which is why we're hiring, especially in engineering, which is going to be one of our top priorities going into 2017. And Dave will say more about this in his remarks.
Everything we do is about opening the world to everyone and helping more people to connect and share. So I want to thank our entire community, all of our teams, our partners and our shareholders for being a part of this journey with us. 
Now here's Sheryl."

We had a great third quarter. Q2 ad revenue grew 59%. Mobile ad revenue reached $5.7 billion, up 70% year-over-year and was approximately 84% of total ad revenues. Our growth was broad based across all regions, marketer seg",950,"Thanks, Mark, and hi, everyone. We had a great third quarter. Q2 ad revenue grew 59%. Mobile ad revenue reached $5.7 billion, up 70% year-over-year and was approximately 84% of total ad revenues. Our growth was broad based across all regions, marketer segments and verticals.
In Q3, we announced that we have over 4 million active advertisers on Facebook and over 500,000 active advertisers on Instagram. The number of advertisers on both platforms continues to grow quickly, and we're pleased to see more and more of them using the full range of our ad products. We continue to focus on our 3 priorities: capitalizing on the shift to mobile, growing the number of marketers using our ad products and making our ads more relevant and effective.
First, capitalizing on the shift to mobile. People have shifted to mobile, and we remain focused on helping businesses catch up. We know that marketing shift takes time. The first TV ads showed people standing in front of microphones reading a radio ad. Similarly, many of the first mobile video ads were TV ads dropped into mobile. Ads optimized for each platform often perform better, so marketers are increasingly tailoring their creative for mobile.
We're excited to see the world's largest advertisers realize that the small screen is big. In September, P&G Chief Brand Officer Marc Pritchard, GM CEO Mary Barra and I addressed the Adweek audience together. Marc described how P&G is creating mobile video ads designed to grab attention in the first few seconds. He shared the example of Tide. In a typical TV ad, they start with a clean dress or shirt, show it getting stained and then cleaned with Tide. On mobile, they need to communicate the product value more quickly, so they start by showing Tide cleaning a stained garment.
Mary shared GM's success with Facebook mobile video ads. In Q3, GM's subsidiary, Holden, used carousel ad plus video to maximize its sponsorship of Australia's premier rugby tournament. Holden created a video series about their support of youth rugby. The ads generated an 8 point lift in brand favorability for the overall audience and a 15 point lift amongst their target audience of women over 35.
For many small businesses, the shift to mobile means leveraging video for the very first time. Rather than needing a camera crew and production budget, anyone with a smartphone can shoot a video and share it on Facebook. In the past month alone, over 3 million small businesses have posted a video on Facebook in creating organic posts and ads.
Our second priority is growing the number of marketers using our ad products. We continue to focus on our advertiser pipeline. In Q2, we announced that over 60 million businesses use our free Facebook pages product each month, and we introduced the Instagram equivalent, business profiles, which are being used by 1.5 million businesses.
On past calls, I've talked about product simplification as a driver of advertiser growth on Facebook. Now with the launch of promoted posts, we are seeing that on Instagram, too. Like boosted posts on Facebook, promoted posts on Instagram are an easy way to start advertising, and we're pleased with adoption.
Over 85% of business pages are active on mobile, so we're making it easier for advertisers to manage campaigns from their phones. In Q3, we added a feature that shows marketers a preview of a potential ad in News Feed just as their customers would see it. They can then run the ad with just a few taps from their mobile device. Making it easy to advertise from a mobile phone is especially important in emerging markets. For businesses operating in areas with weak network connections, we continue to build advertising tools into Facebook Lite, our low-bandwidth app and are making more of them available offline.
Our third priority is making our ads more relevant and effective. Our goal is to be the #1 driver of growth for our clients. In Q3, we introduced tools to help businesses find people around the world who look like their current customers and target the ones most likely to convert.  For example, SA Company, an outdoor gear and apparel business started by a young man out of his parents' home, used international lookalike targeting to reach customers in 32 countries and increase sales by 37%.
We're focused on driving purchases online and in stores. In Q2, we launched estimated store visits, which show advertisers how many people came to their store after seeing an ad. And this quarter, we made it possible for advertisers to optimize campaigns for in-store visits.
We also expanded Dynamic Ads, a proven way to drive online sales for in-store retail objectives. Businesses can use Dynamic Ads for retail to show people the products available at their closest location in real-time and reach people likely to visit their store.
To prove the value we're driving for our partners, we continue to invest in measurement. This quarter, we announced new third-party partnerships with Nielsen, Datalogix, Visual IQ and MarketShare to help our clients measure how Facebook ads drive business results.
We're pleased with the value we're driving for our partners, and we remain focused on helping them make the shift to mobile. With only a small fraction of businesses on Facebook and Instagram advertising, we have a lot of opportunity in front of us. We also have a lot of hard work to do to help our partners around the world use mobile to drive their businesses.
I want to thank our clients around the world for their partnership and congratulate our global teams on the results of their continued focus and dedication.
Thanks. And now here's Dave."

Total revenue grew 56% and exceeded $7 billion for the first time. And we delivered $2.4 billion in GAAP net income, up 166%.
We saw healthy growth and engagement in our community as well as broad-based strength in our mobile ads business. Let's start with our community metrics. In September, 1.18 billion people used Facebook on an average day, up 172 million or 17% compared to last year. This daily number represents 66% of the 1.79 billion people that used Facebook in the month of September. Mobile continues to drive our growth, with 1.09 billion people accessing Facebook on mobile on an average day in September, up approximately 197 million or 22% compared to last year.
Turning now to the financials. My comments today will focus on our GAAP financial metrics, and all of our comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial metrics is included in our press release and earnings slides.
Q3 total revenue was approximately $7 billion, up 56%. Q3 ad revenue was $6.8 billion, up 59%. Exchange rates did not impact our overall growth this quarter as headwinds in certain currencies were offset by tailwinds in others.
Asia Pacific and North America were our fastest growing regions with ad revenue growth rates of 64% and 62%, respectively. Ad revenue grew at a rate of 50% or more in all regions in Q3. Mobile ad revenue was $5.7 billion, up 70% and representing approximately 84% of total ad revenue.
On prior calls, we have discussed the supply and demand factors that drive our mobile ads business. As Sheryl noted earlier, advertiser demand remained strong in Q3 across all geographies, verticals and marketer segments. We also benefited from growth in users, time spent and ad loads.
It is worth noting that desktop ad revenue grew 18%, which is higher than growth rates in recent quarters and was aided by our efforts to limit the impact of ad blockers on advertising served via web browsers. Our price volume trends were similar to those we reported last quarter. The average price per ad increased 6% in Q3, while total ad impressions increased 50%. The reported price -- reported increase in price continues to be driven by the ongoing mix shift towards mobile, where we show only higher-priced feed ads. Impression growth was primarily driven by mobile feed ads on Facebook and Instagram.
Payments and other fees revenue was $195 million, down 3%. Payments and other fees revenue is largely generated from games played on personal computers, which has declined as people spend less time on their PCs.
Q3 total expenses were $3.9 billion, up 28%. This includes $839 million of share-based compensation expenses and related payroll taxes as well as $195 million of amortization of intangible assets.
In Q3, we hired over 1,200 people and ended the quarter with approximately 15,700 employees, up 31% compared to last year. We remain committed to investing aggressively in hiring, including expanding our technical and recruiting teams globally.
Q3 operating income was $3.1 billion, representing a 45% margin. Our tax rate was 25%. GAAP net income was $2.4 billion or $0.82 per share. Q3 capital expenditures were $1.1 billion. Year-to-date through September, capital expenditures were $3.2 billion, up 76%, driven by investments in data centers, servers, office buildings and network infrastructure.
In addition to our new data center projects in Texas and Ireland, we recently broke ground on our seventh data center facility in New Mexico, which we anticipate will come online in late 2018. We generated approximately $2.5 billion of free cash flow and ended the quarter with $26.1 billion in cash and investments.
Turning now to the outlook for the remainder of 2016. First, some color on revenue. We continue to expect that revenue growth rates will decline in Q4 as we lap a strong fourth quarter in 2015. We also continue to expect that our total payments and other fees revenue in Q4 will be lower than it was in the fourth quarter of last year.
Turning now to the 2016 expense outlook. Based on our year-to-date results and our updated view of the remainder of the year, we are adjusting our expense guidance ranges. We now expect that full year 2016 GAAP expense growth will be at the lower end of our prior range of 30% to 35%. We expect full year 2016 amortization expenses to be approximately $700 million to $800 million and the full year 2016 share-based compensation expenses to be approximately $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion.
Accordingly, we anticipate that our total non-GAAP expenses, which exclude those share-based compensation and amortization expenses, will grow in the range of 40% to 45%, down from our prior range of 45% to 50%. We anticipate full year capital expenditures to be approximately $4.5 billion as we invest aggressively to support the rapid growth of the business. We expect that our Q4 and full year 2016 tax rates will be in line with the year-to-date tax rates.
I also wanted to provide some brief comments on 2017. First on revenue. As I mentioned, last quarter, we continued to expect that ad load will play a less significant factor driving revenue growth after mid-2017. Over the past 2 years, we have averaged about 50% revenue growth in advertising. Ad load has been 1 of the 3 primary factors fueling that growth. With a much smaller contribution from this important factor going forward, we expect to see ad revenue growth rates come down meaningfully.
Secondly on expenses. Though it is premature to provide specific expense guidance, as Mark mentioned, we anticipate 2017 will be an aggressive investment year. Adding top engineering talent remains 1 of our key investment priorities as we continue to execute on our 3-, 5- and 10-year road maps. We will continue to invest in our ability to recruit top technology talent both in the Bay Area and beyond. In addition, we expect to grow capital expenditures substantially as we continue to fund the ongoing data center expansion efforts that we have underway.
Finally, I wanted to share some plans on the use of cash starting in 2017. Beginning in January, we intend to fund withholding taxes due on employee equity awards via net share settlement rather than our current approach of requiring employees to sell our shares of common stock to cover taxes upon vesting of such awards. We expect this change will increase our cash flows and correspondingly result in less dilution -- our cash outflows and correspondingly result in less dilution. If we had used this approach in 2016, our cash outflows would have increased by approximately $1.8 billion in the year through September.
To wrap things up, Q3 was another strong quarter for Facebook. Our results reflected the continued growth and engagement of our community around the world and the strength of our mobile ads business.

There's 60 million small business pages up on Facebook and 1.5 million Instagram business profiles, which are the similar -- the equivalent for Instagram. And the reason we think people are so active is it's just really expensive and hard to have your own mobile site or your own even web page. 35% of small businesses in the United States, which is the most developed market, in many cases, don't even have a web page of any kind. And it's cheaper and easier to build a web page than it is to build a mobile app and get distribution or downloads. And so what's happening is that people are really using the Facebook business pages and increasingly, the Instagram business profiles as their mobile presence. And we think that's what's working. And then we're working hard to build products that work in store visits and then you simplify the ad products that convert them over to advertising."

Just really reiterating what I said last quarter about our expectations on ad load going into mid-2017. It's been one of the key factors in terms of driving growth along with time spent and -- user growth and time spent growth and advertiser demand. So we continue to see good opportunities to grow time spent. We see good opportunities to grow users, and we continue to see good opportunities to grow advertiser demand. On that latter point, really, the mix of ad units is part of what we're doing, I think, really well. We're developing a number of new ad products as well as enhancing the ad products that we have out in the market today, so we're taking what is a great mobile ad product on Facebook and Instagram and making it even better. And I think the investments that we're doing there will continue to enable us to drive advertiser demand. So those key factors will continue, we believe, to drive growth next year. So what I'm specifically talking about is ad load, and our anticipation is it's going to be a less significant factor as we get into mid-2017."

So how do you weigh investing in Live versus, let's call it, on-demand content? And maybe a related question would be Fox Sports and Sports Illustrator (sic -- Sports Illustrated) are coproducing some original content for Facebook Live. I think they're doing a pregame show ahead of the big game tonight. So that seems like, in some ways, it's an entrée into sports perhaps for Facebook. Could you give us an update on whether or not you see any advantage or any benefit in licensing sports content over time versus having one of the publishers do it on the Facebook platform?"

The video-on-demand content is the vast majority of video that is both shared and consumed on Facebook, not live video. But Live is growing very quickly. And part of the reason why we're investing in it is we see that video as a medium is not only in the future going to be about people producing content that looks like traditional content and then consuming it in a static, rectangle video screen. So live video, we think, represents an example of something new, which is video which is a medium for doing something that's really interacting with other people, right? Whether you're a public figure that is using it to hold a town hall or interact with a lot of people at the same time or you're hanging out with your friends by going live, and you have 10 people who are just there with you, chatting with you while you're doing something, going about -- throughout your day. It's not the kind of traditional video experience. It's actually a more social experience. I think 360 videos, in another way, are another example of this kind of interactive video experience. And my guess will be that we will see more different kinds of video media as time goes on. I think Stories is another example of this, that we're seeing with Instagram Stories and with Messenger and the initial test that we have with Messenger Day, where that is another interesting format where you can put videos together. I think that's going to be more and more. So -- but to put that all in context, I mean, the majority of the consumption today is video on demand. We are very interested in making sure that the business model that we have works for folks who produce content in their business to make sure that they can make money from it so that their best content comes on Facebook. So it's going to be a lot of growth in all of these things across all of our family of apps."

There are 2 broad sets of improvements that I think we need to make. One are to the capture and sharing tools that we offer. So the example of that is the new camera that we're working on and then all the creative tools around that. And then on the other hand, we also need to improve the infrastructure to deliver the best videos to people and do that quickly. So if you think about what is enabling video to become huge right now is that, fundamentally, the mobile networks are getting to a point where a large enough people around the world can have a good experience watching a video. If you go back a few years and you tried to load a video in News Feed, it might have to buffer for 30 seconds before you watch it, which wasn't a good enough experience for that to be the primary way that people shared. But now you can -- it loads instantly. You can take a video and upload it without having to take 5 minutes to do that. So it's a good experience. So we're very focused on creative tools, right? You can see that a little bit in the announcement and launch of Instagram Stories and what we're doing with Messenger and some of the initial tests in Facebook and the camera work that we're doing in WhatsApp. So this is across the whole family of apps. This is a big part of the product experience that we want to deliver. And then on the actual delivery of video side, it's just much more intensive technically, right? So there aren't that many companies that can do this at the scale that we're talking about, and this has been a big advantage for us in rolling out things like Live. We've had this infrastructure that we've been building out for a decade all around the world, and that allowed us to build a product like Live where someone has to stream something live from their phone to potentially hundreds of thousands of people around the world from a phone. That's a difficult scaling problem. So we've been able to build that up not just because of the ongoing investment in technology and infrastructure here but because we're building on the strong base. That goes not only for just being able to deliver the content but being able to understand what it is, so we can rank it at News Feed better and show people the right content. But all of these things are going to be part of a cohesive experience to get behind our community. And when people are ready and want video to be the primary way that they're sharing and consuming content, we're going to be there, ready."

And we expect we've got a lot of great opportunities to continue to innovate on that front. But we've also been innovating over the past several years. So demand has been a big factor in what's been driving our growth today. On top of that, we've grown users and time spent, and then we've also grown ad load. So I do think, as we look into 2017, we do expect that, as you get to mid-2017, ad load will be a less significant factor contributing. We'll continue to get benefits of being able to grow our revenue with advertiser demand and continuing to innovate there. But I do think that as we slow ad load growth, we're going have a slowing in revenue as well. So that's our expectation, but obviously, we're going to continue to work hard to innovate in the ad product space."

There is a second experience called video home, which we started talking about earlier in the year, and we've rolled out again in a few markets. And those tests have gone well, so we're also hoping to roll that out pretty soon widely. And that's the new experience, which, if you come to Facebook and you specifically want to watch some different kinds of videos or you want to see what videos a recent page that you follow has posted, or the presidential debate is on and you want to find a good place to go online to get that, you can go to video home and see that. That is the new experience that we're building. And building that as part of Facebook is a great way for people to see it and get exposure to it. And we'll see where that goes over time. I think it's a good experience inside Facebook, but we also have had examples over time -- like Messenger, for example, where we started them in Facebook and decided that in order to fulfill their potential, it needed to be its own experience over time. So we'll look at all those options. But for now I really think that video home is going to be a great experience, and I'm excited to roll that out."

It's definitely true that most of our advertisers are advertising on TV and advertising with us on mobile, and they should be. And we've done studies that show with Nielsen that our ads can be a really good complement to TV, particularly enabling you to reach people who really aren't on TV and you can't reach. I think the power of what we're able to do really goes to the targeting, and what we're seeing is big brand advertisers -- and this is actually a particularly strong growth for -- this quarter was particularly strong for brands, are really recognizing that they can do big brand buys on our platform like they would do on TV but make them much more targeted. So for example, Nestlé Purina PetCare did an ad campaign with Germany -- in Germany with ZenithOptimedia. And they defined 5 distinct cat owner personality types and created different creatives for each group. So that's kind of a big brand thing. There's the cat food category is big, and they want brand awareness. But rather than just run 1 ad, they were able to run 5 based on the kind of interest base and personality targeting that really only we can do. And the results were amazing. They got an 89% increase in brand awareness and a 20% lift in sales. And so we think what we offer is the power of the broad reach of TV but an ability to target much more efficiently."

The second phase is help people not only interact with the people they care about but also the businesses and other public entities that they care about as well. And then the third phase is, once there's good organic interaction between people and those businesses, give those businesses tools that they can pay for to reach more people and amplify those interactions. So I mentioned this stat earlier, that we have -- about 33,000 bots are live in Messenger, including experiences across a range of verticals from news to e-commerce to local businesses and all kinds of different things. And we're seeing some early progress. I'd say, we're still pretty early on in getting this to be widely rolled out. I think we're going to need many more than 33,000, and the number of people using them, I think, is still pretty early, right, in terms of there are more than 1 billion people using Messenger. So we need to get that rolled out pretty widely. So I'm not sure that I have an answer for you just yet on exactly when we're going to move to the third phase. The one thing that I would say in terms of making money through Messenger is we're already driving results for businesses by letting them advertise in News Feed to open up threads in Messenger, which is different from the long-term vision that we have here around creating interactions that start in Messenger. I think that, that will ultimately be most of the value that's generated. But in the near term, what we found is that a lot of businesses are creating ads in news feeds that then they can follow off and do transactions with people in Messenger.

Our top verticals this time are e-commerce, CPG, retail and entertainment media. We do see growth in the other verticals as well. You're right that, historically, it took us a longer time to break into some of these, particularly travel and auto where things that took us -- that took us longer. But we are seeing some really nice traction. I talked about Mary Barra and what she and I did together in New York at Adweek. And we're seeing them not just use the platform for advertising but really use the platform. So earlier this year, they rolled out a car at CES on Facebook video rather than at a car show, and that was a big moment for us, I think, in the auto vertical. And we continue to work with them and lots of other partners. Measurement's really key there. The better we can do with dealers and with auto manufacturers at measuring all the ways through to purchase, the better off we are. And I think they know that people are doing research for autos and the purchases they make, which is a very long sales cycle on their mobile phones, and they want us to be part of that. Similarly with travel, this is a vertical that we are really investing in. We have rolled out different types of product ads that we think will help. So in Q2, we rolled out Dynamic Ads that were specifically focused on the travel vertical. And I'll share one example. Celebrity Cruises used these Dynamic Ads for travel on both Facebook and Instagram to increase their online bookings. They worked with one of our SMPs, StitcherAds, and they created Custom Audiences viewed -- who viewed specific itineraries by date. So they looked for people that at a certain date have used specific itineraries and then created Dynamic Ads, which showed the available cruises and pricing and had a Book Now button. They saw a 3x increase in their online bookings. And I think those kind of results are made possible by more vertical-specific products, and we're going to continue to invest there."

Obviously, on the CapEx side, we've got a number of projects underway on the data center front. So clearly, on that front, we've got a lot of projects that are going to need ongoing funding going into 2017. So that, we've got good visibility on. In addition, it's, well, too early to give specifics. I want to give some directional color around expense growth. We've already invested in accelerating our recruiting efforts, so I wanted to highlight that. That's primarily around technology, technical recruiting, software engineering. And we have a lot of opportunities that we see to invest in the long-term growth of the business, and so that's our plan going into 2017. On ad blocking, in terms of the impact, I would just point out that, this quarter, we had 18% year-over-year desktop revenue growth. If you look at recent quarters, it was about half of that growth rate on a year-over-year basis, so that increment, that acceleration in desktop revenue growth is largely due to our efforts on reducing the impact of ad blocking. So that's what led to the acceleration of desktop revenue growth."

So News Feed is an ongoing work that we're always improving. What we basically are trying to do is work on, over time, adding more and more signals to the News Feed model to help us fully value what people in the community value about the different content that we show them. So what we realized was that the model that we had previously didn't fully capture the nuance and how people preferred certain content from friends and family, so we ran a bunch of qualitative studies and talked to a bunch of people and incorporated those signals into the model, and that has had the result that the people in our community, who gave us that feedback and who we worked with on this, what we'd expected and in terms of both increasing the quality of the content that people see and therefore, also enabling people to share more with their friends and the people that they want. But one thing that I would clarify is that, I think, sometimes people -- on your framing of your question, you asked if we had tweaked News Feed to do this or that. This is an ongoing iterative process. We're constantly learning about what our community wants, and we will constantly be trying to incorporate new information and signals into the model to help value all of the content in the system as accurately as possible. The biggest job that we have is to show people in the community what's going to be meaningful and important to them, and that is our goal in all of these changes."

In general, what we want to do is try to understand the content that people are sharing and that's out there for them to see as best as possible. So for example, that means being able to read and understand news articles or posts that people make or messages that a person might send you a business so we can help that business auto-reply to them and get information back to the person really quickly or understand the content so we can better understand what might be interesting to a person and show it in News Feed. Similarly, aside from the conversational linguistic understanding, we -- there's a whole thread of the work that we're doing on visual understanding, right, so understanding photos, what's in photos, what's in videos, what people are doing. That allows us to not only do things around accessibility to show somebody who's visually impaired, to be able to read to them what might be in a video or a photo, but it also helps us rank News Feed better so that way, we can help understand what is in the content and show people more of what is going to be meaningful to them. It helps us identify content that might be offensive or graphic that might violate the policies of Facebook, so we can flag that and review that better. So these are -- that's the main thread of the AI work that we're doing, is trying to understand conversational and linguistic context and computation -- sorry, computer vision, photographic and video signals to understand what's going on there. And that will apply across basically every product that we build at the company. And then, of course, there's some deeper AI research that we're doing that feeds into those applications as well that can apply to things like ranking for News Feed and search and ads and all of our systems more broadly."

And we think that, that reflects that people are getting value from the search experience, which a lot of the growth comes from people searching for posts and content in the system, not just looking up people and pages in the system. So yes -- on search, that's -- there's that. And then, of course, I think that search is often driven by what unique content is in a system and not just the ability to find it. So I think what people are going to search Facebook for are finding people and content that they know is on Facebook and that isn't in other places. Then that, I think, is driving most of the volume today and I think can get us to be -- we're already one of the largest search engines in the world but just to be even bigger on that front. You asked about transactions as well. And we spent a lot of time on this call talking about putting video first. That has certainly been the biggest theme of the last quarter and is the biggest part of the product strategy for Facebook and Instagram and is a big part of the product strategy for Messenger and WhatsApp as well. In terms of transaction, one of the big things that we see happening in messaging long term is that it's a great channel for people to interact with a business one on one and either do transactions in a private space or get support or for businesses to reach out with very personally tailored messages and have an ongoing engagement with a person. So that's something that we're very excited about building, and that is going to be the business that we hope to build on Messenger and WhatsApp over time. So we're looking forward to that. Marketplace, I think, is going to be a great example of this, too. What we're seeing in pages and marketers on Facebook is they want to both get awareness and drive all the way down to generating transactions, and Marketplace, I think, is going to help people do that. We're starting with people being able to sell things to and connect to other people who want to buy them, just like they've been doing in for sale groups for many years. But I -- we're excited to evolve this and grow it over time as well."

We had another good quarter. Our community continues to grow around the world. We're pleased to see nearly 1.8 billion people now use Facebook every month and nearly 1.2 billion people use it every day. It's also great to see the continued growth and strength of engagement on our platform, and our ads growth is growing at a healthy rate as well.  Total revenue grew by 56% year-over-year to $7 billion, and advertising revenue was up 59% to $6.8 billion.
I want to start by talking about our work around putting video first across our apps. People are creating and sharing more video, and we think it's pretty clear that video is only going to become more important. So that's why we're prioritizing putting video first across our family of apps and taking steps to make it even easier for people to express themselves in richer ways.
One way we're putting video first is through live video on Facebook. Since May, the number of people going live at any given moment has grown by 4x, and people have gone live from all 7 continents and also from outer space. Another recent example is Instagram Stories, which we launched in August. Instagram Stories is a lightweight way for people to share moments of their day through photos and videos that appear in a slide show format and disappear after 24 hours. Stories now has more than 100 million daily actives. We also improved the Explore tab in Instagram to include more videos and stories, and it has 100 million daily actives now as well.
In addition to making it easy to share video, we also want to make it easier to capture video. In most social apps today, a text box is still the default way we share. Soon, we believe a camera will be the main way that we share.
We're already testing this in our main Facebook app with a version of the -- that has a camera directly, just one swipe away from News Feed and with creative effects for your photos and videos. And in Messenger, we're testing new camera and video features. We'll be experimenting with even more visual messaging tools over the next few months as well. So those are a few examples of some of the things that we're doing to put video first across our family of apps.
Now I'll give you an update on our progress over our 3-, 5- and 10-year time horizon. Over the next 3 years, we're focusing on making our core services more useful and engaging. The 2016 Summer Olympics were huge on Facebook, with more than 270 million people creating 1.5 billion interactions. Facebook helped bring the world together, and athletes, fans and media went live throughout the games, including athletes who went live from the Olympic Village and Michael Phelps, who even announced his retirement on our platform.
This election season has also driven a lot of conversations, including on Facebook, where we've made it easier for voters and candidates to communicate with each other. In the first 9 months of this year, 109 million people on Facebook in the U.S. generated over 5.3 billion posts, comments and likes and shares related to the election. During the primaries in September, we also added a Register to Vote link at the top of our Facebook app that we estimate helped more than 2 million people register to vote, some who were registering for the first time. Facebook really is the new town hall, and we're proud of the role that we played in enabling dialogue and increasing civic engagement. That's the 3-year update.
Over the next 5 years, we're going to keep building ecosystems around products that a lot of people already use every day. Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp each have large communities, but we have a lot more work to do on all of them. I think about our progress here in 3 phases: The first phase is building a great consumer experience and getting it to scale; the second phase is about enabling people to organically interact with businesses; and then the third phase is to give businesses tools to reach more people. And that's where we build our business.
Right now Instagram has moved into that third phase. Instagram has more than 500 million monthly actives and more than 300 million daily actives. We're making good progress helping businesses and marketers use Instagram in new ways, and Sheryl will talk more about that in a few minutes.
Messenger is early in the second phase. We're helping businesses and consumers increasingly interact in richer ways. Today, there are 33,000 bots live on Messenger. We also launched Messenger Lite, which is designed to make messaging fast and easy with a wide variety of Android phones and for people who are on slower networks as well.
A lot of businesses use WhatsApp already, but we're going to really start working on the second phase in the next year. Right now we're testing new camera features, and we're continuing to keep features fast and reliable on multiple devices in every network condition.
Finally, we're starting to build communities around completely new apps. This quarter, we launched the Workplace to help make organizations more connected and productive. Workplace is a communications platform that uses features that people know like News Feed, groups and messages to help them collaborate and share at work the same way that they do everywhere else. Already, more than 1,000 organizations are using Workplace, including Starbucks, Royal Bank of Scotland and Danone, and we're adding more all the time. We're also getting new services to scale in the core app.
In October, we also launched the Marketplace tab to help people discover, buy and sell things with people in their community. While we just launched Marketplace, many millions of people have been buying and selling things in Facebook for sale groups for a while, and we think this is going to be an important tool going forward.
Over the next 10 years, we're going to continue to invest in the platforms and technologies that will connect more people in more places and allow everyone in the world to have a voice. We focused our long-term innovation road map around 3 areas: connectivity initiatives that bring more people online, artificial intelligence, and virtual and augmented reality.
On connectivity, through our efforts with internet.org, we've connected 40 million people based on our best estimate. And we're making good progress with our Express WiFi program, which empowers entrepreneurs to build a business by providing their community with access to the Internet.
On artificial intelligence, we're starting to see the impact that AI can have on enhancing people's experiences on Facebook and showing them more of what they care about. More than 40 teams at Facebook and more than 25% of our engineers are already using AI to power the products and services they build. We've made changes to our -- and improvements to our AI in order to filter out misleading click-bait stories from News Feed. And we're using AI to help find terrorist propaganda on Facebook. It's still early, but we think that AI will help improve the quality of what people see and can share on our platform.
We also took some important steps forward on virtual reality to help people experience the world in richer and more immersive ways. At Oculus Connect, we announced that touch controllers for Rift will ship in early December, with 35 games and experiences exclusively built for Touch. And since we believe the next phase of VR is great software experiences, we're investing another $250 million in virtual reality content on top of the money that we've already invested.
So this was a very busy third quarter, and 2016 is shaping up to be a year of important progress for Facebook. Our business is performing well, and while I'm happy about what we've accomplished, we're really just getting started. We want to continue to invest aggressively to accomplish our goals, which is why we're hiring, especially in engineering, which is going to be one of our top priorities going into 2017. And Dave will say more about this in his remarks.
Everything we do is about opening the world to everyone and helping more people to connect and share. So I want to thank our entire community, all of our teams, our partners and our shareholders for being a part of this journey with us. 
Now here's Sheryl."

We had a great third quarter. Q2 ad revenue grew 59%. Mobile ad revenue reached $5.7 billion, up 70% year-over-year and was approximately 84% of total ad revenues.

Mobile ad revenue reached $5.7 billion, up 70% year-over-year and was approximately 84% of total ad revenues. Our growth was broad based across all regions, marketer segments and verticals.
In Q3, we announced that we have over 4 million active advertisers on Facebook and over 500,000 active advertisers on Instagram. The number of advertisers on both platforms continues to grow quickly, and we're pleased to see more and more of them using the full range of our ad products. We continue to focus on our 3 priorities: capitalizing on the shift to mobile, growing the number of marketers using our ad products and making our ads more relevant and effective.
First, capitalizing on the shift to mobile. People have shifted to mobile, and we remain focused on helping businesses catch up. We know that marketing shift takes time. The first TV ads showed people standing in front of microphones reading a radio ad. Similarly, many of the first mobile video ads were TV ads dropped into mobile. Ads optimized for each platform often perform better, so marketers are increasingly tailoring their creative for mobile.
We're excited to see the world's largest advertisers realize that the small screen is big. In September, P&G Chief Brand Officer Marc Pritchard, GM CEO Mary Barra and I addressed the Adweek audience together. Marc described how P&G is creating mobile video ads designed to grab attention in the first few seconds. He shared the example of Tide. In a typical TV ad, they start with a clean dress or shirt, show it getting stained and then cleaned with Tide. On mobile, they need to communicate the product value more quickly, so they start by showing Tide cleaning a stained garment.
Mary shared GM's success with Facebook mobile video ads. In Q3, GM's subsidiary, Holden, used carousel ad plus video to maximize its sponsorship of Australia's premier rugby tournament. Holden created a video series about their support of youth rugby. The ads generated an 8 point lift in brand favorability for the overall audience and a 15 point lift amongst their target audience of women over 35.
For many small businesses, the shift to mobile means leveraging video for the very first time. Rather than needing a camera crew and production budget, anyone with a smartphone can shoot a video and share it on Facebook. In the past month alone, over 3 million small businesses have posted a video on Facebook in creating organic posts and ads.
Our second priority is growing the number of marketers using our ad products. We continue to focus on our advertiser pipeline. In Q2, we announced that over 60 million businesses use our free Facebook pages product each month, and we introduced the Instagram equivalent, business profiles, which are being used by 1.5 million businesses.
On past calls, I've talked about product simplification as a driver of advertiser growth on Facebook. Now with the launch of promoted posts, we are seeing that on Instagram, too. Like boosted posts on Facebook, promoted posts on Instagram are an easy way to start advertising, and we're pleased with adoption.
Over 85% of business pages are active on mobile, so we're making it easier for advertisers to manage campaigns from their phones. In Q3, we added a feature that shows marketers a preview of a potential ad in News Feed just as their customers would see it. They can then run the ad with just a few taps from their mobile device. Making it easy to advertise from a mobile phone is especially important in emerging markets. For businesses operating in areas with weak network connections, we continue to build advertising tools into Facebook Lite, our low-bandwidth app and are making more of them available offline.
Our third priority is making our ads more relevant and effective. Our goal is to be the #1 driver of growth for our clients. In Q3, we introduced tools to help businesses find people around the world who look like their current customers and target the ones most likely to convert.  For example, SA Company, an outdoor gear and apparel business started by a young man out of his parents' home, used international lookalike targeting to reach customers in 32 countries and increase sales by 37%.
We're focused on driving purchases online and in stores. In Q2, we launched estimated store visits, which show advertisers how many people came to their store after seeing an ad. And this quarter, we made it possible for advertisers to optimize campaigns for in-store visits.
We also expanded Dynamic Ads, a proven way to drive online sales for in-store retail objectives. Businesses can use Dynamic Ads for retail to show people the products available at their closest location in real-time and reach people likely to visit their store.
To prove the value we're driving for our partners, we continue to invest in measurement. This quarter, we announced new third-party partnerships with Nielsen, Datalogix, Visual IQ and MarketShare to help our clients measure how Facebook ads drive business results.
We're pleased with the value we're driving for our partners, and we remain focused on helping them make the shift to mobile. With only a small fraction of businesses on Facebook and Instagram advertising, we have a lot of opportunity in front of us. We also have a lot of hard work to do to help our partners around the world use mobile to drive their businesses.
I want to thank our clients around the world for their partnership and congratulate our global teams on the results of their continued focus and dedication.
Thanks. And now here's Dave."

Total revenue grew 56% and exceeded $7 billion for the first time. And we delivered $2.4 billion in GAAP net income, up 166%.
We saw healthy growth and engagement in our community as well as broad-based strength in our mobile ads business. Let's start with our community metrics. In September, 1.18 billion people used Facebook on an average day, up 172 million or 17% compared to last year. This daily number represents 66% of the 1.79 billion people that used Facebook in the month of September. Mobile continues to drive our growth, with 1.09 billion people accessing Facebook on mobile on an average day in September, up approximately 197 million or 22% compared to last year.
Turning now to the financials. My comments today will focus on our GAAP financial metrics, and all of our comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial metrics is included in our press release and earnings slides.
Q3 total revenue was approximately $7 billion, up 56%. Q3 ad revenue was $6.8 billion, up 59%. Exchange rates did not impact our overall growth this quarter as headwinds in certain currencies were offset by tailwinds in others.
Asia Pacific and North America were our fastest growing regions with ad revenue growth rates of 64% and 62%, respectively. Ad revenue grew at a rate of 50% or more in all regions in Q3. Mobile ad revenue was $5.7 billion, up 70% and representing approximately 84% of total ad revenue.
On prior calls, we have discussed the supply and demand factors that drive our mobile ads business. As Sheryl noted earlier, advertiser demand remained strong in Q3 across all geographies, verticals and marketer segments. We also benefited from growth in users, time spent and ad loads.
It is worth noting that desktop ad revenue grew 18%, which is higher than growth rates in recent quarters and was aided by our efforts to limit the impact of ad blockers on advertising served via web browsers. Our price volume trends were similar to those we reported last quarter. The average price per ad increased 6% in Q3, while total ad impressions increased 50%. The reported price -- reported increase in price continues to be driven by the ongoing mix shift towards mobile, where we show only higher-priced feed ads. Impression growth was primarily driven by mobile feed ads on Facebook and Instagram.
Payments and other fees revenue was $195 million, down 3%. Payments and other fees revenue is largely generated from games played on personal computers, which has declined as people spend less time on their PCs.
Q3 total expenses were $3.9 billion, up 28%. This includes $839 million of share-based compensation expenses and related payroll taxes as well as $195 million of amortization of intangible assets.
In Q3, we hired over 1,200 people and ended the quarter with approximately 15,700 employees, up 31% compared to last year. We remain committed to investing aggressively in hiring, including expanding our technical and recruiting teams globally.
Q3 operating income was $3.1 billion, representing a 45% margin. Our tax rate was 25%. GAAP net income was $2.4 billion or $0.82 per share. Q3 capital expenditures were $1.1 billion. Year-to-date through September, capital expenditures were $3.2 billion, up 76%, driven by investments in data centers, servers, office buildings and network infrastructure.
In addition to our new data center projects in Texas and Ireland, we recently broke ground on our seventh data center facility in New Mexico, which we anticipate will come online in late 2018. We generated approximately $2.5 billion of free cash flow and ended the quarter with $26.1 billion in cash and investments.
Turning now to the outlook for the remainder of 2016. First, some color on revenue. We continue to expect that revenue growth rates will decline in Q4 as we lap a strong fourth quarter in 2015. We also continue to expect that our total payments and other fees revenue in Q4 will be lower than it was in the fourth quarter of last year.
Turning now to the 2016 expense outlook. Based on our year-to-date results and our updated view of the remainder of the year, we are adjusting our expense guidance ranges. We now expect that full year 2016 GAAP expense growth will be at the lower end of our prior range of 30% to 35%. We expect full year 2016 amortization expenses to be approximately $700 million to $800 million and the full year 2016 share-based compensation expenses to be approximately $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion.
Accordingly, we anticipate that our total non-GAAP expenses, which exclude those share-based compensation and amortization expenses, will grow in the range of 40% to 45%, down from our prior range of 45% to 50%. We anticipate full year capital expenditures to be approximately $4.5 billion as we invest aggressively to support the rapid growth of the business. We expect that our Q4 and full year 2016 tax rates will be in line with the year-to-date tax rates.
I also wanted to provide some brief comments on 2017. First on revenue. As I mentioned, last quarter, we continued to expect that ad load will play a less significant factor driving revenue growth after mid-2017. Over the past 2 years, we have averaged about 50% revenue growth in advertising. Ad load has been 1 of the 3 primary factors fueling that growth. With a much smaller contribution from this important factor going forward, we expect to see ad revenue growth rates come down meaningfully.
Secondly on expenses. Though it is premature to provide specific expense guidance, as Mark mentioned, we anticipate 2017 will be an aggressive investment year. Adding top engineering talent remains 1 of our key investment priorities as we continue to execute on our 3-, 5- and 10-year road maps. We will continue to invest in our ability to recruit top technology talent both in the Bay Area and beyond. In addition, we expect to grow capital expenditures substantially as we continue to fund the ongoing data center expansion efforts that we have underway.
Finally, I wanted to share some plans on the use of cash starting in 2017. Beginning in January, we intend to fund withholding taxes due on employee equity awards via net share settlement rather than our current approach of requiring employees to sell our shares of common stock to cover taxes upon vesting of such awards. We expect this change will increase our cash flows and correspondingly result in less dilution -- our cash outflows and correspondingly result in less dilution. If we had used this approach in 2016, our cash outflows would have increased by approximately $1.8 billion in the year through September.
To wrap things up, Q3 was another strong quarter for Facebook. Our results reflected the continued growth and engagement of our community around the world and the strength of our mobile ads business.
With that, operator, let's open up the call for questions."

There's 60 million small business pages up on Facebook and 1.5 million Instagram business profiles, which are the similar -- the equivalent for Instagram. And the reason we think people are so active is it's just really expensive and hard to have your own mobile site or your own even web page. 35% of small businesses in the United States, which is the most developed market, in many cases, don't even have a web page of any kind. And it's cheaper and easier to build a web page than it is to build a mobile app and get distribution or downloads. And so what's happening is that people are really using the Facebook business pages and increasingly, the Instagram business profiles as their mobile presence. And we think that's what's working. And then we're working hard to build products that work in store visits and then you simplify the ad products that convert them over to advertising."

So we continue to see good opportunities to grow time spent. We see good opportunities to grow users, and we continue to see good opportunities to grow advertiser demand. On that latter point, really, the mix of ad units is part of what we're doing, I think, really well. We're developing a number of new ad products as well as enhancing the ad products that we have out in the market today, so we're taking what is a great mobile ad product on Facebook and Instagram and making it even better. And I think the investments that we're doing there will continue to enable us to drive advertiser demand. So those key factors will continue, we believe, to drive growth next year. So what I'm specifically talking about is ad load, and our anticipation is it's going to be a less significant factor as we get into mid-2017."

And maybe a related question would be Fox Sports and Sports Illustrator (sic) [ Sports Illustrated ] are coproducing some original content for Facebook Live. I think they're doing a pregame show ahead of the big game tonight. So that seems like, in some ways, it's an entrée into sports perhaps for Facebook. Could you give us an update on whether or not you see any advantage or any benefit in licensing sports content over time versus having one of the publishers do it on the Facebook platform?"

The video-on-demand content is the vast majority of video that is both shared and consumed on Facebook, not live video. But Live is growing very quickly. And part of the reason why we're investing in it is we see that video as a medium is not only in the future going to be about people producing content that looks like traditional content and then consuming it in a static, rectangle video screen. So live video, we think, represents an example of something new, which is video which is a medium for doing something that's really interacting with other people, right? Whether you're a public figure that is using it to hold a town hall or interact with a lot of people at the same time or you're hanging out with your friends by going live, and you have 10 people who are just there with you, chatting with you while you're doing something, going about -- throughout your day. It's not the kind of traditional video experience. It's actually a more social experience. I think 360 videos, in another way, are another example of this kind of interactive video experience. And my guess will be that we will see more different kinds of video media as time goes on. I think Stories is another example of this, that we're seeing with Instagram Stories and with Messenger and the initial test that we have with Messenger Day, where that is another interesting format where you can put videos together. I think that's going to be more and more. So -- but to put that all in context, I mean, the majority of the consumption today is video on demand. We are very interested in making sure that the business model that we have works for folks who produce content in their business to make sure that they can make money from it so that their best content comes on Facebook. So it's going to be a lot of growth in all of these things across all of our family of apps."

There are 2 broad sets of improvements that I think we need to make. One are to the capture and sharing tools that we offer. So the example of that is the new camera that we're working on and then all the creative tools around that. And then on the other hand, we also need to improve the infrastructure to deliver the best videos to people and do that quickly. So if you think about what is enabling video to become huge right now is that, fundamentally, the mobile networks are getting to a point where a large enough people around the world can have a good experience watching a video. If you go back a few years and you tried to load a video in News Feed, it might have to buffer for 30 seconds before you watch it, which wasn't a good enough experience for that to be the primary way that people shared. But now you can -- it loads instantly. You can take a video and upload it without having to take 5 minutes to do that. So it's a good experience. So we're very focused on creative tools, right? You can see that a little bit in the announcement and launch of Instagram Stories and what we're doing with Messenger and some of the initial tests in Facebook and the camera work that we're doing in WhatsApp. So this is across the whole family of apps. This is a big part of the product experience that we want to deliver. And then on the actual delivery of video side, it's just much more intensive technically, right? So there aren't that many companies that can do this at the scale that we're talking about, and this has been a big advantage for us in rolling out things like Live. We've had this infrastructure that we've been building out for a decade all around the world, and that allowed us to build a product like Live where someone has to stream something live from their phone to potentially hundreds of thousands of people around the world from a phone. That's a difficult scaling problem. So we've been able to build that up not just because of the ongoing investment in technology and infrastructure here but because we're building on the strong base. That goes not only for just being able to deliver the content but being able to understand what it is, so we can rank it at News Feed better and show people the right content. But all of these things are going to be part of a cohesive experience to get behind our community. And when people are ready and want video to be the primary way that they're sharing and consuming content, we're going to be there, ready."

And we expect we've got a lot of great opportunities to continue to innovate on that front. But we've also been innovating over the past several years. So demand has been a big factor in what's been driving our growth today. On top of that, we've grown users and time spent, and then we've also grown ad load. So I do think, as we look into 2017, we do expect that, as you get to mid-2017, ad load will be a less significant factor contributing. We'll continue to get benefits of being able to grow our revenue with advertiser demand and continuing to innovate there.

One is that video is naturally becoming a larger share of the content in News Feed because both people and pages are sharing more videos as  a mix, and people want to consume that content. So that -- there's not really a question of whether that should be a separate app. This is what people want News Feed to be increasingly, so this is what it will become. There is a second experience called video home, which we started talking about earlier in the year, and we've rolled out again in a few markets. And those tests have gone well, so we're also hoping to roll that out pretty soon widely. And that's the new experience, which, if you come to Facebook and you specifically want to watch some different kinds of videos or you want to see what videos a recent page that you follow has posted, or the presidential debate is on and you want to find a good place to go online to get that, you can go to video home and see that. That is the new experience that we're building. And building that as part of Facebook is a great way for people to see it and get exposure to it. And we'll see where that goes over time. I think it's a good experience inside Facebook, but we also have had examples over time -- like Messenger, for example, where we started them in Facebook and decided that in order to fulfill their potential, it needed to be its own experience over time. So we'll look at all those options. But for now I really think that video home is going to be a great experience, and I'm excited to roll that out."

It's definitely true that most of our advertisers are advertising on TV and advertising with us on mobile, and they should be. And we've done studies that show with Nielsen that our ads can be a really good complement to TV, particularly enabling you to reach people who really aren't on TV and you can't reach. I think the power of what we're able to do really goes to the targeting, and what we're seeing is big brand advertisers -- and this is actually a particularly strong growth for -- this quarter was particularly strong for brands, are really recognizing that they can do big brand buys on our platform like they would do on TV but make them much more targeted. So for example, Nestlé Purina PetCare did an ad campaign with Germany -- in Germany with ZenithOptimedia. And they defined 5 distinct cat owner personality types and created different creatives for each group. So that's kind of a big brand thing. There's the cat food category is big, and they want brand awareness. But rather than just run 1 ad, they were able to run 5 based on the kind of interest base and personality targeting that really only we can do. And the results were amazing. They got an 89% increase in brand awareness and a 20% lift in sales. And so we think what we offer is the power of the broad reach of TV but an ability to target much more efficiently."

Just to recap the framework that we have here, the strategy is there are 3 phases, right? We build and then build businesses around these apps. The first is build an experience and get it to scale, right, to build a community that can get to hundreds of millions or 1 billion people or more. The second phase is help people not only interact with the people they care about but also the businesses and other public entities that they care about as well. And then the third phase is, once there's good organic interaction between people and those businesses, give those businesses tools that they can pay for to reach more people and amplify those interactions. So I mentioned this stat earlier, that we have -- about 33,000 bots are live in Messenger, including experiences across a range of verticals from news to e-commerce to local businesses and all kinds of different things. And we're seeing some early progress. I'd say, we're still pretty early on in getting this to be widely rolled out. I think we're going to need many more than 33,000, and the number of people using them, I think, is still pretty early, right, in terms of there are more than 1 billion people using Messenger. So we need to get that rolled out pretty widely. So I'm not sure that I have an answer for you just yet on exactly when we're going to move to the third phase. The one thing that I would say in terms of making money through Messenger is we're already driving results for businesses by letting them advertise in News Feed to open up threads in Messenger, which is different from the long-term vision that we have here around creating interactions that start in Messenger. I think that, that will ultimately be most of the value that's generated. But in the near term, what we found is that a lot of businesses are creating ads in news feeds that then they can follow off and do transactions with people in Messenger. And I think that's going to be pretty meaningful over the next few years."

What we see is that people in Instagram are using Instagram to browse for products and make those connections, and so we then make the product investments to make those a little bit easier.

Our top verticals this time are e-commerce, CPG, retail and entertainment media. We do see growth in the other verticals as well. You're right that, historically, it took us a longer time to break into some of these, particularly travel and auto where things that took us -- that took us longer. But we are seeing some really nice traction. I talked about Mary Barra and what she and I did together in New York at Adweek. And we're seeing them not just use the platform for advertising but really use the platform. So earlier this year, they rolled out a car at CES on Facebook video rather than at a car show, and that was a big moment for us, I think, in the auto vertical. And we continue to work with them and lots of other partners. Measurement's really key there. The better we can do with dealers and with auto manufacturers at measuring all the ways through to purchase, the better off we are. And I think they know that people are doing research for autos and the purchases they make, which is a very long sales cycle on their mobile phones, and they want us to be part of that. Similarly with travel, this is a vertical that we are really investing in. We have rolled out different types of product ads that we think will help. So in Q2, we rolled out Dynamic Ads that were specifically focused on the travel vertical. And I'll share one example. Celebrity Cruises used these Dynamic Ads for travel on both Facebook and Instagram to increase their online bookings. They worked with one of our SMPs, StitcherAds, and they created Custom Audiences viewed -- who viewed specific itineraries by date. So they looked for people that at a certain date have used specific itineraries and then created Dynamic Ads, which showed the available cruises and pricing and had a Book Now button. They saw a 3x increase in their online bookings. And I think those kind of results are made possible by more vertical-specific products, and we're going to continue to invest there."

In addition, it's, well, too early to give specifics. I want to give some directional color around expense growth. We've already invested in accelerating our recruiting efforts, so I wanted to highlight that. That's primarily around technology, technical recruiting, software engineering. And we have a lot of opportunities that we see to invest in the long-term growth of the business, and so that's our plan going into 2017. On ad blocking, in terms of the impact, I would just point out that, this quarter, we had 18% year-over-year desktop revenue growth. If you look at recent quarters, it was about half of that growth rate on a year-over-year basis, so that increment, that acceleration in desktop revenue growth is largely due to our efforts on reducing the impact of ad blocking.

What we basically are trying to do is work on, over time, adding more and more signals to the News Feed model to help us fully value what people in the community value about the different content that we show them.

Similarly, aside from the conversational linguistic understanding, we -- there's a whole thread of the work that we're doing on visual understanding, right, so understanding photos, what's in photos, what's in videos, what people are doing. That allows us to not only do things around accessibility to show somebody who's visually impaired, to be able to read to them what might be in a video or a photo, but it also helps us rank News Feed better so that way, we can help understand what is in the content and show people more of what is going to be meaningful to them. It helps us identify content that might be offensive or graphic that might violate the policies of Facebook, so we can flag that and review that better. So these are -- that's the main thread of the AI work that we're doing, is trying to understand conversational and linguistic context and computation -- sorry, computer vision, photographic and video signals to understand what's going on there. And that will apply across basically every product that we build at the company.

So yes -- on search, that's -- there's that. And then, of course, I think that search is often driven by what unique content is in a system and not just the ability to find it. So I think what people are going to search Facebook for are finding people and content that they know is on Facebook and that isn't in other places. Then that, I think, is driving most of the volume today and I think can get us to be -- we're already one of the largest search engines in the world but just to be even bigger on that front. You asked about transactions as well. And we spent a lot of time on this call talking about putting video first. That has certainly been the biggest theme of the last quarter and is the biggest part of the product strategy for Facebook and Instagram and is a big part of the product strategy for Messenger and WhatsApp as well. In terms of transaction, one of the big things that we see happening in messaging long term is that it's a great channel for people to interact with a business one on one and either do transactions in a private space or get support or for businesses to reach out with very personally tailored messages and have an ongoing engagement with a person. So that's something that we're very excited about building, and that is going to be the business that we hope to build on Messenger and WhatsApp over time. So we're looking forward to that. Marketplace, I think, is going to be a great example of this, too. What we're seeing in pages and marketers on Facebook is they want to both get awareness and drive all the way down to generating transactions, and Marketplace, I think, is going to help people do that. We're starting with people being able to sell things to and connect to other people who want to buy them, just like they've been doing in for sale groups for many years.

We started 2016 off well. 1.65 billion people now use Facebook every month and 1.09 billion people use Facebook every day. In recent weeks, we're also consistently seeing more than 1 billion people using Facebook on mobile every day. 
We're also pleased with our business results. Total revenue this quarter grew by 52% year-on-year to $5.4 billion, and advertising revenue grew by 57% to $5.2 billion. I'll have more to say about these results in a minute, but first I want to talk about a proposal by our Board of Directors to reclassify Facebook's stock. 
At F8, I talked about our mission and how the work we're doing to connect the world is more important today than it's ever been. I walked through our 10-year roadmap, focused on building the technology to give everyone in world the power to share anything with anyone. Bringing people together and giving everyone a voice takes a long-term commitment, not just over the next few years but over the next few decades. 
We're focused on the long term. And that's the main reason for today's proposal. Facebook has always been a founder-like company, so we can focus on our mission and build long-term value. This structure has served our shareholders well. Early on, we received some generous offers for companies trying to buy Facebook, and our structure helped us resist that pressure. 
More recently, we navigated a challenging transition to mobile, but because we were a controlled company, we were able to focus on improving the user and product experience of our apps first, and then build a strong mobile business over time rather than being forced to do something shortsighted. And over the years, our structure has helped us make big bets on acquisitions like Instagram that were very controversial initially but were good decisions for our community and our business. 
Facebook has been built by a series of bold moves. And when I look out at the future, I see more bold moves ahead of us than behind us. We're focused not on what Facebook is, but on what it can be, and on what it needs to be. And that means doing bold things. A lot of what we're building today in the areas like connectivity, artificial intelligence and virtual and augmented reality may not pay off for years. But they're important to our mission of connecting the world. And I'm committed to seeing this mission through and to leading Facebook there over the long term.
Personally, there's another element to this. While helping to connect the world will always be the most important thing that I do, there are more global challenges that I also feel a responsibility to help solve, to create a better world for my daughter and all future generations. Things like helping to cure all disease by the end of the century, upgrading our education system so it's personalized for each student and protecting our environment from climate change. That's why Priscilla and I created the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and committed to give 99% of our Facebook shares to advance human potential and promote equality.
Today's Board proposal will allow us to maintain and improve the voting structure that has served us well and allow me to fund the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. In December, I also announced that I won't sell more than $1 billion worth of stock -- Facebook shares per year over the next 3 years. That's still my commitment, and I'll update our shareholders on the future plans beyond that.
Dave will talk more about the mechanics of this proposal in his comments in just a few minutes. But before we get there, I want to also share a few more thoughts on the progress we've made this quarter. As I said before, our roadmap has 3 horizons. Over the next 3 years, we're going to keep investing in our most developed ecosystem, the Facebook app and platform. Today, people around the world spend on average more than 50 minutes a day using Facebook, Instagram and Messenger, and that doesn't even include WhatsApp yet. This growth isn't happening because we came up with just 1 or 2 big changes. Our team has just worked day after day on lots of improvements over a long period of time. And that progress continued in the first quarter. We launched Reactions to help people express themselves in more ways, and we improved our product to work on different mobile networks and devices all over the world. 
Sheryl will talk more about this in a minute, but now, more than 3 million businesses are using our advertising products every month. We've expanded our measurement capabilities, so more businesses can see the results they get from ads. We've made it easier for small and medium businesses to use the same targeting tools and ad formats that our larger advertisers use. 
Over the next 5 years, we're going to build the ecosystems around our products that are already being used by a lot of people. We're at the beginning of a golden age of online video. Video isn't just a single kind of content. We think it's a medium that allows people to interact in a lot of new ways. So that's why in addition to normal Internet video, we're also focusing on more interactive video experiences like Live and 360 video. 
I'm a big Game of Thrones fan, and the other week, HBO and our Oculus team came out with a 360 video of the opening sequence of the show, and it's now the most-watched 360 video on Facebook in any 24-hour period, with more than 12 million total views. 
Earlier this month, we opened up Live to everyone. Live is just one part of our overall video effort, but we think it has a lot of potential. Friends go live because it's unfiltered and personal. Actors and news anchors go live because they can reach bigger audiences, in some cases, than they can on, even on their own shows. And if we do a good job, we think it's something that people will associate with Facebook, with interacting with people and not just watching content. But it's also a very new and a small part of all of the videos that we see on Facebook today.
I'm also really excited about what we're building around messaging. Right now, we have 2 of the top messaging apps in the world. 900 million people use Messenger every month and 1 billion people use WhatsApp every month. Between Messenger and WhatsApp, people send around 60 billion messages every day. That's almost 3x as many messages as SMS handled at its peak. 
Over the past couple of weeks, we've talked about steps we're taking to build messaging into a platform that developers and businesses can build on. We have bots for Messenger, that let you do things like order flowers or get news without leaving your messenger thread. So this is all very early, and we're rolling these experiences out carefully and slowly over time. 
We're also very happy with the way that Instagram is growing, with more than 400 million actives and more than 200,000 businesses advertising every month. Now we're focused on making the user experience even more engaging. With more content on Instagram all the time, people are currently missing about 70% of what's in their feed. So that's why in the first quarter, we started rolling out feed ranking to help you see more of the posts that you care about. 
And this is a long-term effort, but News Feed shows that ranking creates the best and most engaging experiences for our community. Over the next 10 years, we're going to keep investing in new technology to help everyone connect. As part of internet.org, we're building an open-source telco infrastructure project called TIP to make it cheaper to operate mobile networks. Free Basics, which helps people access tools for education, health information and communication for free, now features more than 600 services, and it has brought more than 25 million people online. That makes it one of the most successful connectivity initiatives in the world.
We're also working to help people connect and share in a more natural and intuitive way. Artificial intelligence is a long-term effort for us but we're already using it in lots of ways. Right now, our Moments app is using face recognition to help you share pictures with your friends. 
We're using AIs to show the most relevant content in News Feeds, filter spam and messaging and even help blind people understand what's in their friend's photos by reading explanations of them aloud. 
Finally, we're building technology in virtual and augmented reality that can change the way that we all experience of the world. Gear VR started shipping late last year and the response so far has been great. There are now hundreds of apps built specifically for Gear, and people have watched more than 2 million hours of video on it. 
In Q1, we also started shipping Oculus Rift. Now we've got a lot of great content with more than 50 games and apps built for Rift. And again, this is very early and we don't expect VR to take off as a mainstream success right away. I really want to emphasize that. Most Rift early adopters are gamers and developers, but eventually, we believe that VR is going to be the next big computing platform, and we're making the investments necessary to lead the way there.
So that's our update for the quarter. As always, everything we do is focused on our mission to make the world more open and connected. And to get there, we're building technology that brings people together and that helps everyone in the world share anything they want with anyone. It takes a long-term commitment and it won't happen overnight, but we're in a strong position, and I'm excited about what's next. So thank you to everyone in our community, to all of our teams, all of our partners and all of our shareholders for everything you're doing to help connect the world. And now here's Sheryl."

We had a great first quarter and a strong start to the year. Q1 ad revenue grew 57% or 63% on a constant currency basis. Mobile ad revenue reached $4.2 billion, up 75% year-over-year, and is now approximately 82% of total",790,"Thanks, Mark, and hi, everyone. 
We had a great first quarter and a strong start to the year. Q1 ad revenue grew 57% or 63% on a constant currency basis. Mobile ad revenue reached $4.2 billion, up 75% year-over-year, and is now approximately 82% of total ad revenue. Our growth was strong across all verticals, marketer segments and regions, particularly North America and APAC. 
We remained focused on driving our clients businesses, moving their products off shelves both in stores and online. A big focus for us in 2016 is helping our clients understand the true business impact of their ads, especially on digital. 
We're pleased with the progress we made in Q1 across our 3 priorities: capitalizing on the shift to mobile; growing the number of marketers using our ad products; and making our ads more relevant and effective. 
First, capitalizing on the shift to mobile. Consumers have shifted to mobile, and businesses know they need to catch up. We hear from marketers that figuring out mobile today is like figuring out TV in its early days. But given where consumers spend their time, the question now is not if they should market on mobile, but how. 
One of the drivers of the consumer shift to mobile is video. People are sharing and creating nearly 3x more video on Facebook than they were a year ago. And as of February, the time people spend watching videos on Instagram increased by more than 40% over the preceding 6 months. This presents a big opportunity for marketers. 
The best marketers understand that people watch video differently in mobile feed than on TV. They create ads that grab attention in the first few seconds, sometimes even without sound, what we now call thumb-stopping creative. For example, Nestle took their TV ad for Natural Bliss Coffee Creamer, and in less than a day, edited it for mobile feed by creating a new opening and adding text overlays to relay their message without sound. They showed both the original TV ad and the mobile ad on Facebook. The original TV ad drove a 4-point increase in ad recall. The mobile-optimized version, however, drove an even stronger 10-point increase in ad recall and a 7-point increase in product awareness. 
We want to help marketers optimize their video ads. For example, we know that on average, captioned videos increase view time by 12%, so we introduced auto captions to generate captions for video ads. In Q1, we introduced new ad formats like Canvas ads. Canvas ads showcase products by combining video images and call for action button. While it's still early, we're pleased with the results and are seeing adoption across many verticals. 
To motivate millennials to take on do-it-yourself projects, Lowes and BBDO targeted 25- to 34-year-old homeowners with Canvas ads that let them see bathroom designs, discover the products in each design and tap to purchase. The ads were so engaging that people spent an average of 28 seconds interacting with them and loads saw a 6.7x return on ad spend.
Our second priority is growing the number of marketers using our ad products. This quarter, we announced that we have over 3 million active advertisers on Facebook and over 200,000 on Instagram. A significant number of these advertisers are small and medium businesses. These businesses use our platform because it's easy and affordable for them to connect with their consumers on mobile. 
We're also making it easier for SMBs to use the same targeting tools and ad formats that our most sophisticated advertisers use. We're seeing even small businesses use products like lead ads, Slideshow and Dynamic Product Ad. [ph] 
Our third priority is improving the relevance and effectiveness of our ads. Last year, we introduced conversion lift to measure how Facebook and Instagram campaigns drive business objectives like sales. We've seen clients across verticals from retail to auto use conversion lift to measure and improve the return on their ad investment. 
Chase Bank used conversion lift to measure how effectively their Super Bowl ad drove credit card applications. They found that combining Facebook video ads with their TV ads drove 1.5x more conversion than TV ads alone. In Q1, we expanded our lift capabilities by testing lift API, enabling more partners to measure the effectiveness of more of their campaigns. 
We're pleased with the value we're driving for our partners and the progress we're making across our 3 priorities. Helping marketers make the shift to mobile will take time. We have a lot of hard work ahead and will continue to invest. I want to thank our clients around the world for their partnership and congratulate our global team on the results of their hard work. Thanks, everyone, and now here's Dave."
20765463,330038583,1216445,"Facebook, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 27, 2016",2016-04-27,"Earnings Calls","Meta Platforms, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Sheryl, and good afternoon, everyone. We're off to a great start in 2016, led by the ongoing growth and engagement in our community and continued momentum in our ads business. In Q1, we generated $5.4 billion in total revenue and delivered over $1",1372,"Thanks, Sheryl, and good afternoon, everyone. We're off to a great start in 2016, led by the ongoing growth and engagement in our community and continued momentum in our ads business. In Q1, we generated $5.4 billion in total revenue and delivered over $1.8 billion in free cash flow. Let's begin with our community metrics.
In March, 1.09 billion people used Facebook on an average day, up 16% compared to last year. This daily number represents 66% of the 1.65 billion people who visited Facebook in the month of March. Mobile continues to drive our growth. Over 1.5 billion people accessed Facebook from mobile devices in March, up 21% from last year. 
Before diving into our quarterly financial results, I wanted to highlight that beginning this quarter, I will focus my prepared remarks on our GAAP results and our -- all financial metrics are GAAP, unless otherwise noted. The primary difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP metrics is stock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation plays an important role in how we compensate our employees, and therefore, we view it as a real expense for the business. We will continue to provide a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial metrics in our press release and earnings slides. All of our comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted.
Q1 total revenue was $5.4 billion, up 52% or 58% on a constant currency basis. Ad revenue in Q1 was $5.2 billion, up 57% or 63% on a constant currency basis. This marks a slight decline from the 66% constant currency ad growth rate we experienced in Q4. 
In Q1 this year, we benefited from an additional day due to the leap year, which contributed approximately 2 percentage points to our year-over-year ad revenue growth rate. North America and Asia-Pacific were our fastest-growing regions, with advertising revenue growth of 64% and 62%, respectively. Europe and Rest of World grew advertising revenue more slowly at 49% and 35%, respectively, with the latter particularly impacted by foreign exchange headwinds. Setting aside currency headwinds, all regions exceeded 50% constant currency ad revenue growth. 
Mobile ad revenue was $4.2 billion, representing approximately 82% of total ad revenue. Mobile ad revenue grew 75%, driven by strength from Facebook's News Feed. Our mobile apps business continues to be driven by the combination of both supply-side and demand-side factors. 
On the supply side, we continue to see healthy growth in the number of people using Facebook, time spent across our products and app loads. On the demand side, we believe the investments we've made to improve our mobile advertising solutions are helping drive value for both people and marketers. We are seeing growth in both new customers as well as existing customers who are spending more with us on average compared to last year.
In Q1, the average price per ad increased 5% while total ad impressions increased 50%. The reported increase in price is being driven by the continued mix shift towards mobile, which contained higher-priced News Feed ads rather than the mix we have on PCs of both News Feed ads and lower-priced right-hand column ads. 
The increase in impressions was driven by strong growth in mobile ad impressions and was offset partially by a decline in ad impressions delivered on personal computers, consistent with the ongoing declines in PC usage. 
The increase in -- sorry, total payments and other fees revenue was $181 million, down 20% compared to last year. This decline was mainly driven by a reduction in payments revenue related to games played on personal computers. 
Q1 total cost and expenses were $3.4 billion, up 29%. We ended the quarter with approximately 13,600 employees, up 35% compared to last year. Q1 operating income was $2 billion, representing a 37% operating margin. Our Q1 tax rate was 27%, down from our full year 2015 tax rate of 40%. Our Q1 net income was approximately $1.5 billion or $0.52 per share.
In Q1, capital expenditures were $1.1 billion, more than double compared to Q1 of last year. Server purchases and data center construction were the largest contributors to year-over-year growth. New builds in Texas and Ireland, along with the expansion of existing facilities, will nearly double our current data center footprint when completed. In addition to servers and data centers, investments in office facilities also contributed to the year-over-year growth. We ended the quarter with $20.6 billion in cash and investments.
Turning now to the outlook. First, some color on revenue. We remain focused on creating value for the people and marketers who use our services. We expect that the main drivers of advertising revenue growth will continue throughout 2016, but we will face tougher comparables as the year progresses, given the accelerating ad revenue growth we experienced throughout 2015. 
Payments and other fees revenues will continue to face headwinds throughout the year given that the substantial majority of that revenue relates to payments from games played on personal computers. Even with the expected contribution from Oculus, we anticipate that our payments and other fees revenue for the full year 2016 will come in lower than the level in 2015.
Next, on to the expense outlook. Our expense guidance remains unchanged. We expect that full year 2016 total GAAP expense growth will be approximately 30% to 40%. We expect full year 2016 amortization expenses to be approximately $700 million to $800 million, and full year 2016 stock-based compensation expenses to be approximately $3.1 billion to $3.3 billion. 
If you take into account our GAAP expense guidance, as well as our amortization and FPC guidance, you'll see that our full year 2016 total non-GAAP expense growth guidance range remains unchanged at 45% to 55%. We anticipate full year 2016 capital expenditures to be at the high end of the $4 billion to $4.5 billion range we gave last quarter as we invest to support the rapid growth of the business. We expect our Q2 and full year 2016 tax rates to be similar to our Q1 rates.
In summary, 2016 is off to a great start for Facebook. Our results reflect healthy growth and engagement in our community, strength in our ads business and investments we're making to capitalize on the long-term opportunities we see ahead. 
Before going to questions, I wanted to touch briefly on the share reclassification that Mark discussed at the beginning of the call. As we disclosed in the proxy statement we filed today, our Board of Directors has approved a proposal for the reclassification of our capital stock that would involve the creation of a newly -- of a new class of publicly listed nonvoting Class C capital stock. 
Pending stockholder approval, we intend to issue 2 Class C shares as a one-time stock dividend for each outstanding Class A and Class B share, resulting in a tripling of the pre-reclassification total shares outstanding. All stockholders would be treated equally. 
The net effect of this transaction would be to establish 2 publicly traded classes of Facebook stock, one representing the current Class A shares and the other representing the nonvoting Class C shares. Since the Class C shares would have the same economic rights as the Class A and Class B shares, we would expect that after the payment of the stock dividend, the share price of the Class A common stock would generally reflect a 3-for-1 stock split.
This will have no effect on the voting interests related to shares that investors currently hold. As Mark mentioned, this structure will allow for the preservation of the voting structure that has served the company well to-date, while allowing for Mark to fund the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative over the course of his lifetime. Importantly, as part of this proposal, the preservation of the multi-class capital structure would be generally predicated on Mark continuing to maintain an active leadership role at Facebook. 
Let me talk about next steps. The reclassification would be conditioned on approval by a majority of outstanding votes held by company stockholders, and we anticipate a vote on the matter at our annual meeting to be held on June 20 this year. A record date for this dividend will be determined at a later day. 
With that, Chris, let's open up the call for questions."

SMBs or SMEs, as they're called in different places around the world, we think are a very core competitive advantage for us. It's prohibitively expensive for most small businesses to reach people digitally. 35% of small businesses in the United States, which is often the most advanced market, don't have a web presence at all. And setting up a mobile app, getting people to find and download a mobile app can be even more expensive. And so what's happening is that SMBs are turning to Facebook pages as their mobile solution. They're free, they're easy to set up, and they already know how to do them because almost all of them are already Facebook users in the first place. And so the onboarding has been incredibly important and incredibly attractive. We announced last year that we have over 50 million small business pages active on a monthly basis. 80% of those are active on mobile. We then work on helping them use our ad products and upsell them through our paid ads products as well. And we announced this quarter that we hit 3 million active advertisers on Facebook and 200,000 on Instagram. What's interesting is that, what you see is SMBs able to use the tools as some of the biggest brands in the world. There are over 2 million SMBs have posted a video, both paid and organic, in the last month, and that has to be many times the number of SMBs that have shot or placed a TV commercial. In terms of measurement, your question's important because it's not just getting them to use our platforms to connect to consumers, it's getting them to be able to measure our results. And so we've worked hard to build the measurement tools into the products, so that when you buy an ad, SMBs, in a very easy interface and decide what their goals are. Are their goals measuring sales? Are their goals to connect to their website? Are their goals mobile app downloads and then measuring all the way through, from showing that ad to the purchase? I continue and we continue to be very bullish on this channel because we have such a broad base of usage, because that usage is so active, and because we're very focused on investing in simplifying our products, so that all SMBs can use them."

Our growth was really broad-based, and we grew across all of our markets or segments this quarter. That's direct response, brands, SMB and developer. Our direct response business continues to be very strong. It's very ROI-focused and we continue to invest and roll out products that help people. So for example, lead ads, where people can fill out forms on a mobile device, take their content and put it up on Facebook. We rolled that out fully this quarter. And that enabled people to use Facebook in a very direct response way, and we'll continue to invest there. Video ads are really exciting. It's worth noting that video ads take the place of other not ad agencies, but not all of the revenues are incremental, but as consumer engagement with video has continued to grow, that creates more and more of an opportunity for video ads. Marketers have always loved video because it's a really compelling way to reach people. And this -- now, you can reach them on mobile all day with those kind of messages. Importantly, marketers have to adjust sometimes. While the 30-second ad does perform well in News Feed, we also see people understanding that some of the formats are different, creating shorter ads, creating ads that can work even without sound, more personal ads has really mattered. One example is Toyota used Facebook for the launch of the RAV4 Hybrid. With Sachi in Los Angeles, they used a very broad video to drive brand awareness. They've reached over 36 million people in their target demo within 3 days. Then, and this is where it gets even more interesting, they retargeted people who watched the video with over 500 personalized video ads that were optimized for Facebook and Instagram. So they were creating a direct response campaign to get people to take specific actions, like requesting a quote and finding a specific dealer.

So part of our playbook for building out these ecosystems at scale is we start with the person-to-person use case, right? So whether that's in messaging, if people are messaging their friends or Groups. In News Feed before that, it was people posting updates and then seeing what is going on with friends and the people that they care about. And then the next step is to create organic activity around public entities, right? So whether that's businesses, public figures -- I don't know like athletes, celebrities and types of folks that people want to interact with on these different platforms, we did that on Facebook and News Feed though pages, and we're working on a number of different ways to do that in Messenger. One of those is bots. And one of the good things about bots that we've seen is that it can increase -- or sorry, decrease the amount of time that you have to wait before you get a reply back from interaction with a message. So what we've seen, we've done some research on this. A lot of people every day, in Facebook today, are already messaging pages and businesses directly. And they -- the businesses respond. But what we've actually also found is that, through some of our AI research, we can look at the responses that businesses give to common questions and can confidently provide the right reply a lot of the time. And when we can do that, then that decreases the latency, and predictably, people want to do more of that activity. So that's one way that I think you're going to see bots work between people who are actually driving the businesses directly will need to, in some way, train or answer questions for people. But we can build artificial intelligence that can learn from people, how to automate a lot of that and make that experience a lot faster for people who want to interact with businesses and public figures. And you know, of course then, after you start building out that segment of businesses and public figures and the platform. Then on top of that, you have just a good amount of intent in these platforms to build a good business on top of that, that's kind of Stage 3."

They're a popular airline in China, but they don't really have -- they're not really as well known overseas. And before working with us, they really only invested in traditional media. They had a goal of promoting their new flight routes, including one from Mumbai to Beijing in their new aircraft. So the launched a campaign with us in 15 countries globally. They used the reach and frequency and Carousel and video ad targeting. And, for example, they would target in the U.S. age 18 and above, frequent international travelers, living in cities where they had roots or Indian expats living in the U.S. to promote their new route to Mumbai. They reached 30 million people globally, more than 95% on mobile. And here's the best part, they had a 73% sales lift in the United States.

So overall sharing is up across Facebook, and people are spending more time on Facebook and the whole family of apps. And that is not just the case for the aggregate of the growing community, but it's actually also the case on a per person basis as well, in terms of people sharing more and spending more time individually. Now one of the things that we see is that, the way that we are sharing is always changing, right? And some of this is because of underlying technical transitions. So, you know, on desktop, for example, it was easier to type, so we saw more text posts. In mobile, it's easier to take videos, so we see more videos. On desktop, people would have more commonly uploaded an album of photos that they took from their digital camera, and downloaded onto their computer, whereas on mobile the more common behavior is to take a single photo or a couple, and just post those. So there are all these transitions -- and that's our job, right, is to make it so that we build great tools that people, everyone around the world, can share anything that they want with everyone. Now the other thing that's also true is that people want to share with lots of different kinds of audiences. So Facebook gives you the ability to share with all of your friends, and publicly if you want, and with groups. But we're also investing in things like Messenger and WhatsApp, because a lot of people want to share, increasingly, messages, privately one-on-one or with very small groups. So in addition to Messenger, which is a 900 million people a month and WhatsApp, which is at more than 1 billion people a month. Facebook Groups is also at more than 1 billion people a month, which I think represents the increasing diversity of the different types of audiences that people want to share with. But ultimately, I think that -- humans have such a deep desire to express themselves and want to connect with the people around them that I think that all of these audiences and all of these different types of media should grow over time. And it's our job to basically make sure that we build good products, and get rid of all the bugs, and make it that their performance is fast and all the basic stuff works that way we get there. But in general, right now, all the high level trends look pretty positive on that. I think I'll kick it off to Dave to go through your questions about the -- some of the technical pieces about the reclassification."

And then, that's enabled us to show more of them without harming the user experience at all. So that's been really key. Over time, we would expect that ad load growth will be a less significant factor driving overall revenue growth, but we remain confident that we've got opportunity to grow supply through the continued growth in people and engagement on Facebook, as well as on our other apps such as Instagram. On the question regarding what would happen to Mark's shares if he were to leave Facebook, I would -- I just kind of refer that the new multiclass capital structure is generally dependent on Mark continuing to maintain an active leadership role at Facebook.

And the basic theory that we have is that there are a small number of services that are going to be ubiquitous utilities that 1 billion or 2 billion or more people are going to want to use, right? So that's kind of core basic messaging, right? The core functionality around having your real identity and connecting with all of your real friends and family online. Those are things that we think are going to be ubiquitous. And we want to build those. At the same time, we also think that there are going to be many, many good businesses, and different other social use cases, where there are people doing good work and building different companies that we feel no need to own those things. So when I think -- and people come up from time to time and suggest to us, should we buy this company or that, you know what we look at are, what are the things that we think are going to be ubiquitous tools, and who are the most talented people in the world to build this? And so when you think about something like virtual and augmented reality, that's how we thought about that. This is -- those are going to be important platforms over time. It's very early, obviously, we're going to take a long time to get there. And a lot of what we felt like we were buying there was a critical mass of the best people and the best technology to go do all the things that we needed to go do over the next 10 years to drive that home and turn that into a big platform. And you asked a question about virtual and augmented reality, what are going to be the big use cases? I mean, for the first few years of virtual reality, I think gaming and video are going to be the big one, right. I mean the initial market that we look at are all the people who have Xbox and PlayStations that we use, right. The people who are excited to have an immersive media experience sitting in their living room for a long period of time. And that's a pretty big market. And even though that's not all of what we hope to eventually serve, and that's not the full potential of these new platforms, I think that is one case where you can obviously deliver better and richer experiences than what you can with the current generation of technology. Video is going really well. I shared a stat before in some of my comments that on Gear VR alone, we're now at more than 2 million hours of video have been watched in from the platform, so that's really exciting. And that, of course, will be bolstered by the fact that these new kind of 360 videos can not only be watched in VR, so in the headsets, but we're building tools that you can share them on News Feed and through our products elsewhere as well. So I think that's exciting, over time there will be even more, but that I should be enough to have some initial use. But again, I do want to reemphasize, this is early and it's going to take a long time. And as you know there's a lot of hype around this, and we're just focused on building this to be very good over the long term."

We've seen great examples of Audience Network really improving people's results. A recent one is eBay Vivanuncios, which is an online real estate destination, working in Latin America and Mexico. When they were using a combination of Facebook, Instagram and the Audience Network, they saw a 57% lower cost per install with place and optimization and 59% more volume, versus running on Facebook alone, which led to 6% incremental revenue.

So in the basic human senses like seeing, hearing, language, kind of core thing is that we do. I think it's possible to get to the point in the next 5 to 10 years where we have computer systems that are better than people at each of those things. That doesn't mean that the computers will be thinking, or be generally better, but that is useful for a number of things. So for example, I talked about earlier, we are building this moments app, so that way, you can take photos on your phone and if you use this app, our face recognition can look at the photos that you take and suggest that you might want to share photos that you took with a friend of them, with that person, right. So that way, all the photos that might be of you and your friends' camera rolls, they can share with you. Another example is just spam filtering, right, and just making sure that we can actually read the content and understand what's interesting to you or not, and not show that. One obvious thing, I think over time, is if you just look at the way that we rank News Feed. Today, we use some basic signals like who you're friends with, and what pages you like, as some of the most important things for figuring out what, out of all of the millions and millions of pieces of content that are on Facebook, what we're going to show, and what are going to be the most interesting things to you. And you know, that's because today, our systems can't actually understand what the content means. We don't actually look at the photo and deeply understand what's in it or look at the videos and understand what's in it or read the links that people share and understand what's in them. But in the future, we'll be able to, I think, on a 5- or 10-year period. So all of these millions and millions of pieces of content that are out there, whether or not you've added someone as a friend or have liked a page, we'll be able to know a lot better, what types of things are going to be interesting to you to produce a much better feed of content. So that's how just some basic example of where having a human level perception broadly is going to yield better experiences and a lot of the things that people care about today."

But for brands, we're seeing -- where promotion, transaction and support capabilities for businesses are all deepening within Facebook. Therefore, should we be thinking about a longer-term transition from a platform that's basically all ads to something where more marketplace capability is offered, given that buyers and those sellers are so known and so connected? And if so, can we think about Facebook starting to monetize, maybe on a transaction basis or even through various customer support capabilities via the messaging tools, AI, et cetera that you're beginning to offer businesses. So maybe if you could just kind of provide a little bit of color on how you see that evolution, that would be great."

We're also testing some incremental features in pages, which enable businesses to drive purchases on a page or direct people directly to their website. These are really early, but we've had some positive feedback. Our focus, however, continues to be on our ad products because we think we can take people all the way from the top of the funnel, where they can really get a brand awareness or product awareness, and go all the way down to purchase. Not necessarily because the purchase is happening on Facebook, but because we can work on the measurement system to understand how the advertising, both at the top and lower down in the funnel, is influencing those purchases. We've been really excited by what we've seen in the commerce vertical of our ad products. There products like dynamic product ads, carousel ads are working really well for us. This quarter, we launched Canvas ads, which are very fast-loading immersive mobile ads. They're easy to build, you can use a self-service tool. You don't have to write any code. They are native format, so they decrease that initial drop off you see when people click off to another site. Very early days, but the average viewing time is over 30 seconds, which shows how immersive that is. I'll share one example of how ads are driving a small business on Facebook through ads, which is a company called Sparkle in Pink. They're a Utah-based SMB, they're selling girls' clothing. They did a slide show ad that included a Shop Now button, which enabled you to take action on their site. They were able to increase sales by 9% per month. And more exciting for us, this was 6x more efficient in terms of acquisitions than any other digital media channel. And that shows how you can use our ad products to go all the way from awareness, measuring through to a sale, and show how important our ads can be to commerce on our platform."

We are not rolling out any monetization products on WhatsApp right now, but we did start that process at F8 on Messenger. And what we're doing is following the organic activity that's happening on the Messenger platform. Businesses and consumers are using Messenger to connect to each other in a more personal, more immediate way. And we rolled out a platform data, which gives new opportunities to build compelling experiences. Bots, very early, but giving the opportunity for more personal interactions between businesses and mobile. They tend to [ph] receive API so that businesses could send immediate responses to common questions, including engaging images and call to action as well as text. In terms of the timing, this is really early. We have a lot of opportunity to invest in advertising across our different platforms. And so we want to make sure we get this right, as we focus on continued engagement. You're right that over time, when we make these investments, we are going to be able to rely on some of the core aspects of the ads infrastructure. Certainly, our long ad -- our base of advertisers, some of the things that we understand about how ads perform and the functionality, will be an important part of the product offerings in the future. But those are not immediate by any stretch of the imagination."

But I wonder, do you think multiple platforms can succeed in live streaming over time, given the size of the market longer term? Or do you think it's more of a network effect business, where a vast majority of the traffic and economics will ultimately accrue to the leader in the live streaming space?"

I don't think this means that all of our expense comes and -- that all of our growth comes at the expense of any one channel, but it's broad-based. And often, TV and Facebook and Instagram can work really well together. I'll give a fun example from this Super Bowl. T-Mobile wanted to use their Super Bowl campaign to increase their brand awareness and increase their reach. So before the game, they targeted their 30-second Super Bowl ad that featured Drake to NFL and people with NFL and celebrity interest. It performed so well that they decided to run a 60-second version on Facebook and Instagram. That ad was so successful on Facebook and Instagram that they then ran the 60-second ad on TV, instead of their 30-second ad. So as people invest, they can use these different platforms together, and we're pretty excited to see that progress."

And I think that, that's a huge opportunity, not just in live video but in a lot of the things that we're talking about. And one interesting example recently, that I touched on earlier is, between Messenger and WhatsApp, we're around 60 billion messages a day. And sorry -- sorry, SMS at its peak, we think, was around 20 billion messages a day. And just unlocking some of the friction that existed in SMS and improving the product a little bit, and removing the small fee that was there has just unlocked a huge amount of expression. And we think that this is going to be the case in all different types of media and with all different audiences that a person would share with. So in video, there are billions and billions of videos that are viewed every day on Facebook. Live is a very small part of it. The reason why we give disproportionate attention to it, is because we're trying to help push forward new formats that are not just about consuming content but are really about interacting. So Live, 360 video and there'll be others in the future. And so, yes, I mean, to answer your question, I do think that multiple products and companies can succeed in building these things. I also think that there are going to be a lot more interactive forms of video than just Live and 360, like we're talking about now. And I think that this extends not just to video but for all of the different types of media and audiences that we're serving. So we are -- we're very excited about continuing to do our work, to help unlock all the expression and connection that people want to do."

We had another good quarter in the first half of the year. Our community continues to grow around the world. 1.7 billion people now use Facebook every month and 1.1 billion people use it every day. Our business is growing at a healthy rate as well. Total revenue grew by 59% year-over-year to $6.4 billion and advertising revenue was up 63% to $6.2 billion.
Our results show our progress as we work to make the world more open and connected across our 3-, 5- and 10-year horizons. Over the next 3 years, we're focused on continuing to build our community and help people share more of what matters to them. The next 5 years are about building our newer products into full ecosystems with developers and business. And over the next 10 years, we're working to build new technologies to help everyone connect in new ways. 
I'll give an update on our progress across each of these areas, starting with how we're working to deliver better experiences for our community and more ways for people to share more what they care about with anyone they want.
We continue to see excellent growth in our community. Over the past year, we've added over 200 million people using Facebook on a monthly basis. And in the second quarter, time spent per person increased double-digit percentages year-over-year across Facebook, Instagram and Messenger and that doesn't even include WhatsApp yet. 
One of the biggest opportunities to grow our community is in developing countries where connectivity is less advanced than what we take for granted here at home. So over the past couple of years, we've been making steady improvements to our apps to make them work regardless of the device or connection that people are using. We've also built a lightweight version of our Android app called Facebook Lite that's tuned to work on 2G networks and is now used by more than 100 million people. 
We're also working on new tools to help people express themselves and understand what's going on with the people they care about. Ten years ago, most of what we shared and consumed online was text. Now it's photos and soon, most of it will be videos. 
We see a world that is video-first, with video at the heart of all of our apps and services. Over the past 6 months, we've been particularly focused on Live video. Live represents a new way to share what's happening in more immediate and creative ways. This quarter, Candace Payne's Chewbacca mask video was viewed almost 160 million times. Live is also changing the way we see politics as news organizations and delegates go live from the Republican and Democratic conventions. And we've seen in Minnesota and Dallas how Live can shine a light on important moments as they happen.
This quarter, we also launched 360 Photos. You don't need a special camera to take them. You just take a panorama or use a 360 camera app on your phone and post it. And since we launched, more than 4 million 360 photos have been shared on Facebook with 1 million more being shared every week. 
We're making good progress on core services within the Facebook app like Search. A growing way that people use Search is to find what people are saying about a topic across the more than 2.5 trillion posts in our network. Now people are doing more than 2 billion searches a day between looking up people, businesses and other things that they care about. Continuous, steady improvement of services like Search are an important part of helping people connect and realizing our mission.
We're also improving the experience for our community by building our business with more engaging ads. We've always emphasized the importance of measurement and value in driving real results for the businesses that use Facebook, and that means helping them create more relevance and engaging ads. 
Over the next 5 years, we are working hard to build ecosystems around some of our newer products. Instagram now has more than 500 million monthly actives, with more than 300 million daily. Now we're working to make that experience even more engaging. Recently, Instagram began to rank its feed, because we know that people have a better experience when they see more of the stories they care about. We're already seeing a positive impact in terms of time spent and the amount of content that people are sharing. We've also introduced our advertising tools on Instagram, and we're seeing marketers engage with people in creative and innovative ways. 
In the 2 years since we separated Messenger from the main Facebook app, which was a pretty controversial decision at the time, we've improved performance and given people new ways to express themselves. And now, for the first time, more than 1 billion people are using Messenger every month. 
I'm also happy with the updates we're making to WhatsApp which also has a community of more than 1 billion people. This quarter, we launched new desktop apps and end-to-end encryption and millions of people are using WhatsApp's voice calling features. 
The scale we've achieved with our messaging services makes it clear that they are more than just a way to chat with friends. That's why we're also making it easier for people to connect with groups and businesses as well. We're going to keep focusing on this over the next several years.
I'm also excited about the early progress we're making on our 10-year initiative. We're investing in new technologies to give more people a voice, including, of course, the 4 billion people around the world who aren't yet online. And we're helping more people take advantage of the opportunities that come with the Internet.
We're still early in our journey with lots of hard work ahead, but we're making good progress. Like the first successful flight of Aquila, our solar-powered aircraft that will beam Internet to places that have never been connected. Eventually, we're going to work with telecom operators and governments around the world to connect people on the outskirts of cities, rural areas and disaster zones, where you can't get traditional connectivity today. 
We've also been making progress with our initiatives around artificial intelligence and virtual reality. This quarter, we announced DeepText, a deep learning-based engine that can understand the context of several thousand posts per second across 20 different languages. This is a long-term project but it also has some near-term benefits like helping show people more of what they want to see and filtering out less of what they don't want to see. 
We're also investing in new platforms to help people connect and share. We believe that virtual reality can help people share richer experiences and help everyone understand what's going on around the world. It's really early for us in VR but we're hitting some important milestones. As of the second quarter, more than 1 million people a month are now using Oculus on mobile phones through our Gear VR partnership with Samsung. More than 300 apps are already available at the Oculus store for Gear VR. We've filled all of our preorders for Oculus Rift and we're seeing increasing demand from retail as stores plan for the holidays. While it's still early for augmented reality, we're doing AR research and are seeing lightweight versions of AR technology in mobile apps like MSQRD.
So that's a recap of the progress that we're making in our 10-year plan. We have a saying at Facebook that our journey is only 1% done. And while I'm happy with our progress, we have a lot more work to do to grow our community and connect the whole world. That means making big investments and taking risks, focusing not just on what Facebook is but on what it can be. 
I want to thank everyone in our community, all of our teams, our partners and our shareholders for being a part of this journey with us. 
And now, here's Sheryl."

We had a great second quarter. Q2 ad revenue grew 63%. Mobile ad revenue reached $5.2 billion, up 81% year-over-year and was approximately 84% of total ad revenues. Our growth was broad-based across verticals, marketer segm",1020,"Thanks, Mark, and hi, everyone. We had a great second quarter. Q2 ad revenue grew 63%. Mobile ad revenue reached $5.2 billion, up 81% year-over-year and was approximately 84% of total ad revenues. Our growth was broad-based across verticals, marketer segments and regions.
We're excited to announce that we now have 60 million monthly active business pages on Facebook. We also continue to grow the number of active advertisers on our platform. This shows that both our free and paid products are providing value to marketers of all sizes around the world. 
We continue to focus on our 3 priorities: capitalizing on the shift to mobile; growing the number of marketers using our ad products; and making our ads more relevant and effective. 
First, capitalizing on the shift to mobile. For 32 years, the advertising industry has gathered in Cannes to celebrate creativity. People have shifted to mobile and marketers know they need to catch up. Mobile is no longer a nice to do, it's a must do, and we're working closely with marketers to help them make this transition. 
The best marketers understand that people watch video differently in mobile feeds. The goal is to create what we think of as thumb-stopping creative; videos that grab attention in the first few seconds even without sound. For example, to drive awareness for Sour Patch Kids gum, Mondelez targeted teams with non-chocolate candy interests. Working with VaynerMedia, CARAT and the Facebook Creative Shop, they created punchy, 10-second looping videos tailored for Facebook and Instagram. The campaign helped the Sour Patch Kids portfolio beat sales benchmarks for the entire candy industry.
We're excited to bring more relevant video ads to people both on and off Facebook. In May, we expanded Audience Network to include video for brand objectives. This means that advertisers can place video, brand video ads not just on Facebook and Instagram, but across a network of apps and sites. 
Our second priority is growing the number of marketers using our ad products. Over 1/3 of small and medium businesses in the U.S. don't have a website, and having a mobile presence is even more difficult and expensive. Creating a business page on Facebook is as easy as setting up a personal profile. This is why Facebook pages are the novel solution for many of the 60 million businesses using our products each month in the U.S. and around the world. 
We've made it easy for business owners to manage their Facebook page from their mobile device. Over 85% of active business pages use mobile and 40% of active advertisers have created a Facebook ad on their mobile device. In Q2, we rolled out new tools to make it easier for businesses to promote posts and track performance directly from the Instagram app. 
We've worked hard to make becoming an advertiser as easy as possible for these businesses. With just a few steps and for as little as a few dollars, businesses can boost their posts to reach more people. Simplifying our ad products is key to advertiser acquisition. Over 80% of new advertisers in Q2 started with simplified products like boosted posts. 
Once these businesses begin advertising with us, we make it easy for them to take advantage of even our most sophisticated capabilities. For example, Lighting Etc., a third-generation family-owned business, used Facebook and Instagram ads to drive in-store sales. They targeted 25- to 45-year-old homeowners interested in interior design, living within 35 miles of their showroom in Fort Worth, Texas. 
It was striking to them that on Facebook, the size of our community meant that they can reach over 300,000 people even with such specific targeting. They've seen a 40% increase in revenue in 2016 and they attribute this increase to their ads on Facebook and Instagram.
Our third priority is making our ads more effective and relevant. Our goal is to help our clients grow their businesses, whether it be moving products off shelves, driving online sales or building their brands. Our system constantly looks for the most efficient and effective way to drive these objectives. 
Businesses that want to build their brands need to reach a large audience with a compelling story, and they're seeing strong results from immersive formats like Video and Canvas ads. Businesses working to acquire new customers need to reach high-quality leads and convert them to action. We introduced lead ads in Q1 to make it easy for people to fill out forms on mobile devices right from News Feed. In Q2, we made it possible for advertisers to retarget people who opened or completed a lead ad form. 
For example, Nissan Turkey and the SEM agency used lead ads to collect over 20,000 high-quality leads from people interested in buying a new car. They then used retargeting to show relevant ads to people who had completed these lead ads and ultimately drove vehicle sales. The cost of a high-quality lead was 9.3x lower on Facebook than all other online media.
Businesses selling products are getting search-like ROI from Dynamic Ads. Dynamic Ads allow advertisers to upload their product catalogs and target people with specific products in real time. Over 300 million people see Dynamic Ads each month and over 2.5 billion unique products have been uploaded by marketers. In Q2, we expanded Dynamic Ads to Instagram and also launched Dynamic Ads for travel. For example, you can now advertise specific destinations and dates for hotel rooms.
We're pleased with the value we're driving for our partners and the progress we're making across our 3 priorities. With only a small fraction of our 60 million business pages advertising, we have a lot of opportunity ahead. We also have a lot of hard work to do to help businesses make the shift to mobile and to drive results for our clients. 
I want to thank our clients around the world for their partnership and their ongoing input which informs our product development. I also want to congratulate our global teams on the results of their hard work and thank them for their dedication to our mission. 
Thanks, everyone, and now here's Dave."

Total revenue grew 59% to $6.4 billion and we generated over $2 billion in free cash flow. These results highlight the continued growth and engagement of our global community and the strength of our ads business as advertisers benefit from our increasingly broad and deep portfolio of targeting creative and measurement tools. 
Let's start with our community metrics. This past quarter was our strongest quarter in over 3 years in terms of absolute year-over-year growth of monthly and daily actives on Facebook. In June, 1.13 billion people used Facebook on an average day, up 17% compared to last year. This daily number represents 66% of the 1.71 billion people who visited Facebook in the month of June. 
Mobile continued to drive our growth, with over 1 billion people accessing Facebook via mobile devices on an average day in June, up 22% compared to last year. The growth of our other services also continues to be strong. WhatsApp and Messenger now each have over 1 billion monthly actives and Instagram surpassed 500 million.
Turning now to the financials. My comments today will focus on our GAAP financial metrics and all of our comparisons are on a year-over-year basis unless otherwise noted. A reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial metrics is included in our press release and earnings slides.
Total Q2 revenue was $6.4 billion, up 59%. Q2 ad revenue was $6.2 billion, up 63%. Exchange rates did not impact our overall revenue growth rates this quarter as headwinds in certain currencies were offset by tailwinds in others. U.S. and Canada and Asia Pacific were our fastest-growing regions, with advertising growth rates of 69% and 67%, respectively. Mobile ad revenue was $5.2 billion, up 81% and representing approximately 84% of total ad revenue.
Let's turn to the supply and demand factors that continue to drive our growth. Advertiser demand was particularly strong in Q2 across a broad range of verticals and advertiser objectives. Additionally, supply-side factors, including growth in users, time spent and ad load, all contributed to our Q2 revenue growth.
In Q2, the average price per ad increased 9%, while total ad impressions increased 49%. The reported increase in price was again driven by the continued mix shift towards mobile where we only show higher-priced News Feed ads compared to the mix of News Feed ads and lower-priced right-hand column ads on personal computers.
The 49% increase in total ad impressions was driven primarily by growth in ad impressions served in Facebook's mobile News Feed, where the majority of our ads are shown. 
Payments and other fees revenue was $197 million, down 8%. Remember that payments and other fees revenue is largely generated from games played on personal computers which has declined as people spend less time on their PCs.
Q2 total expenses were $3.7 billion, up 33%, inclusive of $825 million of share-based compensation-related expenses, as well as $193 million of amortization of intangible assets. 
Q2 operating income was $2.7 billion, representing a 43% operating margin. We continue to be pleased with the profitable growth of the business while we invest for the long term.
We ended Q2 with approximately 14,500 employees, up 32% year-over-year. We added about 900 employees in the quarter, with the majority of those in technical functions. We are seeing continued success with our efforts to hire top talent in a market that remains very competitive.
Our Q2 tax rate was 26%. GAAP net income was approximately $2.1 billion or $0.71 per share. Q2 capital expenditures were $1 billion. Year-to-date, capital expenditures totaled $2.1 billion, driven by investments in data centers, servers, office buildings and network infrastructure. Facebook generated over $4 billion in free cash flow in the first half of 2016 and as of June 30, we had over $23 billion in cash and investments.
Turning now to the outlook. First, some color on revenue. We have been pleased with the strength of our advertising revenue in the first half of 2016. As I discussed on our last call, while we expect the main drivers of our advertising revenue growth will continue throughout 2016, we will face tougher comparables as the year progresses, given the accelerating revenue growth rates we experienced in the second half of 2015. Consequently, we anticipate lower advertising revenue growth rates in each successive quarter in 2016. 
Additionally, we anticipate ad load on Facebook will continue to grow modestly over the next 12 months and then will be a less significant factor driving revenue growth after mid-2017.
Since ad load has been one of the important factors in our recent strong period of revenue growth, we expect the rate at which we are able to grow revenue will be impacted accordingly. 
Turning now to expenses. Based on our updated view of the remainder of the year, we are tightening our expense guidance ranges. We expect that full year 2016 total GAAP expense growth will be approximately 30% to 35%, narrowed from our prior range of 30% to 40%. We expect full year 2016 amortization expenses to be approximately $700 million to $800 million and full year 2016 stock-based compensation-related expenses to be approximately $3.1 billion to $3.3 billion. 
Accordingly, we anticipate that our total non-GAAP expenses which exclude stock-based compensation and amortization, will grow in the range of 45% to 50%, narrowed from our prior range of 45% to 55%. We anticipate full year 2016 capital expenditures will be approximately $4.5 billion, as we invest to support the rapid growth of our business. Finally, we expect that our Q3 and full year 2016 tax rates will be similar to our Q2 rates.
In summary, Q2 was another great quarter for Facebook, illustrated by the strong growth and engagement of our global community and continued broad-based strength of our ads business. We're pleased with the results and we will continue to invest in order to best position Facebook for our long-term growth opportunities. 
With that, Chris, let's open up the call for questions."

One on the video platform going forward and how you think about video as a distribution mechanism. How should we think about investments that need to be made in video on both the technical infrastructure side, as well as the sourcing of content type to sort of broaden out the video offering over the next couple of years? And then maybe on the last comment on ad load, just wanted to go back to that for a minute in terms of what you're seeing on ad load by region, because we are seeing a widening gap in revenue per user between U.S. and Canada and the rest of the world. How much of that might be driven by ad load or ad products?"

I can take the question on video distribution as it relates to CapEx and the ad load question and then maybe on the sourcing of content, I'll pass it back to Sheryl. So on the video platform, clearly from an investment perspective, you've seen us step up our CapEx this year pretty substantially, and that's baked into the guidance of $4.5 billion of CapEx which if you'll recall, is at the high end of our prior range. We are investing across our infrastructure to prepare ourselves for growth across all of our different services, and a part of that investment is really to support video. That is -- it's definitely more taxing on the network and we're investing heavily on the network side. And as well, it does also impact our overall needs within the data center servers and the like. So it's certainly an area that we're investing in heavily and we expect to be investing in heavily going forward, Eric. And then on the ad load question, ad load is not something that varies that dramatically by region. So you're really looking at a number of factors. Really, what's driving that is just the dispersion of overall ad demand across region, and we're seeing really good strength across the globe on that front. But ad load is not a big driver of discrepancies in ARPU that you see. That's really something that maps very closely to the size of the mobile ad markets per population in those countries. So it's not an ad load question. And then I'll hand it over to Sheryl to talk about video on a -- from a content perspective."

On the DAU and MAU front, a couple of things. One is DAU and MAU are up sequentially and year-over-year in all regions and with trends that are largely consistent with past quarters, so really good, strong growth across the globe on a DAU to MAU ratio. We don't use specific breakdowns of those metrics by demographic. We're obviously pleased with our overall level of growth and engagement. On the teen front, younger users, we continue to be the best way to reach the largest global audience of teens and millennials. Teens remain very -- remain engaged on Facebook. Clearly, how they've used our service has evolved over the years. And in addition to Facebook, they're using Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp. So from a teen perspective, that's some color there. On the ad load front, ad load is definitely up from where we were a few years ago. It's been an important driver of inventory growth. And really, I think one of the things that's enabled us to grow ad load has been improving the quality and the relevance of the ads as you mentioned. And we've been able to do that without negatively impacting user experience. We do expect that ad load will be a less significant factor driving overall growth, especially after mid-2017. The optimal ad load is really a mix of art and science. We've carefully tracked the impact of ads on the user experience over the last several years. We aren't seeing a cause for concern. We also want to be thoughtful about making sure that each person's overall feed experience has the right balance of organic and ad content, and that factors into how we think about ad load and where that might ultimately be. And that's really why we're talking about our expectation that as you get into mid-2017, ad load will not be a big factor in driving overall inventory growth. We still see the opportunity to grow inventory from the growth of people and engagement on Facebook as well as our other services like Instagram. Instagram does have a lower ad load than Facebook."

We had especially strong growth in APAC and the U.S. and Canada, so that was part of the growth. In terms of our marketer segments from brands to direct response to SMBs to developers, the growth is really strong there as well. We're really excited today to announce that we have 60 million small business pages that are using Facebook on a monthly basis. And we're very focused on the opportunity to upsell them to advertising products. I think we have a good track record there. We're also seeing a lot of strength in brands and I think that's because we have a combination of the creative and the storytelling, so the art with the science of the targeting. And when people do that well together, you see great opportunities. So to share one example, Jack in the Box use our canvas ads which are very immersive ads, they're really good for a brand experience, to roll out a new menu item, their Double Jack burger. They worked with agencies Horizon, David&Goliath and Adaptly and they targeted millennials on Facebook to create 2 different custom audience groups. One group was customers who had visited the restaurant web page or engaged with previous video ads. And the second group were people that hadn't engaged with them directly but were quick-service restaurant purchasers. They had an average view rate of 23 seconds across those canvas ads, so clearly, people were very engaged in the brand experience of the ad. And they had a 13-point lift in ad recall and a 9-point lift in purchase impact. And so I think what you're seeing is that across all of the objectives people have from brands, marketers to direct response, to SMB to developers, as our ad products get more sophisticated, our targeting and measurement get better, they have an increased opportunity to grow and that's why we think our growth to date continues to be broad-based."

So I'll talk about sharing and then I think Dave can probably talk about ad load and pricing. So the overall level of sharing is up on Facebook and what we're seeing is that how people share is evolving as we move from desktop to mobile, right. So you can imagine more photos on people's mobile cameras, fewer long photo albums, more ability to capture video, probably a little bit harder to type on mobile, so there's this evolution. The other thing that we see is that now, people have tools to share more privately as well. So when you think about sharing on Facebook, you shouldn't just think about the kind of sharing that you'd see a News Feed, right, so sharing with all your friends, sharing in Groups on Facebook and public sharing which are the trends that I was just talking about. But another area that's growing incredibly quickly is private messaging, right, where between Messenger and WhatsApp, I think we're around 60 billion messages a day which I think is something like 3x more than the peak of global SMS traffic. So that is something that's growing pretty quickly and that we're really excited about as well. And we're just going to continue working on giving people the best tools across the spectrum from private to public and across the spectrum from text-based and simple communication to richer type of media like photos, videos and then eventually, more immersive forms like VR."

And getting the balance and mix right is important and clearly, how the pricing plays out is via the auction. And we've had a good balance of demand growth and supply growth and that's led to our good strong financial results and our ability to deliver very strong ROI to advertisers. So we think we're in a good zone on the right ad load, and we do think there's opportunities to grow that modestly. But as we look forward into 2017, we think it will be a less significant factor driving inventory growth. But we still think there's opportunities to drive inventory through user growth and time spent. I don't think we would think about necessarily dropping ad load to drive pricing. We're also very cognizant of providing good value to advertisers and getting that balance right is important to driving overall ROI as well as obviously, providing better targeting and measurement tools for our advertisers."

So I'd say we're around the second phase of that in Search now. We have a pretty big navigational use case where people look up people and pages and groups that they want to get to and look at and search. One of the big growing use cases that we're investing a lot in is looking up the content in the ecosystem, and that is an area that we're very excited about which helps people find more content. But certainly, there's a reasonable amount of behavior in there which is looking for things that over time could be monetizable or commercial intent. And at some point, we will probably want to work on that but we're still in the phase of just making it easier for people to find all the content they want and connect with businesses organically."

And what we're starting to see is that people are using Facebook, Instagram and Audience Network to drive their objectives in a cohesive way. So to share an example, Garmin launched the fenix 3 Sapphire watch and they did it with video ads on Facebook that worked without sound. They targeted outdoor enthusiasts then retargeted people who viewed the Instagram videos with carousel ads on Facebook that highlighted the product features. Then they extended those ads on Audience Network to maximize reach, and they used the Facebook pixel to measure the incremental sales and got to a 9.7x return on ad sales. So that's a really good example of how you can take targeting and the ability to target across Audience Network, Facebook and Instagram and drive people all the way down the funnel. And we think more and more people will do that, particularly as we do a better job of combining the interfaces. So for example, you can buy now in 1 interface on Facebook, Instagram and Audience Network."

That said, we are pleased by what's happened on Facebook for the elections -- for the election cycle, not just on the pay side but actually on the organic side as well. We really see Facebook being embraced by politicians all over the world to get in touch with their constituents, and we're pleased with that. Every member of Congress right now has a Facebook presence and we're seeing people like one example is Elise Stefanik, she's the youngest person in the Congress. She made a pledge when she was elected that she would explain every vote she takes and she explains every vote she takes on Facebook. With shorter explanations if they're not controversial but longer explanations, that's the kind of mission-based work we're happy about because it brings people closer to the people who are representing them. We don't break out how many advertisers are advertising on the Audience Network but we're seeing solid and growing adoption of the Audience Network across the board as we are with Instagram. And we think all of these platforms together really help give us the ability to serve our clients in a very leveraged way and use the targeting and measurement capabilities we've invested in across multiple platforms."

And basically, what -- the way to think about this is that even if a lot of your friends come from the same kind of background or of the same political or religious beliefs, if you know a couple hundred people, there's a good chance that even maybe a small percent, maybe 5% or 10% or 15% of them will have a different viewpoints which means that their perspectives are now going to be shown in your News Feed. And if you compare that to traditional media where people will typically pick a newspaper or a TV station that they want to watch and just get 100% of the view from that, people are actually getting exposed to much more different kinds of content through social media than they would have otherwise or have been in the past. So it's a good sounding theory and I can get why people repeat it, but it's not true. So I think that that's something that if folks read the research that we put out there, then they'll see that.

So we don't think it would be a good experience in News Feed, right. Because a lot of when people are finding videos on Facebook is you're scrolling through your News Feed, you're looking at what stories seem interesting to you which is why we did the autoplay videos so that rather than having to take an action, you can just start experiencing the video automatically and continue watching it if it's something that you're interested in. But if we started playing an ad in the middle of the feed before you got to the video, then that would really go against that. I think people would just watch a lot less of the organic videos that were posted because of that. But the important thing to keep in mind on this is we don't really -- we don't need to do pre-rolls because our model is not one where you come to Facebook to watch one piece of content. You come to look at a feed and putting the ads in between the stories is a much more effective way to do it and better for the user experience."

F8 was the big announcement there and I think since then, I think we've announced -- we have more than 10,000 bots in the system, which are basically making it so that different businesses can build automated ways to communicate with people. The way we think about this experience is that qualitatively, I don't know a single person really who wants to call a business to get support or interact with it, right. Whether that's trying to get a reservation for a restaurant or getting customer support our calling to buy something. And those are slow interactions, they're synchronous, they consume your whole attention while you're doing them. And if we can make it so that you can have some of those interactions in an automated way where you fire off a text and then just get a response back quickly but asynchronously so it doesn't take up your full attention, then I think that that's going to be a much better experience that people really enjoy and like. So we're in the experimentation phase, I think, with the platform. We're seeing a lot of good ideas getting tried out and I'm -- I personally enjoy a lot of the different bots that people are using or making, especially the news ones where you get these digests at the end of the day of different kinds of content. And between that and M which is kind of our own internal bot that we're building, I think that this is going to be an interesting area to watch and encourage more interaction between people and businesses in messaging."

And part of why I think you see this is that there are just so many different ways that people want to share, so many different kinds of content ranging from text, to photo, to video, to just richer and richer and more immersive content. And also, there's a range from private one-on-one type sharing to small groups, all your friends at once, large interest-based communities and then ultimately, fully public. And there are different apps that explore different regions of that space and do a good job with it and offer ideas that I think the whole market needs to learn from. Right now, the big theme and strategy that we're executing is we're going to become video-first. And what I mean by that is that this trend where 10 years back, most of what you saw and shared online was text. And then we went through a phase where most of it is photos and we really believe that in, call it, 5 years or whatever the period of time that it takes to get there, I think most of what people consume online is going to be video. And that means that there needs to be a whole range of new production tools and consumption experiences for enabling that. For production, I think that means that you need to get the camera experience and the experience for capturing and uploading videos that you've captured to be much better and a more central part of the experience. On consumption, there are innovations that we've had like autoplay in feed but what's the next version of that, that makes it so that people can have an even more native and default video experience when they're in News Feed, as well as private areas like Messenger and WhatsApp. So I think you're going to see this across all of our apps, more focused on producing this kind of content and making it first-class to consume as well, both in private and public context. And I think that that's just a big trend across the market and one of the big things that if we get right, I think it's going to unlock a lot of sharing and opportunity."

Instagram is clearly making a contribution and then as is the Audience Network. In terms of ad load, as I said, it's been one of the factors driving supply. It's certainly been helpful but there's also DAU growth and time spent per DAU growth, time spent per person, and we continue to feel that there are opportunities to execute on those and continue to grow inventory in that way. So that's where we would focus. As we drive DAU faster than MAU, then that's going to increase that ratio but we're really focused on driving DAU and time spent per person."
