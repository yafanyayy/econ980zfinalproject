As always, we appreciate your continued interest and investment in ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. On this conference call is Walt Hulse, Executive Vice President of Strategic Planning and Corporate Affairs; Derek Reiners, our Chief Financial Officer; Wes Christensen, Senior Vice President, Operations; Sheridan Swords, Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids; Kevin Burdick, Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Gathering and Processing; and Phill May, Senior Vice President, Natural Gas pipelines. Additional key financial and operational information has been updated in a short presentation and is posted on ONEOK's and ONEOK Partners' website.
Let's start by discussing ONEOK and ONEOK Partners accomplishments in 2015, then I'll hand it off to Derek for a financial update, and finish by reviewing our 2016 financial guidance, which we maintain for both ONEOK and ONEOK Partners in last night's release. 
Our uniquely positioned assets delivered higher ONEOK Partners fourth quarter and 2015 adjusted EBITDA in a very challenging market, and we delivered on our expectation to significantly grow natural gas and natural gas liquids volumes and earnings in the second half of the year. The partnership grew its adjusted EBITDA throughout the year by nearly 40% from the first quarter to the fourth quarter 2015, ending the year with $450 million in fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA. The partnership also improved its quarterly distribution coverage to 1.03x. These results were driven by a significant ramp in natural gas volumes gathered and processed across our system, especially in the Williston Basin as we connected more than 820 additional wells to capture more flared volumes from existing wells, completed 6 field compression projects and our Lonesome Creek natural gas processing plant and restructured several contracts earlier than expected. And in the Mid-Continent, volumes increased late in the year as a large producer customer completed wells that had been drilled earlier in the year.
The natural gas liquids segment, which is connected to more than 180 natural gas processing plants, continued to benefit from natural gas liquids processed volume growth in Williston Basin. 7 new third-party natural gas processing plants were connected in 2015. 
We also realized solid volume performance on our West Texas LPG pipeline system from our long-haul customers as we continue to provide quality service at a good value. With nearly 100% of its earnings fee-based, the natural gas pipelines segment had another solid year. This segment is taking advantage of incremental demands due to lower natural gas prices, through its uniquely positioned assets with the announcement of the Roadrunner Gas Transmission pipeline and Westex pipeline expansion serving growing markets in Mexico.
In 2015, we made significant progress toward reducing commodity risk in our business, which is expected to reduce earnings volatility over the long term. As a result, we expect 2016 fee-based earnings to be approximately 85%, a significant improvement from 66% in 2014. Drivers of this increase include drawing the fee-based exchange services volumes in the natural gas liquids segment and contract restructuring in the gathering and processing segment. 
The efforts of contract restructuring in the gathering and processing segment can be seen by the increase in our average fee rate. The average fee rate for the fourth quarter 2015 was $0.55, a nearly 60% increase compared with $0.35 in the first quarter 2015. 
At ONEOK, we remain committed to being a support of general partner as evidenced by the $650 million equity investment in the partnership in mid-2015, which we expect to result in increased distributions from ONEOK's higher ownership percentage in ONEOK Partners. Our extensive, integrated network of natural gas and natural gas liquids assets delivered solid results in 2015 and has positioned us well for 2016. 
That concludes my opening remarks. Derek?"

I'll start by highlighting the financial steps we took in 2015 and early 2016 that position us well for 2016 and into 2017.

I'll start by highlighting the financial steps we took in 2015 and early 2016 that position us well for 2016 and into 2017. 
With a high priority on maintaining the partnership's investment grade credit ratings, we took decisive steps to manage its balance sheet by high-grading its growth projects and reducing capital spending by nearly $1.6 billion in 2015 from our original 2015 capital guidance. We issued $750 million of equity in August, along with nearly $280 million of additional equity through the at-the market program during 2015, turned out $800 million of short-term debt in March and, most recently, entered into a $1 billion 3-year unsecured term loan, which effectively refinances the 2016 long-term debt maturities at a low cost. With the financial steps we've taken and the momentum and volume growth in earnings leading into 2016, we expect to achieve our 2016 financial guidance. 
At ONEOK Partners, we expect not to need public debt or equity issuances well into 2017, which includes no equity from the at-the-market equity program, to keep distributions flat for the year, deliver distribution coverage of 1x or better for 2016 and obtain GAAP debt to EBITDA ratio of 4.2x or less by late 2016.
At ONEOK, we expect to keep these dividends flat for the year, pay no cash income taxes in 2016 and generate approximately $160 million of free cash flow after dividends in 2016, which, along with $90 million of cash at the end of 2015, provides ONEOK with significant flexibility to support ONEOK Partners if needed.
For growth capital in 2016, we expect to spend $320 million in the gathering and processing segment and $70 million each in the natural gas liquids and natural gas pipelines segments, for a total of $460 million as previously guided. As producer needs evolve throughout the balance of the year and into 2017, we have the flexibility to significantly reduce growth capital, particularly in the gathering and processing segment, as we optimize our systems and available capacity.
Additionally, we have been able to realize reduced operating cost and capital costs from our service providers across our operations. We continue to control operating costs and have reduced contract labor. We expect this trend to continue into 2016. 
As it relates to maintenance capital expenditures, we take a conservative approach. We are extremely careful not to underestimate expenditures when establishing guidance. Spending for the integrity and reliability of our assets is very important to the partnership's success. Over the long term, our assets have operated very reliably as a result of this approach.
In 2015, a number of our large maintenance projects came in significantly under budget, especially the projects scheduled towards the second half of 2015, as service providers reduced cost and bid very aggressively due to market conditions.
On the topic of counterparty credit risk, we consider our credit exposure to be low across all 3 of our operating segments. The partnership had no single customer representing more than 10% of revenues and only 15 customers individually represented 1% or more of revenues. Additionally, of the top 10 customers, which represented 38% of revenue, 9 are investment grade or provide full credit support. Many of our top 10 customers are natural gas liquids segment customers comprise of large petrochemical and integrated oil companies. 
Taking a look at our credit profile within our 3 segments, where we consider investment grade as rated by the ratings agencies or comparable internal ratings or secured by letters of credit or other collateral. The natural gas pipelines segment received more than 85% of its 2015 revenue from investment grade customers who are primarily large electric and natural gas utilities. The natural gas liquids segment has limited credit exposure in its exchange service fee earnings as most contracts -- in most contracts the natural gas liquids are purchased and proceeds are remitted from the partnership to the liquids producer less of fee. And more than 80% of 2015 commodity sales were to investment grade customer. And finally, the gathering and processing segment's credit risk is limited, as in most contracts the partnership remits the proceeds under the percent-of-proceeds contracts to the producer net of ONEOK Partners share of those proceeds as well as the fees charged. 99% of the segment's 2015 downstream sales were to investment grade customers.
2015  results at both ONEOK and ONEOK Partners include the impact from noncash impairment charges totaling $264 million, primarily related to investments in the coal-bed methane area of the Powder River Basin. The partnership remains highly committed to maintaining our investment-grade credit ratings, having a solid balance sheet and ample liquidity to support our capital program, ending 2015 with $1.8 billion available on its credit facility. 
The partnership's GAAP debt to adjusted EBITDA on a run-rate basis is 4.1x, reflecting earnings growth during the year. 
Distribution coverage remains an important metric for us as well. Expect distribution coverage of 1x or better for 2016 by growing our cash flows through volume growth, cost savings and efficiency improvements. 
ONEOK, on a stand-alone basis, ended 2015 with over $90 million of cash and an undrawn $300 million credit facility. The partnership is advantaged by having a strong supportive general partner in ONEOK.
With a significant excess dividend coverage, ONEOK has the resources that may be used to further support the partnership if needed as it navigates these uncertain times. 
Terry, that concludes my remarks."

Let's walk through our 2016 financial guidance and key assumptions by segment. Starting with our largest segment, the natural gas liquids segment is expected to contribute $995 million in operating income and equity earnings in 2016. A",1259,"Thank you, Derek. Let's walk through our 2016 financial guidance and key assumptions by segment. 
Starting with our largest segment, the natural gas liquids segment is expected to contribute $995 million in operating income and equity earnings in 2016. Additionally, we expect the natural gas liquids volumes and earnings to be weighted towards the mid to second half of 2016. Approximately 90% of the expected earnings in this segment are fee-based from the exchange services and transportation businesses. We continue to expect the partnership's natural gas liquids volumes gathered to increase in 2016, primarily from Williston Basin natural gas liquids volume growth expected from our gathering and processing assets in the basin, including the expected connection of the Bear Creek plant and 1/3 party natural gas processing plant in 2016. Approximately 60% of the segment's natural gas liquids volumes gathered come from the Mid-Continent, with the majority of the gathered volume coming from third-party processing plants. Our unique natural gas liquids position in the Mid-Continent is similar to the position we have in the Williston, with the partnership's gathering and processing assets, as we are connected to most of the third-party plants in the region. We expect to continue to benefit from natural gas liquids volumes gathered through our West Texas LPG system, where nearly 26% of the segment's volume originates. The segment is connected to more than 60 natural gas processing plants in the Permian Basin and is expected to connect 1 additional plant in 2016 and we expect to receive the full benefit in 2016 of increased tariffs. 
Finally, we moved the completion of the Bakken NGL Pipeline expansion to the third quarter 2018 due to a slower expected rate of volume growth. The realigned timing of the expansion has no impact on financial or capital guidance for 2016.
Driving the earnings growth in the natural gas gathering and processing segment in 2016 is natural gas volume growth in the Williston Basin and enhanced margins due to the contract restructuring efforts. In the Williston, we expect to average 740 million cubic feet per day of natural gas gathered volume in 2016. Our gathered volumes early in the year had been very strong as we reached nearly 800 million cubic feet per day in February. The recently completed Lonesome Creek plant and compression projects have already added nearly 100 million a day of incremental volume to our system, most of which has come from capturing previously flared gas. We continue to have approximately 24 rigs operating in more than 500 drilled uncompleted wells on our dedicated acreage. Given this activity, we expect 250 to 350 new well connections to our system in 2016. To put the expected 2016 volume outlook into context, if every rig were to have stopped drilling on January 1, 2016 and we did not connect any new wells in 2016, we would expect an average gathered volume of 720 million cubic feet per day in 2016, slightly below our guidance for the Williston. Natural gas volume growth in 2016 will not reflect a pronounced second half ramp-up as we experienced in 2015. We do expect volumes to slightly decline through the summer until our 80 million cubic feet per day Bear Creek plant comes online, and we expect to capture an incremental 40 million cubic feet per day of gas currently flaring in Dunn County.
In the Mid-Continent, we continue to be in constant communication with our producer customers regarding their drilling and completion activity. And similar to the Williston, the Mid-Continent volume exited 2015 at a high rate. As I mentioned earlier, the segment did receive an early benefit from our contract restructuring efforts in the fourth quarter 2015. However, 2016 is expected to receive the full benefit of these efforts, and we expect another increase in the average fee rate in the first quarter 2016 from the $0.55 segment average in the fourth quarter 2015.
In the natural gas pipelines segment, 2016 earnings are expected to remain more than 95% fee-based, with more than 90% of the segment's transportation capacity and more than 75% of its natural gas storage capacity contracted for the year. The first phase of the Roadrunner Gas Transmission Pipeline is on schedule to be complete next month and is fully subscribed under 25-year firm demand charge fee-based commitments, with the second phase expected to be complete in the first quarter 2017. 
Before closing, I would like to discuss future demand growth for ethane, which we expect to be a significant opportunity for the natural gas liquids segment as we move through 2017 and 2018. Approximately 400,000 barrels per day of incremental ethane demand from New World scale petrochemical crackers is expected to come online by the third quarter of 2017 and nearly 164,000 barrels per day more by first quarter 2019. We expect this new demand combined with additional ethane exporting infrastructure to significantly reduce the ethane excess supply overhang and put upward pressure on ethane prices and bringing most natural gas processing plants into full ethane recovery some time in mid-2018. Nearly 1/3 of U.S. ethane or approximately 180,000 barrels per day is dedicated and connected to our natural gas liquids system but is currently not producing due to insufficient ethane demand. We are well positioned to transport and fractionate substantial incremental ethane volumes once the natural gas processing plants we are connected to transition into full ethane recovery in response to growing U.S. petrochemical demand. We expect little to no additional capital expenditures needed to bring this ethane onto our system as we already constructed the natural gas liquids infrastructure necessary to connect supply to the Gulf coast region. The total incremental adjusted EBITDA benefit to the partnership, if all of the natural gas processing plants we are connected to enter full ethane recovery, could be in the range of $200 million per year. With the natural gas liquids segment's unique and extensive asset position, we can deliver significant ethane supplies to the Gulf Coast markets from the Williston, Mid-Continent and Permian Basins. 
Since we issued guidance in December, the commodity price environment has continued to be unstable and many of our producer customers have reduced their capital expenditure plans for 2016. While these challenges remain, we will continue to remain focused on serving our customers, reducing risks, controlling costs, managing our balance sheet prudently and reducing capital needs. As we have discussed on this call, more than 85% of the partnership's operating income and equity earnings comes from primarily fee-based activities underpinned by its large 37,000-mile integrated natural gas and natural gas liquids network with opportunities to grow its cash flows even in a lower capital spending environment. In 2016, we expect to finish the year within our financial guidance driven by our uniquely positioned assets. We are less than 60 days into 2016, and we expect, similar to 2015, opportunities and challenges throughout the year. We will be proactive in our approach to these opportunities and challenges and prudent in our decision-making, all while keeping in mind the long-term interest of our investors. 
I'd like to thank our employees across the country for their strong performance, hard work and dedication in 2015. Many of our employees have experienced these difficult industry cycles before, and they know what to do: manage costs, be efficient, be creative and operate safely and reliably, all while being focused on providing quality service to our customers. And many thanks to all of our stakeholders for your continued support of ONEOK and ONEOK Partners.

I can't tell you to what extent they may or may not be including ethane uplift. I suspect not much. But historically, they've understood and added back some credit, I think, for the capital spending over time. So what I think they look for is a track record of plan to continue to reduce leverage. And as I mentioned in my remarks, the GAAP debt to EBITDA of 4.1x on a run-rate basis is certainly supporting that we're headed in the right direction. And I think that the unique aspects of our footprint, the tailwinds in terms of volume that Terry mentioned in the Williston capturing the flared gas, those sorts of things I think all play into their thought process."

Additional key financial and operational information has been updated in a short presentation and is posted on ONEOK's and ONEOK Partners' websites. Let's start by discussing ONEOK and ONEOK Partners accomplishments in 2015, then I'll hand it off to Derek for a financial update, and finish by reviewing our 2016 financial guidance, which we maintained for both ONEOK and ONEOK Partners in last night's release. 
Our uniquely positioned assets delivered higher ONEOK Partners fourth quarter and 2015 adjusted EBITDA in a very challenging market, and we delivered on our expectation to significantly grow natural gas and natural gas liquids volumes and earnings in the second half of the year. The partnership grew its adjusted EBITDA throughout the year by nearly 40% from the first quarter to the fourth quarter 2015, ending the year with $450 million in fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA. The partnership also improved its quarterly distribution coverage to 1.03x. These results were driven by a significant ramp in natural gas volumes gathered and processed across our system, especially in Williston Basin, as we connected more than 820 additional wells, captured more flared volumes from existing wells, completed 6 field compression projects and our Lonesome Creek natural gas processing plant and restructured several contracts earlier than expected. And in the Mid-Continent, volumes increased late in the year as a large producer customer completed wells that had been drilled earlier in the year.
The natural gas liquids segment, which is connected to more than 180 natural gas processing plants, continued to benefit from natural gas liquids processed volume growth in Williston Basin. 7 new third-party natural gas processing plants were connected in 2015. 
We also realized solid volume performance on our West Texas LPG pipeline system from our long-haul customers as we continue to provide quality service at a good value. With nearly 100% of its earnings fee-based, the natural gas pipelines segment had another solid year. This segment is taking advantage of incremental demand due to lower natural gas prices through its uniquely positioned assets with the announcement of the Roadrunner Gas Transmission pipeline and the WesTex pipeline expansion serving growing markets in Mexico.
In 2015, we made significant progress toward reducing commodity risk in our business, which is expected to reduce earnings volatility over the long term. As a result, we expect 2016 fee-based earnings to be approximately 85%, a significant improvement from 66% in 2014. Drivers of this increase include growing the fee-based exchange services volumes in the natural gas liquids segment and contract restructuring in the gathering and processing segment. 
The efforts of contract restructuring in the gathering and processing segment can be seen by the increase in our average fee rate. The average fee rate for the fourth quarter 2015 was $0.55, a nearly 60% increase compared with $0.35 in the first quarter 2015. 
At ONEOK, we remain committed to being a supportive general partner, as evidenced by the $650 million equity investment in the partnership in mid-2015, which we expect to result in increased distributions from ONEOK's higher ownership percentage in ONEOK Partners. Our extensive, integrated network of natural gas and natural gas liquids assets delivered solid results in 2015 and has positioned us well for 2016. 
That concludes my opening remarks. Derek?"

I'll start by highlighting the financial steps we took in 2015 and early 2016 that positioned us well for 2016 and into 2017. 
With a high priority on maintaining the partnership's investment-grade credit ratings, we took decisive steps to manage its balance sheet by high grading its growth projects and reducing capital spending by nearly $1.6 billion in 2015 from our original 2015 capital guidance. We issued $750 million of equity in August, along with nearly $280 million of additional equity through the ""at-the-market"" program during 2015. We termed out $800 million of short-term debt in March and most recently, entered into a $1 billion 3-year unsecured term loan, which effectively refinances the 2016 long-term debt maturities at a low cost. 
With the financial steps we've taken and the momentum and volume growth in earnings leading into 2016, we expect to achieve our 2016 financial guidance. At ONEOK Partners, we expect not to need public debt or equity issuances well into 2017, which includes no equity from the ""at-the-market"" equity program, to keep distributions flat for the year, deliver distribution coverage of 1x or better for 2016 and obtain GAAP debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 4.2x or less by late 2016. At ONEOK, we expect to keep these dividends flat for the year, pay no cash income taxes in 2016 and generate approximately $160 million of free cash flow after dividends in 2016, which, along with $90 million of cash at the end of 2015, provides ONEOK with significant flexibility to support ONEOK Partners if needed.
For growth capital in 2016, we expect to spend $320 million in the gathering and processing segment and $70 million each in the natural gas liquids and natural gas pipelines segments, for a total of $460 million as previously guided. As producer needs evolve throughout the balance of the year and into 2017, we have the flexibility to significantly reduce growth capital, particularly in the gathering and processing segment, as we optimize our systems and available capacity.
Additionally, we've been able to realize reduced operating cost and capital costs from our service providers across our operations. We continue to control operating costs and have reduced contract labor. We expect this trend to continue into 2016. 
As it relates to maintenance capital expenditures, we take a conservative approach. We're extremely careful not to underestimate expenditures when establishing guidance as spending for the integrity and reliability of our assets is very important to the partnership's success. Over the long term, our assets have operated very reliably as a result of this approach.
In 2015, a number of our large maintenance projects came in significantly under budget, especially the projects scheduled towards the second half of 2015, as service providers reduced cost and bid very aggressively due to market conditions.
On the topic of counterparty credit risk, we consider our credit exposure to be low across all 3 of our operating segments. The partnership had no single customer representing more than 10% of revenues, and only 15 customers individually represented 1% or more of revenues. Additionally, of the top-10 customers, which represented 38% of revenue, 9 are investment grade or provide full credit support. Many of our top-10 customers are natural gas liquids segment customers comprised of large petrochemical and integrated oil companies. 
Taking a look at our credit profile within our 3 segments, where we consider investment grade as rated by the ratings agencies or comparable internal ratings or secured by letters of credit or other collateral. The natural gas pipelines segment received more than 85% of its 2015 revenue from investment-grade customers, who are primarily large electric and natural gas utilities. 
The natural gas liquids segment has limited credit exposure in its exchange service fee earnings as most contracts -- in most contracts, the natural gas liquids are purchased, and proceeds are remitted from the partnership to the liquids producer, less a fee. And more than 80% of 2015 commodity sales were to investment-grade customers. 
And finally, the gathering and processing segment's credit risk is limited, as in most contracts the partnership remits the proceeds under the percent-of-proceeds contracts to the producer net of ONEOK Partners share of those proceeds as well as the fees charged. 99% of the segment's 2015 downstream sales were to investment-grade customers.
2015 results at both ONEOK and ONEOK Partners include the impact from noncash impairment charges totaling $264 million, primarily related to investments in the coal-bed methane area of the Powder River Basin. The partnership remains highly committed to maintaining our investment-grade credit ratings, having a solid balance sheet and ample liquidity to support our capital program, ending 2015 with $1.8 billion available on its credit facility. The partnership's GAAP debt to adjusted EBITDA on a run-rate basis is 4.1x, reflecting earnings growth during the year. 
Distribution coverage remains an important metric for us as well. Expect distribution coverage of 1x or better for 2016 by growing our cash flows through volume growth, cost savings and efficiency improvements. 
ONEOK, on a stand-alone basis, ended 2015 with over $90 million of cash and an undrawn $300 million credit facility. The partnership is advantaged by having a strong supportive general partner in ONEOK. With the significant excess dividend coverage, ONEOK has the resources that may be used to further support the partnership, if needed, as it navigates these uncertain times. 
Terry, that concludes my remarks."

Let's walk through our 2016 financial guidance and key assumptions by segment. Starting with our largest segment. The natural gas liquids segment is expected to contribute $995 million in operating income and equity earnings in 2016. A",1260,"Thank you, Derek. Let's walk through our 2016 financial guidance and key assumptions by segment. 
Starting with our largest segment. The natural gas liquids segment is expected to contribute $995 million in operating income and equity earnings in 2016. Additionally, we expect the natural gas liquids volumes and earnings to be weighted towards the mid to second half of 2016. Approximately 90% of the expected earnings in this segment are fee based from the exchange services and transportation businesses. We continue to expect the partnership's natural gas liquids volumes gathered to increase in 2016, primarily from Williston Basin natural gas liquids volume growth expected from our gathering and processing assets in the basin, including the expected connection of the Bear Creek plant and one third-party natural gas processing plant in 2016. Approximately 60% of the segment's natural gas liquids volumes gathered come from the Mid-Continent, with the majority of the gathered volume coming from third-party processing plants. Our unique natural gas liquids position in the Mid-Continent is similar to the position we have in the Williston with the partnership's gathering and processing assets, as we are connected to most of the third-party plants in the region. 
We expect to continue to benefit from natural gas liquids volumes gathered through our West Texas LPG system, where nearly 26% of the segment's volume originates. The segment is connected to more than 60 natural gas processing plants in the Permian Basin and is expected to connect one additional plant in 2016. And we expect to receive the full benefit in 2016 of increased tariffs. 
Finally, we moved the completion of the Bakken NGL Pipeline expansion to the third quarter 2018 due to a slower expected rate of volume growth. The realigned timing of the expansion has no impact on financial or capital guidance for 2016.
Driving the earnings growth in the natural gas gathering and processing segment in 2016 is natural gas volume growth in the Williston Basin and enhanced margins due to the contract restructuring efforts. In the Williston, we expect to average 740 million cubic feet per day of natural gas gathered volume in 2016. Our gathered volumes early in the year have been very strong as we reached nearly 800 million cubic feet per day in February. The recently completed Lonesome Creek plant and compression projects have already added nearly 100 million a day of incremental volume to our system, most of which has come from capturing previously flared gas. 
We continue to have approximately 24 rigs operating in more than 500 drilled, uncompleted wells on our dedicated acreage. Given this activity, we expect 250 to 350 new well connections to our system in 2016. To put the expected 2016 volume outlook into context, if every rig were to have stopped drilling on January 1, 2016, and we did not connect any new wells in 2016, we would expect an average gathered volume of 720 million cubic feet per day in 2016, slightly below our guidance for the Williston. Natural gas volume growth in 2016 will not reflect a pronounced second half ramp-up as we experienced in 2015. We do expect volumes to slightly decline through the summer until our 80 million cubic feet per day Bear Creek plant comes online, and we expect to capture an incremental 40 million cubic feet per day of gas currently flaring in Dunn County.
In the Mid-Continent, we continue to be in constant communication with our producer customers regarding their drilling and completion activity. And similar to the Williston, the Mid-Continent volume exited 2015 at a high rate. As I mentioned earlier, the segment did receive an early benefit from our contract restructuring efforts in the fourth quarter 2015. However, 2016 is expected to receive the full benefit of these efforts, and we expect another increase in the average fee rate in the first quarter 2016 from the $0.55 the segment average in the fourth quarter 2015.
In the natural gas pipelines segment, 2016 earnings are expected to remain more than 95% fee based, with more than 90% of the segment's transportation capacity and more than 75% of its natural gas storage capacity contracted for the year. The first phase of the Roadrunner Gas Transmission Pipeline is on schedule to be complete next month and is fully subscribed under 25-year firm demand charge, fee-based commitments, with the second phase expected to be complete in the first quarter 2017. 
Before closing, I would like to discuss future demand growth for ethane, which we expect to be a significant opportunity for the natural gas liquids segment as we move through 2017 and 2018. Approximately 400,000 barrels per day of incremental ethane demand from new world-scale petrochemical crackers is expected to come online by the third quarter of 2017 and nearly 164,000 barrels per day more by first quarter 2019. We expect this new demand, combined with additional ethane exporting infrastructure, to significantly reduce the ethane excess supply overhang and put upward pressure on ethane prices and bringing most natural gas processing plants into full ethane recovery sometime in mid-2018. Nearly 1/3 of U.S. ethane or approximately 180,000 barrels per day is dedicated and connected to our natural gas liquids system but is currently not producing due to insufficient ethane demand. We are well positioned to transport and fractionate substantial incremental ethane volumes once the natural gas processing plants we are connected to transition into full ethane recovery in response to growing U.S. petrochemical demand. We expect little to no additional capital expenditures needed to bring this ethane onto our system as we already constructed the natural gas liquids infrastructure necessary to connect supply to the Gulf Coast region. 
The total incremental adjusted EBITDA benefit to the partnership, if all of the natural gas processing plants we are connected to enter full ethane recovery, could be in the range of $200 million per year. With the natural gas liquids segment's unique and extensive asset position, we can deliver significant ethane supplies to the Gulf Coast markets from the Williston, Mid-Continent and Permian Basins. 
Since we issued guidance in December, the commodity price environment has continued to be unstable, and many of our producer customers have reduced their capital expenditure plans for 2016. While these challenges remain, we will continue to remain focused on serving our customers, reducing risks, controlling costs, managing our balance sheet prudently and reducing capital needs. As we have discussed on this call, more than 85% of the partnership's operating income and equity earnings comes from primarily fee-based activities underpinned by its large 37,000-mile integrated natural gas and natural gas liquids network with opportunities to grow its cash flows even in a lower capital spending environment. 
In 2016, we expect to finish the year within our financial guidance, driven by our uniquely positioned assets. We are less than 60 days into 2016, and we expect, similar to 2015, opportunities and challenges throughout the year. We will be proactive in our approach to these opportunities and challenges and prudent in our decision-making, all while keeping in mind the long-term interest of our investors. 
I'd like to thank our employees across the country for their strong performance, hard work and dedication in 2015. Many of our employees have experienced these difficult industry cycles before, and they know what to do: manage costs, be efficient, be creative and operate safely and reliably, all while being focused on providing quality service to our customers. And many thanks to all of our stakeholders for your continued support of ONEOK and ONEOK Partners.

I can't tell you to what extent they may or may not be, including ethane uplift. I suspect not much. But historically, they've understood and added back some credit, I think, for the capital spending over time. So what I think they look for is a track record, a plan to continue to reduce leverage. And as I mentioned in my remarks, the GAAP debt to EBITDA of 4.1x on a run-rate basis is certainly supporting that we're headed in the right direction.

So Becca, the -- a couple of things and dynamics that are going on in that -- the transitioning from that slide to our guidance. Like Terry mentioned, that's kind of a theoretical, assuming all the flares were out. Well, in our guidance volumes, we factor in some level -- minimal level of flaring. And keep in mind, we've got Dunn County, where gas is going to flare until we get the Bear Creek plant built in the third quarter. We also factor in a little bit for weather during the winter months. And then just some general operational cushion, or whatever you want to call it, just to pull volumes back a little bit. So that's the incremental difference between 100 well connects that's referenced in the stairstep slide and our guidance. But we do feel strong -- when you look at the activity that's currently there in the basin and the number of rigs on our acreage, and then you look at the drilled and uncompleted backlog, we feel that the 250 to 350 is a really good number to achieve."

Additional key financial and operational information has been updated in a short presentation and is posted on ONEOK's and ONEOK Partners' websites. Let's start by discussing ONEOK and ONEOK Partners accomplishments in 2015, then I'll hand it off to Derek for a financial update, and finish by reviewing our 2016 financial guidance, which we maintained for both ONEOK and ONEOK Partners in last night's release. 
Our uniquely positioned assets delivered higher ONEOK Partners fourth quarter and 2015 adjusted EBITDA in a very challenging market, and we delivered on our expectation to significantly grow natural gas and natural gas liquids volumes and earnings in the second half of the year. The partnership grew its adjusted EBITDA throughout the year by nearly 40% from the first quarter to the fourth quarter 2015, ending the year with $450 million in fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA. The partnership also improved its quarterly distribution coverage to 1.03x. These results were driven by a significant ramp in natural gas volumes gathered and processed across our system, especially in Williston Basin, as we connected more than 820 additional wells, captured more flared volumes from existing wells, completed 6 field compression projects and our Lonesome Creek natural gas processing plant and restructured several contracts earlier than expected. And in the Mid-Continent, volumes increased late in the year as a large producer customer completed wells that had been drilled earlier in the year.
The natural gas liquids segment, which is connected to more than 180 natural gas processing plants, continued to benefit from natural gas liquids processed volume growth in Williston Basin. Seven new third-party natural gas processing plants were connected in 2015. 
We also realized solid volume performance on our West Texas LPG pipeline system from our long-haul customers as we continue to provide quality service at a good value. With nearly 100% of its earnings fee-based, the natural gas pipelines segment had another solid year. This segment is taking advantage of incremental demand due to lower natural gas prices through its uniquely positioned assets, with the announcement of the Roadrunner Gas Transmission pipeline and the WesTex pipeline expansion serving growing markets in Mexico.
In 2015, we made significant progress toward reducing commodity risk in our business, which is expected to reduce earnings volatility over the long term. As a result, we expect 2016 fee-based earnings to be approximately 85%, a significant improvement from 66% in 2014. Drivers of this increase include growing the fee-based exchange services volumes in the natural gas liquids segment and contract restructuring in the gathering and processing segment. 
The efforts of contract restructuring in the gathering and processing segment can be seen by the increase in our average fee rate. The average fee rate for the fourth quarter 2015 was $0.55, a nearly 60% increase compared with $0.35 in the first quarter 2015. 
At ONEOK, we remain committed to being a supportive general partner, as evidenced by the $650 million equity investment in the partnership in mid-2015, which we expect to result in increased distributions from ONEOK's higher ownership percentage in ONEOK Partners. Our extensive, integrated network of natural gas and natural gas liquids assets delivered solid results in 2015 and has positioned us well for 2016. 
That concludes my opening remarks. Derek?"
293889,283397730,938484,"ONEOK Inc., ONEOK Partners, L.P., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 23, 2016",2016-02-23,"Earnings Calls","ONEOK, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Terry. I'll start by highlighting the financial steps we took in 2015 and early 2016 that position us well for 2016 and into 2017.

I'll start by highlighting the financial steps we took in 2015 and early 2016 that position us well for 2016 and into 2017. 
With a high priority on maintaining the partnership's investment-grade credit ratings, we took decisive steps to manage its balance sheet by high-grading its growth projects and reducing capital spending by nearly $1.6 billion in 2015 from our original 2015 capital guidance. We issued $750 million of equity in August, along with nearly $280 million of additional equity through the at-the-market program during 2015. We termed out $800 million of short-term debt in March and most recently, entered into a $1 billion, 3-year unsecured term loan, which effectively refinances the 2016 long-term debt maturities at a low cost. 
With the financial steps we've taken and the momentum and volume growth in earnings leading into 2016, we expect to achieve our 2016 financial guidance. At ONEOK Partners, we expect not to need public debt or equity issuances well into 2017, which includes no equity from the at-the-market equity program, to keep distributions flat for the year, deliver distribution coverage of 1x or better for 2016 and obtain GAAP debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 4.2x or less by late 2016. At ONEOK, we expect to keep dividends flat for the year, pay no cash income taxes in 2016 and generate approximately $160 million of free cash flow after dividends in 2016, which, along with $90 million of cash at the end of 2015, provides ONEOK with significant flexibility to support ONEOK Partners if needed.
For growth capital in 2016, we expect to spend $320 million in the gathering and processing segment and $70 million each in the natural gas liquids and natural gas pipelines segments, for a total of $460 million, as previously guided. As producer needs evolve throughout the balance of the year and into 2017, we have the flexibility to significantly reduce growth capital, particularly in the gathering and processing segment, as we optimize our systems and available capacity.
Additionally, we've been able to realize reduced operating cost and capital costs from our service providers across our operations. We continue to control operating costs and have reduced contract labor. We expect this trend to continue into 2016. 
As it relates to maintenance capital expenditures, we take a conservative approach. We're extremely careful not to underestimate expenditures when establishing guidance, as spending for the integrity and reliability of our assets is very important to the partnership's success. Over the long term, our assets have operated very reliably as a result of this approach.
In 2015, a number of our large maintenance projects came in significantly under budget, especially the projects scheduled towards the second half of 2015, as service providers reduced cost and bid very aggressively due to market conditions.
On the topic of counterparty credit risk, we consider our credit exposure to be low across all 3 of our operating segments. The partnership had no single customer representing more than 10% of revenues, and only 15 customers individually represented 1% or more of revenues. Additionally, of the top-10 customers, which represented 38% of revenue, 9 are investment grade or provide full credit support. Many of our top-10 customers are natural gas liquids segment customers comprised of large petrochemical and integrated oil companies. 
Taking a look at our credit profile within our 3 segments, where we consider investment grade as rated by the ratings agencies or comparable internal ratings or secured by letters of credit or other collateral. The natural gas pipelines segment received more than 85% of its 2015 revenue from investment-grade customers, who are primarily large electric and natural gas utilities. 
The natural gas liquids segment has limited credit exposure in its exchange service fee earnings as most contracts -- in most contracts, natural gas liquids are purchased, and proceeds are remitted from the partnership to the liquids producer, less a fee. And more than 80% of 2015 commodity sales were to investment-grade customers. 
And finally, the gathering and processing segment's credit risk is limited, as in most contracts, the partnership remits the proceeds, under the percent-of-proceeds contracts, to the producer net of ONEOK Partners' share of those proceeds as well as the fees charged. 99% of the segment's 2015 downstream sales were to investment-grade customers.
2015 results at both ONEOK and ONEOK Partners include the impact from noncash impairment charges totaling $264 million, primarily related to investments in the coal-bed methane area of the Powder River Basin. The partnership remains highly committed to maintaining our investment-grade credit ratings, having a solid balance sheet and ample liquidity to support our capital program, ending 2015 with $1.8 billion available on its credit facility. The partnership's GAAP debt to adjusted EBITDA on a run-rate basis is 4.1x, reflecting earnings growth during the year. 
Distribution coverage remains an important metric for us as well. Expect distribution coverage of 1x or better for 2016 by growing our cash flows through volume growth, cost savings and efficiency improvements. 
ONEOK, on a stand-alone basis, ended 2015 with over $90 million of cash and an undrawn $300 million credit facility. The partnership is advantaged by having a strong supportive general partner in ONEOK. With the significant excess dividend coverage, ONEOK has the resources that may be used to further support the partnership, if needed, as it navigates these uncertain times. 
Terry, that concludes my remarks."
293889,283397730,938484,"ONEOK Inc., ONEOK Partners, L.P., Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 23, 2016",2016-02-23,"Earnings Calls","ONEOK, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Derek. Let's walk through our 2016 financial guidance and key assumptions by segment. Starting with our largest segment. The natural gas liquids segment is expected to contribute $995 million in operating income and equity earnings in 2016. A",1258,"Thank you, Derek. Let's walk through our 2016 financial guidance and key assumptions by segment. 
Starting with our largest segment. The natural gas liquids segment is expected to contribute $995 million in operating income and equity earnings in 2016. Additionally, we expect the natural gas liquids volumes and earnings to be weighted towards the mid to second half of 2016. Approximately 90% of the expected earnings in this segment are fee-based from the exchange services and transportation businesses. We continue to expect the partnership's natural gas liquids volumes gathered to increase in 2016, primarily from Williston Basin natural gas liquids volume growth expected from our gathering and processing assets in the basin, including the expected connection of the Bear Creek plant and one third-party natural gas processing plant in 2016. Approximately 60% of the segment's natural gas liquids volumes gathered come from the Mid-Continent, with the majority of the gathered volume coming from third-party processing plants. Our unique natural gas liquids position in the Mid-Continent is similar to the position we have in the Williston, with the partnership's gathering and processing assets, as we are connected to most of the third-party plants in the region. 
We expect to continue to benefit from natural gas liquids volumes gathered through our West Texas LPG system, where nearly 26% of the segment's volume originates. The segment is connected to more than 60 natural gas processing plants in the Permian Basin and is expected to connect one additional plant in 2016. And we expect to receive the full benefit in 2016 of increased tariffs. 
Finally, we moved the completion of the Bakken NGL Pipeline expansion to the third quarter 2018 due to a slower expected rate of volume growth. The realigned timing of the expansion has no impact on financial or capital guidance for 2016.
Driving the earnings growth in the natural gas gathering and processing segment in 2016 is natural gas volume growth in the Williston Basin and enhanced margins due to the contract restructuring efforts. In the Williston, we expect to average 740 million cubic feet per day of natural gas gathered volume in 2016. Our gathered volumes early in the year have been very strong as we reached nearly 800 million cubic feet per day in February. The recently completed Lonesome Creek plant and compression projects have already added nearly 100 million a day of incremental volume to our system, most of which has come from capturing previously flared gas. 
We continue to have approximately 24 rigs operating in more than 500 drilled, uncompleted wells on our dedicated acreage. Given this activity, we expect 250 to 350 new well connections to our system in 2016. To put the expected 2016 volume outlook into context, if every rig were to have stopped drilling on January 1, 2016, and we did not connect any new wells in 2016, we would expect an average gathered volume of 720 million cubic feet per day in 2016, slightly below our guidance for the Williston. Natural gas volume growth in 2016 will not reflect a pronounced second half ramp-up as we experienced in 2015. We do expect volumes to slightly decline through the summer until our 80 million cubic feet per day Bear Creek plant comes online, and we expect to capture an incremental 40 million cubic feet per day of gas currently flaring in Dunn County.
In the Mid-Continent, we continue to be in constant communication with our producer customers regarding their drilling and completion activity. And similar to the Williston, the Mid-Continent volume exited 2015 at a high rate. As I mentioned earlier, the segment did receive an early benefit from our contract restructuring efforts in the fourth quarter 2015. However, 2016 is expected to receive the full benefit of these efforts, and we expect another increase in the average fee rate in the first quarter 2016 from the $0.55, the segment average in the fourth quarter 2015.
In the natural gas pipelines segment, 2016 earnings are expected to remain more than 95% fee-based, with more than 90% of the segment's transportation capacity and more than 75% of its natural gas storage capacity contracted for the year. The first phase of the Roadrunner Gas Transmission Pipeline is on schedule to be complete next month and is fully subscribed under 25-year firm demand charge, fee-based commitments, with the second phase expected to be complete in the first quarter 2017. 
Before closing, I would like to discuss future demand growth for ethane, which we expect to be a significant opportunity for the natural gas liquids segment as we move through 2017 and 2018. Approximately 400,000 barrels per day of incremental ethane demand from new world-scale petrochemical crackers is expected to come online by the third quarter of 2017 and nearly 164,000 barrels per day more by first quarter 2019. We expect this new demand, combined with additional ethane exporting infrastructure, to significantly reduce the ethane excess supply overhang and put upward pressure on ethane prices and bringing most natural gas processing plants into full ethane recovery sometime in mid-2018. Nearly 1/3 of U.S. ethane or approximately 180,000 barrels per day is dedicated and connected to our natural gas liquids system but is currently not producing due to insufficient ethane demand. We are well positioned to transport and fractionate substantial incremental ethane volumes once the natural gas processing plants we are connected to transition into full ethane recovery in response to growing U.S. petrochemical demand. We expect little to no additional capital expenditures needed to bring this ethane onto our system as we already constructed the natural gas liquids infrastructure necessary to connect supply to the Gulf Coast region. 
The total incremental adjusted EBITDA benefit to the partnership, if all of the natural gas processing plants we are connected to enter full ethane recovery, could be in the range of $200 million per year. With the natural gas liquids segment's unique and extensive asset position, we can deliver significant ethane supplies to the Gulf Coast markets from the Williston, Mid-Continent and Permian Basins. 
Since we issued guidance in December, the commodity price environment has continued to be unstable, and many of our producer customers have reduced their capital expenditure plans for 2016. While these challenges remain, we will continue to remain focused on serving our customers, reducing risk, controlling costs, managing our balance sheet prudently and reducing capital needs. As we have discussed on this call, more than 85% of the partnership's operating income and equity earnings comes from primarily fee-based activities underpinned by its large 37,000-mile integrated natural gas and natural gas liquids network with opportunities to grow its cash flows even in a lower capital spending environment. 
In 2016, we expect to finish the year within our financial guidance, driven by our uniquely positioned assets. We are less than 60 days into 2016, and we expect, similar to 2015, opportunities and challenges throughout the year. We will be proactive in our approach to these opportunities and challenges and prudent in our decision-making, all while keeping in mind the long-term interest of our investors. 
I'd like to thank our employees across the country for their strong performance, hard work and dedication in 2015. Many of our employees have experienced these difficult industry cycles before, and they know what to do: manage costs, be efficient, be creative and operate safely and reliably, all while being focused on providing quality service to our customers. And many thanks to all of our stakeholders for your continued support of ONEOK and ONEOK Partners.

I can't tell you to what extent they may or may not be including ethane uplift. I suspect not much. But historically, they've understood and added back some credit, I think, for the capital spending over time. So what I think they look for is a track record, a plan to continue to reduce leverage. And as I mentioned in my remarks, the GAAP debt-to-EBITDA of 4.1x on a run-rate basis is certainly supporting that we're headed in the right direction. And I think that the unique aspects of our footprint, the tailwinds in terms of volume that Terry mentioned in the Williston, capturing the flared gas, those sorts of things, I think all play into their thought process."

Good morning, and thank you for joining today. As always, we appreciate your continued interest and investment in ONEOK and ONEOK Partners.
On this conference call is Walter Hulse, the Executive Vice President of Strategic Planning and Corporate Affairs; Derek Reiners, Chief Financial Officer and Senior Vice President; Wes Christiansen, Operations; Sheridan Swords, Natural Gas Liquids; Kevin Burdick, Natural Gas Gathering and Processing; and Phill May, Natural Gas Pipelines.
I'll begin with a few opening remarks then Derek will give a brief financial update and then I will wrap up with highlights of the first quarter, our outlook for the remainder of the year and our ethane opportunity.
To begin, first quarter 2016 performance was a result of the progress made last year by continuing to focus on increasing our fee-based earnings, reducing commodity price risk in our businesses, project execution and making prudent financial decisions, all while continuing to operate safely and responsibly.
In this challenging market conditions, we have relied on our strengths, which for ONEOK Partners are predominantly fee-based earnings, our uniquely positioned assets and our dedicated employees. Our competitive advantage is our integrated network of assets that fit and work well together. Our 37,000 mile network of pipelines, processing plants and fractionators are well-positioned to withstand the cyclical nature of the industry.
Our assets in the Williston Basin have served us well and we continue to benefit from the basins large natural gas reserve base and inventory of flared, NGL-rich natural gas. Our natural gas pipelines segment remains well-positioned to expand its fee-based natural gas export capabilities, particularly to Mexico where we have key relationships through our joint venture, Roadrunner Gas Transmission pipeline, and our extensive natural gas liquids business maintains a growing position in the Rockies, Texas and emerging STACK and SCOOP plays in Oklahoma, providing us a large and diverse supply base over of which to serve our end-use customers.
The partnership's distribution coverage increased to 1.06x in the first quarter, up from 1.03x in the fourth quarter 2015 and significantly higher compared to the beginning of 2015, which is a reflection of our increasing stable cash flow as we now have a significant amount of infrastructure completed and are able to harvest earnings, particularly in the gathering and processing and natural gas liquids businesses.
ONEOK Partners first quarter 2016 adjusted EBITDA of approximately $445 million represents a nearly 40% increase compared with the first quarter 2015. Executing on our growth projects, contract restructuring, capital and cost savings and consistent operations were key drivers to delivering the greatly improved results from a year-ago even in the face of deteriorating industry fundamentals throughout 2015.
From an operating perspective, the volume growth across our businesses, increased fee-based earnings and ongoing cost reduction efforts across ONEOK Partners business segments have all contributed to a solid first quarter and positive outlook for the remainder of 2016. In the midst of some of the industry's most challenging conditions, our employees once again performed exceptionally well by successfully executing on our strategies to mitigate risk, reduce capital spending and operating cost and manage our balance sheet. It is through their hard work and determination that our company delivered impressive results quarter-after-quarter in 2015 and we remain as committed as ever to delivering even better results in 2016.
Through our key strategies and well managed and operated assets our employees have, with a sense of urgency, met the challenge, just as they have many times in the past. I'd like to thank them for their hard work and commitment to deliver value to the bottom line safely and reliably.
We'll cover each of the segments in more detail later in the call. But first, I'd like to have Derek give us a brief financial update.
Derek?"
293889,331146631,972269,"ONEOK Inc., ONEOK Partners, L.P., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 04, 2016",2016-05-04,"Earnings Calls","ONEOK, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Terry.

Both ONEOK and ONEOK Partners ended the first quarter in a strong financial position, with healthy balance sheets and ample financial flexibility. As Terry mentioned, ONEOK Partners first quarter distribution coverage is 1.06x. ONEOK's first quarter dividend coverage was 1.31x, which together with cash on hand entering during the year maintains ONEOK's flexibility to provide financial support to the partnership as needed.
In yesterday's earnings news releases, as we maintained our 2016 financial guidance expectations for both ONEOK and ONEOK Partners, our proactive financial actions in 2015 and early 2016 and enhanced earnings from the partnership has allowed the partnership to deliver on distribution coverage while also reducing leverage. The partnership's capital expenditure guidance remains $600 million, including $140 million of maintenance capital for 2016 as the reliability and integrity of our assets is the foundation of our success. However, we are seeing aggressive bidding from our vendors on maintenance projects and the timing associated with our maintenance activities can vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter due to seasonal impacts and varying maintenance cycles across our ever-changing asset base.
Typically, our maintenance capital spending is lowering the first quarter. Sequentially, maintenance capital decreased $8 million in the first quarter primarily due to our maintenance project planned for the quarter having fewer projects compared to the fourth quarter, which is not unusual when compared to our historical spending profile. We are on plan for our scheduled maintenance projects for 2016.
Similarly, as it relates to operating cost, we continue to see competitive, lower pricing and rates from service providers and we have significantly reduced contract labor across all of our segments. In the first quarter, realized a $15 million sequential decrease in operating costs. And as Terry mentioned, we continue to focus on internal operating cost reduction efforts company-wide. We expect these cost savings to continue throughout the year.
In January, ONEOK Partners entered into a $1 billion 3-year unsecured term loan, effectively refinancing our 2016 debt maturities and enhancing financial flexibility. With approximately $1.9 billion of capacity available on the ONEOK Partners credit facility at the end of the first quarter, the reduction of more than $2.2 billion in capital growth projects in 2 years and higher earnings, the partnership does not need to access public debt or equity markets well into 2017.
The partnership continues to progress towards deleveraging as our trailing 12 months GAAP debt-to-EBITDA improved to 4.5x at March 31, and we continue to expect annual debt GAAP debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 4.2x for the full year 2016 as a result of prudent financial, operating and commercial execution. As always, we remain committed to the partnership's investment-grade credit ratings.
On a standalone basis, ONEOK ended the first quarter with nearly $130 million of cash and expects to have approximately $250 million of cash by year-end 2016 and an undrawn $300 million credit facility, allowing us financial flexibility as we continued to navigate a challenging market environment.
In February, we provide detailed information our counterparty credit risk. We've included similar information again this year in our Form 10-Q, but there haven't been any subsequent changes. We have a very high quality customer base and no material counterparty credit concerns. The majority of our top customers are large petrochemical and integrated oil companies, which have a higher tolerance for volatility in commodity prices. Our track record of prudent and proactive financial decisions during uncertain times results in ample liquidity, 2 strong balance sheets and a strong customer base. ONEOK and ONEOK Partners remain well-positioned to withstand the volatile commodity and financial market environment.
Terry, That concludes my remarks."

Let's take a closer look at each of our business segments.
In the natural gas liquids segment, volumes continued to increase year-over-year, with the first quarter 2016 volumes gathered, up 6% and volumes fractionated up 16% compared with the first quarter 2015. Compared with the fourth quarter 2015, volumes gathered and fractionated were lower primarily due to decreased spot volumes, higher ethane rejection and seasonal impacts. We continue to expect NGL volumes to be weighted towards the second half of the year as incremental volumes from the natural gas processing plant connections continued to ramp-up.
In the first quarter, we connected 3 additional third-party plants to our NGL system and we continued to see volumes ramp at the 8 plants we connected in 2015. We expect to connect 1 additional third-party plant this year, in addition to completing and connecting our 80 million cubic feet per day Bear Creek plant in the Williston Basin for additional flared natural gas remains ready to come online.
Williston Basin NGL volumes, our highest margin NGL volumes with bundled rates more than 3x those in other regions, remained strong in the first quarter. The average volume gathered on our Bakken NGL Pipeline increased nearly 12% compared with the fourth quarter 2015, driven by the completion of the Lonesome Creek plant in November 2015 and compression projects. I'll also talk about ethane and provide an update on our ethane opportunity outlook in just a moment.
As it relates to the West Texas LPG system, in July 2015, we increased rates on the system to be more in line with market rates. In March, the Texas Railroad Commission suspended the rate increase until it is determined by the Commission if the rates are in line with the market. We are confident that our increased rates are just and reasonable and in line with the market. However, regardless of the outcome of the pending case, our current 2016 financial guidance remains as indicated.
As you all can appreciate, due to the legal process now underway with the Railroad Commission, it will not be prudent at this time for us to discuss this case in any more detail. We will provide future updates or commentary when and if it is appropriate.
In the natural gas gathering and processing segment, Williston Basin volumes were a key driver to our first quarter performance. Our natural gas volumes process reached 810 million cubic feet per day and as we captured previously flared gas and connected new wells to our system. Average natural gas volumes processed in the Williston increased 44% in the first quarter 2016 compared with the first quarter last year and increased 6% compared with the fourth quarter 2015.
Our producer customers continued to drive improvements in initial production rates through enhanced completion techniques and combined with the higher natural gas to oil ratios in the core areas, where virtually all of our new wells are being connected, have helped offset the reduction in drilling and completion activity. We will continue to benefit from the more than 820 wells connected in 2015 and the 115 wells connected to our system in the first quarter of 2016. The vast majority of these high-performing wells are in the most productive areas of Williams, McKenzie and Dunn Counties in North Dakota, where we have more than 1 million acres dedicated to us and an extensive network of interconnected gathering lines, compression and processing plants.
There are currently 900 drilled but uncompleted wells in the basin with nearly 400 on our acreage. We saw a decline in the drilling rig count across the Williston Basin during the first quarter and currently have approximately 15 rigs operating on our acreage under dedication. Flared natural gas in North Dakota was reported at approximately 185 million cubic feet per day for the state in February, with approximately 70 million to 80 million cubic feet per day on our system. This continues to present an opportunity for us as we had processing capacity to our system in the third quarter 2016 with the completion of our Bear Creek natural gas processing plant.
In the Mid-Continent, first quarter 2016 processed volumes increased 8% compared with fourth quarter 2015 volumes. Similar to the Williston, our producer customers continue to drive significant increases in initial production rates through enhanced completion techniques, especially in the STACK, Cana-Woodford and SCOOP plays. Producer delays on completions of some larger multi-well pads are expected to impact our volumes over the next several months and potentially, through the remainder of 2016. However, with the recent improvement in commodity prices and breakevens in the STACK, competing favorably with the best plays in the country, we could see acceleration of the delayed completions.
Contract restructuring in the natural gas gathering and processing segment has significantly decreased the segment's commodity price sensitivity and was another major contributor to the partnership's first quarter results. The segment's average fee rate increased to $0.68 per MMBtu compared with $0.35 in the same period last year and $0.55 in the fourth quarter 2015. We expect the segment's earnings to increase to more than 75% fee-based this year, driven by these contract restructuring efforts.
Moving on to the natural gas pipelines segment. First quarter results remained steady as the segment continued to provide a partnership with stable, predominantly fee-based earnings. The segment completed 2 capital growth projects in March, the first phase of the Roadrunner Gas Transmission pipeline project and a compressor station expansion project on our Midwestern Gas Transmission pipeline, which will add an additional 170 million cubic feet per day of capacity to the pipeline.
The Roadrunner project is fully subscribed under 25-year firm fee-based commitments and the second phase of Roadrunner is expected to be complete in the first quarter 2017. Additionally, the Midwestern Gas Transmission expansion is also fully subscribed under 15-year firm fee-based commitments.
Our natural gas pipelines segment is primarily market connected, meaning we are directly connected with large stable customers who provide services to end-users. These customers, such as large utility companies, electric generation facilities and industrials, have specific volume needs that don't fluctuate based on commodity prices. Additionally, we work closely with these customers to design our systems to fit their specific needs. Unlike basis-driven pipelines, there's minimal financial risk associated with our natural gas pipelines or our customers. We like the stability of our natural gas pipelines business and the customers we serve and we'll continue to develop additional fee-based and market-driven long-term growth and export opportunities in and around our asset footprint.
I'd like to close by providing an update on our ethane opportunity outlook. For the past 3 years, our industry has experienced an unprecedented period of heavy and prolonged ethane rejection. The partnership continued, even in the face of sustained ethane rejection, to increase our natural gas liquids volumes, gathered and fractionated. We are starting to see ethane process improve in relation to natural gas as a result of improving NGL process and weakened  gas, increases in NGL exports and expected incremental ethane demand from new world scale petrochemical crackers.
Since last quarter, we've seen ethane recovery economics improve, some natural gas processing plants on our system had intermittently started to recover ethane, we expect -- which we expect to continue throughout 2016. We continue to expect a meaningful amount of processing plants to move into full ethane -- full recovery in early 2017.
We average 175,000 barrels per day of ethane rejection on our system in the first quarter, and we expect anywhere from 175,000 to 200,000 barrels per day of ethane rejection on our system as new natural gas plants we are connected to continue to ramp-up and as we see the impacts of increased volumes in the Williston, STACK and SCOOP plays throughout 2016. We are well-positioned to benefit from this ethane opportunity and have more than enough infrastructure to bring this incremental barrels or approximately $200 million in annual earnings to our system with no additional capital requirements.
We also have the opportunity to utilize our assets to capture pricing differentials if any dislocations in pricing occur between the Conway, Kansas and Mont Belvieu Texas market centers as a result of increasing ethane demand.
Ethane recovery presents a major opportunity for ONEOK and ONEOK Partners, but it certainly isn't our only opportunity. We remain focused on additional fee-based growth opportunities for our businesses, cost-effective ways to enhance our assets and employee retention efforts so we're fully prepared when market conditions improve.
Congratulations to our employees on a solid first quarter. We continue to face headwinds from challenging industry conditions, but we've shown once again that we're uniquely positioned to handle these challenges and deliver on the financial results we've laid out for ourselves and our investors.
Thank you to all of our stakeholders for your continued support of ONEOK and ONEOK Partners.

On this conference call is Walt Hulse, Executive Vice President of Strategic Planning and Corporate Affairs; Derek Reiners, Chief Financial Officer; and Senior Vice President, Wes Christensen, Operations; Sheridan Swords, Natural Gas Liquids; Kevin Burdick, Natural Gas Gathering and Processing; and Phill May, Natural Gas Pipelines.
I'll begin with a few opening remarks, then Derek will give a brief financial update, and then I will wrap up with highlights of the first quarter, our outlook for the remainder of the year and our ethane opportunity.
To begin, first quarter 2016 performance was a result of the progress made last year by continuing to focus on increasing our fee-based earnings, reducing commodity price risk in our businesses, project execution and making prudent financial decisions, all while continuing to operate safely and responsibly.
In these challenging market conditions, we have relied on our strengths, which for ONEOK Partners, are predominantly fee-based earnings, our uniquely positioned assets and our dedicated employees. Our competitive advantage is our integrated network of assets that fit and work well together. Our 37,000-mile network of pipelines, processing plants and fractionators are well-positioned to withstand the cyclical nature of the industry.
Our assets in the Williston Basin have served us well, and we continue to benefit from the basin's large natural gas reserve base and inventory of flared, NGL-rich natural gas. Our natural gas pipeline segment remains well-positioned to expand its fee-based natural gas export capabilities, particularly to Mexico, where we have key relationships through our joint venture, Roadrunner Gas Transmission pipeline. And our extensive natural gas liquids business maintains a growing position in the Rockies, Texas and emerging STACK and SCOOP plays in Oklahoma, providing us a large and diverse supply base with which to serve our end-use customers.
The partnership's distribution coverage increased to 1.06x in the first quarter, up from 1.03x in the fourth quarter 2015 and significantly higher compared to the beginning of 2015, which is a reflection of our increasing stable cash flow as we now have a significant amount of infrastructure completed and are able to harvest earnings, particularly in the gathering and processing and natural gas liquids businesses.
ONEOK Partners' first quarter 2016 adjusted EBITDA of approximately $445 million represents a nearly 40% increase compared with the first quarter 2015. 
Executing on our growth projects, contract restructuring, capital and cost savings and consistent operations were key drivers to delivering the greatly improved results from a year ago, even in the face of deteriorating industry fundamentals throughout 2015. From an operating perspective, the volume growth across our businesses, increased fee-based earnings and ongoing cost reduction efforts across ONEOK Partners business segments have all contributed to a solid first quarter and positive outlook for the remainder of 2016. 
In the midst of some of the industry's most challenging conditions, our employees once again performed exceptionally well by successfully executing on our strategies to mitigate risk, reduce capital spending and operating cost and manage our balance sheet. It is through their hard work and determination that our company delivered impressive results quarter after quarter in 2015, and we remain as committed as ever to delivering even better results in 2016.
Through our key strategies and well-managed and operated assets, our employees have, with a high sense of urgency, met the challenge, just as they have many times in the past. I'd like to thank them for their hard work and commitment to deliver value to the bottom line safely and reliably.
We'll cover each of the segments in more detail later in the call. But first, I'd like to have Derek give us a brief financial update.
Derek?"
293889,331146631,972472,"ONEOK Inc., ONEOK Partners, L.P., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 04, 2016",2016-05-04,"Earnings Calls","ONEOK, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Terry. Both ONEOK and ONEOK Partners ended the first quarter in a strong financial position, with healthy balance sheets and ample financial flexibility. As Terry mentioned, ONEOK Partners' first quarter distribution coverage is 1.06x. ONEOK's",600,"Thank you, Terry. Both ONEOK and ONEOK Partners ended the first quarter in a strong financial position, with healthy balance sheets and ample financial flexibility. As Terry mentioned, ONEOK Partners' first quarter distribution coverage is 1.06x. ONEOK's first quarter dividend coverage was 1.31x, which together with cash on hand entering the year, maintains ONEOK's flexibility to provide financial support to the partnership if needed.
In yesterday's earnings news releases, we maintained our 2016 financial guidance expectations for both ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. Our proactive financial actions in 2015 and early 2016 and enhanced earnings from the partnership has allowed the partnership to deliver on distribution coverage while also reducing leverage. 
The partnership's capital expenditure guidance remains $600 million, including $140 million of maintenance capital for 2016, as the reliability and integrity of our assets is the foundation of our success. However, we are seeing aggressive bidding from our vendors on maintenance projects, and the timing associated with our maintenance activities can vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter due to seasonal impacts and varying maintenance cycles across our ever-changing asset base.
Typically, our maintenance capital spending is lower in the first quarter. Sequentially, maintenance capital decreased $8 million in the first quarter, primarily due to our maintenance project plan for the quarter having fewer projects compared to the fourth quarter, which is not unusual when compared to our historical spending profile. We are on plan for our scheduled maintenance projects for 2016.
Similarly, as it relates to operating cost, we continue to see competitive, lower pricing and rates from service providers, and we have significantly reduced contract labor across all of our segments. In the first quarter, we realized a $15 million sequential decrease in operating cost. And as Terry mentioned, we continue to focus on internal operating cost reduction efforts company-wide. We expect these cost savings to continue throughout the year.
In January, ONEOK Partners entered into a $1 billion 3-year unsecured term loan, effectively refinancing our 2016 debt maturities and enhancing financial flexibility. With approximately $1.9 billion of capacity available on the ONEOK Partners credit facility at the end of the first quarter, the reduction of more than $2.2 billion in capital growth projects in 2 years and higher earnings, the partnership does not need to access public debt or equity markets well into 2017.
The partnership continues to progress towards deleveraging, as our trailing 12-months GAAP debt-to-EBITDA improved to 4.5x at March 31, and we continue to expect annual debt -- GAAP debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 4.2x for the full year 2016 as a result of prudent financial, operating and commercial execution. As always, we remain committed to the partnership's investment-grade credit ratings.
On a standalone basis, ONEOK ended the first quarter with nearly $130 million of cash, and expects to have approximately $250 million of cash by year-end 2016 and an undrawn $300 million credit facility, allowing us financial flexibility as we continue to navigate a challenging market environment.
In February, we provided detailed information our counterparty credit risk. We have included similar information again this year in our Form 10-Q, but there haven't been any substantive changes. We have a very high quality customer base and no material counterparty credit concerns. The majority of our top customers are large petrochemical and integrated oil companies which have a higher tolerance for volatility in commodity prices. Our track record of prudent and proactive financial decisions during uncertain times results in ample liquidity, 2 strong balance sheets and a strong customer base. ONEOK and ONEOK Partners remain well-positioned to withstand the volatile commodity and financial market environment.
Terry, That concludes my remarks."
293889,331146631,972472,"ONEOK Inc., ONEOK Partners, L.P., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 04, 2016",2016-05-04,"Earnings Calls","ONEOK, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Derek. Let's take a closer look at each of our business segments.In the natural gas liquids segment, volumes continued to increase year-over-year, with the first quarter 2016 volumes gathered up 6% and volumes fractionated up 16% compared wit",1484,"Thank you, Derek. Let's take a closer look at each of our business segments.
In the natural gas liquids segment, volumes continued to increase year-over-year, with the first quarter 2016 volumes gathered up 6% and volumes fractionated up 16% compared with the first quarter 2015. Compared with the fourth quarter 2015, volumes gathered and fractionated were lower, primarily due to decreased spot volumes, higher ethane rejection and seasonal impacts. We continue to expect NGL volumes to be weighted towards the second half of the year, as incremental volumes from new natural gas processing plant connections continue to ramp-up.
In the first quarter, we connected 3 additional third-party plants to our NGL system, and we continue to see volumes ramp at the 8 plants we connected in 2015. We expect to connect 1 additional third-party plant this year in addition to completing and connecting our 80 million cubic feet per day Bear Creek plant in the Williston Basin, where additional flared natural gas remains ready to come online.
Williston Basin NGL volumes, our highest margin NGL volumes, with bundled rates more than 3x those in other regions, remained strong in the first quarter. The average volume gathered on our Bakken NGL Pipeline increased nearly 12% compared with the fourth quarter 2015, driven by the completion of the Lonesome Creek plant in November 2015 and compression project. I'll also talk about ethane and provide an update on our ethane opportunity outlook in just a moment.
As it relates to the West Texas LPG system, in July 2015, we increased rates on the system to be more in line with market rates. In March, the Texas Railroad Commission suspended the rate increase until it is determined by the Commission if the rates are in line with the market. We are confident that our increased rates are just and reasonable and in line with the market. However, regardless of the outcome of the pending case, our current 2016 financial guidance remains as indicated. As you all can appreciate, due to the legal process now underway with the Railroad Commission, it will not be prudent at this time for us to discuss this case in any more detail. We will provide future updates or commentary when and if it is appropriate.
In the natural gas gathering and processing segment, Williston Basin volumes were a key driver to our first quarter performance. Our natural gas volumes processed reached 810 million cubic feet per day, as we captured previously flared gas and connected new wells to our system. Average natural gas volumes processed in the Williston increased 44% in the first quarter 2016 compared with the first quarter last year and increased 6% compared with the fourth quarter 2015.
Our producer customers continued to drive improvements in initial production rates through enhanced completion techniques, and combined with the higher natural gas to oil ratios in the core areas, where virtually all of our new wells are being connected, have helped offset the reduction in drilling and completion activity. We will continue to benefit from the more than 820 wells connected in 2015 and the 115 wells connected to our system in the first quarter 2016. The vast majority of these high-performing wells are in the most productive areas of Williams, McKenzie and Dunn Counties in North Dakota, where we have more than 1 million acres dedicated to us and an extensive network of interconnected gathering lines, compression and processing plants. There are currently 900 drilled but uncompleted wells in the basin, with nearly 400 on our acreage. 
We saw a decline in the drilling rig count across the Williston Basin during the first quarter and currently have approximately 15 rigs operating on our acreage under dedication. 
Flared natural gas in North Dakota was reported at approximately 185 million cubic feet per day for the state in February, with approximately 70 million to 80 million cubic feet per day on our system. This continues to present an opportunity for us, as we add processing capacity to our system in the third quarter 2016 with the completion of our Bear Creek natural gas processing plant.
In the Mid-Continent, first quarter 2016 processed volumes increased 8% compared with fourth quarter 2015 volumes. Similar to the Williston, our producer customers continue to drive significant increases in initial production rates through enhanced completion techniques, especially in the STACK, Cana-Woodford and SCOOP plays. 
Producer delays on completions of some large multi-well pads are expected to impact our volumes over the next several months and potentially through the remainder of 2016. However, with the recent improvement in commodity prices and breakevens in the STACK competing favorably with the best plays in the country, we could see acceleration of the delayed completions.
Contract restructuring in the natural gas gathering and processing segment has significantly decreased the segment's commodity price sensitivity and was another major contributor to the partnership's first quarter results. The segment's average fee rate increased to $0.68 per MMBtu compared with $0.35 in the same period last year and $0.55 in the fourth quarter 2015. We expect the segment's earnings to increase to more than 75% fee-based this year, driven by these contract restructuring efforts.
Moving on to the natural gas pipelines segment. First quarter results remained steady, as the segment continued to provide the partnership with stable, predominantly fee-based earnings. The segment completed 2 capital growth projects in March: The first phase of the Roadrunner Gas Transmission pipeline project; and a compressor station expansion project on our Midwestern Gas Transmission pipeline, which will add an additional 170 million cubic feet per day of capacity to the pipeline.
The Roadrunner project is fully subscribed under 25-year firm fee-based commitments, and the second phase of Roadrunner is expected to be complete in the first quarter 2017. Additionally, the Midwestern Gas Transmission expansion is also fully subscribed under 15-year firm fee-based commitments.
Our natural gas pipelines segment is primarily market-connected, meaning, we are directly connected with large, stable customers who provide services to end users. These customers, such as large utility companies, electric generation facilities and industrials, have specific volume needs that don't fluctuate based on commodity prices. Additionally, we work closely with these customers to design our systems to fit their specific needs. Unlike basis-driven pipelines, there is minimal financial risk associated with our natural gas pipelines or our customers. We like the stability of our natural gas pipelines business and the customers we serve, and we'll continue to develop additional fee-based and market-driven long-term growth and export opportunities in and around our asset footprint.
I'd like to close by providing an update on our ethane opportunity outlook. For the past 3 years, our industry has experienced an unprecedented period of heavy and prolonged ethane rejection. The partnership continued, even in the face of sustained ethane rejection, to increase our natural gas liquids volumes, gathered and fractionated. We are starting to see ethane process improve in relation to natural gas as a result of improving NGL process and weakened natural gas, increases in NGL exports and expected incremental ethane demand from new world-scale petrochemical crackers.
Since last quarter, we've seen ethane recovery economics improve. Some natural gas processing plants on our system had intermittently started to recover ethane, we expect -- which we expect to continue throughout 2016. We continue to expect a meaningful amount of processing plants to move into full ethane -- full recovery in early 2017.
We averaged 175,000 barrels per day of ethane rejection on our system in the first quarter, and we expect anywhere from 175,000 to 200,000 barrels per day of ethane rejection on our system as new natural gas plants we are connected to continue to ramp up and as we see the impacts of increased volumes in the Williston, STACK and SCOOP plays throughout 2016. We are well-positioned to benefit from this ethane opportunity and have more than enough infrastructure to bring these incremental barrels, or approximately $200 million in annual earnings, to our system with no additional capital requirements.
We also have the opportunity to utilize our assets to capture pricing differentials if any dislocations in pricing occur between the Conway, Kansas and Mont Belvieu, Texas market centers as a result of increasing ethane demand.
Ethane recovery presents a major opportunity for ONEOK and ONEOK Partners, but it certainly isn't our only opportunity. We remain focused on additional fee-based growth opportunities for our businesses, cost-effective ways to enhance our assets and employee retention efforts so we're fully prepared when market conditions improve.
Congratulations to our employees on a solid first quarter. We continue to face headwinds from challenging industry conditions, but we've shown once again that we're uniquely positioned to handle these challenges and deliver on the financial results we've laid out for ourselves and our investors.
Thank you to all of our stakeholders for your continued support of ONEOK and ONEOK Partners.

And so I think I understand, based on bundle costs and how that works economically, and you guys have said basically, that Bakken would theoretically be one of the later basins to be called. But I'm also curious, too, because I know you referred to some of your services being nondiscretionary in the past that, and it's not like ethane economics, specifically, is going to drive drilling in the Bakken. So I'm curious, is there a way to look at or think about pipeline specs in the Bakken? And sort of as things come back to sort of forced ethane recovery and how that might impact you, is there any way to be certain -- numerically think about that? Or is that still something that we'll just have to kind of wait on?"

We may periodically, in certain specific locations, depending upon the locations of those pipes to end user, we'd sometimes do have some issues with the respective quality specs. But I don't see quality specs being a big driver for ethane emergence in the Bakken, nor really anywhere else for that matter. When we talk about these nondiscretionary services, we talk about producers have to have the process and they've got to have the liquids extracted from the gas in order to meet quality specs, ethane tends to be one of those -- is one of those NGLs that can be -- can easily go into to the gas stream and be diluted without causing much of a problem. Unless you've got industrial customers or commercial customers, right near -- located pretty -- in pretty close proximity to the processing plant. Okay? That help you?"

On this conference call is Walt Hulse, Executive Vice President of Strategic Planning and Corporate Affairs; Derek Reiners, Chief Financial Officer; and Senior Vice President, Wes Christensen, Operations; Sheridan Swords, Natural Gas Liquids; Kevin Burdick, Natural Gas Gathering and Processing; and Phill May, Natural Gas Pipelines.
I'll begin with a few opening remarks, then Derek will give a brief financial update, and then I will wrap up with highlights of the first quarter, our outlook for the remainder of the year and our ethane opportunity.
To begin, first quarter 2016 performance was a result of the progress made last year by continuing to focus on increasing our fee-based earnings, reducing commodity price risk in our businesses, project execution and making prudent financial decisions, all while continuing to operate safely and responsibly.
In these challenging market conditions, we have relied on our strengths, which for ONEOK Partners, are predominantly fee-based earnings, our uniquely positioned assets and our dedicated employees. Our competitive advantage is our integrated network of assets that fit and work well together. Our 37,000-mile network of pipelines, processing plants and fractionators are well-positioned to withstand the cyclical nature of the industry.
Our assets in the Williston Basin have served us well, and we continue to benefit from the basin's large natural gas reserve base and inventory of flared, NGL-rich natural gas. Our natural gas pipeline segment remains well-positioned to expand its fee-based natural gas export capabilities, particularly to Mexico, where we have key relationships through our joint venture, Roadrunner Gas Transmission pipeline. And our extensive natural gas liquids business maintains a growing position in the Rockies, Texas and emerging STACK and SCOOP plays in Oklahoma, providing us a large and diverse supply base with which to serve our end-use customers.
The partnership's distribution coverage increased to 1.06x in the first quarter, up from 1.03x in the fourth quarter 2015 and significantly higher compared to the beginning of 2015, which is a reflection of our increasing stable cash flow as we now have a significant amount of infrastructure completed and are able to harvest earnings, particularly in the gathering and processing and natural gas liquids businesses.
ONEOK Partners' first quarter 2016 adjusted EBITDA of approximately $445 million represents a nearly 40% increase compared with the first quarter 2015. 
Executing on our growth projects, contract restructuring, capital and cost savings and consistent operations were key drivers to delivering the greatly improved results from a year ago, even in the face of deteriorating industry fundamentals throughout 2015. From an operating perspective, the volume growth across our businesses, increased fee-based earnings and ongoing cost reduction efforts across ONEOK Partners business segments have all contributed to a solid first quarter and positive outlook for the remainder of 2016. 
In the midst of some of the industry's most challenging conditions, our employees once again performed exceptionally well by successfully executing on our strategies to mitigate risk, reduce capital spending and operating cost and manage our balance sheet. It is through their hard work and determination that our company delivered impressive results quarter after quarter in 2015, and we remain as committed as ever to delivering even better results in 2016.
Through our key strategies and well-managed and operated assets, our employees have, with a high sense of urgency, met the challenge, just as they have many times in the past. I'd like to thank them for their hard work and commitment to deliver value to the bottom line safely and reliably.
We'll cover each of the segments in more detail later in the call. But first, I'd like to have Derek give us a brief financial update.
Derek?"

Both ONEOK and ONEOK Partners ended the first quarter in a strong financial position, with healthy balance sheets and ample financial flexibility. As Terry mentioned, ONEOK Partners' first quarter distribution coverage is 1.06x. ONEOK's",600,"Thank you, Terry. Both ONEOK and ONEOK Partners ended the first quarter in a strong financial position, with healthy balance sheets and ample financial flexibility. As Terry mentioned, ONEOK Partners' first quarter distribution coverage is 1.06x. ONEOK's first quarter dividend coverage was 1.31x, which together with cash on hand entering the year, maintains ONEOK's flexibility to provide financial support to the partnership if needed.
In yesterday's earnings news releases, we maintained our 2016 financial guidance expectations for both ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. Our proactive financial actions in 2015 and early 2016 and enhanced earnings from the partnership has allowed the partnership to deliver on distribution coverage while also reducing leverage. 
The partnership's capital expenditure guidance remains $600 million, including $140 million of maintenance capital for 2016, as the reliability and integrity of our assets is the foundation of our success. However, we are seeing aggressive bidding from our vendors on maintenance projects, and the timing associated with our maintenance activities can vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter due to seasonal impacts and varying maintenance cycles across our ever-changing asset base.
Typically, our maintenance capital spending is lower in the first quarter. Sequentially, maintenance capital decreased $8 million in the first quarter, primarily due to our maintenance project plan for the quarter having fewer projects compared to the fourth quarter, which is not unusual when compared to our historical spending profile. We are on plan for our scheduled maintenance projects for 2016.
Similarly, as it relates to operating cost, we continue to see competitive, lower pricing and rates from service providers, and we have significantly reduced contract labor across all of our segments. In the first quarter, we realized a $15 million sequential decrease in operating cost. And as Terry mentioned, we continue to focus on internal operating cost reduction efforts company-wide. We expect these cost savings to continue throughout the year.
In January, ONEOK Partners entered into a $1 billion 3-year unsecured term loan, effectively refinancing our 2016 debt maturities and enhancing financial flexibility. With approximately $1.9 billion of capacity available on the ONEOK Partners credit facility at the end of the first quarter, the reduction of more than $2.2 billion in capital growth projects in 2 years and higher earnings, the partnership does not need to access public debt or equity markets well into 2017.
The partnership continues to progress towards deleveraging, as our trailing 12-months GAAP debt-to-EBITDA improved to 4.5x at March 31, and we continue to expect annual debt -- GAAP debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 4.2x for the full year 2016 as a result of prudent financial, operating and commercial execution. As always, we remain committed to the partnership's investment-grade credit ratings.
On a standalone basis, ONEOK ended the first quarter with nearly $130 million of cash, and expects to have approximately $250 million of cash by year-end 2016 and an undrawn $300 million credit facility, allowing us financial flexibility as we continue to navigate a challenging market environment.
In February, we provided detailed information our counterparty credit risk. We have included similar information again this year in our Form 10-Q, but there haven't been any substantive changes. We have a very high quality customer base and no material counterparty credit concerns. The majority of our top customers are large petrochemical and integrated oil companies which have a higher tolerance for volatility in commodity prices. Our track record of prudent and proactive financial decisions during uncertain times results in ample liquidity, 2 strong balance sheets and a strong customer base. ONEOK and ONEOK Partners remain well-positioned to withstand the volatile commodity and financial market environment.
Terry, That concludes my remarks."

Let's take a closer look at each of our business segments.
In the natural gas liquids segment, volumes continued to increase year-over-year, with the first quarter 2016 volumes gathered up 6% and volumes fractionated up 16% compared with the first quarter 2015. Compared with the fourth quarter 2015, volumes gathered and fractionated were lower, primarily due to decreased spot volumes, higher ethane rejection and seasonal impacts. We continue to expect NGL volumes to be weighted towards the second half of the year, as incremental volumes from new natural gas processing plant connections continue to ramp-up.
In the first quarter, we connected 3 additional third-party plants to our NGL system, and we continue to see volumes ramp at the 8 plants we connected in 2015. We expect to connect 1 additional third-party plant this year in addition to completing and connecting our 80 million cubic feet per day Bear Creek plant in the Williston Basin, where additional flared natural gas remains ready to come online.
Williston Basin NGL volumes, our highest margin NGL volumes, with bundled rates more than 3x those in other regions, remained strong in the first quarter. The average volume gathered on our Bakken NGL Pipeline increased nearly 12% compared with the fourth quarter 2015, driven by the completion of the Lonesome Creek plant in November 2015 and compression project. I'll also talk about ethane and provide an update on our ethane opportunity outlook in just a moment.
As it relates to the West Texas LPG system, in July 2015, we increased rates on the system to be more in line with market rates. In March, the Texas Railroad Commission suspended the rate increase until it is determined by the Commission if the rates are in line with the market. We are confident that our increased rates are just and reasonable and in line with the market. However, regardless of the outcome of the pending case, our current 2016 financial guidance remains as indicated. As you all can appreciate, due to the legal process now underway with the Railroad Commission, it will not be prudent at this time for us to discuss this case in any more detail. We will provide future updates or commentary when and if it is appropriate.
In the natural gas gathering and processing segment, Williston Basin volumes were a key driver to our first quarter performance. Our natural gas volumes processed reached 810 million cubic feet per day, as we captured previously flared gas and connected new wells to our system. Average natural gas volumes processed in the Williston increased 44% in the first quarter 2016 compared with the first quarter last year and increased 6% compared with the fourth quarter 2015.
Our producer customers continued to drive improvements in initial production rates through enhanced completion techniques, and combined with the higher natural gas to oil ratios in the core areas, where virtually all of our new wells are being connected, have helped offset the reduction in drilling and completion activity. We will continue to benefit from the more than 820 wells connected in 2015 and the 115 wells connected to our system in the first quarter 2016. The vast majority of these high-performing wells are in the most productive areas of Williams, McKenzie and Dunn Counties in North Dakota, where we have more than 1 million acres dedicated to us and an extensive network of interconnected gathering lines, compression and processing plants. There are currently 900 drilled but uncompleted wells in the basin, with nearly 400 on our acreage. 
We saw a decline in the drilling rig count across the Williston Basin during the first quarter and currently have approximately 15 rigs operating on our acreage under dedication. 
Flared natural gas in North Dakota was reported at approximately 185 million cubic feet per day for the state in February, with approximately 70 million to 80 million cubic feet per day on our system. This continues to present an opportunity for us, as we add processing capacity to our system in the third quarter 2016 with the completion of our Bear Creek natural gas processing plant.
In the Mid-Continent, first quarter 2016 processed volumes increased 8% compared with fourth quarter 2015 volumes. Similar to the Williston, our producer customers continue to drive significant increases in initial production rates through enhanced completion techniques, especially in the STACK, Cana-Woodford and SCOOP plays. 
Producer delays on completions of some large multi-well pads are expected to impact our volumes over the next several months and potentially through the remainder of 2016. However, with the recent improvement in commodity prices and breakevens in the STACK competing favorably with the best plays in the country, we could see acceleration of the delayed completions.
Contract restructuring in the natural gas gathering and processing segment has significantly decreased the segment's commodity price sensitivity and was another major contributor to the partnership's first quarter results. The segment's average fee rate increased to $0.68 per MMBtu compared with $0.35 in the same period last year and $0.55 in the fourth quarter 2015. We expect the segment's earnings to increase to more than 75% fee-based this year, driven by these contract restructuring efforts.
Moving on to the natural gas pipelines segment. First quarter results remained steady, as the segment continued to provide the partnership with stable, predominantly fee-based earnings. The segment completed 2 capital growth projects in March: The first phase of the Roadrunner Gas Transmission pipeline project; and a compressor station expansion project on our Midwestern Gas Transmission pipeline, which will add an additional 170 million cubic feet per day of capacity to the pipeline.
The Roadrunner project is fully subscribed under 25-year firm fee-based commitments, and the second phase of Roadrunner is expected to be complete in the first quarter 2017. Additionally, the Midwestern Gas Transmission expansion is also fully subscribed under 15-year firm fee-based commitments.
Our natural gas pipelines segment is primarily market-connected, meaning, we are directly connected with large, stable customers who provide services to end users. These customers, such as large utility companies, electric generation facilities and industrials, have specific volume needs that don't fluctuate based on commodity prices. Additionally, we work closely with these customers to design our systems to fit their specific needs. Unlike basis-driven pipelines, there is minimal financial risk associated with our natural gas pipelines or our customers. We like the stability of our natural gas pipelines business and the customers we serve, and we'll continue to develop additional fee-based and market-driven long-term growth and export opportunities in and around our asset footprint.
I'd like to close by providing an update on our ethane opportunity outlook. For the past 3 years, our industry has experienced an unprecedented period of heavy and prolonged ethane rejection. The partnership continued, even in the face of sustained ethane rejection, to increase our natural gas liquids volumes, gathered and fractionated. We are starting to see ethane process improve in relation to natural gas as a result of improving NGL process and weakened natural gas, increases in NGL exports and expected incremental ethane demand from new world-scale petrochemical crackers.
Since last quarter, we've seen ethane recovery economics improve. Some natural gas processing plants on our system had intermittently started to recover ethane, we expect -- which we expect to continue throughout 2016. We continue to expect a meaningful amount of processing plants to move into full ethane -- full recovery in early 2017.
We averaged 175,000 barrels per day of ethane rejection on our system in the first quarter, and we expect anywhere from 175,000 to 200,000 barrels per day of ethane rejection on our system as new natural gas plants we are connected to continue to ramp up and as we see the impacts of increased volumes in the Williston, STACK and SCOOP plays throughout 2016. We are well-positioned to benefit from this ethane opportunity and have more than enough infrastructure to bring these incremental barrels, or approximately $200 million in annual earnings, to our system with no additional capital requirements.
We also have the opportunity to utilize our assets to capture pricing differentials if any dislocations in pricing occur between the Conway, Kansas and Mont Belvieu, Texas market centers as a result of increasing ethane demand.
Ethane recovery presents a major opportunity for ONEOK and ONEOK Partners, but it certainly isn't our only opportunity. We remain focused on additional fee-based growth opportunities for our businesses, cost-effective ways to enhance our assets and employee retention efforts so we're fully prepared when market conditions improve.
Congratulations to our employees on a solid first quarter. We continue to face headwinds from challenging industry conditions, but we've shown once again that we're uniquely positioned to handle these challenges and deliver on the financial results we've laid out for ourselves and our investors.
Thank you to all of our stakeholders for your continued support of ONEOK and ONEOK Partners.

But I'm also curious, too, because I know you referred to some of your services being nondiscretionary in the past that, and it's not like ethane economics, specifically, is going to drive drilling in the Bakken. So I'm curious, is there a way to look at or think about pipeline specs in the Bakken?

When we talk about these nondiscretionary services, we talk about producers have to have the process and they've got to have the liquids extracted from the gas in order to meet quality specs, ethane tends to be one of those -- is one of those NGLs that can be -- can easily go into to the gas stream and be diluted without causing much of a problem.

But do you think over the longer term we could be short ethane? This would imply that ethane price could approach NAFTA prices."

Good morning, and thank you for joining today. As always, we appreciate your continued interest and investment in ONEOK and ONEOK Partners.
On this conference call is Walt Hulse, Executive Vice President of Strategic Planning and Corporate Affairs; Derek Reiners, Chief Financial Officer; and Senior Vice Presidents, Wes Christensen, Operations; Sheridan Swords, Natural Gas Liquids; Kevin Burdick, Natural Gas Gathering and Processing; and Phill May, Natural Gas Pipelines.
I'll begin with a few opening remarks, then Derek will give a brief financial update, and then I will wrap up with highlights of the first quarter, our outlook for the remainder of the year and our ethane opportunity.
To begin, first quarter 2016 performance was a result of the progress made last year by continuing to focus on increasing our fee-based earnings, reducing commodity price risk in our businesses, project execution and making prudent financial decisions, all while continuing to operate safely and responsibly.
In these challenging market conditions, we have relied on our strengths, which for ONEOK Partners, are predominantly fee-based earnings, our uniquely positioned assets and our dedicated employees. Our competitive advantage is our integrated network of assets that fit and work well together. Our 37,000-mile network of pipelines, processing plants and fractionators are well-positioned to withstand the cyclical nature of the industry.
Our assets in the Williston Basin have served us well, and we continue to benefit from the basin's large natural gas reserve base and inventory of flared, NGL-rich natural gas. Our natural gas pipeline segment remains well-positioned to expand its fee-based natural gas export capabilities, particularly to Mexico, where we have key relationships through our joint venture, Roadrunner Gas Transmission pipeline. And our extensive natural gas liquids business maintains a growing position in the Rockies, Texas and emerging STACK and SCOOP plays in Oklahoma, providing us a large and diverse supply base with which to serve our end-use customers.
The partnership's distribution coverage increased to 1.06x in the first quarter, up from 1.03x in the fourth quarter 2015 and significantly higher compared to the beginning of 2015, which is a reflection of our increasing stable cash flow as we now have a significant amount of infrastructure completed and are able to harvest earnings, particularly in the gathering and processing and natural gas liquids businesses.
ONEOK Partners' first quarter 2016 adjusted EBITDA of approximately $445 million represents a nearly 40% increase compared with the first quarter 2015. 
Executing on our growth projects, contract restructuring, capital and cost savings and consistent operations were key drivers to delivering the greatly improved results from a year ago, even in the face of deteriorating industry fundamentals throughout 2015. From an operating perspective, the volume growth across our businesses, increased fee-based earnings and ongoing cost reduction efforts across ONEOK Partners business segments have all contributed to a solid first quarter and positive outlook for the remainder of 2016. 
In the midst of some of the industry's most challenging conditions, our employees once again performed exceptionally well by successfully executing on our strategies to mitigate risk, reduce capital spending and operating costs and manage our balance sheet. It is through their hard work and determination that our company delivered impressive results quarter after quarter in 2015, and we remain as committed as ever to delivering even better results in 2016.
Through our key strategies and well-managed and operated assets, our employees have, with a high sense of urgency, met the challenge, just as they have many times in the past. I'd like to thank them for their hard work and commitment to deliver value to the bottom line safely and reliably.
We'll cover each of the segments in more detail later in the call. But first, I'd like to have Derek give us a brief financial update.

Both ONEOK and ONEOK Partners ended the first quarter in a strong financial position, with healthy balance sheets and ample financial flexibility. As Terry mentioned, ONEOK Partners' first quarter distribution coverage is 1.06x. ONEOK's",601,"Thank you, Terry. Both ONEOK and ONEOK Partners ended the first quarter in a strong financial position, with healthy balance sheets and ample financial flexibility. As Terry mentioned, ONEOK Partners' first quarter distribution coverage is 1.06x. ONEOK's first quarter dividend coverage was 1.31x, which together with cash on hand entering the year, maintains ONEOK's flexibility to provide financial support to the partnership if needed.
In yesterday's earnings news releases, we maintained our 2016 financial guidance expectations for both ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. Our proactive financial actions in 2015 and early 2016 and enhanced earnings from the partnership has allowed the partnership to deliver on distribution coverage while also reducing leverage. 
The partnership's capital expenditure guidance remains $600 million, including $140 million of maintenance capital for 2016, as the reliability and integrity of our assets is the foundation of our success. However, we are seeing aggressive bidding from our vendors on maintenance projects, and the timing associated with our maintenance activities can vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter due to seasonal impacts and varying maintenance cycles across our ever-changing asset base.
Typically, our maintenance capital spending is lower in the first quarter. Sequentially, maintenance capital decreased $8 million in the first quarter, primarily due to our maintenance project plan for the quarter having fewer projects compared to the fourth quarter, which is not unusual when compared to our historical spending profile. We are on plan for our scheduled maintenance projects for 2016.
Similarly, as it relates to operating costs, we continue to see competitive, lower pricing and rates from service providers, and we have significantly reduced contract labor across all of our segments. In the first quarter, we realized a $15 million sequential decrease in operating costs. And as Terry mentioned, we continue to focus on internal operating cost reduction efforts company-wide. We expect these cost savings to continue throughout the year.
In January, ONEOK Partners entered into a $1 billion 3-year unsecured term loan, effectively refinancing our 2016 debt maturities and enhancing financial flexibility. With approximately $1.9 billion of capacity available on the ONEOK Partners credit facility at the end of the first quarter, the reduction of more than $2.2 billion in capital growth projects in 2 years and higher earnings, the partnership does not need to access public debt or equity markets well into 2017.
The partnership continues to progress towards deleveraging, as our trailing 12-months GAAP debt-to-EBITDA improved to 4.5x at March 31, and we continue to expect annual debt -- GAAP debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 4.2x for the full year 2016 as a result of prudent financial, operating and commercial execution. As always, we remain committed to the partnership's investment-grade credit ratings.
On a standalone basis, ONEOK ended the first quarter with nearly $130 million of cash, and expects to have approximately $250 million of cash by year-end 2016 and an undrawn $300 million credit facility, allowing us financial flexibility as we continue to navigate a challenging market environment.
In February, we provided detailed information on our counterparty credit risk. We have included similar information again this year in our Form 10-Q, but there haven't been any substantive changes. We have a very high quality customer base and no material counterparty credit concerns. The majority of our top customers are large petrochemical and integrated oil companies which have a higher tolerance for volatility in commodity prices. Our track record of prudent and proactive financial decisions during uncertain times results in ample liquidity, 2 strong balance sheets and a strong customer base. ONEOK and ONEOK Partners remain well-positioned to withstand the volatile commodity and financial market environment.
Terry, That concludes my remarks."

Let's take a closer look at each of our business segments.In the natural gas liquids segment, volumes continued to increase year-over-year, with the first quarter 2016 volumes gathered up 6% and volumes fractionated up 16% compared wit",1484,"Thank you, Derek. Let's take a closer look at each of our business segments.
In the natural gas liquids segment, volumes continued to increase year-over-year, with the first quarter 2016 volumes gathered up 6% and volumes fractionated up 16% compared with the first quarter 2015. Compared with the fourth quarter 2015, volumes gathered and fractionated were lower, primarily due to decreased spot volumes, higher ethane rejection and seasonal impacts. We continue to expect NGL volumes to be weighted towards the second half of the year, as incremental volumes from new natural gas processing plant connections continue to ramp-up.
In the first quarter, we connected 3 additional third-party plants to our NGL system, and we continued to see volumes ramp at the 8 plants we connected in 2015. We expect to connect 1 additional third-party plant this year in addition to completing and connecting our 80 million cubic feet per day Bear Creek plant in the Williston Basin, where additional flared natural gas remains ready to come online.
Williston Basin NGL volumes, our highest margin NGL volumes, with bundled rates more than 3x those in other regions, remained strong in the first quarter. The average volume gathered on our Bakken NGL Pipeline increased nearly 12% compared with the fourth quarter 2015, driven by the completion of the Lonesome Creek plant in November 2015 and compression projects. I'll also talk about ethane and provide an update on our ethane opportunity outlook in just a moment.
As it relates to the West Texas LPG system, in July 2015, we increased rates on the system to be more in line with market rates. In March, the Texas Railroad Commission suspended the rate increase until it is determined by the Commission if the rates are in line with the market. We are confident that our increased rates are just and reasonable and in line with the market. However, regardless of the outcome of the pending case, our current 2016 financial guidance remains as indicated. As you all can appreciate, due to the legal process now underway with the Railroad Commission, it will not be prudent at this time for us to discuss this case in any more detail. We will provide future updates or commentary when and if it is appropriate.
In the natural gas gathering and processing segment, Williston Basin volumes were a key driver to our first quarter performance. Our natural gas volumes processed reached 810 million cubic feet per day, as we captured previously flared gas and connected new wells to our system. Average natural gas volumes processed in the Williston increased 44% in the first quarter 2016 compared with the first quarter last year and increased 6% compared with the fourth quarter 2015.
Our producer customers continued to drive improvements in initial production rates through enhanced completion techniques, and combined with the higher natural gas to oil ratios in the core areas, where virtually all of our new wells are being connected, have helped offset the reduction in drilling and completion activity. We will continue to benefit from the more than 820 wells connected in 2015 and the 115 wells connected to our system in the first quarter 2016. The vast majority of these high-performing wells are in the most productive areas of Williams, McKenzie and Dunn Counties in North Dakota, where we have more than 1 million acres dedicated to us and an extensive network of interconnected gathering lines, compression and processing plants. There are currently 900 drilled but uncompleted wells in the basin, with nearly 400 on our acreage. 
We saw a decline in the drilling rig count across the Williston Basin during the first quarter and currently have approximately 15 rigs operating on our acreage under dedication. 
Flared natural gas in North Dakota was reported at approximately 185 million cubic feet per day for the state in February, with approximately 70 million to 80 million cubic feet per day on our system. This continues to present an opportunity for us, as we add processing capacity to our system in the third quarter 2016 with the completion of our Bear Creek natural gas processing plant.
In the Mid-Continent, first quarter 2016 processed volumes increased 8% compared with fourth quarter 2015 volumes. Similar to the Williston, our producer customers continue to drive significant increases in initial production rates through enhanced completion techniques, especially in the STACK, Cana-Woodford and SCOOP plays. 
Producer delays on completions of some large multi-well pads are expected to impact our volumes over the next several months and potentially through the remainder of 2016. However, with the recent improvement in commodity prices and breakevens in the STACK competing favorably with the best plays in the country, we could see acceleration of the delayed completions.
Contract restructuring in the natural gas gathering and processing segment has significantly decreased the segment's commodity price sensitivity and was another major contributor to the partnership's first quarter results. The segment's average fee rate increased to $0.68 per MMBtu compared with $0.35 in the same period last year and $0.55 in the fourth quarter 2015. We expect the segment's earnings to increase to more than 75% fee-based this year, driven by these contract restructuring efforts.
Moving on to the natural gas pipelines segment. First quarter results remained steady, as the segment continued to provide the partnership with stable, predominantly fee-based earnings. The segment completed 2 capital growth projects in March: The first phase of the Roadrunner Gas Transmission pipeline project; and a compressor station expansion project on our Midwestern Gas Transmission pipeline, which will add an additional 170 million cubic feet per day of capacity to the pipeline.
The Roadrunner project is fully subscribed under 25-year firm fee-based commitments, and the second phase of Roadrunner is expected to be complete in the first quarter 2017. Additionally, the Midwestern Gas Transmission expansion is also fully subscribed under 15-year firm fee-based commitments.
Our natural gas pipelines segment is primarily market-connected, meaning, we are directly connected with large, stable customers who provide services to end users. These customers, such as large utility companies, electric generation facilities and industrials, have specific volume needs that don't fluctuate based on commodity prices. Additionally, we work closely with these customers to design our systems to fit their specific needs. Unlike basis-driven pipelines, there is minimal financial risk associated with our natural gas pipelines or our customers. We like the stability of our natural gas pipelines business and the customers we serve, and we'll continue to develop additional fee-based and market-driven long-term growth and export opportunities in and around our asset footprint.
I'd like to close by providing an update on our ethane opportunity outlook. For the past 3 years, our industry has experienced an unprecedented period of heavy and prolonged ethane rejection. The partnership continued, even in the face of sustained ethane rejection, to increase our natural gas liquids volumes, gathered and fractionated. We are starting to see ethane prices improve in relation to natural gas as a result of improving NGL process and weakened natural gas, increases in NGL exports and expected incremental ethane demand from new world-scale petrochemical crackers.
Since last quarter, we've seen ethane recovery economics improve. Some natural gas processing plants on our system have intermittently started to recover ethane, we expect -- which we expect to continue throughout 2016. We continue to expect a meaningful amount of processing plants to move into full ethane -- full recovery in early 2017.
We averaged 175,000 barrels per day of ethane rejection on our system in the first quarter, and we expect anywhere from 175,000 to 200,000 barrels per day of ethane rejection on our system, as new natural gas plants we are connected to continue to ramp up and as we see the impacts of increased volumes in the Williston, STACK and SCOOP plays throughout 2016. We are well-positioned to benefit from this ethane opportunity and have more than enough infrastructure to bring these incremental barrels, or approximately $200 million in annual earnings, to our system with no additional capital requirements.
We also have the opportunity to utilize our assets to capture pricing differentials if any dislocations in pricing occur between the Conway, Kansas and Mont Belvieu, Texas market centers as a result of increasing ethane demand.
Ethane recovery presents a major opportunity for ONEOK and ONEOK Partners, but it certainly isn't our only opportunity. We remain focused on additional fee-based growth opportunities for our businesses, cost-effective ways to enhance our assets and employee retention efforts so we're fully prepared when market conditions improve.
Congratulations to our employees on a solid first quarter. We continue to face headwinds from challenging industry conditions, but we've shown once again that we're uniquely positioned to handle these challenges and deliver on the financial results we've laid out for ourselves and our investors.
Thank you to all of our stakeholders for your continued support of ONEOK and ONEOK Partners.

But I'm also curious, too, because I know you referred to some of your services being nondiscretionary in the past, and it's not like ethane economics, specifically, is going to drive drilling in the Bakken. So I'm curious, is there a way to look at or think about pipeline specs in the Bakken? And sort of as things come back to sort of forced ethane recovery and how that might impact you, is there any way to sort of numerically think about that? Or is that still something that we'll just have to kind of wait on?"

We may periodically, in certain specific locations, depending upon the locations of those pipes to end user, we sometimes do have some issues with respect to quality specs. But I don't see quality specs being a big driver for ethane emergence in the Bakken, nor really anywhere else for that matter. When we talk about these nondiscretionary services, we talk about producers have to have the processing and they've got to have the liquids extracted from the gas in order to meet quality specs, ethane tends to be one of those -- is one of those NGLs that can be -- can easily go into to the gas stream and be diluted without causing much of a problem. Unless you've got industrial customers or commercial customers, right near -- located pretty -- in pretty close proximity to the processing plant. Okay? That help you?"

One is, as we look at our flaring, keep in mind, there's probably 30 million to 40 million behind Bear Creek. So when we bring Bear Creek online, we expect that a chunk, approximately half of that, will get put out with that -- as that plant comes up. As for the other, yes, there will always be some level of flaring that occurs. But we do have quite a bit, we've got some headroom from both our field infrastructure and processing plants. So was new wells come online, I don't know that, that would contribute much to the flaring. So I do think we expect that number will go down significantly as we move into the back half of the year once Bear Creek's up. And yes, when you look at the numbers over the last few months, it does appear that some of the reporting has been conservative for overall -- for total kind of state-wide flaring."

Good morning, and thank you for joining today. As always, we appreciate your continued interest and investment in ONEOK and ONEOK Partners.
On this conference call is Walt Hulse, Executive Vice President of Strategic Planning and Corporate Affairs; Derek Reiners, Chief Financial Officer; and Senior Vice Presidents, Wes Christensen, Operations; Sheridan Swords, Natural Gas Liquids; Kevin Burdick, Natural Gas Gathering and Processing; and Phill May, Natural Gas Pipelines.
I'll begin with a few opening remarks, then Derek will give a brief financial update, and then I will wrap up with highlights of the first quarter, our outlook for the remainder of the year and our ethane opportunity.
To begin, first quarter 2016 performance was a result of the progress made last year by continuing to focus on increasing our fee-based earnings, reducing commodity price risk in our businesses, project execution and making prudent financial decisions, all while continuing to operate safely and responsibly.
In these challenging market conditions, we have relied on our strengths, which for ONEOK Partners, are predominantly fee-based earnings, our uniquely positioned assets and our dedicated employees. Our competitive advantage is our integrated network of assets that fit and work well together. Our 37,000-mile network of pipelines, processing plants and fractionators are well-positioned to withstand the cyclical nature of the industry.
Our assets in the Williston Basin have served us well, and we continue to benefit from the basin's large natural gas reserve base and inventory of flared, NGL-rich natural gas. Our natural gas pipeline segment remains well-positioned to expand its fee-based natural gas export capabilities, particularly to Mexico, where we have key relationships through our joint venture, Roadrunner Gas Transmission pipeline. And our extensive natural gas liquids business maintains a growing position in the Rockies, Texas and emerging STACK and SCOOP plays in Oklahoma, providing us a large and diverse supply base with which to serve our end-use customers.
The partnership's distribution coverage increased to 1.06x in the first quarter, up from 1.03x in the fourth quarter 2015 and significantly higher compared to the beginning of 2015, which is a reflection of our increasing stable cash flow as we now have a significant amount of infrastructure completed and are able to harvest earnings, particularly in the gathering and processing and natural gas liquids businesses.
ONEOK Partners' first quarter 2016 adjusted EBITDA of approximately $445 million represents a nearly 40% increase compared with the first quarter 2015. 
Executing on our growth projects, contract restructuring, capital and cost savings and consistent operations were key drivers to delivering the greatly improved results from a year ago, even in the face of deteriorating industry fundamentals throughout 2015. From an operating perspective, the volume growth across our businesses, increased fee-based earnings and ongoing cost reduction efforts across ONEOK Partners business segments have all contributed to a solid first quarter and positive outlook for the remainder of 2016. 
In the midst of some of the industry's most challenging conditions, our employees once again performed exceptionally well by successfully executing on our strategies to mitigate risk, reduce capital spending and operating costs and manage our balance sheet. It is through their hard work and determination that our company delivered impressive results quarter after quarter in 2015, and we remain as committed as ever to delivering even better results in 2016.
Through our key strategies and well-managed and operated assets, our employees have, with a high sense of urgency, met the challenge, just as they have many times in the past. I'd like to thank them for their hard work and commitment to deliver value to the bottom line safely and reliably.
We'll cover each of the segments in more detail later in the call. But first, I'd like to have Derek give us a brief financial update.

293889,331146631,973316,"ONEOK Inc., ONEOK Partners, L.P., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 04, 2016",2016-05-04,"Earnings Calls","ONEOK, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Terry. Both ONEOK and ONEOK Partners ended the first quarter in a strong financial position, with healthy balance sheets and ample financial flexibility. As Terry mentioned, ONEOK Partners' first quarter distribution coverage is 1.06x. ONEOK's",601,"Thank you, Terry. Both ONEOK and ONEOK Partners ended the first quarter in a strong financial position, with healthy balance sheets and ample financial flexibility. As Terry mentioned, ONEOK Partners' first quarter distribution coverage is 1.06x. ONEOK's first quarter dividend coverage was 1.31x, which together with cash on hand entering the year, maintains ONEOK's flexibility to provide financial support to the partnership if needed.
In yesterday's earnings news releases, we maintained our 2016 financial guidance expectations for both ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. Our proactive financial actions in 2015 and early 2016 and enhanced earnings from the partnership has allowed the partnership to deliver on distribution coverage while also reducing leverage. 
The partnership's capital expenditure guidance remains $600 million, including $140 million of maintenance capital for 2016, as the reliability and integrity of our assets is the foundation of our success. However, we are seeing aggressive bidding from our vendors on maintenance projects, and the timing associated with our maintenance activities can vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter due to seasonal impacts and varying maintenance cycles across our ever-changing asset base.
Typically, our maintenance capital spending is lower in the first quarter. Sequentially, maintenance capital decreased $8 million in the first quarter, primarily due to our maintenance project plan for the quarter having fewer projects compared to the fourth quarter, which is not unusual when compared to our historical spending profile. We are on plan for our scheduled maintenance projects for 2016.
Similarly, as it relates to operating costs, we continue to see competitive, lower pricing and rates from service providers, and we have significantly reduced contract labor across all of our segments. In the first quarter, we realized a $15 million sequential decrease in operating costs. And as Terry mentioned, we continue to focus on internal operating cost reduction efforts company-wide. We expect these cost savings to continue throughout the year.
In January, ONEOK Partners entered into a $1 billion 3-year unsecured term loan, effectively refinancing our 2016 debt maturities and enhancing financial flexibility. With approximately $1.9 billion of capacity available on the ONEOK Partners credit facility at the end of the first quarter, the reduction of more than $2.2 billion in capital growth projects in 2 years and higher earnings, the partnership does not need to access public debt or equity markets well into 2017.
The partnership continues to progress towards deleveraging, as our trailing 12-months GAAP debt-to-EBITDA improved to 4.5x at March 31, and we continue to expect annual debt -- GAAP debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 4.2x for the full year 2016 as a result of prudent financial, operating and commercial execution. As always, we remain committed to the partnership's investment-grade credit ratings.
On a standalone basis, ONEOK ended the first quarter with nearly $130 million of cash, and expects to have approximately $250 million of cash by year-end 2016 and an undrawn $300 million credit facility, allowing us financial flexibility as we continue to navigate a challenging market environment.
In February, we provided detailed information on our counterparty credit risk. We have included similar information again this year in our Form 10-Q, but there haven't been any substantive changes. We have a very high quality customer base and no material counterparty credit concerns. The majority of our top customers are large petrochemical and integrated oil companies which have a higher tolerance for volatility in commodity prices. Our track record of prudent and proactive financial decisions during uncertain times results in ample liquidity, 2 strong balance sheets and a strong customer base. ONEOK and ONEOK Partners remain well-positioned to withstand the volatile commodity and financial market environment.
Terry, that concludes my remarks."

Let's take a closer look at each of our business segments.
In the natural gas liquids segment, volumes continued to increase year-over-year, with the first quarter 2016 volumes gathered up 6% and volumes fractionated up 16% compared with the first quarter 2015. Compared with the fourth quarter 2015, volumes gathered and fractionated were lower, primarily due to decreased spot volumes, higher ethane rejection and seasonal impacts. We continue to expect NGL volumes to be weighted towards the second half of the year, as incremental volumes from new natural gas processing plant connections continue to ramp-up.
In the first quarter, we connected 3 additional third-party plants to our NGL system, and we continued to see volumes ramp at the 8 plants we connected in 2015. We expect to connect 1 additional third-party plant this year in addition to completing and connecting our 80 million cubic feet per day Bear Creek plant in the Williston Basin, where additional flared natural gas remains ready to come online.
Williston Basin NGL volumes, our highest margin NGL volumes, with bundled rates more than 3x those in other regions, remained strong in the first quarter. The average volume gathered on our Bakken NGL Pipeline increased nearly 12% compared with the fourth quarter 2015, driven by the completion of the Lonesome Creek plant in November 2015 and compression projects. I'll also talk about ethane and provide an update on our ethane opportunity outlook in just a moment.
As it relates to the West Texas LPG system, in July 2015, we increased rates on the system to be more in line with market rates. In March, the Texas Railroad Commission suspended the rate increase until it is determined by the Commission if the rates are in line with the market. We are confident that our increased rates are just and reasonable and in line with the market. However, regardless of the outcome of the pending case, our current 2016 financial guidance remains as indicated. As you all can appreciate, due to the legal process now underway with the Railroad Commission, it will not be prudent at this time for us to discuss this case in any more detail. We will provide future updates or commentary when and if it is appropriate.
In the natural gas gathering and processing segment, Williston Basin volumes were a key driver to our first quarter performance. Our natural gas volumes processed reached 810 million cubic feet per day, as we captured previously flared gas and connected new wells to our system. Average natural gas volumes processed in the Williston increased 44% in the first quarter 2016 compared with the first quarter last year and increased 6% compared with the fourth quarter 2015.
Our producer customers continued to drive improvements in initial production rates through enhanced completion techniques, and combined with the higher natural gas to oil ratios in the core areas, where virtually all of our new wells are being connected, have helped offset the reduction in drilling and completion activity. We will continue to benefit from the more than 820 wells connected in 2015 and the 115 wells connected to our system in the first quarter 2016. The vast majority of these high-performing wells are in the most productive areas of Williams, McKenzie and Dunn Counties in North Dakota, where we have more than 1 million acres dedicated to us and an extensive network of interconnected gathering lines, compression and processing plants. There are currently 900 drilled but uncompleted wells in the basin, with nearly 400 on our acreage. 
We saw a decline in the drilling rig count across the Williston Basin during the first quarter and currently have approximately 15 rigs operating on our acreage under dedication. 
Flared natural gas in North Dakota was reported at approximately 185 million cubic feet per day for the state in February, with approximately 70 million to 80 million cubic feet per day on our system. This continues to present an opportunity for us, as we add processing capacity to our system in the third quarter 2016 with the completion of our Bear Creek natural gas processing plant.
In the Mid-Continent, first quarter 2016 processed volumes increased 8% compared with fourth quarter 2015 volumes. Similar to the Williston, our producer customers continue to drive significant increases in initial production rates through enhanced completion techniques, especially in the STACK, Cana-Woodford and SCOOP plays. 
Producer delays on completions of some large multi-well pads are expected to impact our volumes over the next several months and potentially through the remainder of 2016. However, with the recent improvement in commodity prices and breakevens in the STACK competing favorably with the best plays in the country, we could see acceleration of the delayed completions.
Contract restructuring in the natural gas gathering and processing segment has significantly decreased the segment's commodity price sensitivity and was another major contributor to the partnership's first quarter results. The segment's average fee rate increased to $0.68 per MMBtu compared with $0.35 in the same period last year and $0.55 in the fourth quarter 2015. We expect the segment's earnings to increase to more than 75% fee-based this year, driven by these contract restructuring efforts.
Moving on to the natural gas pipelines segment. First quarter results remained steady, as the segment continued to provide the partnership with stable, predominantly fee-based earnings. The segment completed 2 capital growth projects in March: The first phase of the Roadrunner Gas Transmission pipeline project; and a compressor station expansion project on our Midwestern Gas Transmission pipeline, which will add an additional 170 million cubic feet per day of capacity to the pipeline.
The Roadrunner project is fully subscribed under 25-year firm fee-based commitments, and the second phase of Roadrunner is expected to be complete in the first quarter 2017. Additionally, the Midwestern Gas Transmission expansion is also fully subscribed under 15-year firm fee-based commitments.
Our natural gas pipelines segment is primarily market-connected, meaning, we are directly connected with large, stable customers who provide services to end users. These customers, such as large utility companies, electric generation facilities and industrials, have specific volume needs that don't fluctuate based on commodity prices. Additionally, we work closely with these customers to design our systems to fit their specific needs. Unlike basis-driven pipelines, there is minimal financial risk associated with our natural gas pipelines or our customers. We like the stability of our natural gas pipelines business and the customers we serve, and we'll continue to develop additional fee-based and market-driven long-term growth and export opportunities in and around our asset footprint.
I'd like to close by providing an update on our ethane opportunity outlook. For the past 3 years, our industry has experienced an unprecedented period of heavy and prolonged ethane rejection. The partnership continued, even in the face of sustained ethane rejection, to increase our natural gas liquids volumes, gathered and fractionated. We are starting to see ethane prices improve in relation to natural gas as a result of improving NGL process and weakened natural gas, increases in NGL exports and expected incremental ethane demand from new world-scale petrochemical crackers.
Since last quarter, we've seen ethane recovery economics improve. Some natural gas processing plants on our system have intermittently started to recover ethane, we expect -- which we expect to continue throughout 2016. We continue to expect a meaningful amount of processing plants to move into full ethane -- full recovery in early 2017.
We averaged 175,000 barrels per day of ethane rejection on our system in the first quarter, and we expect anywhere from 175,000 to 200,000 barrels per day of ethane rejection on our system, as new natural gas plants we are connected to continue to ramp up and as we see the impacts of increased volumes in the Williston, STACK and SCOOP plays throughout 2016. We are well-positioned to benefit from this ethane opportunity and have more than enough infrastructure to bring these incremental barrels, or approximately $200 million in annual earnings, to our system with no additional capital requirements.
We also have the opportunity to utilize our assets to capture pricing differentials if any dislocations in pricing occur between the Conway, Kansas and Mont Belvieu, Texas market centers as a result of increasing ethane demand.
Ethane recovery presents a major opportunity for ONEOK and ONEOK Partners, but it certainly isn't our only opportunity. We remain focused on additional fee-based growth opportunities for our businesses, cost-effective ways to enhance our assets and employee retention efforts so we're fully prepared when market conditions improve.
Congratulations to our employees on a solid first quarter. We continue to face headwinds from challenging industry conditions, but we've shown once again that we're uniquely positioned to handle these challenges and deliver on the financial results we've laid out for ourselves and our investors.
Thank you to all of our stakeholders for your continued support of ONEOK and ONEOK Partners.

But I'm also curious, too, because I know you referred to some of your services being nondiscretionary in the past, and it's not like ethane economics, specifically, is going to drive drilling in the Bakken. So I'm curious, is there a way to look at or think about pipeline specs in the Bakken? And sort of as things come back to sort of forced ethane recovery and how that might impact you, is there any way to sort of numerically think about that?

We may periodically, in certain specific locations, depending upon the locations of those pipes to end user, we sometimes do have some issues with respect to quality specs. But I don't see quality specs being a big driver for ethane emergence in the Bakken, nor really anywhere else for that matter. When we talk about these nondiscretionary services, we talk about producers have to have the processing and they've got to have the liquids extracted from the gas in order to meet quality specs, ethane tends to be one of those -- is one of those NGLs that can be -- can easily go into to the gas stream and be diluted without causing much of a problem.

Before I hand the call over to Derek for the financial review, I will open with a few remarks. And after Derek's comments, I will discuss the segment's performance and have some closing comments. 
We continue to like the progress we have made in the first half of the year towards achieving our 2016 financial goals at ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. Our geographically diverse assets located in the Williston, Mid-Continent, Permian and Gulf Coast are meeting our customers' needs by enhancing both supply and market connectivity. The asset footprint we have developed over the last decade has generated significant value to our stakeholders. 
To put the scale of investment and return to our stakeholders into a little perspective, since 2006, we have spent more than $9 billion in growth capital projects and acquisitions. In 2006, ONEOK Partners adjusted EBITDA was $615 million and distributions declared in 2006 were $1.80 per unit split adjusted. The partnership's 2016 adjusted EBITDA guidance is $1.88 billion, and we expect distributions declared of $3.16 per unit in 2016. 
This impressive earnings growth at the partnership has also benefited ONEOK. In 2006, distributions declared for ONEOK's limited and general partner interest in ONEOK Partners totaled approximately $145 million, compared with ONEOK's 2016 guidance of approximately $790 million in distributions declared from the partnership. 
I would add we have prudently managed ONEOK and ONEOK Partners dividends and distribution patients through a number of challenging industry events without a decrease. We have slowed the capital spending during uncertain times to protect the partnership's balance sheet and investment grade credit rating, while aligning our business to take advantage of growth opportunities. Many of the investments we have made have positioned ONEOK Partners with continued running room for growth with minimum capital requirements. Available capacity in our Natural Gas Liquids segment allows us to continue to benefit from increased volumes driven by expected higher ethane recovery levels and NGL volume growth from more than 180 natural gas processing plants connected to our system. 
Our Natural Gas Gathering and processing segment also has considerable available processing capacity, as our new processing plants have demonstrated operating performance at higher capacity levels than our original design expectations. 
In addition, many of our gathering and processing plants are interconnected with each other, providing flexibility to direct NGL rich Natural Gas volumes to the most efficient plants. Our hard-working and experienced operating team will continue to optimize our assets to further enhance performance across our facilities. 
As we continue to take advantage of the considerable capacity we have available across our Natural Gas and Natural Gas Liquids businesses, our returns on invested capital, coverage and leverage metrics should continue to improve. Now Derek will provide a brief financial update on the quarter. Derek?"
293889,374529070,1023021,"ONEOK Partners, L.P., ONEOK Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2016",2016-08-03,"Earnings Calls","ONEOK, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Terry. Starting at the partnership, second quarter 2016 adjusted EBITDA increased 3% from the first quarter 2016, resulting from increased Natural Gas Liquids volumes gathered and fractionated and higher fee rate -- higher average fee rates in",535,"Thank you, Terry. Starting at the partnership, second quarter 2016 adjusted EBITDA increased 3% from the first quarter 2016, resulting from increased Natural Gas Liquids volumes gathered and fractionated and higher fee rate -- higher average fee rates in the gathering and processing segment. Even in this lower commodity price environment, the partnership's year-to-date adjusted EBITDA of $900 million is nearly $200 million more than in the same period in 2015. Last year's earnings were weighted more to the second half of the year, but to Terry's points, our assets continue to produce solid earnings in a very challenging pricing environment, and we have significant room to increase earnings with available system capacity. 
Our distribution coverage ratio increased to 1.15x in the second quarter and 1.11x year-to-date. This includes a onetime benefit from a change in the timing of cash distributions received from the partnership's equity method investment in Northern border pipeline. Beginning in the second quarter cash distributions related to the partnership's 50% interest in the pipeline are received monthly instead of quarterly. This onetime $15 million cash increase to distributable cash flow were approximately 0.7x to coverage. 
Excluding this benefit, our distribution coverage ratio still continued to improve. The second quarter 2016 represents the fifth quarter of consecutive increases in distribution coverage, with our third consecutive quarter above 1.0x. 
We continued deleveraging the partnership's already strong balance sheet as trailing 12 months GAAP debt-to-EBITDA improved again to 4.4x at June 30. We continue to expect leverage of 4.2x or less for the full year 2016. The partnership has ample liquidity, with more than $1.8 billion of capacity on its $2.4 billion credit facility. 
On a standalone basis, ONEOK ended the first quarter with nearly $180 million of cash and expects to have approximately $250 million of cash by year-end 2016 with an undrawn $300 million credit facility, allowing us continued financial flexibility. ONEOK's second quarter dividend coverage increased to 1.33x with free cash flow of over $40 million after dividends. 
Finally, you'll note a 7% increase in operating cost compared with the first quarter of 2016. This increase is mainly in the Natural Gas Liquids segment due to the timing of plant asset integrity projects at our pipelines and fractionators and higher property tax estimates. 
I would like to reiterate, from a financial perspective, we are pleased with the progress we've made in the first half of the year. We continue to have no debt or equity capital markets needs, including through our at-the-market equity program until well into 2017, although we continue to evaluate opportunities to proactively manage debt maturities and liquidity at the partnership. 
And lastly, I would like to point out we accelerated the expected completion of Phase II of the Roadrunner project and the Westex expansion project to the fourth quarter 2016 from the first quarter 2017. With all things being equal, we could see a 2% or 3% resulting increase in the Natural Gas pipeline segment's operating income and equity earnings. We are maintaining our 2016 financial guidance expectations for both ONEOK and ONEOK Partners and expect to continue to navigate the remainder of the year with prudent financial decision-making. 
I'll hand the call back over to Terry."

We recorded NGL gathered and fractionated volume growth across the segment",1001,"Thank you, Derek. Let's take a closer look at each of our business segments. 
Our Natural Gas Liquids segment continues to be a key driver of fee-based growth for the partnership. We recorded NGL gathered and fractionated volume growth across the segment's footprint, driven by recently connected natural gas processing plants and increased ethane recovery in the Mid-Continent. The ethane opportunity remains a strong expected tailwind for ONEOK Partners. Our processing plant customers connected to our system averaged approximately 150,000 barrels per day of ethane rejection in the second quarter, down from approximately 175,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of 2016. However, a portion of the fees associated with the increased volumes were previously being earned under contracts with minimum volume obligations. We expect ethane recovery levels to continue to fluctuate for the remainder of 2016. We continue to expect a meaningful impact from the ethane opportunity beginning in early 2017 and expect $200 million in annual impact to the segment once in full ethane recovery. 
In addition to the ethane opportunity, the growing STACK and SCOOP plays in Oklahoma present an opportunity for Natural Gas Liquids volume growth as we remain a critical NGL takeaway provider in the area. Based on the conversations we've had with producer customers in the STACK and SCOOP plays, and with the results they're seeing, we expect to gather an incremental 100,000 barrels per day of natural gas liquids from the play. Our current gathering system capacity can handle the natural gas liquids out of the Mid-Continent when the region is in full ethane recovery, and we expect to have available gathering capacity of approximately 40,000 barrels per day at full ethane recovery. We can expand by an additional 60,000 barrels per day with capital expenditures of less than $100 million for a total available gathering capacity of more than 100,000 barrels per day. 
Excluding the impact of changes in ethane recovery, we continue to expect NGL volumes to be weighted toward the second half of the year as incremental volumes from new natural gas processing plant connections continue to ramp up, including the connection of 3 third-party processing plants through the first half of 2016. We expect to connect 2 additional third-party plants, 1 each in Williston and Mid-Continent, and our Bear Creek plant in August 2016, which equals a total of 6 plant connections in 2016. 
From a Natural Gas Liquids perspective, supply and market connectivity remains our competitive advantage. Or said another way, our competitive advantage is our ability to connect our producers in key basins to consumers in key market centers. 
A very important component of our integrated NGL system is the connectivity we have between Conway and Mont Belvieu. We have a significant amount of available capacity between these 2 market centers, which allow the natural gas liquids out of the Williston, Rockies and the Mid-Continent to have connectivity to end markets. 
In the Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment, the average fee rate increased to $0.76 in the second quarter 2016, driven by benefits from increased volumes on previously restructured contracts and continued contract restructuring efforts. This average fee rate is an $0.08 or 12% increase compared with the first quarter 2016 and a $0.37 or 95% increase compared with the second quarter of 2015. We expect the average fee rate to continue to increase, but at a slower rate compared with the last 3 quarters. We are continuing to work on restructuring more contracts to be primarily fee-based to reduce earnings volatility and enhance margins. 
Additionally, we did add nearly 85 new well connections in the Williston Basin during the second quarter. There are 19 rigs currently on our dedicated acreage, along with approximately 350 drilled but uncompleted wells in inventory. Segment volumes decreased slightly compared with the first quarter 2016, impacted by planned facility maintenance and weather events in the Williston Basin. We estimate without these occurrences, the Williston natural gas gathered and processed volumes would have equaled the first quarter. 
The Mid-Continent's volumes were impacted by the timing of well completions and volume declines. 
I would like to emphasize that the Gathering and Processing segment's EBITDA increased approximately $10 million from the first quarter, even with lower gathered and processed volumes, which shows the value of the enhanced margins achieved through our contract restructuring effort. 
The STACK and SCOOP plays are also benefiting the Gathering and Processing segment as we continue to see strong producer results in the plays. The majority of the well completions we expect to see at the end of 2016 and early 2017 are in the STACK, which is becoming one of the top return plays, which brings significant opportunities to all 3 ONEOK segments and especially the Natural Gas Liquids segment. 
Our Natural Gas Pipeline segment had another solid quarter. We moved up the expected completion of Phase II of the Roadrunner pipeline project to the fourth quarter 2016. The early expected completion resulted from good weather, limited issues with right away and less rock than expected during the construction process. 
We also moved up the completion date of the Westex expansion project, as I mentioned previously, which is complementary to Roadrunner. This project is another example of our commitment to grow the partnership's long-term fee-based business. 
Our continued focus on stable, fee-based earnings growth has positioned us well for the remainder of 2016. While we're optimistic about the long-term outlook for commodity prices, we'll continue to prudently manage our business and position it for continued earnings growth while weathering the sometimes challenging and cyclical nature of the industry. 
Thank you for your continued support of ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. And as always, thank you to our employees, whose hard work and experience and good decision-making, has made for another solid quarter amid difficult industry conditions. It is through our employees' hard work, creativity and dedication that our company remains well positioned to take advantage of the many opportunities we have under development. Operator, we're now ready for questions."

You had some interesting color about the Bakken, had the weather issues not been there, you would have been in line with the first quarter. So when we think about the guidance that you sort of set at the beginning of the year, how would you see volumes are tracking versus planned? And then when we think about a few rigs being out into the basin, increasing completion crews I think was announced by [indiscernible] the other day as well, too, how should we be thinking about the exit rate for the Bakken? Do you think it will be higher than what you were original planning on in your original budget? And then in contrast, if you can talk about I guess a little bit more in-depth about producer completion plans in the Mid-Continent, does that change your exit rate there as well, too? I'm sorry if you can give us a little more color around that."

If we talk about the Williston first, I think the volumes are progressing very much as we anticipated coming into the year. We have had some producers announced some -- bringing some crews back, and we do have that factored in. The weather and the facility maintenance, we saw basically just a minor decline in the second quarter. We're kind of flat right now.  As we move in, we've got Bear Creek, which we now say will be completed in August, so we will see an extra 30 to 40 million a day coming in when that plant comes online. And then towards the back half of the year, we're looking flat to -- flattish type volumes as we go through the end of 2016 with the completion activity in the rigs that we currently have kind of on the schedule. If we transition to the Mid-Continent, a little bit different story. We absolutely expect a back half weighting, especially towards the end of the year as some of the -- some large pads, the completions were delayed to the fourth quarter. And so from that standpoint, we do expect a ramp there, but -- and we've also had some gathered only volumes that have dropped off a little more than we anticipated coming into the year. But that's kind of how we see the Mid-Continent volume shaping up into the year."

So when you think about a more constructive environment, say maybe $55 to $65 a barrel oil environment, we are well positioned to capture more opportunities. So if you think about the impact from an EBITDA perspective or the incremental EBITDA, I think a 10% to 20% improvement, if all those things happen, I think would actually be conservative.

None of them really -- none of them liked it, but they understood the reality. They certainly did not want us to pick up and invest capital elsewhere. They needed capital to continue to be invested. They needed the services in order to monetize their reserves and continue to produce their crude oil candidly in the basin. So they all understood the rationale.

Before I hand the call over to Derek for the financial review, I will open with a few remarks. And after Derek's comments, I will discuss the segments' performance and have some closing comments. 
We continue to like the progress we have made in the first half of the year towards achieving our 2016 financial goals at ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. Our geographically diverse assets located in the Williston, Mid-Continent, Permian and Gulf Coast are meeting our customers' needs by enhancing both supply and market connectivity. The asset footprint we have developed over the last decade has generated significant value to our stakeholders. 
To put the scale of investment and return to our stakeholders into a little perspective, since 2006, we have spent more than $9 billion in growth capital projects and acquisitions. In 2006, ONEOK Partners' adjusted EBITDA was $615 million and distributions declared in 2006 were $1.80 per unit, split adjusted. The partnership's 2016 adjusted EBITDA guidance is $1.88 billion, and we expect distributions declared of $3.16 per unit in 2016. 
This impressive earnings growth at the partnership has also benefited ONEOK. In 2006, distributions declared for ONEOK's limited and general partner interests in ONEOK Partners totaled approximately $145 million, compared with ONEOK's 2016 guidance of approximately $790 million in distributions declared from the partnership. 
I would add we have prudently managed ONEOK and ONEOK Partners' dividends and distributions through a number of challenging industry events without a decrease. We have slowed the capital spending during uncertain times to protect the partnership's balance sheet and investment grade credit rating while aligning our business to take advantage of growth opportunities. Many of the investments we have made have positioned ONEOK Partners with continued running room for growth with minimum capital requirements. Available capacity in our natural gas liquids segment allows us to continue to benefit from increased volumes driven by expected higher ethane recovery levels and NGL volume growth from more than 180 natural gas processing plants connected to our system. 
Our natural gas gathering and processing segment also has considerable available processing capacity as our new processing plants have demonstrated operating performance at higher capacity levels than our original design expectations. In addition, many of our gathering and processing plants are interconnected with each other, providing flexibility to direct NGL rich natural gas volumes to the most efficient plants. Our hard-working and experienced operating team will continue to optimize our assets to further enhance performance across our facilities. 
As we continue to take advantage of the considerable capacity we have available across our natural gas and natural gas liquids businesses, our returns on invested capital, coverage and leverage metrics should continue to improve. Now Derek will provide a brief financial update on the quarter. Derek?"
293889,374529070,1023491,"ONEOK Partners, L.P., ONEOK Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2016",2016-08-03,"Earnings Calls","ONEOK, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Terry. Starting at the partnership, second quarter 2016 adjusted EBITDA increased 3% from the first quarter 2016, resulting from increased natural gas liquids volumes gathered and fractionated and higher fee rate -- higher average fee rates in",535,"Thank you, Terry. Starting at the partnership, second quarter 2016 adjusted EBITDA increased 3% from the first quarter 2016, resulting from increased natural gas liquids volumes gathered and fractionated and higher fee rate -- higher average fee rates in the gathering and processing segment. Even in this lower-commodity-price environment, the partnership's year-to-date adjusted EBITDA of $900 million is nearly $200 million more than in the same period in 2015. Last year's earnings were weighted more to the second half of the year, but to Terry's points, our assets continue to produce solid earnings in a very challenging pricing environment, and we have significant room to increase earnings with available system capacity. 
Our distribution coverage ratio increased to 1.15x in the second quarter and 1.11x year-to-date. This includes a onetime benefit from a change in the timing of cash distributions received from the partnership's equity method investment in Northern Border Pipeline. Beginning in the second quarter, cash distributions related to the partnership's 50% interest in the pipeline are received monthly instead of quarterly. This onetime $15 million cash increase to distributable cash flow were approximately 0.7x to coverage. 
Excluding this benefit, our distribution coverage ratio still continued to improve. The second quarter 2016 represents the fifth quarter of consecutive increases in distribution coverage with our third consecutive quarter above 1.0x. 
We continued deleveraging the partnership's already strong balance sheet as trailing 12 months GAAP debt to EBITDA improved again to 4.4x at June 30. We continue to expect leverage of 4.2x or less for the full year 2016. The partnership has ample liquidity with more than $1.8 billion of capacity on its $2.4 billion credit facility. 
On a stand-alone basis, ONEOK ended the first quarter with nearly $180 million of cash and expects to have approximately $250 [ph] million of cash by year-end 2016 with an undrawn $300 million credit facility, allowing us continued financial flexibility. ONEOK's second quarter dividend coverage increased to 1.33x with free cash flow of over $40 million after dividends. 
Finally, you'll note a 7% increase in operating cost compared with the first quarter of 2016. This increase is mainly in the natural gas liquids segment due to the timing of planned asset integrity projects at our pipelines and fractionators and higher property tax estimates. 
I would like to reiterate, from a financial perspective, we're pleased with the progress we've made in the first half of the year. We continue to have no debt or equity capital markets needs, including through our at-the-market equity program until well into 2017, although we continue to evaluate opportunities to proactively manage debt maturities and liquidity at the partnership. 
And lastly, I'd like to point out we accelerated the expected completion of Phase II of the Roadrunner project and the Westex expansion project to the fourth quarter 2016 from the first quarter 2017. With all things being equal, we could see a 2% or 3% resulting increase in the Natural Gas pipeline segment's operating income and equity earnings. We are maintaining our 2016 financial guidance expectations for both ONEOK and ONEOK Partners and expect to continue to navigate the remainder of the year with prudent financial decision making. 
I'll hand the call back over to Terry."
293889,374529070,1023491,"ONEOK Partners, L.P., ONEOK Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2016",2016-08-03,"Earnings Calls","ONEOK, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Derek. Let's take a closer look at each of our business segments. Our natural gas liquids segment continues to be a key driver of fee-based growth for the partnership. We recorded NGL gathered and fractionated volume growth across the segment",1004,"Thank you, Derek. Let's take a closer look at each of our business segments. 
Our natural gas liquids segment continues to be a key driver of fee-based growth for the partnership. We recorded NGL gathered and fractionated volume growth across the segment's footprint, driven by recently connected natural gas processing plants and increased ethane recovery in the Mid-Continent. 
The ethane opportunity remains a strong expected tailwind for ONEOK Partners. Our processing plant customers connected to our system averaged approximately 150,000 barrels per day of ethane rejection in the second quarter, down from approximately 175,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of 2016. However, a portion of the fees associated with the increased volumes were previously being earned under contracts with minimum volume obligations. We expect ethane recovery levels to continue to fluctuate for the remainder of 2016. We continue to expect a meaningful impact from the ethane opportunity beginning in early 2017 and expect $200 million in annual impact to the segment once in full ethane recovery. 
In addition to the ethane opportunity, the growing STACK and SCOOP plays in Oklahoma present an opportunity for natural gas liquids volume growth as we remain a critical NGL takeaway provider in the area. Based on the conversations we've had with producer customers in the STACK and SCOOP plays and with the results they're seeing, we expect to gather an incremental 100,000 barrels per day of natural gas liquids from the play. Our current gathering system capacity can handle the natural gas liquids out of the Mid-Continent when the region is in full ethane recovery, and we expect to have available gathering capacity of approximately 40,000 barrels per day at full ethane recovery. We can expand by an additional 60,000 barrels per day with capital expenditures of less than $100 million for a total available gathering capacity of more than 100,000 barrels per day. 
Excluding the impact of changes in ethane recovery, we continue to expect NGL volumes to be weighted toward the second half of the year as incremental volumes from new natural gas processing plant connections continue to ramp up, including the connection of 3 third-party processing plants through the first half of 2016. We expect to connect 2 additional third-party plants, 1 each in the Williston and Mid-Continent, and our Bear Creek plant in August 2016, which equals a total of 6 plant connections in 2016. 
From a natural gas liquids perspective, supply and market connectivity remains our competitive advantage. Or said another way, our competitive advantage is our ability to connect our producers in key basins to consumers in key market centers. 
A very important component of our integrated NGL system is the connectivity we have between Conway and Mont Belvieu. We have a significant amount of available capacity between these 2 market centers, which allows the natural gas liquids out of the Williston, Rockies and the Mid-Continent to have connectivity to end markets. 
In the natural gas gathering and processing segment, the average fee rate increased to $0.76 in the second quarter 2016, driven by benefits from increased volumes on previously restructured contracts and continued contract restructuring efforts. This average fee rate is an $0.08 or 12% increase compared with the first quarter 2016 and a $0.37 or 95% increase compared with the second quarter of 2015. 
We expect the average fee rate to continue to increase but at a slower rate compared with the last 3 quarters. We are continuing to work on restructuring more contracts to be primarily fee based to reduce earnings volatility and enhance margins. 
Additionally, we did add nearly 85 new well connections in the Williston Basin during the second quarter. There are 19 rigs currently on our dedicated acreage along with approximately 350 drilled but uncompleted wells in inventory. Segment volumes decreased slightly compared with the first quarter 2016, impacted by planned facility maintenance and weather events in the Williston Basin. We estimate without these occurrences, the Williston natural gas gathered and processed volumes would have equaled the first quarter. The Mid-Continent's volumes were impacted by the timing of well completions and volume declines. 
I would like to emphasize that the gathering and processing segment's EBITDA increased approximately $10 million from the first quarter, even with lowered gathered and processed volumes, which shows the value of the enhanced margins achieved through our contract restructuring effort. 
The STACK and SCOOP plays are also benefiting the gathering and processing segment as we continue to see strong producer results in the plays. The majority of the well completions we expect to see at the end of 2016 and early 2017 are in the STACK, which is becoming one of the top return plays, which brings significant opportunities to all 3 ONEOK segments and especially the natural gas liquids segment. 
Our natural gas pipeline segment had another solid quarter. We moved up the expected completion of Phase 2 of the Roadrunner pipeline project to the fourth quarter 2016. The early expected completion resulted from good weather, limited issues with right of way and less rock than expected during the construction process. 
We also moved up the completion date of the Westex expansion project, as I mentioned previously, which is complementary to Roadrunner. This project is another example of our commitment to grow the partnership's long-term fee-based business. 
Our continued focus on stable, fee-based earnings growth has positioned us well for the remainder of 2016. While we're optimistic about the long-term outlook for commodity prices, we'll continue to prudently manage our business and position it for continued earnings growth while weathering the sometimes challenging and cyclical nature of the industry. 
Thank you for your continued support of ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. And as always, thank you to our employees, whose hard work, experienced and good decision making has made for another solid quarter amid difficult industry conditions. It is through our employees' hard work, creativity and dedication that our company remains well positioned to take advantage of the many opportunities we have under development.

And then when we think about a few rigs being out into the basin, increasing completion crews I think was announced by Whiting the other day as well, too. How should we be thinking about the exit rate for the Bakken? Do you think it'll be higher than what you were originally planning on in your original budget? And then in contrast, if you can talk about I guess a little bit more in-depth about producer completion plans in the Mid-Continent, does that change your exit rate there as well, too?

We have had some producers announce some -- bringing some crews back, and we do have that factored in. The weather and the facility maintenance, we saw basically just a minor decline in the second quarter. We're kind of flat right now. As we move in, we've got Bear Creek, which we now say will be completed in August, so we will see an extra 30 million to 40 million a day coming in when that plant comes online. And then towards the back half of the year, we're looking flat to -- flattish type volumes as we go through the end of 2016 with the completion activity in the rigs that we currently have kind of on the schedule. If we transition to the Mid-Continent, a little bit different story. We absolutely expect a back half weighting, especially towards the end of the year as some of the -- some large pads, the completions were delayed to the fourth quarter. And so from that standpoint, we do expect a ramp there, but -- and we've also had some gathered-only volumes that have dropped off a little more than we anticipated coming into the year. But that's kind of how we see the Mid-Continent volumes shaping up through the end of the year."

So when you think about a more-constructive environment, say maybe $55 to $65 a barrel oil environment, we're well positioned to capture more opportunities. So if you think about the impact from an EBITDA perspective or the incremental EBITDA, I think a 10% to 20% improvement, if all those things happen, I think would actually be conservative. So I think we could outperform that considerably."

I would not anticipate a whole lot more contract renegotiation happening, obviously, until some of these contracts come up for term many years down the road. So I think, for the most part, we've accomplished what we set out to do. From an ongoing perspective, we'll stay focused in particular in the Mid-Continent to restructure where we can, understanding that the challenge there is that the contracts are much smaller.

Before I hand the call over to Derek for the financial review, I will open with a few remarks. And after Derek's comments, I will discuss the segments' performance and have some closing comments. 
We continue to like the progress we have made in the first half of the year towards achieving our 2016 financial goals at ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. Our geographically diverse assets located in the Williston, Mid-Continent, Permian and Gulf Coast are meeting our customers' needs by enhancing both supply and market connectivity. The asset footprint we have developed over the last decade has generated significant value to our stakeholders. 
To put the scale of investment and return to our stakeholders into a little perspective, since 2006, we have spent more than $9 billion in growth capital projects and acquisitions. In 2006, ONEOK Partners' adjusted EBITDA was $615 million and distributions declared in 2006 were $1.80 per unit, split adjusted. The partnership's 2016 adjusted EBITDA guidance is $1.88 billion, and we expect distributions declared of $3.16 per unit in 2016. 
This impressive earnings growth at the partnership has also benefited ONEOK. In 2006, distributions declared for ONEOK's limited and general partner interests in ONEOK Partners totaled approximately $145 million, compared with ONEOK's 2016 guidance of approximately $790 million in distributions declared from the partnership. 
I would add we have prudently managed ONEOK and ONEOK Partners' dividends and distributions through a number of challenging industry events without a decrease. We have slowed the capital spending during uncertain times to protect the partnership's balance sheet and investment grade credit rating while aligning our business to take advantage of growth opportunities. Many of the investments we have made have positioned ONEOK Partners with continued running room for growth with minimum capital requirements. Available capacity in our natural gas liquids segment allows us to continue to benefit from increased volumes driven by expected higher ethane recovery levels and NGL volume growth from more than 180 natural gas processing plants connected to our system. 
Our natural gas gathering and processing segment also has considerable available processing capacity as our new processing plants have demonstrated operating performance at higher capacity levels than our original design expectations. In addition, many of our gathering and processing plants are interconnected with each other, providing flexibility to direct NGL rich natural gas volumes to the most efficient plants. Our hard-working and experienced operating team will continue to optimize our assets to further enhance performance across our facilities. 
As we continue to take advantage of the considerable capacity we have available across our natural gas and natural gas liquids businesses, our returns on invested capital, coverage and leverage metrics should continue to improve. Now Derek will provide a brief financial update on the quarter. Derek?"
293889,374529070,1023707,"ONEOK Partners, L.P., ONEOK Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2016",2016-08-03,"Earnings Calls","ONEOK, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Terry. Starting at the partnership, second quarter 2016 adjusted EBITDA increased 3% from the first quarter 2016, resulting from increased natural gas liquids volumes gathered and fractionated and higher fee rate -- higher average fee rates in",539,"Thank you, Terry. Starting at the partnership, second quarter 2016 adjusted EBITDA increased 3% from the first quarter 2016, resulting from increased natural gas liquids volumes gathered and fractionated and higher fee rate -- higher average fee rates in the gathering and processing segment. Even in this lower commodity price environment, the partnership's year-to-date adjusted EBITDA of $900 million is nearly $200 million more than in the same period in 2015. Last year's earnings were weighted more to the second half of the year, but to Terry's points, our assets continue to produce solid earnings in a very challenging pricing environment, and we have significant room to increase earnings with available system capacity. 
Our distribution coverage ratio increased to 1.15x in the second quarter and 1.11x year-to-date. This includes a one time benefit from a change in the timing of cash distributions received from the partnership's equity method investment in Northern Border Pipeline. Beginning in the second quarter, cash distributions related to the partnership's 50% interest in the pipeline are received monthly instead of quarterly. This onetime $15 million cash increase to distributable cash flow were approximately 0.7x to coverage. 
Excluding this benefit, our distribution coverage ratio still continued to improve. The second quarter 2016 represents the fifth quarter of consecutive increases in distribution coverage with our third consecutive quarter above 1.0x. 
We continued deleveraging the partnership's already strong balance sheet as trailing 12 months GAAP debt to EBITDA improved again to 4.4x at June 30. We continue to expect leverage of 4.2x or less for the full year 2016. The partnership has ample liquidity with more than $1.8 billion of capacity on its $2.4 billion credit facility. 
On a stand-alone basis, ONEOK ended the first quarter with nearly $180 million of cash and expects to have approximately $250 million of cash by year-end 2016 with an undrawn $300 million credit facility, allowing us continued financial flexibility. ONEOK's second quarter dividend coverage increased to 1.33x with free cash flow of over $40 million after dividends. 
Finally, you'll note a 7% increase in operating cost compared with the first quarter of 2016. This increase is mainly in the natural gas liquids segment due to the timing of planned asset integrity projects at our pipelines and fractionators and higher property tax estimates. 
I would like to reiterate, from a financial perspective, we're pleased with the progress we've made in the first half of the year. We continue to have no debt or equity capital markets needs, including through our at the market equity program until well into 2017, although we continue to evaluate opportunities to proactively manage debt maturities and liquidity at the partnership. 
And lastly, I'd like to point out we accelerated the expected completion of Phase II of the Roadrunner project and the Westex expansion project to the fourth quarter 2016 from the first quarter 2017. With all things being equal, we could see a 2% or 3% resulting increase in the Natural Gas pipeline segment's operating income and equity earnings. We are maintaining our 2016 financial guidance expectations for both ONEOK and ONEOK Partners and expect to continue to navigate the remainder of the year with prudent financial decision making. 
I'll hand the call back over to Terry."
293889,374529070,1023707,"ONEOK Partners, L.P., ONEOK Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2016",2016-08-03,"Earnings Calls","ONEOK, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Derek. Let's take a closer look at each of our business segments. Our natural gas liquids segment continues to be a key driver of fee-based growth for the partnership. We recorded NGL gathered and fractionated volume growth across the segment",1004,"Thank you, Derek. Let's take a closer look at each of our business segments. 
Our natural gas liquids segment continues to be a key driver of fee-based growth for the partnership. We recorded NGL gathered and fractionated volume growth across the segment's footprint, driven by recently connected natural gas processing plants and increased ethane recovery in the Mid-Continent. 
The ethane opportunity remains a strong expected tailwind for ONEOK Partners. Our processing plant customers connected to our system averaged approximately 150,000 barrels per day of ethane rejection in the second quarter, down from approximately 175,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of 2016. However, a portion of the fees associated with the increased volumes were previously being earned under contracts with minimum volume obligations. We expect ethane recovery levels to continue to fluctuate for the remainder of 2016. We continue to expect a meaningful impact from the ethane opportunity beginning in early 2017 and expect $200 million in annual impact to the segment once in full ethane recovery. 
In addition to the ethane opportunity, the growing STACK and SCOOP plays in Oklahoma present an opportunity for natural gas liquids volume growth as we remain a critical NGL takeaway provider in the area. Based on the conversations we've had with producer customers in the STACK and SCOOP plays and with the results they're seeing, we expect to gather an incremental 100,000 barrels per day of natural gas liquids from the play. Our current gathering system capacity can handle the natural gas liquids out of the Mid-Continent when the region is in full ethane recovery, and we expect to have available gathering capacity of approximately 40,000 barrels per day at full ethane recovery. We can expand by an additional 60,000 barrels per day with capital expenditures of less than $100 million for a total available gathering capacity of more than 100,000 barrels per day. 
Excluding the impact of changes in ethane recovery, we continue to expect NGL volumes to be weighted toward the second half of the year as incremental volumes from new natural gas processing plant connections continue to ramp up, including the connection of 3 third-party processing plants through the first half of 2016. We expect to connect 2 additional third-party plants, 1 each in the Williston and Mid-Continent, and our Bear Creek plant in August 2016, which equals a total of 6 plant connections in 2016. 
From a natural gas liquids perspective, supply and market connectivity remains our competitive advantage. Or said another way, our competitive advantage is our ability to connect our producers in key basins to consumers in key market centers. 
A very important component of our integrated NGL system is the connectivity we have between Conway and Mont Belvieu. We have a significant amount of available capacity between these 2 market centers, which allows the natural gas liquids out of the Williston, Rockies and the Mid-Continent to have connectivity to end markets. 
In the natural gas gathering and processing segment, the average fee rate increased to $0.76 in the second quarter 2016, driven by benefits from increased volumes on previously restructured contracts and continued contract restructuring efforts. This average fee rate is an $0.08 or 12% increase compared with the first quarter 2016 and a $0.37 or 95% increase compared with the second quarter of 2015. 
We expect the average fee rate to continue to increase but at a slower rate compared with the last 2 quarters. We are continuing to work on restructuring more contracts to be primarily fee based to reduce earnings volatility and enhance margins. 
Additionally, we did add nearly 85 new well connections in the Williston Basin during the second quarter. There are 19 rigs currently on our dedicated acreage along with approximately 350 drilled but uncompleted wells in inventory. Segment volumes decreased slightly compared with the first quarter 2016, impacted by planned facility maintenance and weather events in the Williston Basin. We estimate without these occurrences, the Williston natural gas gathered and processed volumes would have equaled the first quarter. The Mid-Continent's volumes were impacted by the timing of well completions and volume declines. 
I would like to emphasize that the gathering and processing segment's EBITDA increased approximately $10 million from the first quarter, even with lowered gathered and processed volumes, which shows the value of the enhanced margins achieved through our contract restructuring effort. 
The STACK and SCOOP plays are also benefiting the gathering and processing segment as we continue to see strong producer results in the plays. The majority of the well completions we expect to see at the end of 2016 and early 2017 are in the STACK, which is becoming one of the top return plays, which brings significant opportunities to all 3 ONEOK segments and especially the natural gas liquids segment. 
Our natural gas pipeline segment had another solid quarter. We moved up the expected completion of Phase 2 of the Roadrunner pipeline project to the fourth quarter 2016. The early expected completion resulted from good weather, limited issues with right of way and less rock than expected during the construction process. 
We also moved up the completion date of the Westex expansion project, as I mentioned previously, which is complementary to Roadrunner. This project is another example of our commitment to grow the partnership's long-term fee-based business. 
Our continued focus on stable, fee-based earnings growth has positioned us well for the remainder of 2016. While we're optimistic about the long-term outlook for commodity prices, we'll continue to prudently manage our business and position it for continued earnings growth while weathering the sometimes challenging and cyclical nature of the industry. 
Thank you for your continued support of ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. And as always, thank you to our employees, whose hard work, experienced and good decision making has made for another solid quarter amid difficult industry conditions. It is through our employees' hard work, creativity and dedication that our company remains well positioned to take advantage of the many opportunities we have under development.

And then when we think about a few rigs being out into the basin, increasing completion crews I think was announced by Whiting the other day as well, too. How should we be thinking about the exit rate for the Bakken? Do you think it'll be higher than what you were originally planning on in your original budget? And then in contrast, if you can talk about I guess a little bit more in-depth about producer completion plans in the Mid-Continent, does that change your exit rate there as well, too?

We have had some producers announce some -- bringing some crews back, and we do have that factored in. The weather and the facility maintenance, we saw basically just a minor decline in the second quarter. We're kind of flat right now. As we move in, we've got Bear Creek, which we now say will be completed in August, so we will see an extra 30 million to 40 million a day coming in when that plant comes online. And then towards the back half of the year, we're looking flat to -- flattish type volumes as we go through the end of 2016 with the completion activity in the rigs that we currently have kind of on the schedule. If we transition to the Mid-Continent, a little bit different story. We absolutely expect a back half weighting, especially towards the end of the year as some of the -- some large pads, the completions were delayed to the fourth quarter. And so from that standpoint, we do expect a ramp there, but -- and we've also had some gathered only volumes that have dropped off a little more than we anticipated coming into the year. But that's kind of how we see the Mid-Continent volumes shaping up through the end of the year."

So when you think about a more constructive environment, say maybe $55 to $65 a barrel oil environment, we're well positioned to capture more opportunities. So if you think about the impact from an EBITDA perspective or the incremental EBITDA, I think a 10% to 20% improvement, if all those things happen, I think would actually be conservative. So I think we could outperform that considerably."

Before I hand the call over to Derek for the financial review, I will open with a few remarks. And after Derek's comments, I will discuss the segments' performance and have some closing comments. 
We continue to like the progress we have made in the first half of the year towards achieving our 2016 financial goals at ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. Our geographically diverse assets located in the Williston, Mid-Continent, Permian and Gulf Coast are meeting our customers' needs by enhancing both supply and market connectivity. The asset footprint we have developed over the last decade has generated significant value to our stakeholders. 
To put the scale of investment and return to our stakeholders into a little perspective, since 2006, we have spent more than $9 billion in growth capital projects and acquisitions. In 2006, ONEOK Partners' adjusted EBITDA was $615 million and distributions declared in 2006 were $1.80 per unit, split adjusted. The partnership's 2016 adjusted EBITDA guidance is $1.88 billion, and we expect distributions declared of $3.16 per unit in 2016. 
This impressive earnings growth at the partnership has also benefited ONEOK. In 2006, distributions declared for ONEOK's limited and general partner interests in ONEOK Partners totaled approximately $145 million, compared with ONEOK's 2016 guidance of approximately $790 million in distributions declared from the partnership. 
I would add we have prudently managed ONEOK and ONEOK Partners' dividends and distributions through a number of challenging industry events without a decrease. We have slowed the capital spending during uncertain times to protect the partnership's balance sheet and investment grade credit rating while aligning our business to take advantage of growth opportunities. Many of the investments we have made have positioned ONEOK Partners with continued running room for growth with minimum capital requirements. Available capacity in our natural gas liquids segment allows us to continue to benefit from increased volumes driven by expected higher ethane recovery levels and NGL volume growth from more than 180 natural gas processing plants connected to our system. 
Our natural gas gathering and processing segment also has considerable available processing capacity as our new processing plants have demonstrated operating performance at higher capacity levels than our original design expectations. In addition, many of our gathering and processing plants are interconnected with each other, providing flexibility to direct NGL rich natural gas volumes to the most efficient plants. Our hard-working and experienced operating team will continue to optimize our assets to further enhance performance across our facilities. 
As we continue to take advantage of the considerable capacity we have available across our natural gas and natural gas liquids businesses, our returns on invested capital, coverage and leverage metrics should continue to improve. Now Derek will provide a brief financial update on the quarter. Derek?"
293889,374529070,1024276,"ONEOK Partners, L.P., ONEOK Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2016",2016-08-03,"Earnings Calls","ONEOK, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Terry. Starting at the partnership, second quarter 2016 adjusted EBITDA increased 3% from the first quarter 2016, resulting from increased natural gas liquids volumes gathered and fractionated and higher fee rate -- higher average fee rates in",538,"Thank you, Terry. Starting at the partnership, second quarter 2016 adjusted EBITDA increased 3% from the first quarter 2016, resulting from increased natural gas liquids volumes gathered and fractionated and higher fee rate -- higher average fee rates in the gathering and processing segment. Even in this lower commodity price environment, the partnership's year-to-date adjusted EBITDA of $900 million is nearly $200 million more than in the same period in 2015. Last year's earnings were weighted more to the second half of the year, but to Terry's points, our assets continue to produce solid earnings in a very challenging pricing environment, and we have significant room to increase earnings with available system capacity. 
Our distribution coverage ratio increased to 1.15x in the second quarter and 1.11x year-to-date. This includes a onetime benefit from a change in the timing of cash distributions received from the partnership's equity method investment in Northern Border Pipeline. Beginning in the second quarter, cash distributions related to the partnership's 50% interest in the pipeline are received monthly instead of quarterly. This onetime $15 million cash increase to distributable cash flow were approximately 0.7x to coverage. 
Excluding this benefit, our distribution coverage ratio still continued to improve. The second quarter 2016 represents the fifth quarter of consecutive increases in distribution coverage with our third consecutive quarter above 1.0x. 
We continued deleveraging the partnership's already strong balance sheet as trailing 12 months GAAP debt to EBITDA improved again to 4.4x at June 30. We continue to expect leverage of 4.2x or less for the full year 2016. The partnership has ample liquidity with more than $1.8 billion of capacity on its $2.4 billion credit facility. 
On a stand-alone basis, ONEOK ended the first quarter with nearly $180 million of cash and expects to have approximately $250 million of cash by year-end 2016 with an undrawn $300 million credit facility, allowing us continued financial flexibility. ONEOK's second quarter dividend coverage increased to 1.33x with free cash flow of over $40 million after dividends. 
Finally, you'll note a 7% increase in operating cost compared with the first quarter of 2016. This increase is mainly in the natural gas liquids segment due to the timing of planned asset integrity projects at our pipelines and fractionators and higher property tax estimates. 
I would like to reiterate, from a financial perspective, we're pleased with the progress we've made in the first half of the year. We continue to have no debt or equity capital market’s needs, including through our at the market equity program until well into 2017, although we continue to evaluate opportunities to proactively manage debt maturities and liquidity at the partnership. 
And lastly, I'd like to point out we accelerated the expected completion of Phase II of the Roadrunner project and the Westex expansion project to the fourth quarter 2016 from the first quarter 2017. With all things being equal, we could see a 2% or 3% resulting increase in the Natural Gas pipeline segment's operating income and equity earnings. We are maintaining our 2016 financial guidance expectations for both ONEOK and ONEOK Partners and expect to continue to navigate the remainder of the year with prudent financial decision making. 
I'll hand the call back over to Terry."
293889,374529070,1024276,"ONEOK Partners, L.P., ONEOK Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 03, 2016",2016-08-03,"Earnings Calls","ONEOK, Inc.","Executives","Thank you, Derek. Let's take a closer look at each of our business segments. Our natural gas liquids segment continues to be a key driver of fee-based growth for the partnership. We recorded NGL gathered and fractionated volume growth across the segment",1004,"Thank you, Derek. Let's take a closer look at each of our business segments. 
Our natural gas liquids segment continues to be a key driver of fee-based growth for the partnership. We recorded NGL gathered and fractionated volume growth across the segment's footprint, driven by recently connected natural gas processing plants and increased ethane recovery in the Mid-Continent. 
The ethane opportunity remains a strong expected tailwind for ONEOK Partners. Our processing plant customers connected to our system averaged approximately 150,000 barrels per day of ethane rejection in the second quarter, down from approximately 175,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of 2016. However, a portion of the fees associated with the increased volumes were previously being earned under contracts with minimum volume obligations. We expect ethane recovery levels to continue to fluctuate for the remainder of 2016. We continue to expect a meaningful impact from the ethane opportunity beginning in early 2017 and expect $200 million in annual impact to the segment once in full ethane recovery. 
In addition to the ethane opportunity, the growing STACK and SCOOP plays in Oklahoma present an opportunity for natural gas liquids volume growth as we remain a critical NGL takeaway provider in the area. Based on the conversations we've had with producer customers in the STACK and SCOOP plays and with the results they're seeing, we expect to gather an incremental 100,000 barrels per day of natural gas liquids from the play. Our current gathering system capacity can handle the natural gas liquids out of the Mid-Continent when the region is in full ethane recovery, and we expect to have available gathering capacity of approximately 40,000 barrels per day at full ethane recovery. We can expand by an additional 60,000 barrels per day with capital expenditures of less than $100 million for a total available gathering capacity of more than 100,000 barrels per day. 
Excluding the impact of changes in ethane recovery, we continue to expect NGL volumes to be weighted toward the second half of the year as incremental volumes from new natural gas processing plant connections continue to ramp up, including the connection of 3 third-party processing plants through the first half of 2016. We expect to connect 2 additional third-party plants, 1 each in the Williston and Mid-Continent, and our Bear Creek plant in August 2016, which equals a total of 6 plant connections in 2016. 
From a natural gas liquids perspective, supply and market connectivity remains our competitive advantage. Or said another way, our competitive advantage is our ability to connect our producers in key basins to consumers in key market centers. 
A very important component of our integrated NGL system is the connectivity we have between Conway and Mont Belvieu. We have a significant amount of available capacity between these 2 market centers, which allows the natural gas liquids out of the Williston, Rockies and the Mid-Continent to have connectivity to end markets. 
In the natural gas gathering and processing segment, the average fee rate increased to $0.76 in the second quarter 2016, driven by benefits from increased volumes on previously restructured contracts and continued contract restructuring efforts. This average fee rate is an $0.08 or 12% increase compared with the first quarter 2016 and a $0.37 or 95% increase compared with the second quarter of 2015. 
We expect the average fee rate to continue to increase but at a slower rate compared with the last 2 quarters. We are continuing to work on restructuring more contracts to be primarily fee based to reduce earnings volatility and enhance margins. 
Additionally, we did add nearly 85 new well connections in the Williston Basin during the second quarter. There are 19 rigs currently on our dedicated acreage along with approximately 350 drilled but uncompleted wells in inventory. Segment volumes decreased slightly compared with the first quarter 2016, impacted by planned facility maintenance and weather events in the Williston Basin. We estimate without these occurrences, the Williston natural gas gathered and processed volumes would have equaled the first quarter. The Mid-Continent's volumes were impacted by the timing of well completions and volume declines. 
I would like to emphasize that the gathering and processing segment's EBITDA increased approximately $10 million from the first quarter, even with lowered gathered and processed volumes, which shows the value of the enhanced margins achieved through our contract restructuring effort. 
The STACK and SCOOP plays are also benefiting the gathering and processing segment as we continue to see strong producer results in the plays. The majority of the well completions we expect to see at the end of 2016 and early 2017 are in the STACK, which is becoming one of the top return plays, which brings significant opportunities to all 3 ONEOK segments and especially the natural gas liquids segment. 
Our natural gas pipeline segment had another solid quarter. We moved up the expected completion of Phase 2 of the Roadrunner pipeline project to the fourth quarter 2016. The early expected completion resulted from good weather, limited issues with right of way and less rock than expected during the construction process. 
We also moved up the completion date of the Westex expansion project, as I mentioned previously, which is complementary to Roadrunner. This project is another example of our commitment to grow the partnership's long-term fee-based business. 
Our continued focus on stable, fee-based earnings growth has positioned us well for the remainder of 2016. While we're optimistic about the long-term outlook for commodity prices, we'll continue to prudently manage our business and position it for continued earnings growth while weathering the sometimes challenging and cyclical nature of the industry. 
Thank you for your continued support of ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. And as always, thank you to our employees, whose hard work, experienced and good decision making has made for another solid quarter amid difficult industry conditions. It is through our employees' hard work, creativity and dedication that our company remains well positioned to take advantage of the many opportunities we have under development.

And then when we think about a few rigs being out into the basin, increasing completion crews I think was announced by Whiting the other day as well, too. How should we be thinking about the exit rate for the Bakken? Do you think it'll be higher than what you were originally planning on in your original budget?

We have had some producers announce some -- bringing some crews back, and we do have that factored in. The weather and the facility maintenance, we saw basically just a minor decline in the second quarter. We're kind of flat right now. As we move in, we've got Bear Creek, which we now say will be completed in August, so we will see an extra 30 million to 40 million a day coming in when that plant comes online. And then towards the back half of the year, we're looking flat to -- flattish type volumes as we go through the end of 2016 with the completion activity in the rigs that we currently have kind of on the schedule. If we transition to the Mid-Continent, a little bit different story. We absolutely expect a back half weighting, especially towards the end of the year as some of the -- some large pads, the completions were delayed to the fourth quarter. And so from that standpoint, we do expect a ramp there, but -- and we've also had some gathered only volumes that have dropped off a little more than we anticipated coming into the year. But that's kind of how we see the Mid-Continent volumes shaping up through the end of the year."

So when you think about a more constructive environment, say maybe $55 to $65 a barrel oil environment, we're well positioned to capture more opportunities. So if you think about the impact from an EBITDA perspective or the incremental EBITDA, I think a 10% to 20% improvement, if all those things happen, I think would actually be conservative. So I think we could outperform that considerably."

In yesterday's earnings release, as we reiterated that ONEOK and ONEOK Partners expect to finish 2016 in line with financial guidance. In addition, we provided updated 2016 volume estimates for the gathering and processing and natural gas liquids segments in the third quarter earnings presentation.
As I discussed previously, our industry is experiencing one of many down cycles in my career, and it's been particularly challenging due to the duration of the low commodity price environment. While the cyclical nature of this industry continues, we are seeing more positive data points from our producer and end-user customers, industry fundamentals seemed to be improving and most importantly, ONEOK Partners is well positioned to benefit from growth opportunities in 2017 and beyond. Our businesses have performed well in a tough environment and we remain disciplined and committed to making prudent operational, commercial and financial decisions.
As I think about our opportunities, I remain confident in our ability to serve our petrochemical customers as their ethane demand grows. We also continue to see producer activity ramping up in the STACK and SCOOP, which we expect will benefit all 3 of our business segments. And most importantly, the available capacity in our natural gas liquids and natural gas gathering and processing segments gives us a room to grow without the need for large capital spending. Our more than $9 billion of investments over the last 10 years gives us the flexibility to grow with our producer and end-user customers without needing to spend significant capital.
The efforts we have taken during this down cycle to better position ONEOK and ONEOK Partners will allow us to continue providing value to our stakeholders. Derek, that concludes my opening remarks."

Starting with the partnership, third quarter 2016 adjusted EBITDA increased 3% compared with the second quarter 2016. And year-to-date adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.4 billion represents a 23% increase compared with the same period last year, benefiting from recently completed capital growth projects across our system and sustained higher average fee rates in the natural gas gathering and processing segment.
ONEOK Partners distribution coverage ratio was 1.11x for both the third quarter and year-to-date 2016. In yesterday's earnings release, we also lowered the partnership's expected maintenance capital spend for 2016. About $10 million of this reduction relates primarily to the timing of an NGL relocation project, $5 million for information technology upgrades, $5 million from lower-than-expected vendor and contractor costs with the balance being various small items. We continued deleveraging partnership's already strong balance sheet as trailing 12-month GAAP debt-to-EBITDA improved again to 4.3x at September 30. We continue to expect leverage of 4.2x or less for the full year 2016.
The partnership has ample liquidity and more than $1.7 billion of capacity on its $2.4 billion credit facility at September 30. In October, we've repaid $450 million, 6.15% senior notes with a combination of cash on hand and short-term borrowings. We continue to have no debt or equity capital market needs until well under 2017. However, we will continue to assess the markets for opportunities to proactively manage our future debt maturities and liquidity at the partnership.
The proactive steps we've taken to improve our leverage position and balance sheet are being recognized. In October, Moody's affirmed the partnerships investment grade Baa2 credit rating and approved our outlook to Stable from Negative. Also we expect these improvements will provide the partnership flexibility with excess coverage in the future. Options include repaying debt, funding capital expenditures, acquisitions or increasing the dividend -- excuse me, the distribution.
On a stand-alone basis, ONEOK ended third quarter with more than $230 million of cash and continues to expect to have approximately $250 million of cash by year-end 2016, with an undrawn $300 million credit facility allowing us continued financial flexibility. ONEOK's third quarter dividend coverage was 1.3x, consistent with the second quarter. ONEOK's healthy coverage and liquidity provides flexibilities we transition into 2017. Leverage improvements, increased distribution coverage, and increased fee-based earnings at ONEOK Partners have decreased the potential need for ONEOK's supported partnership. We will continue to be a supportive general partner to ONEOK Partners to help maintain its investment grade credit ratings, but also recognized that we have many potential options for the excess coverage at ONEOK. Those options include purchasing additional units in the partnership, repaying debt, repurchasing ONEOK shares, funding ONEOK Partners capital growth at the ONEOK level, acquisitions and increasing dividends to shareholders.
I would like to reiterate from a financial perspective, we are pleased with the progress we have made in 2016 at ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. Through the downturn, we've maintained our $0.615 per quarter dividend at ONEOK and our $0.79 per quarter distribution at ONEOK Partners while also improving coverage and reducing leverage through the proactive steps we've taken. And we continue looking for additional ways to increase shareholder value.
And I will turn the call back over to Terry."

Let's take a closer look at each of our business segments. Let's start with our natural gas liquids segment and some updates too our outlook for the year.In the presentation, we released yesterday with earnings, we update our expected",1378,"Thank you, Derek. Let's take a closer look at each of our business segments. Let's start with our natural gas liquids segment and some updates too our outlook for the year.
In the presentation, we released yesterday with earnings, we update our expected NGL volume estimates for 2016. We have seen lower volumes than expected with the lower margin, gathered-only barrels particularly on our West Texas LPG system and in the Barnett Shale. However, we have also seen higher fractionated volumes as gathered and fractionated barrels that earn higher fee rates have been strong on the Bakken NGL Pipeline and the Mid-Continent region, and we have also fractionated more spot barrels during the year. We expect 2016 gathered volumes to average approximately 780,000 barrels per day compared with our previous expected range of 800,000 to 870,000 barrels per day. And we expect volumes fractionated to average approximately 590,000 barrels per day, which is at the high end of our previous expected range.
In the third quarter 2016, we connected 2 additional third-party natural gas processing plants, one each in the Williston Basin and Mid-Continent. Including the connection of our Bear Creek natural gas processing plant in the Williston Basin, we've connected a total of 6 new plans to our NGL system in 2016. 
At full capacity, Bear Creek is expected to generate approximately 10,000 to 12,000 barrels per day of Y-grade takeaway, excluding ethane. The expected ethane growth from the petrochemical industry remains a key opportunity for ONEOK Partners. As we've said previously, approximately 1/3 of the ethane currently being rejected in the U.S. is on our system. We continue to expect the meaningful impact from the ethane opportunity as new petrochemical plants come online, plus an increase in ethane exports during 2017. And we expect as much as $200 million annual EBITDA impact to the segment once in full ethane recovery.
Recently, we've been talking quite a bit about the STACK and SCOOP plays in Oklahoma and the rapidly developing growth opportunities they can provide to all of our business segments, but particularly our natural gas liquids segment because of our position as a critical NGL takeaway provider in the area. We estimate that we're currently gathering approximately 150,000 to 200,000 barrels per day of NGLs from the STACK and SCOOP areas, which accounts for more than 20% of our expected 2016 gathered volumes and demonstrates our strong position in the growing STACK and SCOOP areas of the Mid-Continent where many producers are moving in drilling rigs and seeing very positive results.
Wells in the STACK play in particular are very NGL-rich with 6 to 9 gallons of NGLs per MCF in the natural gas stream.
Moving on to the natural gas gathering and processing segment. We expect natural gas volumes gathered to average approximately 1.5 billion to 1.6 billion cubic feet per day in 2016 compared with previous estimates of 1.7 billion to 1.8 billion cubic feet per day. The sole driver of these changes as we said previously are delays to large multi-well drilling pads and steeper-than-anticipated declines in gathered-only volumes in the Mid-Continent. We expect natural gas volumes processed to average approximately 1.4 billion to 1.5 billion cubic feet per day in 2016 compared with previous estimates of 1.5 billion to 1.6 billion cubic feet per day.
Our 2016 Williston Basin volume estimates remain unchanged and have benefited from a backlog of drilled but uncompleted wells, flared natural gas capture, new plants placed in service and continuing infrastructure build-out. While Mid-Continent volumes had been volatile this year, we continued to expect the segment to have higher natural gas processed volumes in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter 2016 as we've seen the completion of several wells in October and expect additional multi-well pad completions through the end of 2016 and into early 2017. We expect Mid-Continent process volumes to reach nearly 690 million cubic feet per day in the fourth quarter.
Specifically in the STACK, drilling economics remain viable based on recent conversations with our producers and well results have been impressive. We have seen some wells on our acreage average 30-day peak initial production rates of 8 million to 10 million cubic feet per day. In Williston Basin, we expect natural gas processed volumes to reach nearly 780 million cubic feet per day in the fourth quarter. This volume increase is driven by our recently completed Bear Creek plant and by increased well completions as producers work off some of their drilled but uncompleted wells inventory.  
The segment's average fee rate remained $0.76 per MMBtu in the third quarter 2016, unchanged from the second quarter 2016 and up $0.33 per MMBtu compared with the third quarter 2015. Sustained higher fee rates have provided stable earnings for the segment, and we expect the fee rate to stabilize in this range with some fluctuation due to volume or contract mix changes.
With the full benefit of our contract restructuring efforts being realized in 2016 and volume benefits from capital growth projects completed this year, we expect to finish 2016 in line with our financial guidance for the segment.
In the natural gas pipeline segment, adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter 2016 increased 17% compared with the second quarter 2016, driven by increased contracted capacity. In October, the segment completed its 260 million cubic feet per day WesTex Transmission Pipeline expansion and the second phase of its joint venture Roadrunner Gas Transmission pipeline, which adds an additional 400 million cubic feet per day of capacity to the Roadrunner pipeline. Both projects were completed ahead of original schedules and below cost estimates and our fully subscribed under long-term fee-based commitments. 
We've been successful in our strategy to move market, such as Mexico, closer to supply your area such as West Texas and in Mid-Continent. Our recently completed Roadrunner and WesTex pipeline projects are examples of our ability to do this. And as the STACK and SCOOP continue to gain momentum, we're well positioned to provide needed residue Takeaway options. We're currently connected to 34 natural gas processing plants in Oklahoma, with a total combined capacity of approximately 1.8 billion cubic feet per day and have a broad footprint throughout the state, placing us in a strong position to offer transportation and storage services as producer activity picks up in the Mid-Continent. 
Related to this effort, yesterday we posted a binding open season soliciting interest in expanding segments of our intrastate natural gas pipeline in Oklahoma, ONEOK gas transmission to provide additional residue Takeaway from the STACK and SCOOP production areas. The expansion would provide increased capacity and delivery options into pipelines in western Oklahoma, serving markets in the upper Midwest and Texas. We have secured a firm commitment from a customer to support expanding the pipeline, incremental 100 million cubic feet per day and in the open season, we will seek additional long-term firm commitments from shippers to support a broader expansion in the facility.
With nearly 100% fee-based earnings in the segment and our portfolio of high-quality and high connectivity assets, we will continue to look for additional opportunity to grow the stable business. Acting as a solution provider to end-use markets has served as well and will continue to be a key segment strategy.
To wrap up, I'd like to reiterate that we expect to finish 2016 in line with our financial guidance. We've seen better-than-expected results so far in our natural gas pipelines segment and on target results in our gathering and processing segment, our natural gas liquids segment [indiscernible] slightly below operating income and equity guidance for the year. 
With line of sight into our expected earnings growth, strong balance sheets at ONEOK and ONEOK Partners and continued healthy coverage, we expect to be in a position to increase dividend and distribution payments to stakeholders in the second half of 2017, if industry's fundamentals continue to improve.
Financially and operationally, we are in a strong position and we have the flexibility to take advantage of opportunities to create additional shareholder value.
Thank you for your continued support of ONEOK and ONEOK Partners, and as always, thank you to our employees for your hard work and continued dedication to operating our assets safely and environmental responsibly.

In yesterday's earnings release, as we reiterated that ONEOK and ONEOK Partners expect to finish 2016 in line with financial guidance. In addition, we provided updated 2016 volume estimates for the gathering and processing and natural gas liquids segments in the third quarter earnings presentation.
As I've discussed previously, our industry is experiencing one of many down cycles in my career, and it's been particularly challenging due to the duration of the low commodity price environment. While the cyclical nature of this industry continues, we are seeing more positive data points from our producer and end-user customers, industry fundamentals seemed to be improving, and most importantly, ONEOK Partners is well positioned to benefit from growth opportunities in 2017 and beyond. Our businesses have performed well in a tough environment and we remain disciplined and committed to making prudent operational, commercial and financial decisions.
As I think about our opportunities, I remain confident in our ability to serve our petrochemical customers as their ethane demand grows. We also continue to see producer activity ramping up in the STACK and SCOOP, which we expect will benefit all 3 of our business segments. And most importantly, the available capacity in our natural gas liquids and natural gas gathering and processing segments gives us room to grow without the need for large capital spending. Our more than $9 billion of investments over the last 10 years gives us the flexibility to grow with our producer and end-user customers without needing to spend significant capital.
The efforts we have taken during this down cycle to better position ONEOK and ONEOK Partners will allow us to continue providing value to our stakeholders. Derek, that concludes my opening remarks."

Starting with the partnership, third quarter 2016 adjusted EBITDA increased 3% compared with the second quarter of 2016. And year-to-date adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.4 billion represents a 23% increase compared with the same period last year, benefiting from recently completed capital growth projects across our system and sustained higher average fee rates in the natural gas gathering and processing segment.
ONEOK Partners' distribution coverage ratio was 1.11x for both the third quarter and year-to-date 2016. In yesterday's earnings release, we also lowered the partnership's expected maintenance capital spend for 2016. About $10 million of this reduction relates primarily to the timing of an NGL relocation project, $5 million for information technology upgrades, $5 million from lower-than-expected vendor and contractor costs with the balance being various smaller items. We continued deleveraging the partnership's already strong balance sheet as trailing 12 months GAAP debt-to-EBITDA improved again to 4.3x at September 30. We continue to expect leverage of 4.2x or less for the full year 2016.
The partnership has ample liquidity and more than $1.7 billion of capacity on its $2.4 billion credit facility at September 30. In October, we've repaid $450 million, 6.15% senior notes with a combination of cash on hand and short term borrowings. We continue to have no debt or equity capital market needs until well under 2017. However, we will continue to assess the markets for opportunities to proactively manage our future debt maturities and liquidity at the partnership.
The proactive steps we've taken to improve our leverage position and balance sheet are being recognized. In October, Moody's affirmed the partnership's investment grade, Baa2 credit rating, and approved our outlook to stable from negative. Also, we expect these improvements will provide the partnership flexibility with excess coverage in the future. Options include repaying debt, funding capital expenditures, acquisitions or increasing the dividend -- excuse me, the distribution.
On a standalone basis, ONEOK ended the third quarter with more than $230 million of cash and continues to expect to have approximately $250 million of cash by year-end 2016, with an undrawn $300 million credit facility allowing us continued financial flexibility. ONEOK's third quarter dividend coverage was 1.3x, consistent with the second quarter. ONEOK's healthy coverage and liquidity provides flexibilities we'd transition into 2017. Leverage improvements, increased distribution coverage, and increased fee-based earnings at ONEOK Partners have decreased the potential need for ONEOK's support of the partnership. We will continue to be a supportive general partner to ONEOK Partners to help maintain its investment grade credit ratings, but also recognize that we have many potential options for the excess coverage at ONEOK. Those options include purchasing additional units in the partnership, repaying debt, repurchasing ONEOK shares, funding ONEOK Partners' capital growth at the ONEOK level, acquisitions and increasing dividends to shareholders.
I would like to reiterate from a financial perspective, we are pleased with the progress we have made in 2016 at ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. Through the downturn, we've maintained our $0.615 per quarter dividend at ONEOK and our $0.79 per quarter distribution at ONEOK Partners while also improving coverage and reducing leverage through the proactive steps we've taken. And we continue looking for additional ways to increase shareholder value.
And I will turn the call back over to Terry."

Let's take a closer look at each of our business segments. Let's start with our natural gas liquids segment and some updates to our outlook for the year.In the presentation we released yesterday with earnings, we update our expected NG",1382,"Thank you, Derek. Let's take a closer look at each of our business segments. Let's start with our natural gas liquids segment and some updates to our outlook for the year.
In the presentation we released yesterday with earnings, we update our expected NGL volume estimates for 2016. We have seen lower volumes than expected with the lower margin, gathered-only barrels particularly on our West Texas LPG system and in the Barnett Shale. However, we have also seen higher fractionated volumes, as gathered and fractionated barrels that earn higher fee rates, have been strong on the Bakken NGL Pipeline and the Mid-Continent region, and we have also fractionated more spot barrels during the year. We expect 2016 gathered volumes to average approximately 780,000 barrels per day compared with our previous expected range of 800,000 to 870,000 barrels per day. And we expect volumes fractionated to average approximately 590,000 barrels per day, which is at the high end of our previous expected range.
In the third quarter 2016, we connected 2 additional third-party natural gas processing plants. One each in the Williston Basin and Mid-Continent, including the connection of our Bear Creek natural gas processing plant in the Williston Basin. We've connected a total of 6 new plants to our NGL system in 2016. 
At full capacity, Bear Creek is expected to generate approximately 10,000 to 12,000 barrels per day of y-grade takeaway, excluding ethane. The expected ethane growth from the petrochemical industry remains a key opportunity for ONEOK Partners. As we've said previously, approximately 1/3 of the ethane currently being rejected in the U.S. is on our system. We continue to expect a meaningful impact from the ethane opportunity as new petrochemical plants come online, plus an increase in ethane exports during 2017. And we expect as much as $200 million annual EBITDA impact to the segment once in full ethane recovery.
Recently, we've been talking quite a bit about the STACK and SCOOP plays in Oklahoma and the rapidly developing growth opportunities they can provide to all of our business segments, but particularly our natural gas liquids segment because of our position as a critical NGL takeaway provider in the area. We estimate that we're currently gathering approximately 150,000 to 200,000 barrels per day of NGLs from the STACK and SCOOP areas, which accounts for more than 20% of our expected 2016 gathered volumes and demonstrates our strong position in the growing STACK and SCOOP areas of the Mid-Continent where many producers are moving in drilling rigs and seeing very positive results.
Wells in the STACK play in particular are very NGL-rich with 6 to 9 gallons of NGLs per MCF in the natural gas stream.
Moving on to the natural gas gathering and processing segment. We expect natural gas volumes gathered to average approximately 1.5 billion to 1.6 billion cubic feet per day in 2016, compared with previous estimates of 1.7 billion to 1.8 billion cubic feet per day. The sole driver of these changes, as we said previously, are delays to large multi-well drilling pads and steeper-than-anticipated declines in gathered-only volumes in the Mid-Continent. We expect natural gas volumes processed to average approximately 1.4 billion to 1.5 billion cubic feet per day in 2016, compared with previous estimates of 1.5 billion to 1.6 billion cubic feet per day.
Our 2016 Williston Basin volume estimates remain unchanged and have benefited from a backlog of drilled but uncompleted wells, flared natural gas capture, new plants placed in service and continuing infrastructure buildout. While Mid-Continent volumes had been volatile this year, we continued to expect the segment to have higher natural gas processed volumes in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter 2016 as we've seen the completion of several wells in October and expect additional multi-well pad completions through the end of 2016 and into early 2017. We expect Mid-Continent process volumes to reach nearly 690 million cubic feet per day in the fourth quarter.
Specifically in the STACK, drilling economics remain viable based on recent conversations with our producers, and well results have been impressive. We have seen some wells on our acreage average 30-day peak initial production rates of 8 million to 10 million cubic feet per day. In the Williston Basin, we expect natural gas processed volumes to reach nearly 780 million cubic feet per day in the fourth quarter. This volume increase is driven by our recently completed Bear Creek plant and by increased well completions as producers work off some of their drilled but uncompleted well inventory.
The segment's average fee rate remain $0.76 per MMBtu in the third quarter 2016, unchanged from the second quarter 2016 and up $0.33 per MMBtu compared with the third quarter 2015. Sustained higher fee rates have provided stable earnings for the segment, and we expect the fee rate to stabilize in this range with some fluctuation due to volume or contract mix changes.
With the full benefit of our contract restructuring efforts being realized in 2016 and volume benefits from capital growth projects completed this year, we expect to finish 2016 in line with our financial guidance for the segment.
In the natural gas pipeline segment, adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter 2016 increased 17% compared with the second quarter 2016, driven by increased contracted capacity. In October, the segment completed its 260 million cubic feet per day WesTex Transmission Pipeline expansion and the second phase of its joint venture Roadrunner Gas Transmission pipeline, which adds an additional 400 million cubic feet per day of capacity to the Roadrunner pipeline. Both projects were completed ahead of original schedules and below cost estimates and are fully subscribed under long-term fee-based commitments.
We've been successful in our strategy to move market, such as Mexico, closer to supply areas such as West Texas and in the Mid-Continent. Our recently completed Roadrunner and WesTex pipeline projects are examples of our ability to do this. And as the STACK and SCOOP continue to gain momentum, we're well positioned to provide needed residue takeaway options. We're currently connected to 34 natural gas processing plants in Oklahoma, with a total combined capacity of approximately 1.8 billion cubic feet per day and have a broad footprint throughout the state, placing us in a strong position to offer transportation and storage services as producer activity picks up in the Mid-Continent.
Related to this effort, yesterday, we posted a binding open season soliciting interest in expanding segments of our intrastate natural gas pipeline in Oklahoma, ONEOK gas transmission, to provide additional residue takeaway from the STACK and SCOOP production areas. The expansion would provide increased capacity and delivery options into pipelines in western Oklahoma, serving markets in the upper Midwest and Texas. We have secured a firm commitment from a customer to support expanding the pipeline by an incremental 100 million cubic feet per day. And in the open season, we will seek additional long-term firm commitments from shippers to support a broader expansion in the facility.
With nearly 100% fee-based earnings in the segment and our portfolio of high-quality and high connectivity assets, we will continue to look for additional opportunities to grow the stable business, acting as a solution provider to end-use markets has served as well and will continue to be a key segment strategy.
To wrap up, I'd like to reiterate that we expect to finish 2016 in line with our financial guidance. We've seen better-than-expected results so far in our natural gas pipelines segment and on target results in our gathering and processing segment, our natural gas liquids segment may end slightly below operating income and equity earnings guidance for the year. 
With line of sight into our expected earnings growth, strong balance sheets at ONEOK and ONEOK Partners and continued healthy coverage, we expect to be in a position to increase dividend and distribution payments to stakeholders in the second half of 2017, if industry's fundamentals continue to improve.
Financially and operationally, we're in a strong position and we have the flexibility to take advantage of opportunities to create additional shareholder value.
Thank you for your continued support of ONEOK and ONEOK Partners, and as always, thank you to our employees for your hard work and continued dedication to operating our assets safely and environmentally, responsibly.

As we come out of that process, we might be in a position to shed even more light on our thoughts. And I think broadly speaking, as we think about OKE, kind of to your earlier question, we have -- and we've kept this thicker coverage in this very challenging environment. But I think as you think about coverage going forward at OKE over a much longer-term period, we're going to gravitate more towards a 1.0 to a 1.1 coverage range. So that's kind of how we're thinking about it on a much longer-term perspective."

These big pads come online. We could see -- it's not gotten cold yet, so you could see some upside in terms of NGL pricing and spreads and what have you. But you also -- you've got headwinds too and you've got heavy inventories in the industry that could weigh on it and some uncertainty in the export markets that could affect the industry near term. All in all, for us, it equates to a high degree of confidence in our ability to hit our numbers in terms of our guidance. Does that help you?"

In yesterday's earnings releases, as we reiterated that ONEOK and ONEOK Partners expect to finish 2016 in line with financial guidance. In addition, we provided updated 2016 volume estimates for the gathering and processing and natural gas liquids segments in the third quarter earnings presentation.
As I've discussed previously, our industry is experiencing one of many down cycles in my career, and it's been particularly challenging due to the duration of the low commodity price environment. While the cyclical nature of this industry continues, we are seeing more positive data points from our producer and end-user customers, industry fundamentals seem to be improving, and most importantly, ONEOK Partners is well positioned to benefit from growth opportunities in 2017 and beyond. Our businesses have performed well in a tough environment and we remain disciplined and committed to making prudent operational, commercial and financial decisions.
As I think about our opportunities, I remain confident in our ability to serve our petrochemical customers as their ethane demand grows. We also continue to see producer activity ramping up in the STACK and SCOOP, which we expect will benefit all 3 of our business segments. And most importantly, the available capacity in our natural gas liquids and natural gas gathering and processing segments gives us room to grow without the need for large capital spending. Our more than $9 billion of investments over the last 10 years gives us the flexibility to grow with our producer and end-user customers without needing to spend significant capital.
The efforts we have taken during this down cycle to better position ONEOK and ONEOK Partners will allow us to continue providing value to our stakeholders. Derek, that concludes my opening remarks."

Starting with the partnership, third quarter 2016 adjusted EBITDA increased 3% compared with the second quarter of 2016. And year-to-date adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.4 billion represents a 23% increase compared with the same period last year, benefiting from recently completed capital growth projects across our system and sustained higher average fee rates in the natural gas gathering and processing segment.
ONEOK Partners' distribution coverage ratio was 1.11x for both the third quarter and year-to-date 2016. In yesterday's earnings release, we also lowered the partnership's expected maintenance capital spend for 2016. About $10 million of this reduction relates primarily to the timing of an NGL relocation project, $5 million for information technology upgrades, $5 million from lower-than-expected vendor and contractor costs with the balance being various smaller items. We continued deleveraging the partnership's already strong balance sheet as trailing 12 months GAAP debt-to-EBITDA improved again to 4.3x at September 30. We continue to expect leverage of 4.2x or less for the full year 2016.
The partnership has ample liquidity and more than $1.7 billion of capacity on its $2.4 billion credit facility at September 30. In October, we've repaid $450 million, 6.15% senior notes with a combination of cash on hand and short term borrowings. We continue to have no debt or equity capital market needs until well into 2017. However, we will continue to assess the markets for opportunities to proactively manage our future debt maturities and liquidity at the partnership.
The proactive steps we've taken to improve our leverage position and balance sheet are being recognized. In October, Moody's affirmed the partnership's investment grade, Baa2 credit rating, and approved our outlook to stable from negative. Also, we expect these improvements will provide the partnership flexibility with excess coverage in the future. Options include repaying debt, funding capital expenditures, acquisitions or increasing the dividend -- excuse me, the distribution.
On a standalone basis, ONEOK ended the third quarter with more than $230 million of cash and continues to expect to have approximately $250 million of cash by year-end 2016, with an undrawn $300 million credit facility allowing us continued financial flexibility. ONEOK's third quarter dividend coverage was 1.3x, consistent with the second quarter. ONEOK's healthy coverage and liquidity provides flexibility as we transition into 2017. Leverage improvements, increased distribution coverage, and increased fee-based earnings at ONEOK Partners have decreased the potential need for ONEOK's support of the partnership. We will continue to be a supportive general partner to ONEOK Partners to help maintain its investment grade credit ratings, but also recognize that we have many potential options for the excess coverage at ONEOK. Those options include purchasing additional units in the partnership, repaying debt, repurchasing ONEOK shares, funding ONEOK Partners' capital growth at the ONEOK level, acquisitions and increasing dividends to shareholders.
I would like to reiterate from a financial perspective, we are pleased with the progress we have made in 2016 at ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. Through the downturn, we've maintained our $0.615 per quarter dividend at ONEOK and our $0.79 per quarter distribution at ONEOK Partners while also improving coverage and reducing leverage through the proactive steps we've taken. And we continue looking for additional ways to increase shareholder value.
And I will turn the call back over to Terry."

Let's take a closer look at each of our business segments. Let's start with our natural gas liquids segment and some updates to our outlook for the year.In the presentation we released yesterday with earnings, we update our expected NG",1382,"Thank you, Derek. Let's take a closer look at each of our business segments. Let's start with our natural gas liquids segment and some updates to our outlook for the year.
In the presentation we released yesterday with earnings, we update our expected NGL volume estimates for 2016. We have seen lower volumes than expected with the lower margin, gathered-only barrels particularly on our West Texas LPG system and in the Barnett Shale. However, we have also seen higher fractionated volumes, as gathered and fractionated barrels that earn higher fee rates have been strong on the Bakken NGL Pipeline and the Mid-Continent region, and we have also fractionated more spot barrels during the year. We expect 2016 gathered volumes to average approximately 780,000 barrels per day compared with our previous expected range of 800,000 to 870,000 barrels per day. And we expect volumes fractionated to average approximately 590,000 barrels per day, which is at the high end of our previous expected range.
In the third quarter 2016, we connected 2 additional third-party natural gas processing plants. One each in the Williston Basin and Mid-Continent. Including the connection of our Bear Creek natural gas processing plant in the Williston Basin, we've connected a total of 6 new plants to our NGL system in 2016. 
At full capacity, Bear Creek is expected to generate approximately 10,000 to 12,000 barrels per day of y-grade takeaway, excluding ethane. The expected ethane growth from the petrochemical industry remains a key opportunity for ONEOK Partners. As we've said previously, approximately 1/3 of the ethane currently being rejected in the U.S. is on our system. We continue to expect a meaningful impact from the ethane opportunity as new petrochemical plants come online, plus an increase in ethane exports during 2017. And we expect as much as $200 million annual EBITDA impact to the segment once in full ethane recovery.
Recently, we've been talking quite a bit about the STACK and SCOOP plays in Oklahoma and the rapidly developing growth opportunities they can provide to all of our business segments, but particularly our natural gas liquids segment because of our position as a critical NGL takeaway provider in the area. We estimate that we're currently gathering approximately 150,000 to 200,000 barrels per day of NGLs from the STACK and SCOOP areas, which accounts for more than 20% of our expected 2016 gathered volumes and demonstrates our strong position in the growing STACK and SCOOP areas of the Mid-Continent where many producers are moving in drilling rigs and seeing very positive results.
Wells in the STACK play in particular are very NGL-rich with 6 to 9 gallons of NGLs per MCF in the natural gas stream.
Moving on to the natural gas gathering and processing segment. We expect natural gas volumes gathered to average approximately 1.5 billion to 1.6 billion cubic feet per day in 2016, compared with previous estimates of 1.7 billion to 1.8 billion cubic feet per day. The sole driver of these changes, as we said previously, are delays to large multi-well drilling pads and steeper-than-anticipated declines in gathered-only volumes in the Mid-Continent. We expect natural gas volumes processed to average approximately 1.4 billion to 1.5 billion cubic feet per day in 2016, compared with previous estimates of 1.5 billion to 1.6 billion cubic feet per day.
Our 2016 Williston Basin volume estimates remain unchanged and have benefited from a backlog of drilled but uncompleted wells, flared natural gas capture, new plants placed in service and continuing infrastructure buildout. While Mid-Continent volumes had been volatile this year, we continue to expect the segment to have higher natural gas processed volumes in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter 2016 as we've seen the completion of several wells in October and expect additional multi-well pad completions through the end of 2016 and into early 2017. We expect Mid-Continent process volumes to reach nearly 690 million cubic feet per day in the fourth quarter.
Specifically in the STACK, drilling economics remain viable based on recent conversations with our producers, and well results have been impressive. We have seen some wells on our acreage average 30-day peak initial production rates of 8 million to 10 million cubic feet per day. In the Williston Basin, we expect natural gas processed volumes to reach nearly 780 million cubic feet per day in the fourth quarter. This volume increase is driven by our recently completed Bear Creek plant and by increased well completions as producers work off some of their drilled but uncompleted well inventory.
The segment's average fee rate remain $0.76 per MMBtu in the third quarter 2016, unchanged from the second quarter 2016 and up $0.33 per MMBtu compared with the third quarter 2015. Sustained higher fee rates have provided stable earnings for the segment, and we expect the fee rate to stabilize in this range with some fluctuation due to volume or contract mix changes.
With the full benefit of our contract restructuring efforts being realized in 2016 and volume benefits from capital growth projects completed this year, we expect to finish 2016 in line with our financial guidance for the segment.
In the natural gas pipeline segment, adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter 2016 increased 17% compared with the second quarter 2016, driven by increased contracted capacity. In October, the segment completed its 260 million cubic feet per day WesTex Transmission Pipeline expansion and the second phase of its joint venture Roadrunner Gas Transmission pipeline, which adds an additional 400 million cubic feet per day of capacity to the Roadrunner pipeline. Both projects were completed ahead of original schedules and below cost estimates and are fully subscribed under long-term fee-based commitments.
We've been successful in our strategy to move market, such as Mexico, closer to supply areas such as West Texas and in the Mid-Continent. Our recently completed Roadrunner and WesTex pipeline projects are examples of our ability to do this. And as the STACK and SCOOP continue to gain momentum, we're well positioned to provide needed residue takeaway options. We're currently connected to 34 natural gas processing plants in Oklahoma, with a total combined capacity of approximately 1.8 billion cubic feet per day and have a broad footprint throughout the state, placing us in a strong position to offer transportation and storage services as producer activity picks up in the Mid-Continent.
Related to this effort, yesterday, we posted a binding open season soliciting interest in expanding segments of our intrastate natural gas pipeline in Oklahoma, ONEOK gas transmission, to provide additional residue takeaway from the STACK and SCOOP production areas. The expansion would provide increased capacity and delivery options into pipelines in western Oklahoma, serving markets in the upper Midwest and Texas. We have secured a firm commitment from a customer to support expanding the pipeline by an incremental 100 million cubic feet per day. And in the open season, we will seek additional long-term firm commitments from shippers to support a broader expansion in the facility.
With nearly 100% fee-based earnings in the segment and our portfolio of high-quality and high connectivity assets, we will continue to look for additional opportunities to grow this stable business, acting as a solution provider to end-use markets has served as well and will continue to be a key segment strategy.
To wrap up, I'd like to reiterate that we expect to finish 2016 in line with our financial guidance. We've seen better-than-expected results so far in our natural gas pipelines segment and on target results in our gathering and processing segment, our natural gas liquids segment may end slightly below operating income and equity earnings guidance for the year. 
With line of sight into our expected earnings growth, strong balance sheets at ONEOK and ONEOK Partners and continued healthy coverage, we expect to be in a position to increase dividend and distribution payments to stakeholders in the second half of 2017, if industry's fundamentals continue to improve.
Financially and operationally, we're in a strong position and we have the flexibility to take advantage of opportunities to create additional shareholder value.
Thank you for your continued support of ONEOK and ONEOK Partners, and as always, thank you to our employees for your hard work and continued dedication to operating our assets safely and environmentally responsibly.

In yesterday's earnings releases, as we reiterated that ONEOK and ONEOK Partners expect to finish 2016 in line with financial guidance. In addition, we provided updated 2016 volume estimates for the gathering and processing and natural gas liquids segments in the third quarter earnings presentation.
As I've discussed previously, our industry is experiencing one of many down cycles in my career, and it's been particularly challenging due to the duration of the low commodity price environment. While the cyclical nature of this industry continues, we are seeing more positive data points from our producer and end-user customers, industry fundamentals seem to be improving, and most importantly, ONEOK Partners is well positioned to benefit from growth opportunities in 2017 and beyond. Our businesses have performed well in a tough environment and we remain disciplined and committed to making prudent operational, commercial and financial decisions.
As I think about our opportunities, I remain confident in our ability to serve our petrochemical customers as their ethane demand grows. We also continue to see producer activity ramping up in the STACK and SCOOP, which we expect will benefit all 3 of our business segments. And most importantly, the available capacity in our natural gas liquids and natural gas gathering and processing segments gives us room to grow without the need for large capital spending. Our more than $9 billion of investments over the last 10 years gives us the flexibility to grow with our producer and end-user customers without needing to spend significant capital.
The efforts we have taken during this down cycle to better position ONEOK and ONEOK Partners will allow us to continue providing value to our stakeholders. Derek, that concludes my opening remarks."

Starting with the partnership, third quarter 2016 adjusted EBITDA increased 3% compared with the second quarter of 2016. And year-to-date adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.4 billion represents a 23% increase compared with the same period last year, benefiting from recently completed capital growth projects across our system and sustained higher average fee rates in the natural gas gathering and processing segment.
ONEOK Partners' distribution coverage ratio was 1.11x for both the third quarter and year-to-date 2016. In yesterday's earnings release, we also lowered the partnership's expected maintenance capital spend for 2016. About $10 million of this reduction relates primarily to the timing of an NGL relocation project, $5 million for information technology upgrades, $5 million from lower-than-expected vendor and contractor costs with the balance being various smaller items. We continued deleveraging the partnership's already strong balance sheet as trailing 12 months GAAP debt-to-EBITDA improved again to 4.3x at September 30. We continue to expect leverage of 4.2x or less for the full year 2016.
The partnership has ample liquidity and more than $1.7 billion of capacity on its $2.4 billion credit facility at September 30. In October, we've repaid $450 million, 6.15% senior notes with a combination of cash on hand and short term borrowings. We continue to have no debt or equity capital market needs until well into 2017. However, we will continue to assess the markets for opportunities to proactively manage our future debt maturities and liquidity at the partnership.
The proactive steps we've taken to improve our leverage position and balance sheet are being recognized. In October, Moody's affirmed the partnership's investment grade, Baa2 credit rating, and approved our outlook to stable from negative. Also, we expect these improvements will provide the partnership flexibility with excess coverage in the future. Options include repaying debt, funding capital expenditures, acquisitions or increasing the dividend -- excuse me, the distribution.
On a standalone basis, ONEOK ended the third quarter with more than $230 million of cash and continues to expect to have approximately $250 million of cash by year-end 2016, with an undrawn $300 million credit facility allowing us continued financial flexibility. ONEOK's third quarter dividend coverage was 1.3x, consistent with the second quarter. ONEOK's healthy coverage and liquidity provides flexibility as we transition into 2017. Leverage improvements, increased distribution coverage, and increased fee-based earnings at ONEOK Partners have decreased the potential need for ONEOK's support of the partnership. We will continue to be a supportive general partner to ONEOK Partners to help maintain its investment grade credit ratings, but also recognize that we have many potential options for the excess coverage at ONEOK. Those options include purchasing additional units in the partnership, repaying debt, repurchasing ONEOK shares, funding ONEOK Partners' capital growth at the ONEOK level, acquisitions and increasing dividends to shareholders.
I would like to reiterate from a financial perspective, we are pleased with the progress we have made in 2016 at ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. Through the downturn, we've maintained our $0.615 per quarter dividend at ONEOK and our $0.79 per quarter distribution at ONEOK Partners while also improving coverage and reducing leverage through the proactive steps we've taken. And we continue looking for additional ways to increase shareholder value.
And I will turn the call back over to Terry."

Let's take a closer look at each of our business segments. Let's start with our natural gas liquids segment and some updates to our outlook for the year.In the presentation we released yesterday with earnings, we update our expected NG",1382,"Thank you, Derek. Let's take a closer look at each of our business segments. Let's start with our natural gas liquids segment and some updates to our outlook for the year.
In the presentation we released yesterday with earnings, we update our expected NGL volume estimates for 2016. We have seen lower volumes than expected with the lower margin, gathered-only barrels particularly on our West Texas LPG system and in the Barnett Shale. However, we have also seen higher fractionated volumes, as gathered and fractionated barrels that earn higher fee rates have been strong on the Bakken NGL Pipeline and the Mid-Continent region, and we have also fractionated more spot barrels during the year. We expect 2016 gathered volumes to average approximately 780,000 barrels per day compared with our previous expected range of 800,000 to 870,000 barrels per day. And we expect volumes fractionated to average approximately 590,000 barrels per day, which is at the high end of our previous expected range.
In the third quarter 2016, we connected 2 additional third-party natural gas processing plants. One each in the Williston Basin and Mid-Continent. Including the connection of our Bear Creek natural gas processing plant in the Williston Basin, we've connected a total of 6 new plants to our NGL system in 2016. 
At full capacity, Bear Creek is expected to generate approximately 10,000 to 12,000 barrels per day of y-grade takeaway, excluding ethane. The expected ethane growth from the petrochemical industry remains a key opportunity for ONEOK Partners. As we've said previously, approximately 1/3 of the ethane currently being rejected in the U.S. is on our system. We continue to expect a meaningful impact from the ethane opportunity as new petrochemical plants come online, plus an increase in ethane exports during 2017. And we expect as much as $200 million annual EBITDA impact to the segment once in full ethane recovery.
Recently, we've been talking quite a bit about the STACK and SCOOP plays in Oklahoma and the rapidly developing growth opportunities they can provide to all of our business segments, but particularly our natural gas liquids segment because of our position as a critical NGL takeaway provider in the area. We estimate that we're currently gathering approximately 150,000 to 200,000 barrels per day of NGLs from the STACK and SCOOP areas, which accounts for more than 20% of our expected 2016 gathered volumes and demonstrates our strong position in the growing STACK and SCOOP areas of the Mid-Continent where many producers are moving in drilling rigs and seeing very positive results.
Wells in the STACK play in particular are very NGL-rich with 6 to 9 gallons of NGLs per MCF in the natural gas stream.
Moving on to the natural gas gathering and processing segment. We expect natural gas volumes gathered to average approximately 1.5 billion to 1.6 billion cubic feet per day in 2016, compared with previous estimates of 1.7 billion to 1.8 billion cubic feet per day. The sole driver of these changes, as we said previously, are delays to large multi-well drilling pads and steeper-than-anticipated declines in gathered-only volumes in the Mid-Continent. We expect natural gas volumes processed to average approximately 1.4 billion to 1.5 billion cubic feet per day in 2016, compared with previous estimates of 1.5 billion to 1.6 billion cubic feet per day.
Our 2016 Williston Basin volume estimates remain unchanged and have benefited from a backlog of drilled but uncompleted wells, flared natural gas capture, new plants placed in service and continuing infrastructure buildout. While Mid-Continent volumes had been volatile this year, we continue to expect the segment to have higher natural gas processed volumes in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter 2016 as we've seen the completion of several wells in October and expect additional multi-well pad completions through the end of 2016 and into early 2017. We expect Mid-Continent process volumes to reach nearly 690 million cubic feet per day in the fourth quarter.
Specifically in the STACK, drilling economics remain viable based on recent conversations with our producers, and well results have been impressive. We have seen some wells on our acreage average 30-day peak initial production rates of 8 million to 10 million cubic feet per day. In the Williston Basin, we expect natural gas processed volumes to reach nearly 780 million cubic feet per day in the fourth quarter. This volume increase is driven by our recently completed Bear Creek plant and by increased well completions as producers work off some of their drilled but uncompleted well inventory.
The segment's average fee rate remain $0.76 per MMBtu in the third quarter 2016, unchanged from the second quarter 2016 and up $0.33 per MMBtu compared with the third quarter 2015. Sustained higher fee rates have provided stable earnings for the segment, and we expect the fee rate to stabilize in this range with some fluctuation due to volume or contract mix changes.
With the full benefit of our contract restructuring efforts being realized in 2016 and volume benefits from capital growth projects completed this year, we expect to finish 2016 in line with our financial guidance for the segment.
In the natural gas pipeline segment, adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter 2016 increased 17% compared with the second quarter 2016, driven by increased contracted capacity. In October, the segment completed its 260 million cubic feet per day WesTex Transmission Pipeline expansion and the second phase of its joint venture Roadrunner Gas Transmission pipeline, which adds an additional 400 million cubic feet per day of capacity to the Roadrunner pipeline. Both projects were completed ahead of original schedules and below cost estimates and are fully subscribed under long-term fee-based commitments.
We've been successful in our strategy to move market, such as Mexico, closer to supply areas such as West Texas and in the Mid-Continent. Our recently completed Roadrunner and WesTex pipeline projects are examples of our ability to do this. And as the STACK and SCOOP continue to gain momentum, we're well positioned to provide needed residue takeaway options. We're currently connected to 34 natural gas processing plants in Oklahoma, with a total combined capacity of approximately 1.8 billion cubic feet per day and have a broad footprint throughout the state, placing us in a strong position to offer transportation and storage services as producer activity picks up in the Mid-Continent.
Related to this effort, yesterday, we posted a binding open season soliciting interest in expanding segments of our intrastate natural gas pipeline in Oklahoma, ONEOK gas transmission, to provide additional residue takeaway from the STACK and SCOOP production areas. The expansion would provide increased capacity and delivery options into pipelines in western Oklahoma, serving markets in the upper Midwest and Texas. We have secured a firm commitment from a customer to support expanding the pipeline by an incremental 100 million cubic feet per day. And in the open season, we will seek additional long-term firm commitments from shippers to support a broader expansion in the facility.
With nearly 100% fee-based earnings in the segment and our portfolio of high-quality and high connectivity assets, we will continue to look for additional opportunities to grow this stable business, acting as a solution provider to end-use markets has served as well and will continue to be a key segment strategy.
To wrap up, I'd like to reiterate that we expect to finish 2016 in line with our financial guidance. We've seen better-than-expected results so far in our natural gas pipelines segment and on target results in our gathering and processing segment, our natural gas liquids segment may end slightly below operating income and equity earnings guidance for the year. 
With line of sight into our expected earnings growth, strong balance sheets at ONEOK and ONEOK Partners and continued healthy coverage, we expect to be in a position to increase dividend and distribution payments to stakeholders in the second half of 2017, if industry's fundamentals continue to improve.
Financially and operationally, we're in a strong position and we have the flexibility to take advantage of opportunities to create additional shareholder value.
Thank you for your continued support of ONEOK and ONEOK Partners, and as always, thank you to our employees for your hard work and continued dedication to operating our assets safely and environmentally responsibly.
