Our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers, while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders. 
During 2015, VeriSign delivered strong financial performance, including reporting $1,059,000,000 in revenues, expanding free cash flow to $629 million and producing full year non-GAAP operating margins of 61.5%. 
Operationally, 2015 was another strong year for the company. VeriSign processed 38.8 million new .com and .net domain name registrations and finished the year with 139.8 million common net names in the domain name base. 
During the year, we marked more than 18 years of uninterrupted availability of the VeriSign DNS for .com and .net. 
As a part of managing our business, during the fourth quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1.8 million shares for $150 million. 
During the full year 2015, we repurchased 9.3 million shares for $622 million. 
Effective today, the Board of Directors increased the amount of VeriSign common stock authorized for repurchase by approximately $611 million to a total of $1 billion authorized and available under the share buyback program, which has no expiration. 
Our financial position is strong with $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter, of which $753 million was held domestically and the remainder held abroad. 
We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. 
At the end of December, the domain name base in .com and .net was 139.8 million, consisting of 124 million names for .com and 15.8 million names per .net. This represents an increase of 6.3% year-over-year as calculated including domain names on hold for both periods. 
In the fourth quarter, we added 4.6 million net names to the domain name base after processing 12.2 million new gross registrations. 
In the third quarter of 2015, the renewal rate was 71.9% compared with 72% for the same quarter of 2014. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the fourth quarter of 2015 will be approximately 73.3%. This preliminary rate compares favorably to 72.5% achieved in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
As we discussed over the last few quarters, there are many factors that drive domain growth. These include, but are not limited to, Internet adoption, economic activity, eCommerce activity and registrar go-to-market strategies. 
Towards the end of the third quarter and mainly during the first 2 months of the fourth quarter, we saw higher volume of gross additions coming largely in our Asia Pacific region primarily through registrars in China. While we believe China and the Asia Pacific region will continue to perform well, we expect these markets to return to more normal levels in 2016. 
Based on registrar feedback, the most likely contributor of the additional gross addition volume appears to have been driven primarily from domain investment activity in that region. 
Also, as we have noted in the past, the renewal rates for domain names registered in emerging markets such as Asia Pacific, have historically been lower than those registered in more developed markets. 
Considering these factors, we expect the first 3 quarters of the year to have roughly a similar pattern of quarterly net additions to the domain name base as we saw during 2015. However, we expect the fourth quarter of 2016 to be somewhat unique as the expiring domain name base in that quarter will have the largest percentage of first time renewing names that we've seen as a result of the strong Q4 2015 performance. 
While it's difficult to assess what the renewal characteristics of these new names will be due to the usually large upcoming Q4 2016 expiring base, we expect fourth quarter deletions to be elevated. 
Accordingly, deletions could exceed additions in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
Based on these and other factors, we expect the first quarter 2016 net change to the domain name base to be an increase of between 1.5 million and 2 million names and we are forecasting the full year 2016 domain name base growth rate to be between 0.5% and 2%. 
As noted in prior calls, updates to the domain name base are posted on our website at least once per day and our website allows you to track the domain name base throughout the coming quarter and year. 
Finally, as an update related to the launch of our internationalized domain name versions of .com and .net, during December, the localized katakana version of .com in Japanese launched and will be in the sunrise period until March 14. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to George."

For the full year 2015, we recognized revenue of $1,059,000,000, up 4.9% from full year 2014 revenue and delivered GAAP operating income of $606 million, up 7.4% from $564 million for the full year 2014.

During the fourth quarter, we recognized revenue of $273 million, up 6.5% year-over-year and delivered GAAP operating income of $158 million, up 11.3% from $142 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
The GAAP operating margin in the fourth quarter came to 58.1% compared to 55.6% in the same quarter a year ago. GAAP net income totaled $102 million compared to $65 million a year earlier, which produced diluted cap earnings per share of $0.76 in the fourth quarter this year compared to $0.48 for the fourth quarter of last year. As described last year, our fourth quarter 2014 GAAP net income was decreased by $26 million and diluted EPS was decreased by $0.19, primarily due to a non-U.S. income tax charge related to our reorganization of certain international operations and a charge in estimated -- charge in estimate for U.S. income tax charges related to the repatriation of offshore assets back in 2014. 
As of December 31, 2015, the company maintained total assets of $2.4 billion. These assets included $1.9 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $753 million were held domestically with the remainder held abroad. 
Total liabilities were $3.4 billion at year-end, up from $2.8 billion at the end of 2014, primarily as a result of the issuance of a new 10-year, 5.25%, $500 million debenture completed in the first quarter of 2015. 
I'll now review some of our key metrics for our fourth quarter operating metrics, which are revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2016 full year guidance. 
As mentioned, 2015 full year revenue was $1,059,000,000, up 4.9% from full year 2014 revenues. Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2016 totaled $273 million, up 6.5% from the fourth quarter of 2014 and 2.6% sequentially. 
During the quarter, 59% of our revenues was from customers in the U.S. and 41% was from international customers. 
Deferred revenue at the end of the fourth quarter totaled $961 million, a $71 million increase from year-end 2014. 
Fourth quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $12 million of stock-based compensation totaled $103 million compared with $99 million in the third quarter of 2015 and down from $104 million in the same quarter a year ago. 
Non-GAAP operating margin for the fourth quarter was 62.4% compared to 59.4% in the same quarter of 2014. Full year 2015 non-GAAP operating margin was 61.5%. 
Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $105 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.79 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 133.4 million shares. This compares to $0.70 in the fourth quarter of 2014 and $0.78 last quarter based on 135.9 million and 131.7 million weighted average diluted shares, respectively. 
Full year 2015 non-GAAP earnings per share was $3.05, a 12% increase over 2014. We had a weighted average diluted share count of 133.4 million shares in the fourth quarter compared to 131.7 million shares in the third quarter. 
Dilution related to the convertible debentures was 21.4 million shares based on the average share price during the fourth quarter compared with 14.7 million for the same quarter in 2014 and 18 million shares last quarter. 
Operating cash flow and free cash flow for the fourth quarter were $189 million and $176 million, respectively, compared with $170 million and $159 million, respectively, for the fourth quarter last year. 
Full year 2015 operating cash flow was $651 million compared with $601 million for 2014. Free cash flow for 2015 was $629 million compared with $568 million for 2014. 
Also, as we have discussed in recent earnings calls, we expect our cash tax rate to stay below the 26% tax rate used for non-GAAP calculations for at least the next several years. 
In 2016, we expect to pay cash taxes of approximately $10 million to $20 million. 
Due to domestic tax attributes, including cash tax benefits from our convertible debentures, substantially all of the expected tax cash taxes in 2016 are international. 
With respect to full year 2015 guidance, revenue for 2016 is expected to be in the range of $1,110,000,000 to $1,135,000,000, representing an annual growth rate of 5% to 7%. 
Full year 2016 non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be between 62.5% and 64%. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is expected to be an expense of between $114 million to $120 million. 
Capital expenditures for the year are expected to be between $40 million and $50 million. 
In summary, the company continue to demonstrate sound financial performance throughout 2015. We have grown non-GAAP operating margins, non-GAAP net income, operating cash flow and free cash flow. We've maintained a strong financial position and expect our strong operating cash flow generation to continue as a result of our financial model. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

I want to take this opportunity to update you on another item. On March 14, 2014, the U.S. National Telecommunications and Information Administration, or NTIA, announced its intent to transition its historic stewardship role related to the internet's Domain Name System to the global multi-stakeholder community. 
A year later, in March of 2015, in preparation for the implementation phase of stewardship transition, NTIA asked VeriSign and ICANN to submit a proposal detailing how best to remove NTIA's administrative role associated with root zone management. 
These related root zone management functions involve our role as root zone maintainer under the cooperative agreement with the Department of Commerce. 
In response to the March 2015 request from NTIA, ICANN and VeriSign submitted a proposal to NTIA describing how best to remove NTIA's administrative role associated with the root zone management in a manner that maintains the security, stability and resiliency of the internet's Domain Name System. 
NTIA published this joint ICANN/veriSign proposal on August 17, 2015, noting it was anticipated that performance of the root zone maintainer function would be conducted by VeriSign under a new root zone maintainer agreement with ICANN once the root zone maintainer function obligations under the cooperative agreement were completed. 
ICANN and VeriSign are in the final stages of drafting the new root zone maintainer agreement to perform this root zone maintainer role as a commercial service for ICANN upon the successful transition of the functions. 
The root zone maintainer functions performed by VeriSign are delivered via the secure, stable and resilient purpose built DNS infrastructure that has delivered .com .net and A&J root zone services for an uninterrupted and unparalleled 18 years. 
To ensure that root operations continue to perform at the same high-level during the expected 10-year term of the root zone maintainer agreement, ICANN and VeriSign are in discussions to extend the term of the .com registry agreement to coincide with the expected 10-year term of the root zone maintainer agreement. 
Ensuring that the terms of the 2 agreements are the same, we'll promote the stability of root operations and will remove potential instability that might otherwise arise if the terms did not coincide. 
VeriSign's commitment to security stability and resiliency within the DNS is the first priority and consideration in the performance of our roles as directed by ICANN and the NTIA. 
While we cannot yet determine when these documents will be completed, having stability with these key contract is an important component of the stability of the core infrastructure of the Internet. 
While ICANN and VeriSign are in the final stages of preparing the root zone maintainer agreement and the .com registry agreement extension documents, there are several important steps that still need to occur, including completing the drafting of the agreement, posting them for public comment and obtaining approvals from ICANN and VeriSign's Board of Directors. 
Additionally, under the cooperative agreement, we may not enter into the contemplated extension of the .com Registry Agreement without the prior written approval of the Department of Commerce. If the department does not approved the extension and the occurring. com registry agreement will remain unchanged. We will provide periodic updates as appropriate on our progress toward these objectives. 
In closing, during the last year, we furthered our work to protect, grow and manage the business, while delivering value to our shareholders. The end of 2015 marks 5 years since the completion of our divestiture program and the sale of our authentication services business. Our goal then was to simplify the company's business through the divestment of noncore assets and to focus on profitability and value creation. 
Since the end of 2010, revenue has grown sequentially for 5 straight years, annual non-GAAP EPS has grown steadily from $1.04 in 2010 to $3.05 in 2015. Free cash flow has grown steadily and were $629 million during 2015. Non-GAAP operating margin has risen steadily, from 41.8% in 2010 to 61.5% during 2015. We have returned $3.8 billion to our shareholders, including repurchasing over 70 million shares for $3.36 billion, which exceeds our domestic free cash flow for the same period. 
We believe the long trend lines of growth in the top and bottom line, along with a consistent track record in returning generated value to our shareholders through effective capital allocation and an efficient capital structure are what matter most to our shareholders. 
We believe proper balance within our strategy framework protect and grow and manage is what makes it possible for us to deliver this type of consistent long-term result in simultaneously serve the interest of our shareholders, employees and customers. 
I'm sometimes asked what the next big thing is for VeriSign. And my answer is simple, more of the same. Steady and efficient operation of a great business so that we can steadily and consistently create value and efficiently return that value to our shareholders. 
We'll now take your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question."

Contemplated or anticipated term of that agreement is 10 years in order to ensure the same steady, available, uninterrupted, secure and stable environment that we've been providing for 3 decades as a Root Zone Maintainer. It is also anticipated we are discussing the extension of the .com registry agreement for 10 years. So at that point, when -- should all of these that conditions that I described earlier, for example, approval of ICANN's Board of Directors and VeriSign's Board of Directors, no changes whatsoever could be made to the .com registry agreement without the consent of the NTIA. So subject to those approvals and the transition occurring, then we would have 10 year concurrent terms for the Root Zone Maintainer agreement and the .com Registry Agreement. So what you would see is essentially a change of the date, the term of the .com registry agreement. That's essentially the change. From an investor viewpoint, you would, instead of a renewal in 2018, you would see a 10 year term that starts with the effective date of the 2 changes, the Root Zone Maintainer agreement and the extended .com Registry Agreement. So instead of November 30,2018, you would see a date that is 10 years from the effective date of those 2."

Amendment 32 is a separate part of the Cooperative Agreement that addresses pricing with respect to our ability to seek a price change if we think it's justified by market conditions.

So some sort of inorganic growth strategy to try to grow in other businesses or noncore businesses is not part of our plan. And I certainly don't see that happening. And we've been very consistent about that messaging. Now I've also consistently said something else over the last year or 2, which is that, for example, the new gTLD program could present some inorganic opportunities in our core business, and that's certainly still true. In fact, just recently, a group of observers of that marketplace were heavily involved in at all sort of the opined that 2016 could be the year of consolidation in that business. And certainly, those opportunities to acquire growth in our core business would be something we'd look at. And then we've been very consistent about all of that.

I anticipate that we would have our amendment 32 rights to petition based on changing market conditions for price relief.

So I don't see those changing at all. But in the front part of your question, you sort of lumped the .com Registry Agreement and the Cooperative Agreement together, and those are different agreements. What we're doing here is we are seeking an extension to the .com Registry Agreement. The Cooperative Agreement expires in 2018, and we are not seeking any change to that. That is up to NTIA, that is their process, their contract, so I would certainly defer to them. But we are not rolling up those 2 together for 10 year extension. We are just simply ensuring that the .com Registry Agreement, which I might add has the most stringent SLAs, the most stringent security performance requirements of any Registry Agreement run concurrently with the Root Zone Maintainer agreement. Because remember, our performance has the Root Zone Maintainer and publishers essentially you can think of it as the bootstrapping process of the Internet, which we do at least twice a day, and it is critically important to the secure operation of the global Internet that, that process begun in an interrupted, secured way. And so in order to achieve that, we are seeking a concurrent term for the .com Registry Agreement, which addresses the infrastructure and the performance requirements for that infrastructure that provides the security for common net and the roots to run concurrently with the Root Zone Maintainer Agreement for obvious reasons to avoid any possible instability that might result. The Cooperative Agreement -- the only thing that we anticipate will change, I'm not speaking for NTIA, but I assume at some point, Amendment 11, which talks about our role as the Root Zone Maintainer would of necessity change, but we have no anticipation or expectation that anything else would change. It expires in 2018, but it's up to NTIA to decide at that point what happens."

We've also said that when we look around the world's renewal rates perspective, we do see emerging markets having a suddenly lower renewal rate on average. So that could impact the number as well. Clearly, what would dictate Q4 net adds would be the other side of that equation as to what gross adds would be. But clearly -- as we said in our prepared remarks, the renewing name base is going to be large. I mean, we had great, great fourth quarter, and so we'll have those names come up for renewal, and we'll keep an eye on what the renewal rate is.

Our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers, while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders. 
During 2015, VeriSign delivered strong financial performance, including reporting $1,059,000,000 in revenues, expanding free cash flow to $629 million and producing full year non-GAAP operating margins of 61.5%. 
Operationally, 2015 was another strong year for the company. VeriSign processed 38.8 million new .com and .net domain name registrations and finished the year with 139.8 million common net names in the domain name base. 
During the year, we marked more than 18 years of uninterrupted availability of the VeriSign DNS for .com and .net. 
As a part of managing our business, during the fourth quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1.8 million shares for $150 million. 
During the full year 2015, we repurchased 9.3 million shares for $622 million. 
Effective today, the Board of Directors increased the amount of VeriSign common stock authorized for repurchase by approximately $611 million to a total of $1 billion authorized and available under the share buyback program, which has no expiration. 
Our financial position is strong with $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter, of which $753 million was held domestically and the remainder held abroad. 
We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. 
At the end of December, the domain name base in .com and .net was 139.8 million, consisting of 124 million names for .com and 15.8 million names for .net. This represents an increase of 6.3% year-over-year as calculated, including domain names on hold for both periods. 
In the fourth quarter, we added 4.6 million net names to the domain name base after processing 12.2 million new gross registrations. 
In the third quarter of 2015, the renewal rate was 71.9% compared with 72% for the same quarter of 2014. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the fourth quarter of 2015 will be approximately 73.3%. This preliminary rate compares favorably to 72.5% achieved in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
As we discussed over the last few quarters, there are many factors that drive domain growth. These include, but are not limited to, Internet adoption, economic activity, eCommerce activity and registrar go-to-market strategies. 
Towards the end of the third quarter and mainly during the first 2 months of the fourth quarter, we saw higher volume of gross additions coming largely in our Asia Pacific region primarily through registrars in China. While we believe China and the Asia Pacific region will continue to perform well, we expect these markets to return to more normal levels in 2016. 
Based on registrar feedback, the most likely contributor of the additional gross addition volume appears to have been driven primarily from domain investment activity in that region. 
Also, as we have noted in the past, the renewal rates for domain names registered in emerging markets such as Asia Pacific, have historically been lower than those registered in more developed markets. 
Considering these factors, we expect the first 3 quarters of the year to have roughly a similar pattern of quarterly net additions to the domain name base as we saw during 2015. However, we expect the fourth quarter of 2016 to be somewhat unique as the expiring domain name base in that quarter will have the largest percentage of first time renewing names that we've seen as a result of the strong Q4 2015 performance. 
While it's difficult to assess what the renewal characteristics of these new names will be due to the usually large upcoming Q4 2016 expiring base, we expect fourth quarter deletions to be elevated. 
Accordingly, deletions could exceed additions in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
Based on these and other factors, we expect the first quarter 2016 net change to the domain name base to be an increase of between 1.5 million and 2 million names and we are forecasting the full year 2016 domain name base growth rate to be between 0.5% and 2%. 
As noted in prior calls, updates to the domain name base are posted on our website at least once per day and our website allows you to track the domain name base throughout the coming quarter and year. 
Finally, as an update related to the launch of our internationalized domain name versions of .com and .net, during December, the localized katakana version of .com in Japanese launched and will be in the sunrise period until March 14. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to George."

As described last year, our fourth quarter 2014 GAAP net income was decreased by $26 million and diluted EPS was decreased by $0.19, primarily due to a non-U.S. income tax charge related to our reorganization of certain international operations and a charge in estimated -- charge in estimate for U.S. income tax charges related to the repatriation of offshore assets back in 2014. 
As of December 31, 2015, the company maintained total assets of $2.4 billion. These assets included $1.9 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $753 million were held domestically with the remainder held abroad. 
Total liabilities were $3.4 billion at year end, up from $2.8 billion at the end of 2014, primarily as a result of the issuance of a new 10-year, 5.25%, $500 million debenture completed in the first quarter of 2015. 
I'll now review some of our key metrics for our fourth quarter operating metrics, which are revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2016 full year guidance. 
As mentioned, 2015 full year revenue was $1,059,000,000, up 4.9% from full year 2014 revenues. Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2016 totaled $273 million, up 6.5% from the fourth quarter of 2014 and 2.6% sequentially. 
During the quarter, 59% of our revenues was from customers in the U.S. and 41% was from international customers. 
Deferred revenue at the end of the fourth quarter totaled $961 million, a $71 million increase from year end 2014. 
Fourth quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $12 million of stock-based compensation totaled $103 million compared with $99 million in the third quarter of 2015 and down from $104 million in the same quarter a year ago. 
Non-GAAP operating margin for the fourth quarter was 62.4% compared to 59.4% in the same quarter of 2014. Full year 2015 non-GAAP operating margin was 61.5%. 
Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $105 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.79 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 133.4 million shares. This compares to $0.70 in the fourth quarter of 2014 and $0.78 last quarter based on 135.9 million and 131.7 million weighted average diluted shares, respectively. 
Full year 2015 non-GAAP earnings per share was $3.05, a 12% increase over 2014. We had a weighted average diluted share count of 133.4 million shares in the fourth quarter compared to 131.7 million shares in the third quarter. 
Dilution related to the convertible debentures was 21.4 million shares based on the average share price during the fourth quarter compared with 14.7 million for the same quarter in 2014 and 18 million shares last quarter. 
Operating cash flow and free cash flow for the fourth quarter were $189 million and $176 million, respectively, compared with $170 million and $159 million, respectively, for the fourth quarter last year. 
Full year 2015 operating cash flow was $651 million compared with $601 million for 2014. Free cash flow for 2015 was $629 million compared with $568 million for 2014. 
Also, as we have discussed on recent earnings calls, we expect our cash tax rate to stay below the 26% tax rate used for non-GAAP calculations for at least the next several years. 
In 2016, we expect to pay cash taxes of approximately $10 million to $20 million. 
Due to domestic tax attributes, including cash tax benefits from our convertible debentures, substantially all of the expected tax cash taxes in 2016 are international. 
With respect to full year 2016 guidance, revenue for 2016 is expected to be in the range of $1,110,000,000 to $1,135,000,000, representing an annual growth rate of 5% to 7%. 
Full year 2016 non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be between 62.5% and 64%. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is expected to be an expense of between $114 million to $120 million. 
Capital expenditures for the year are expected to be between $40 million and $50 million. 
In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance throughout 2015. We have grown non-GAAP operating margins, non-GAAP net income, operating cash flow and free cash flow. We've maintained a strong financial position and expect our strong operating cash flow generation to continue as a result of our financial model. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

I want to take this opportunity to update you on another item. On March 14, 2014, the U.S. National Telecommunications and Information Administration, or NTIA, announced its intent to transition its historic stewardship role related to",831,"Thank you, George. I want to take this opportunity to update you on another item. On March 14, 2014, the U.S. National Telecommunications and Information Administration, or NTIA, announced its intent to transition its historic stewardship role related to the internet's Domain Name System to the global multi-stakeholder community. 
A year later, in March of 2015, in preparation for the implementation phase of IANA stewardship transition, NTIA asked VeriSign and ICANN to submit a proposal detailing how best to remove NTIA's administrative role associated with root zone management. 
These related root zone management functions involve our role as root zone maintainer under the cooperative agreement with the Department of Commerce. 
In response to the March 2015 request from NTIA, ICANN and VeriSign submitted a proposal to NTIA describing how best to remove NTIA's administrative role associated with the root zone management in a manner that maintains the security, stability and resiliency of the internet's Domain Name System. 
NTIA published this joint ICANN/VeriSign proposal on August 17, 2015, noting it was anticipated that performance of the root zone maintainer function would be conducted by VeriSign under a new root zone maintainer agreement with ICANN once the root zone maintainer function obligations under the cooperative agreement were completed. 
ICANN and VeriSign are in the final stages of drafting the new root zone maintainer agreement to perform this root zone maintainer role as a commercial service for ICANN upon the successful transition of the IANA functions. 
The root zone maintainer functions performed by VeriSign are delivered via the secure, stable and resilient purpose built DNS infrastructure that has delivered .com, .net and ANJ [ph] root zone services for an uninterrupted and unparalleled 18 years. 
To ensure that root operations continue to perform at the same high level during the expected 10-year term of the root zone maintainer agreement, ICANN and VeriSign are in discussions to extend the term of the .com registry agreement to coincide with the expected 10-year term of the root zone maintainer agreement. 
Ensuring that the terms of the 2 agreements are the same, we'll promote the stability of root operations and will remove potential instability that might otherwise arise if the terms did not coincide. 
VeriSign's commitment to security stability and resiliency within the DNS is the first priority and consideration in the performance of our roles as directed by ICANN and the NTIA. 
While we cannot yet determine when or if these documents will be completed, having stability with these key contract is an important component of the stability of the core infrastructure of the Internet. 
While ICANN and VeriSign are in the final stages of preparing the root zone maintainer agreement and the .com registry agreement extension documents, there are several important steps that still need to occur, including completing the drafting of the agreements, posting them for public comment and obtaining approvals from ICANN's and VeriSign's Board of Directors. 
Additionally, under the cooperative agreement, we may not enter into the contemplated extension of the com Registry Agreement without the prior written approval of the Department of Commerce. If the department does not approved the extension then the current com Registry Agreement will remain unchanged. We will provide periodic updates as appropriate on our progress toward these objectives. 
In closing, during the last year, we furthered our work to work -- to protect, grow and manage the business while delivering value to our shareholders. The end of 2015 marks 5 years since the completion of our divestiture program and the sale of our authentication services business. Our goal then was to simplify the company's business through divestment of noncore assets and to focus on profitability and value creation. 
Since the end of 2010, revenue has grown sequentially for 5 straight years, annual non-GAAP EPS has grown steadily from $1.04 in 2010 to $3.05 in 2015. Free cash flow has grown steadily and was $629 million during 2015. Non-GAAP operating margin has risen steadily from 41.8% in 2010 to 61.5% during 2015. We have returned $3.8 billion to our shareholders, including repurchasing over 70 million shares for $3.36 billion, which exceeds our domestic free cash flow for the same period. 
We believe the long trend lines of growth in the top and bottom line, along with a consistent track record in returning generated value to our shareholders through effective capital allocation and an efficient capital structure are what matter most to our shareholders. 
We believe that proper balance within our strategy framework protect, grow and manage is what makes it possible for us to deliver this type of consistent long-term result and simultaneously serve the interests of our shareholders, employees and customers. 
I'm sometimes asked what the next big thing is for VeriSign. And my answer is simple, more of the same. Steady and efficient operation of a great business so that we can steadily and consistently create value and efficiently return that value to our shareholders. 
We'll now take your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question."

That -- the contemplated or anticipated term of that agreement is 10 years in order to ensure the same steady, available, uninterrupted, secure and stable environment that we've been providing for 3 decades as a Root Zone Maintainer. It is also anticipated we are discussing the extension of the .com registry agreement for 10 years. So at that point, when -- should all of these conditions that I described earlier, for example, approval of ICANN's Board of Directors and VeriSign's Board of Directors, no changes whatsoever can be made to the .com registry agreement without the consent of the NTIA. So subject to those approvals and the transition occurring, then we would have 10-year concurrent terms for the Root Zone Maintainer agreement and the .com Registry Agreement. So what you would see is essentially a change of the date, the term of the .com registry agreement. The -- that's essentially the change. From an investor viewpoint, you would, instead of a renewal in 2018, you would see a 10-year term that starts with the effective date of the 2 changes, the Root Zone Maintainer agreement and the extended .com Registry Agreement. So instead of November 30, 2018, you would see a date that is 10 years from the effective date of those 2."

That is the date of the expiration of the IANA contract between NTIA and ICANN. And if everything occurs at that point, and it is certainly possible, all of the work that needs to be done can be accomplished by that date. But again, I can't, of course, tell you what will happen when. I can simply tell you that, that is everyone's goal and that the community, ICANN, NTIA, et cetera are all driving for that September 2016 date.

Since completing divestitures, our position on acquisitions is essentially unchanged. But again, if we see opportunities that come along, we're not opposed to looking at those. As long as they're consistent with our core business, consistent with our commitment to deliver profitable growth, the -- again, the opportunity for -- to participate in consolidation in 2016, that's an opportunity for us. As a significant part of our corporate strategy for 2016, we have evaluated, and we are pursuing and we'll continue to evaluate and pursue acquisitions of TLDs that are currently in operation, those that have not yet been awarded in support of our growth strategy. As long as they fit with that strategy."

But let me just point out the -- .com -- and so the short answer to your question is yes, I don't expect any of that to change, that I anticipate that we would have our Amendment 32 rights to petition based on changing market conditions for price relief. And also that certainly, the agreement calls for the ability for VeriSign to seek so-called cost justified price increases, and that includes things like cost of implementing consensus policies or specific threats to the DNS that are extraordinary that we had to respond to, unanticipated expenses associated with responding to threats. So I don't see those changing at all. But in the front part of your question, you sort of lumped the .com Registry Agreement and the Cooperative Agreement together, and those are different agreements. What we're doing here is we're seeking an extension to the .com Registry Agreement. The Cooperative Agreement expires in 2018, and we are not seeking any change to that. That is up to NTIA, that is their process, their contract, so I would certainly defer to them. But we are not rolling up those 2 together for 10-year extension. We are just simply ensuring that the .com Registry Agreement, which I might add has the most stringent SLAs, the most stringent security performance requirements of any Registry Agreement run concurrently with the Root Zone Maintainer Agreement. Because remember, our performance as the Root Zone Maintainer and publishers, essentially, you can think of it as the bootstrapping process of the Internet, which we do at least twice a day, and it is critically important to the secure operation of the global Internet that, that process be done in an interrupted, secure way. And so in order to achieve that, we are seeking a concurrent term for the .com Registry Agreement, which addresses the infrastructure and the performance requirements for that infrastructure that provides the security for common net and the roots to run concurrently with the Root Zone Maintainer Agreement for obvious reasons, to avoid any possible instability that might result. The Cooperative Agreement, the only thing that we anticipate would change, I'm not speaking for NTIA, but I assume at some point, Amendment 11, which talks about our role as the Root Zone Maintainer would, of necessity, change. But we have no anticipation or expectation that anything else would change. It expires in 2018, but it's up to NTIA to decide at that point what happens."

So that would mathematically suggest that there's maybe a $2 million increase -- or 2 million units increase in deletions. We've also said that when we look around the world from renewal rates perspective, we do see emerging markets having a slightly lower renewal rate on average. So that could impact the number as well. Clearly, what would dictate Q4 net adds would be the other side of that equation as to what gross adds would be. But clearly the -- as we said in our prepared remarks, the renewing name base is going to be large. I mean we had a great, great fourth quarter. And so we'll have those names come up for renewal, and we'll keep an eye on what the renewal rate is. But historically, our first time renewal rate has been 50%."

Our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers, while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders. 
During 2015, VeriSign delivered strong financial performance, including reporting $1,059,000,000 in revenues, expanding free cash flow to $629 million and producing full year non-GAAP operating margins of 61.5%. 
Operationally, 2015 was another strong year for the company. VeriSign processed 38.8 million new .com and .net domain name registrations and finished the year with 139.8 million common net names in the domain name base. 
During the year, we marked more than 18 years of uninterrupted availability of the VeriSign DNS for .com and .net. 
As a part of managing our business, during the fourth quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1.8 million shares for $150 million. 
During the full year 2015, we repurchased 9.3 million shares for $622 million. 
Effective today, the Board of Directors increased the amount of VeriSign common stock authorized for repurchase by approximately $611 million to a total of $1 billion authorized and available under the share buyback program, which has no expiration. 
Our financial position is strong with $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter, of which $753 million was held domestically and the remainder held abroad. 
We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. 
At the end of December, the domain name base in .com and .net was 139.8 million, consisting of 124 million names for .com and 15.8 million names for .net. This represents an increase of 6.3% year-over-year as calculated, including domain names on hold for both periods. 
In the fourth quarter, we added 4.6 million net names to the domain name base after processing 12.2 million new gross registrations. 
In the third quarter of 2015, the renewal rate was 71.9% compared with 72% for the same quarter of 2014. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the fourth quarter of 2015 will be approximately 73.3%. This preliminary rate compares favorably to 72.5% achieved in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
As we discussed over the last few quarters, there are many factors that drive domain growth. These include, but are not limited to, Internet adoption, economic activity, eCommerce activity and registrar go-to-market strategies. 
Towards the end of the third quarter and mainly during the first 2 months of the fourth quarter, we saw higher volume of gross additions coming largely in our Asia Pacific region primarily through registrars in China. While we believe China and the Asia Pacific region will continue to perform well, we expect these markets to return to more normal levels in 2016. 
Based on registrar feedback, the most likely contributor of the additional gross addition volume appears to have been driven primarily from domain investment activity in that region. 
Also, as we have noted in the past, the renewal rates for domain names registered in emerging markets such as Asia Pacific, have historically been lower than those registered in more developed markets. 
Considering these factors, we expect the first 3 quarters of the year to have roughly a similar pattern of quarterly net additions to the domain name base as we saw during 2015. However, we expect the fourth quarter of 2016 to be somewhat unique as the expiring domain name base in that quarter will have the largest percentage of first time renewing names that we've seen as a result of the strong Q4 2015 performance. 
While it's difficult to assess what the renewal characteristics of these new names will be due to the usually large upcoming Q4 2016 expiring base, we expect fourth quarter deletions to be elevated. 
Accordingly, deletions could exceed additions in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
Based on these and other factors, we expect the first quarter 2016 net change to the domain name base to be an increase of between 1.5 million and 2 million names and we are forecasting the full year 2016 domain name base growth rate to be between 0.5% and 2%. 
As noted in prior calls, updates to the domain name base are posted on our website at least once per day and our website allows you to track the domain name base throughout the coming quarter and year. 
Finally, as an update related to the launch of our internationalized domain name versions of .com and .net, during December, the localized katakana version of .com in Japanese launched and will be in the sunrise period until March 14. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to George."

During the fourth quarter, we recognized revenue of $273 million, up 6.5% year-over-year and delivered GAAP operating income of $158 million, up 11.3% from $142 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
The GAAP operating margin in the fourth quarter came to 58.1% compared to 55.6% in the same quarter a year ago. GAAP net income totaled $102 million compared to $65 million a year earlier, which produced diluted GAAP earnings per share of $0.76 in the fourth quarter this year compared to $0.48 for the fourth quarter last year. As described last year, our fourth quarter 2014 GAAP net income was decreased by $26 million and diluted EPS was decreased by $0.19, primarily due to a non-U.S. income tax charge related to our reorganization of certain international operations and a charge in estimated -- charge in estimate for U.S. income tax charges related to the repatriation of offshore assets back in 2014. 
As of December 31, 2015, the company maintained total assets of $2.4 billion. These assets included $1.9 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $753 million were held domestically with the remainder held abroad. 
Total liabilities were $3.4 billion at year-end, up from $2.8 billion at the end of 2014, primarily as a result of the issuance of a new 10-year, 5.25%, $500 million debenture completed in the first quarter of 2015. 
I'll now review some of our key metrics for our fourth quarter operating metrics, which are revenue, deferred revenue, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2016 full year guidance. 
As mentioned, 2015 full year revenue was $1,059,000,000, up 4.9% from full year 2014 revenues. Revenue for the fourth quarter of 2016 (sic) [ 2015 ] totaled $273 million, up 6.5% from the fourth quarter of 2014 and 2.6% sequentially. 
During the quarter, 59% of our revenues was from customers in the U.S. and 41% was from international customers. 
Deferred revenue at the end of the fourth quarter totaled $961 million, a $71 million increase from year end 2014. 
Fourth quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $12 million of stock-based compensation totaled $103 million compared with $99 million in the third quarter of 2015 and down from $104 million in the same quarter a year ago. 
Non-GAAP operating margin for the fourth quarter was 62.4% compared to 59.4% in the same quarter of 2014. Full year 2015 non-GAAP operating margin was 61.5%. 
Non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter was $105 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.79 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 133.4 million shares. This compares to $0.70 in the fourth quarter of 2014 and $0.78 last quarter based on 135.9 million and 131.7 million weighted average diluted shares, respectively. 
Full year 2015 non-GAAP earnings per share was $3.05, a 12% increase over 2014. We had a weighted average diluted share count of 133.4 million shares in the fourth quarter compared to 131.7 million shares in the third quarter. 
Dilution related to the convertible debentures was 21.4 million shares based on the average share price during the fourth quarter compared with 14.7 million for the same quarter in 2014 and 18 million shares last quarter. 
Operating cash flow and free cash flow for the fourth quarter were $189 million and $176 million, respectively, compared with $170 million and $159 million, respectively, for the fourth quarter last year. 
Full year 2015 operating cash flow was $651 million compared with $601 million for 2014. Free cash flow for 2015 was $629 million compared with $568 million for 2014. 
Also, as we have discussed on recent earnings calls, we expect our cash tax rate to stay below the 26% tax rate used for non-GAAP calculations for at least the next several years. 
In 2016, we expect to pay cash taxes of approximately $10 million to $20 million. 
Due to domestic tax attributes, including cash tax benefits from our convertible debentures, substantially all of the expected tax cash taxes in 2016 are international. 
With respect to full year 2016 guidance, revenue for 2016 is expected to be in the range of $1,110,000,000 to $1,135,000,000, representing an annual growth rate of 5% to 7%. 
Full year 2016 non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be between 62.5% and 64%. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is expected to be an expense of between $114 million to $120 million. 
Capital expenditures for the year are expected to be between $40 million and $50 million. 
In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance throughout 2015. We have grown non-GAAP operating margins, non-GAAP net income, operating cash flow and free cash flow. We've maintained a strong financial position and expect our strong operating cash flow generation to continue as a result of our financial model. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

I want to take this opportunity to update you on another item. On March 14, 2014, the U.S. National Telecommunications and Information Administration, or NTIA, announced its intent to transition its historic stewardship role related to the internet's Domain Name System to the global multi-stakeholder community. 
A year later, in March of 2015, in preparation for the implementation phase of the IANA stewardship transition, NTIA asked VeriSign and ICANN to submit a proposal detailing how best to remove NTIA's administrative role associated with root zone management. 
These related root zone management functions involve our role as root zone maintainer under the cooperative agreement with the Department of Commerce. 
In response to the March 2015 request from NTIA, ICANN and VeriSign submitted a proposal to NTIA describing how best to remove NTIA's administrative role associated with the root zone management in a manner that maintains the security, stability and resiliency of the internet's Domain Name System. 
NTIA published this joint ICANN/VeriSign proposal on August 17, 2015, noting it was anticipated that performance of the root zone maintainer function would be conducted by VeriSign under a new root zone maintainer agreement with ICANN once the root zone maintainer function obligations under the cooperative agreement were completed. 
ICANN and VeriSign are in the final stages of drafting the new root zone maintainer agreement to perform this root zone maintainer role as a commercial service for ICANN upon the successful transition of the IANA functions. 
The root zone maintainer functions performed by VeriSign are delivered via the secure, stable and resilient purpose built DNS infrastructure that has delivered .com, .net and A and J root zone services for an uninterrupted and unparalleled 18 years. 
To ensure that root operations continue to perform at the same high level during the expected 10-year term of the root zone maintainer agreement, ICANN and VeriSign are in discussions to extend the term of the .com registry agreement to coincide with the expected 10-year term of the root zone maintainer agreement. 
Ensuring that the terms of the 2 agreements are the same will promote the stability of root operations and will remove potential instability that might otherwise arise if the terms did not coincide. 
VeriSign's commitment to security stability and resiliency within the DNS is the first priority and consideration in the performance of our roles as directed by ICANN and the NTIA. 
While we cannot yet determine when or if these documents will be completed, having stability with these key contracts is an important component of the stability of the core infrastructure of the Internet. 
While ICANN and VeriSign are in the final stages of preparing the root zone maintainer agreement and the .com registry agreement extension documents, there are several important steps that still need to occur, including completing the drafting of the agreements, posting them for public comment and obtaining approvals from ICANN's and VeriSign's Board of Directors. 
Additionally, under the cooperative agreement, we may not enter into the contemplated extension of the com Registry Agreement without the prior written approval of the Department of Commerce. If the department does not approve the extension, then the current com Registry Agreement will remain unchanged. We will provide periodic updates as appropriate on our progress toward these objectives. 
In closing, during the last year, we furthered our work to work -- to protect, grow and manage the business while delivering value to our shareholders. The end of 2015 marks 5 years since the completion of our divestiture program and the sale of our authentication services business. Our goal then was to simplify the company's business through divestment of noncore assets and to focus on profitability and value creation. 
Since the end of 2010, revenue has grown sequentially for 5 straight years, annual non-GAAP EPS has grown steadily from $1.04 in 2010 to $3.05 in 2015. Free cash flow has grown steadily and was $629 million during 2015. Non-GAAP operating margin has risen steadily from 41.8% in 2010 to 61.5% during 2015. We have returned $3.8 billion to our shareholders, including repurchasing over 70 million shares for $3.36 billion, which exceeds our domestic free cash flow for the same period. 
We believe the long trend lines of growth in the top and bottom line, along with a consistent track record in returning generated value to our shareholders through effective capital allocation and an efficient capital structure are what matter most to our shareholders. 
We believe that proper balance within our strategy framework -- protect, grow and manage is what makes it possible for us to deliver this type of consistent long-term result and simultaneously serve the interests of our shareholders, employees and customers. 
I'm sometimes asked what the next big thing is for VeriSign. And my answer is simple, more of the same. Steady and efficient operation of a great business so that we can steadily and consistently create value and efficiently return that value to our shareholders. 
We'll now take your questions. Operator, we're ready for the first question."

So first of all, I think it helps to just understand that we're not actually changing the terms of the .com Registry Agreement, and this is not a renewal. This is an extension. We are negotiating, entering into a 10-year contract with ICANN to perform commercial services as the Root Zone Maintainer. Services that we now perform under contract to the NTIA. That -- the contemplated or anticipated term of that agreement is 10 years in order to ensure the same steady, available, uninterrupted, secure and stable environment that we've been providing for 3 decades as a Root Zone Maintainer. It is also anticipated -- we are discussing the extension of the .com registry agreement for 10 years. So at that point, when -- should all of these conditions that I described earlier, for example, approval of ICANN's Board of Directors and VeriSign's Board of Directors, no changes whatsoever can be made to the .com registry agreement without the consent of the NTIA. So subject to those approvals and the transition occurring, then we would have 10-year concurrent terms for the Root Zone Maintainer agreement and the .com Registry Agreement. So what you would see is essentially a change of the date, the term of the .com registry agreement. The -- that's essentially the change. From an investor viewpoint, you would, instead of a renewal in 2018, you would see a 10-year term that starts with the effective date of the 2 changes, the Root Zone Maintainer agreement and the extended .com Registry Agreement. So instead of November 30, 2018, you would see a date that is 10 years from the effective date of those 2."

Now I've also consistently said something else over the last year or 2, which is that, for example, the new gTLD program could present some inorganic opportunities in our core business, and that's certainly still true. In fact, just recently, a group of observers of that marketplace who were heavily involved in it, all sort of opined that 2016 could be the year of consolidation in that business. And certainly, those opportunities to acquire growth in our core business would be something we'd look at. And then we've been very consistent about all of that. Since completing the divestitures, our position on acquisitions is essentially unchanged. But again, if we'd see opportunities that come along, we're not opposed to looking at those.

So I don't see those changing at all. But in the front part of your question, you sort of lumped the .com Registry Agreement and the Cooperative Agreement together, and those are different agreements. What we're doing here is we're seeking an extension to the .com Registry Agreement. The Cooperative Agreement expires in 2018, and we are not seeking any change to that. That is up to NTIA, that is their process, their contract, so I would certainly defer to them. But we are not rolling up those 2 together for a 10-year extension. We are just simply ensuring that the .com Registry Agreement, which I might add has the most stringent SLAs, the most stringent security performance requirements of any Registry Agreement, run concurrently with the Root Zone Maintainer Agreement. Because remember, our performance as the Root Zone Maintainer and publishers, essentially, you can think of it as the bootstrapping process of the Internet, which we do at least twice a day, and it is critically important to the secure operation of the global Internet that, that process be done in an uninterrupted, secure way. And so in order to achieve that, we are seeking a concurrent term for the .com Registry Agreement, which addresses the infrastructure and the performance requirements for that infrastructure, that provides the security for common net and the roots to run concurrently with the Root Zone Maintainer Agreement for obvious reasons, to avoid any possible instability that might result. The Cooperative Agreement, the only thing that we anticipate would change, I'm not speaking for NTIA, but I assume at some point, Amendment 11, which talks about our role as the Root Zone Maintainer would, of necessity, change. But we have no anticipation or expectation that anything else would change. It expires in 2018, but it's up to NTIA to decide at that point what happens."

So a 4 million increase in the additions, as we historically know, first-time renewal rates are typically around 50%. So that would mathematically suggest that there's maybe a $2 million increase -- or 2 million unit increase in deletions. We've also said that when we look around the world from renewal rates perspective, we do see emerging markets having a slightly lower renewal rate on average. So that could impact the number as well. Clearly, what would dictate Q4 net adds would be the other side of that equation as to what gross adds would be. But clearly the -- as we said in our prepared remarks, the renewing name base is going to be large. I mean we had a great, great fourth quarter. And so we'll have those names come up for renewal, and we'll keep an eye on what the renewal rate is. But historically, our first time renewal rate has been 50%."

Again, from a U.S. perspective, we have our convertible debenture that produces a tax yield last year. It was about $165 million, as we've said. That convertible debenture tax yield tends to grow about 6% year-over-year. We also have approximately $173 million of foreign tax credits that we expect to utilize before they expire over the next 7 or 8 years. And so we don't expect to pay very much U.S. tax based on our attributes. So really, we would look to the $10 million to $20 million to be primarily foreign taxes.

I'm pleased to report a solid start to 2016 for VeriSign. First quarter results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers, while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders. We reported revenue of $282 million, up 9.1% year-over-year, and we delivered strong financial performance, including $143 million in free cash flow. 
We processed nearly $10 million new registrations during the first quarter and added $2.65 million net new names ending with $142.5 million .com and net domain names in the domain name base. Our financial position is strong with $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. As a part of managing our business, during the first quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1.8 million shares for $150 million. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and considered the best uses for our cash, including the potential share repurchases. 
As we discussed during the last call, ICANN and VeriSign are in the final stages of preparing the Agreement and the .com Registry Agreement extension documents. We continue to make progress, and we'll provide periodic updates as appropriate on our progress towards these objectives. 
I'll comment now on first quarter operating highlights. At the end of the March, the domain name base in .com and .net 142.5 million consistent of 126.6 million names for .com and 15.9 million names for .net. This represents an increase of 7.1% year-over-year. 
In the fourth quarter of 2015, the renewal rate was 73.3% compared with 72.5% for the same quarter of 2014. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the first quarter of 2016 will be approximately 74.2%. This preliminary rate compares favorably to 73.4% achieved in the first quarter of 2015. 
As we discussed over the last few quarters, there are many factors that drive domain growth. These include, but are not limited to, Internet adoption, economic activity, eCommerce activity and register on go-to-market strategies. 
During the first quarter, we continue to strength in net additions in many parts of the world both from developed and emerging markets. Also during the quarter, we again saw activity coming from registrars in China that exceeded our expectations. At this point, we expect activity from registrars in China to normalize as we continue during the second quarter. 
Also, as discussed last quarter, we still expect the fourth quarter of 2016 to be somewhat unique as the expiring domain name base in that quarter will have a large percentage of first-time renewing names as a result of the strong performance during Q3 and Q4 of 2015. While it is difficult to assess what the renewal characteristics of these new names will be due to large upcoming Q4 2016 expiring base, we still expect fourth quarter deletions to be elevated. Accordingly, as we stated last quarter, deletions could exceed additions for the fourth quarter of 2016. 
Based on these and other factors, we expect the second quarter 2016 net change for the domain name base to be an increase of between 0.6 million and 1.1 million names, and we are now forecasting a full year 2016 domain name base growth rate to be between 1% and 2.5%. 
As an update related to the launch of our IDN versions of .com and .net, the localized katakana version of .com in Japanese launched in December and will be in general availability starting June 13. Also, we plan to launch the .com and .net Korean IDNs in May. And I would like to turn the call over to George."

Revenue for the first quarter totaled $282 million, up 9.1% year-over-year and 3.4% sequentially. During the quarter, 58% of our revenue was from customers in the U.S. and 42% was from international customers.",665,"Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the first quarter totaled $282 million, up 9.1% year-over-year and 3.4% sequentially. During the quarter, 58% of our revenue was from customers in the U.S. and 42% was from international customers. GAAP operating income for the first quarter totaled $167 million, up 15.6% from $144 million in the first quarter of 2015. The GAAP operating margin in the quarter came to 59.2% compared to 55.8% in the same quarter a year ago. 
GAAP net income totaled $107 million compared to $88 million a year earlier, which produced diluted GAAP earnings per share of $0.82 in the first quarter this year compared to $0.66 for the first quarter last year.
As of March 31, 2016, the company maintained total assets of $2.3 billion. These assets included $1.9 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $667 million were held domestically with the remainder held internationally. 
Total liabilities were $3.4 billion at the quarter end. I'll now review some additional first quarter metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, diluted share count, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2016 full year guidance. First quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $12 million of stock-based compensation totaled $103 million as compared to the $103 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 and compared with $104 million in the same quarter a year ago. 
Non-GAAP operating margin for the first quarter was 63.3% compared to 59.7% in the same quarter 2015. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter was $112 million resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.85 based on a weighted-average diluted share count of 131.6 million shares. This compares to $0.74 in the first quarter of 2015 and $0.79 last quarter based on $133.8 million and $133.4 million weighted-average diluted shares, respectively. 
We had a weighted-average diluted share count of 131.6 million shares in the first quarter compared to 133.4 million shares in the fourth quarter. Dilution related to the convertible debentures was 21.1 million shares based on the average share price during the first quarter compared with $15.8 million for the same quarter in 2015 and 21.4 million shares last quarter. The share count was reduced by the full effect of fourth quarter 2015 repurchase activity and the weighted effect of the 1.8 million shares repurchased during the first quarter. 
Operating cash flow and free cash flow for the first quarter were $144 million and $143 million, respectively, compared with $133 million and $126 million, respectively, for the first quarter of last year. With respect to full year 2016 guidance, revenue for 2016 is now expected to be in the range of $1.125 billion to $1.140 billion representing an annual growth rate of approximately 6% to 7.5%. This revenue guidance is an increase from $1.110 billion to $1.135 billion revenue range given on the last earnings call. The 2016 revenue range reflects our updated expectation of full year 2016 domain name base growth, which is now in the range of 1% to 2.5%. 
Full year 2016 non-GAAP operating margin is still expected to be between 62.5% and 64%. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is now expected to be an expense of between $110 million and $115 million, lowered from the $114 million to $120 million range given on our last earnings call. 
Capital expenditures for the year are now expected to be between $35 million and $45 million, lowered from the $40 million to $50 million range as given on our last earnings call. Cash taxes for the year are still expected to be between $10 million to $20 million. Due to domestic tax attributed, including cash tax benefits from our convertible debentures, substantially all of the expected cash taxes in 2016 are international. 
In summary, the company continue to demonstrate sound financial performance during the first quarter. Now I'll turn the call back over to Jim for his closing remarks."

I'm pleased to report a solid start to 2016 for VeriSign. First quarter results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers, while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders. We reported revenue of $282 million, up 9.1% year-over-year, and we delivered strong financial performance, including $143 million in free cash flow.
We processed nearly $10 million new registrations during the first quarter and added 2.65 million net new names ending with 142.5 million .com and .net domain names in the domain name base.
Our financial position is strong with $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. As a part of managing our business, during the first quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1.8 million shares for $150 million. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.
As we discussed during the last call, ICANN and VeriSign are in the final stages of preparing the Root Zone Maintainer Agreement and the .com Registry Agreement extension documents. We continue to make progress, and we'll provide periodic updates as appropriate on our progress towards these objectives.
I'll comment now on first quarter operating highlights. At the end of the March, the domain name base in .com and .net 142.5 million, consisting of 126.6 million names for .com and 15.9 million names for .net. This represents an increase of 7.1% year-over-year.
In the fourth quarter of 2015, the renewal rate was 73.3% compared with 72.5% for the same quarter of 2014. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the first quarter of 2016 will be approximately 74.2%. This preliminary rate compares favorably to 73.4% achieved in the first quarter of 2015.
As we discussed over the last few quarters, there are many factors that drive domain growth. These include, but are not limited to, Internet adoption, economic activity, eCommerce activity and registrar go-to-market strategies.
During the first quarter, we continue to see strength in net additions in many parts of the world, both from developed and emerging markets. Also during the quarter, we again saw activity coming from registrars in China that exceeded our expectations. At this point, we expect activity from registrars in China to normalize as we continue through the second quarter.
Also, as discussed last quarter, we still expect the fourth quarter of 2016 to be somewhat unique as the expiring domain name base in that quarter will have a large percentage of first-time renewing names as a result of the strong performance during Q3 and Q4 of 2015. While it is difficult to assess what the renewal characteristics of these new names will be due to large upcoming Q4 2016 expiring base, we still expect fourth quarter deletions to be elevated. Accordingly, as we stated last quarter, deletions could exceed additions for the fourth quarter of 2016.
Based on these and other factors, we expect the second quarter 2016 net change to the domain name base to be an increase of between 0.6 million and 1.1 million names, and we are now forecasting a full year 2016 domain name base growth rate to be between 1% and 2.5%.
As an update related to the launch of our IDN versions of .com and .net, the localized katakana version of .com in Japanese launched in December and will be in general availability starting June 13. Also, we plan to launch the .com and .net Korean IDNs in May.
And now I'd like to turn the call over to George."

During the quarter, 58% of our revenue was from customers in the U.S. and 42% was from international customers.",667,"Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the first quarter totaled $282 million, up 9.1% year-over-year and 3.4% sequentially. During the quarter, 58% of our revenue was from customers in the U.S. and 42% was from international customers. GAAP operating income for the first quarter totaled $167 million, up 15.6% from $144 million in the first quarter of 2015. The GAAP operating margin in the quarter came to 59.2% compared to 55.8% in the same quarter a year ago.
GAAP net income totaled $107 million compared to $88 million a year earlier, which produced diluted GAAP earnings per share of $0.82 in the first quarter this year compared to $0.66 for the first quarter last year.
As of March 31, 2016, the company maintained total assets of $2.3 billion. These assets included $1.9 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $667 million were held domestically with the remainder held internationally. Total liabilities were $3.4 billion at the quarter end.
I'll now review some additional first quarter metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, diluted share count, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2016 full year guidance.
First quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $12 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $103 million as compared to the $103 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 and compared to -- with $104 million in the same quarter a year ago.
Non-GAAP operating margin for the first quarter was 63.3% compared to 59.7% in the same quarter 2015. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter was $112 million resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.85 based on a weighted-average diluted share count of 131.6 million shares. This compares to $0.74 in the first quarter of 2015 and $0.79 last quarter based on 133.8 million and 133.4 million weighted-average diluted shares, respectively. 
We had a weighted-average diluted share count of 131.6 million shares in the first quarter compared to 133.4 million shares in the fourth quarter. Dilution related to the convertible debentures was 21.1 million shares based on the average share price during the first quarter compared with 15.8 million for the same quarter in 2015 and 21.4 million shares last quarter. The share count was reduced by the full effect of fourth quarter 2015 repurchase activity and the weighted effect of the 1.8 million shares repurchased during the first quarter.
Operating cash flow and free cash flow for the first quarter were $144 million and $143 million, respectively, compared with $133 million and $126 million, respectively, for the first quarter of last year.
With respect to full year 2016 guidance, revenue for 2016 is now expected to be in the range of $1.125 billion to $1.140 billion, representing an annual growth rate of approximately 6% to 7.5%. This revenue guidance is an increase from $1.110 billion to $1.135 billion revenue range given on our last earnings call. The 2016 revenue range reflects our updated expectation of full year 2016 domain name base growth, which is now in the range of 1% to 2.5%.
Full year 2016 non-GAAP operating margin is still expected to be between 62.5% and 64%. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is now expected to be an expense of between $110 million and $115 million, lowered from the $114 million to $120 million range as given on our last earnings call.
Capital expenditures for the year are now expected to be between $35 million and $45 million, lowered from the $40 million to $50 million range as given on our last earnings call. Cash taxes for the year are still expected to be between $10 million to $20 million, due to domestic tax attributes, including cash tax benefits from our convertible debentures. Substantially all of the expected cash taxes in 2016 are international.
In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the first quarter.
Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

I'm pleased to report a solid start to 2016 for VeriSign. First quarter results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers, while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders. We reported revenue of $282 million, up 9.1% year-over-year, and we delivered strong financial performance, including $143 million in free cash flow.
We processed nearly $10 million new registrations during the first quarter and added 2.65 million net new names ending with 142.5 million .com and .net domain names in the domain name base.
Our financial position is strong with $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. As a part of managing our business, during the first quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1.8 million shares for $150 million. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.
As we discussed during the last call, ICANN and VeriSign are in the final stages of preparing the Root Zone Maintainer Agreement and the .com Registry Agreement extension documents. We continue to make progress, and we'll provide periodic updates as appropriate on our progress towards these objectives.
I'll comment now on first quarter operating highlights. At the end of the March, the domain name base in .com and .net was 142.5 million, consisting of 126.6 million names for .com and 15.9 million names for .net. This represents an increase of 7.1% year-over-year.
In the fourth quarter of 2015, the renewal rate was 73.3% compared with 72.5% for the same quarter of 2014. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the first quarter of 2016 will be approximately 74.2%. This preliminary rate compares favorably to 73.4% achieved in the first quarter of 2015.
As we discussed over the last few quarters, there are many factors that drive domain growth. These include, but are not limited to, Internet adoption, economic activity, eCommerce activity and registrar go-to-market strategies.
During the first quarter, we continue to see strength in net additions in many parts of the world, both from developed and emerging markets. Also during the quarter, we again saw activity coming from registrars in China that exceeded our expectations. At this point, we expect activity from registrars in China to normalize as we continue through the second quarter.
Also, as discussed last quarter, we still expect the fourth quarter of 2016 to be somewhat unique as the expiring domain name base in that quarter will have a large percentage of first-time renewing names as a result of the strong performance during Q3 and Q4 of 2015. While it is difficult to assess what the renewal characteristics of these new names will be due to large upcoming Q4 2016 expiring base, we still expect fourth quarter deletions to be elevated. Accordingly, as we stated last quarter, deletions could exceed additions for the fourth quarter of 2016.
Based on these and other factors, we expect the second quarter 2016 net change to the domain name base to be an increase of between 0.6 million and 1.1 million names, and we are now forecasting a full year 2016 domain name base growth rate to be between 1% and 2.5%.
As an update related to the launch of our IDN versions of .com and .net, the localized katakana version of .com in Japanese launched in December and will be in general availability starting June 13. Also, we plan to launch the .com and .net Korean IDNs in May.
And now I'd like to turn the call over to George."

I'll now review some additional first quarter metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, diluted share count, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2016 full year guidance.
First quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $12 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $103 million as compared to the $103 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 and compared to -- with $104 million in the same quarter a year ago.
Non-GAAP operating margin for the first quarter was 63.3% compared to 59.7% in the same quarter 2015. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter was $112 million resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.85 based on a weighted-average diluted share count of 131.6 million shares. This compares to $0.74 in the first quarter of 2015 and $0.79 last quarter based on 133.8 million and 133.4 million weighted-average diluted shares, respectively. 
We had a weighted-average diluted share count of 131.6 million shares in the first quarter compared to 133.4 million shares in the fourth quarter. Dilution related to the convertible debentures was 21.1 million shares based on the average share price during the first quarter compared with 15.8 million for the same quarter in 2015 and 21.4 million shares last quarter. The share count was reduced by the full effect of fourth quarter 2015 repurchase activity and the weighted effect of the 1.8 million shares repurchased during the first quarter.
Operating cash flow and free cash flow for the first quarter were $144 million and $143 million, respectively, compared with $133 million and $126 million, respectively, for the first quarter of last year.
With respect to full year 2016 guidance, revenue for 2016 is now expected to be in the range of $1.125 billion to $1.140 billion, representing an annual growth rate of approximately 6% to 7.5%. This revenue guidance is an increase from $1.110 billion to $1.135 billion revenue range given on our last earnings call. The 2016 revenue range reflects our updated expectation of full year 2016 domain name base growth, which is now in the range of 1% to 2.5%.
Full year 2016 non-GAAP operating margin is still expected to be between 62.5% and 64%. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is now expected to be an expense of between $110 million and $116 million, lowered from the $114 million to $120 million range as given on our last earnings call.
Capital expenditures for the year are now expected to be between $35 million and $45 million, lowered from the $40 million to $50 million range as given on our last earnings call. Cash taxes for the year are still expected to be between $10 million to $20 million, due to domestic tax attributes, including cash tax benefits from our convertible debentures. Substantially all of the expected cash taxes in 2016 are international.
In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the first quarter.
Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

I'm pleased to report a solid start to 2016 for VeriSign. First quarter results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers, while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders. We reported revenue of $282 million, up 9.1% year-over-year, and we delivered strong financial performance, including $143 million in free cash flow.
We processed nearly $10 million new registrations during the first quarter and added 2.65 million net new names ending with 142.5 million .com and .net domain names in the domain name base.
Our financial position is strong with $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. As a part of managing our business, during the first quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1.8 million shares for $150 million. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases.
As we discussed during the last call, ICANN and VeriSign are in the final stages of preparing the Root Zone Maintainer Agreement and the .com Registry Agreement extension documents. We continue to make progress, and we'll provide periodic updates as appropriate on our progress towards these objectives.
I'll comment now on first quarter operating highlights. At the end of the March, the domain name base in .com and .net was 142.5 million, consisting of 126.6 million names for .com and 15.9 million names for .net. This represents an increase of 7.1% year-over-year.
In the fourth quarter of 2015, the renewal rate was 73.3% compared with 72.5% for the same quarter of 2014. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the first quarter of 2016 will be approximately 74.2%. This preliminary rate compares favorably to 73.4% achieved in the first quarter of 2015.
As we discussed over the last few quarters, there are many factors that drive domain growth. These include, but are not limited to, Internet adoption, economic activity, eCommerce activity and registrar go-to-market strategies.
During the first quarter, we continue to see strength in net additions in many parts of the world, both from developed and emerging markets. Also during the quarter, we again saw activity coming from registrars in China that exceeded our expectations. At this point, we expect activity from registrars in China to normalize as we continue through the second quarter.
Also, as discussed last quarter, we still expect the fourth quarter of 2016 to be somewhat unique as the expiring domain name base in that quarter will have a large percentage of first-time renewing names as a result of the strong performance during Q3 and Q4 of 2015. While it is difficult to assess what the renewal characteristics of these new names will be due to large upcoming Q4 2016 expiring base, we still expect fourth quarter deletions to be elevated. Accordingly, as we stated last quarter, deletions could exceed additions for the fourth quarter of 2016.
Based on these and other factors, we expect the second quarter 2016 net change to the domain name base to be an increase of between 0.6 million and 1.1 million names, and we are now forecasting a full year 2016 domain name base growth rate to be between 1% and 2.5%.
As an update related to the launch of our IDN versions of .com and .net, the localized katakana version of .com in Japanese launched in December and will be in general availability starting June 13. Also, we plan to launch the .com and .net Korean IDNs in May.
And now I'd like to turn the call over to George."

Revenue for the first quarter totaled $282 million, up 9.1% year-over-year and 3.4% sequentially. During the quarter, 58% of our revenue was from customers in the U.S. and 42% was from international customers. GAAP operating income for the first quarter totaled $167 million, up 15.6% from $144 million in the first quarter of 2015. The GAAP operating margin in the quarter came to 59.2% compared to 55.8% in the same quarter a year ago.
GAAP net income totaled $107 million compared to $88 million a year earlier, which produced diluted GAAP earnings per share of $0.82 in the first quarter this year compared to $0.66 for the first quarter last year.
As of March 31, 2016, the company maintained total assets of $2.3 billion. These assets included $1.9 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $667 million were held domestically with the remainder held internationally. Total liabilities were $3.4 billion at the quarter end.
I'll now review some additional first quarter metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, diluted share count, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2016 full year guidance.
First quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $12 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $103 million as compared to the $103 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 and compared to -- with $104 million in the same quarter a year ago.
Non-GAAP operating margin for the first quarter was 63.3% compared to 59.7% in the same quarter 2015. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter was $112 million resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.85 based on a weighted-average diluted share count of 131.6 million shares. This compares to $0.74 in the first quarter of 2015 and $0.79 last quarter based on 133.8 million and 133.4 million weighted-average diluted shares, respectively. 
We had a weighted-average diluted share count of 131.6 million shares in the first quarter compared to 133.4 million shares in the fourth quarter. Dilution related to the convertible debentures was 21.1 million shares based on the average share price during the first quarter compared with 15.8 million for the same quarter in 2015 and 21.4 million shares last quarter. The share count was reduced by the full effect of fourth quarter 2015 repurchase activity and the weighted effect of the 1.8 million shares repurchased during the first quarter.
Operating cash flow and free cash flow for the first quarter were $144 million and $143 million, respectively, compared with $133 million and $126 million, respectively, for the first quarter of last year.
With respect to full year 2016 guidance, revenue for 2016 is now expected to be in the range of $1.125 billion to $1.140 billion, representing an annual growth rate of approximately 6% to 7.5%. This revenue guidance is an increase from $1.110 billion to $1.135 billion revenue range given on our last earnings call. The 2016 revenue range reflects our updated expectation of full year 2016 domain name base growth, which is now in the range of 1% to 2.5%.
Full year 2016 non-GAAP operating margin is still expected to be between 62.5% and 64%. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is now expected to be an expense of between $110 million and $116 million, lowered from the $114 million to $120 million range as given on our last earnings call.
Capital expenditures for the year are now expected to be between $35 million and $45 million, lowered from the $40 million to $50 million range as given on our last earnings call. Cash taxes for the year are still expected to be between $10 million to $20 million, due to domestic tax attributes, including cash tax benefits from our convertible debentures. Substantially all of the expected cash taxes in 2016 are international.
In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the first quarter.
Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

I'm pleased to report a solid first half of 2016 for VeriSign. Second quarter results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers, while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders. 
We reported revenue of $286 million, up 9.1% year-over-year, and we delivered strong financial performance, including $161 million in free cash flow. We processed $8.6 million new registrations during the second quarter and added 0.78 million net new names ending with 143.2 million common .net domain names in the domain name base. 
Our financial position is strong with $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. As a part of managing our business, during the second quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1.7 million shares for $150 million. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. 
As we discussed during the last call, ICANN and VeriSign have been working on the Root Zone Maintainer Services Agreement and the .com Registry Agreement extension amendment. At the end of June, ICANN posted the RCMA for public review and the .com Registry Agreement Amendment for public comment, after which our respective boards of directors will be asked to approve the agreements. After this, the .com RA extension amendment which, extends the term of the RA until November 30, 2024, will be sent to MTIA for review and approval according to their processes. 
I'll comment now on second quarter operating highlights. At the end of June, the domain name base in .com and .net was $143.2 million, consisting of 127.5 million names for .com and 15.8 million net names for .net. This represents an increase of 7.3% year-over-year. In the first quarter of 2016, the renewal rate was 74.4% compared with 73.4% for the same quarter of 2015. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rates for the second quarter of 2016 will be approximately 73.7%. This preliminary rate compares favorably to 72.7% achieved in the second quarter of 2015. 
As we discussed over the last few quarters, there are many factors that drive domain growth. These include, but are not limited to, Internet adoption, economic activity, eCommerce activity and registrar go-to-market strategies. During the second quarter, as we had anticipated, activity from registrars in China normalized. Also, as discussed, during the last 2 quarters, we still expect the fourth quarter of 2016 to be somewhat unique as the expiring domain name base in that quarter will have a larger than normal percentage of first-time renewing names as a result of the strong performance during Q3 and Q4 of 2015. 
While it's difficult to assess what the renewal characteristics of these new names will be due to large upcoming Q4 2016 expiring base, we still expect fourth quarter deletions to be elevated. Accordingly, as we stated the last 2 quarters, deletions could exceed additions for the fourth quarter of 2016. Based on these and other factors, we expect the third quarter 2016 net change to the domain name base to be an increase of 0.5 million and between 0.5 million and 1.0 million names and we are now forecasting the full year 2016 domain name base growth rate to be between 1% to 2%. 
Lastly, today we announced an increase in the annual wholesale fee for .net domain name registration as allowed by our agreement with ICANN. As of February 1, 2017, the annual wholesale fee for .net domain name registration will increase from $7.46 to $8.20. 
And now I'd like to turn the call over to George."

During the quarter, 58% of our revenue was from customers in the U.S. and 42% was from international customers",660,"Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the second quarter totaled $286 million, up 9.1% year-over-year and up 1.6% sequentially. During the quarter, 58% of our revenue was from customers in the U.S. and 42% was from international customers. GAAP operating income in the second quarter totaled $176 million, up 18.3% from $139 million in the second quarter of 2015. The GAAP operating margin in the quarter came to 61.5% compared with 56.7% in the same quarter a year ago. GAAP net income totaled $113 million compared to $93 million a year earlier, which produced diluted GAAP earnings per share of $0.87 in the second quarter this year compared to $0.70 for the second quarter last year. 
As of June 30, 2016, the company maintained total assets of $2.3 billion and total liabilities of $3.4 billion. As it's included $1.9 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which, $609 million were held domestically with the remainder held abroad. 
I'll now review some additional second quarter financial metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, diluted share count, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2016 full year guidance. 
Second quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $11 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $99 million as compared to the $103 million in the first quarter of 2016 and $102 million in the same quarter a year ago. The sequential decline in expenses is primarily a result of seasonally lower employee payroll tax withholdings in the quarter. 
Non-GAAP operating margin for the second quarter were 65.4% compared to 61.3% in the same quarter of 2015. The improved margin performance in the quarter was aided by our strong net add performance in the first quarter and the timing of some sales and marketing expenditures being moved to the second half of the year. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter was $119 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.91 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 130.6 million shares. This compares to $0.74 in the second quarter of 2015 and $0.85 last quarter based on 133.3 million and 131.6 million weighted average diluted shares, respectively. 
Dilution related to the convertible debentures was 21.9 million shares based on the average share price during the second quarter compared with 17 million for the same quarter in 2015 and 21.1 million shares last quarter. The share count was reduced by the full effect of first quarter 2016 repurchase activity and the weighted effect of the 1.7 million shares repurchased during the second quarter. 
Both operating cash flow and free cash flow for the second quarter were $161 million compared with $175 million and $171 million, respectively, for the second quarter last year. 
With respect to full year 2016 guidance, revenue for 2016 is now expected to be in the range of $1.130 billion to $1.140 billion, representing an annual growth rate of approximately 6.5% to 7.5%. This revenue guidance is narrowed from the $1.125 billion to $1.140 billion range given on our last earnings call. The 2016 revenue range reflects our current outlook and our updated expectation of full year 2016 domain name base growth of between 1% and 2%. 
Full year 2016 non-GAAP operating margin is still expected to be between 62.5% and 64%. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is still expected to be an expense of between $110 million and $116 million. Capital expenditures for the year are still expected to be between $35 million and $45 million. 
Cash taxes for the year are also still expected to be between $10 million to $20 million, due to our domestic tax attributes, including cash tax benefits from our convertible debentures, substantially all of the expected cash taxes in 2016 are international. 
In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the second quarter. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

This previous record is due to the expertise of our people and our specialized infrastructure. 
As businesses and economic activity rely increasingly on digital infrastructure, availability will become more important. Second, we were informed earlier this month by the Chinese government that we are now licensed to provide domain name registry services for .com and .net in the PRC.

As we evaluate some of those programs that come in for us clearly, we're looking at those to see if they're going to have the right impact for our business and generate positive returns for us. And so sometimes, some of those programs that submitted are not that attractive for us and so we look to solicit additional proposals from registrars as well as redirecting some of our programs, depending on what's going on around the globe. As you might expect, there was a number of geopolitical things happening and so we take those and other factors into place. And anything unique here other than we do have some programs that we did not execute on in the second half -- in the first half of the year and we expect to exceed on those in the second half of the year.

I'm pleased to report a solid first half of 2016 for VeriSign. Second quarter results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders. 
We reported revenue of $286 million, up 9.1% year-over-year, and we delivered strong financial performance, including $161 million in free cash flow. We processed 8.6 million new registrations during the second quarter and added 0.78 million net new names, ending with 143.2 million common net domain names in the domain name base. 
Our financial position is strong with $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. As a part of managing our business, during the second quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1.7 million shares for $150 million. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. 
As we discussed during the last call, ICANN and VeriSign have been working on the Root Zone Maintainer Services Agreement and the .com Registry Agreement extension amendment. At the end of June, ICANN posted the RZMA for public review and the .com Registry Agreement amendment for public comment, after which our respective Boards of Directors will be asked to approve the agreements. After this, the .com RA extension amendment, which extends the term of the RA until November 30, 2024, will be sent to NTIA for review and approval according to their processes. 
I'll comment now on second quarter operating highlights. At the end of June, the domain name base in .com and .net was 143.2 million, consisting of 127.5 million names for .com and 15.8 million names for .net. This represents an increase of 7.3% year-over-year. In the first quarter of 2016, the renewal rate was 74.4% compared with 73.4% for the same quarter of 2015. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rates for the second quarter of 2016 will be approximately 73.7%. This preliminary rate compares favorably to 72.7% achieved in the second quarter of 2015. 
As we discussed over the last few quarters, there are many factors that drive domain growth. These include, but are not limited to, Internet adoption, economic activity, e-commerce activity and registrar go-to-market strategies. During the second quarter, as we had anticipated, activity from registrars in China normalized. Also, as discussed, during the last 2 quarters, we still expect the fourth quarter of 2016 to be somewhat unique, as the expiring domain name base in that quarter will have a larger-than-normal percentage of first-time renewing names as a result of the strong performance during Q3 and Q4 of 2015. While it is difficult to assess what the renewal characteristics of these new names will be due to large upcoming Q4 2016 expiring base, we still expect fourth quarter deletions to be elevated. Accordingly, as we stated the last 2 quarters, deletions could exceed additions for the fourth quarter of 2016. Based on these and other factors, we expect the third quarter 2016 net change to the domain name base to be an increase of 0.5 million -- between 0.5 million and 1.0 million names, and we are now forecasting the full year 2016 domain name base growth rate to be between 1% and 2%. 
Lastly, today we announced an increase in the annual wholesale fee for a .net domain name registration as allowed by our agreement with ICANN. As of February 1, 2017, the annual wholesale fee for .net domain name registration will increase from $7.46 to $8.20. 
And now I'd like to turn the call over to George."

The GAAP operating margin in the quarter came to 61.5% compared with 56.7% in the same quarter a year ago. GAAP net income totaled $113 million compared to $93 million a year earlier, which produced diluted GAAP earnings per share of $0.87 in the second quarter this year compared to $0.70 for the second quarter last year. 
As of June 30, 2016, the company maintained total assets of $2.3 billion and total liabilities of $3.4 billion. Assets included $1.9 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $609 million were held domestically with the remainder held abroad. 
I'll now review some additional second quarter financial metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, diluted share count, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2016 full year guidance. 
Second quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $11 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $99 million as compared to the $103 million in the first quarter of 2016 and $102 million in the same quarter a year ago. The sequential decline in expenses is primarily a result of seasonally lower employee payroll tax withholdings in the quarter. 
Non-GAAP operating margin for the second quarter was 65.4% compared to 61.3% in the same quarter of 2015. The improved margin performance in the quarter was aided by our strong net add performance in the first quarter and the timing of some sales and marketing expenditures being moved to the second half of the year. 
Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter was $119 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.91 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 130.6 million shares. This compares to $0.74 in the second quarter of 2015 and $0.85 last quarter based on 133.3 million and 131.6 million weighted average diluted shares, respectively. 
Dilution related to the convertible debentures was 21.9 million shares based on the average share price during the second quarter compared with 17 million for the same quarter in 2015 and 21.1 million shares last quarter. The share count was reduced by the full effect of first quarter 2016 repurchase activity and the weighted effect of the 1.7 million shares repurchased during the second quarter. 
Both operating cash flow and free cash flow for the second quarter were $161 million compared with $175 million and $171 million, respectively, for the second quarter last year. 
With respect to full year 2016 guidance, revenue for 2016 is now expected to be in the range of $1,130,000,000 to $1,140,000,000, representing an annual growth rate of approximately 6.5% to 7.5%. This revenue guidance is narrowed from the $1,125,000,000 to $1,140,000,000 range given on our last earnings call. The 2016 revenue range reflects our current outlook and our updated expectation of full year 2016 domain name base growth of between 1% and 2%. 
Full year 2016 non-GAAP operating margin is still expected to be between 62.5% and 64%. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is still expected to be an expense of between $110 million and $116 million. Capital expenditures for the year are still expected to be between $35 million and $45 million. Cash taxes for the year are also still expected to be between $10 million to $20 million. Due to our domestic tax attributes, including cash tax benefits from our convertible debentures, substantially all of the expected cash taxes in 2016 are international. 
In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the second quarter. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

In closing, during the second quarter, we continued to protect, grow and manage the business while delivering value to our shareholders. Since the start of this quarter, the company achieved 2 important milestones. First, we marked 19 continuous years of 100% availability of the .com and .net DNS. This previous record is due to the expertise of our people and our specialized infrastructure. As businesses and economic activity rely increasingly on digital infrastructure, availability will become more important. 
Second, we were informed earlier this month by the Chinese government that we are now licensed to provide domain name registry services for .com and .net in the PRC. We believe .com and .net are the first non-China-based registries to be fully licensed in China. We think that our focus on profitable growth and disciplined execution will extend the long trend lines of growth in our top and bottom line and allow us to continue our consistent track record of generating and returning value to our shareholders in the most efficient manner.

And so sometimes, some of those programs get submitted are not that attractive for us, and so we look to solicit additional proposals from registrars as well as redirecting some of our programs, depending on what's going on around the globe. As you might expect, there is a number of geopolitical things happening, and so we take those and other factors into place.

So at least, what we're currently seeing is those are at much more normal levels. As far as the license agreement, I mean, I don't really -- I don't have any particular expectations. I mean, we've always operated in China. We've done well there. I think our brand is quite strong there. I don't really have any change of expectation just related to a license to how we perform. Anything you'll add, Jim?"

I think the license is important, but we have been operating with the approval of the Chinese government for a period of time as they introduce new processes for their local registrars to follow. There was a new licensing regime that was announced some time ago. We've been in that process for a period of time. And as I've mentioned in my earlier remarks, we now are the, as far as we know, the first registries, .com and .net, to be approved. So we are licensed for those registries to operate in China, which is important, although we did expect that, that process would yield the result that it did. So I don't see any interruption in the availability of our products and our operation in China. So I think it's certainly an important milestone for us but one that we've been working with the Chinese government on for a period of time. That, in and of itself, I don't expect to change anything from the registrant point of view. It just simply enables the registrars to comply with local law."

Financial results in our earnings release are unaudited, and our remarks include forward-looking statements that are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we discussed in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which identify risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.

The financial results in today's call and the matters we will be discussing today include GAAP and non-GAAP measures used by VeriSign.

I'm pleased to report a solid first half of 2016 for VeriSign. Second quarter results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders. 
We reported revenue of $286 million, up 9.1% year-over-year, and we delivered strong financial performance, including $161 million in free cash flow. We processed 8.6 million new registrations during the second quarter and added 0.78 million net new names, ending with 143.2 million common net domain names in the domain name base. 
Our financial position is strong with $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. As a part of managing our business, during the second quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1.7 million shares for $150 million. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. 
As we discussed during the last call, ICANN and VeriSign have been working on the Root Zone Maintainer Services Agreement and the .com Registry Agreement extension amendment. At the end of June, ICANN posted the RZMA for public review and the .com Registry Agreement amendment for public comment, after which our respective Boards of Directors will be asked to approve the agreements. After this, the .com RA extension amendment, which extends the term of the RA until November 30, 2024, will be sent to NTIA for review and approval according to their processes. 
I'll comment now on second quarter operating highlights. At the end of June, the domain name base in .com and .net was 143.2 million, consisting of 127.5 million names for .com and 15.8 million names for .net. This represents an increase of 7.3% year-over-year. In the first quarter of 2016, the renewal rate was 74.4% compared with 73.4% for the same quarter of 2015. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rates for the second quarter of 2016 will be approximately 73.7%. This preliminary rate compares favorably to 72.7% achieved in the second quarter of 2015. 
As we discussed over the last few quarters, there are many factors that drive domain growth. These include, but are not limited to, Internet adoption, economic activity, e-commerce activity and registrar go-to-market strategies. During the second quarter, as we had anticipated, activity from registrars in China normalized. Also, as discussed, during the last 2 quarters, we still expect the fourth quarter of 2016 to be somewhat unique, as the expiring domain name base in that quarter will have a larger-than-normal percentage of first-time renewing names as a result of the strong performance during Q3 and Q4 of 2015. While it is difficult to assess what the renewal characteristics of these new names will be due to large upcoming Q4 2016 expiring base, we still expect fourth quarter deletions to be elevated. Accordingly, as we stated the last 2 quarters, deletions could exceed additions for the fourth quarter of 2016. Based on these and other factors, we expect the third quarter 2016 net change to the domain name base to be an increase of 0.5 million -- between 0.5 million and 1.0 million names, and we are now forecasting the full year 2016 domain name base growth rate to be between 1% and 2%. 
Lastly, today we announced an increase in the annual wholesale fee for a .net domain name registration as allowed by our agreement with ICANN. As of February 1, 2017, the annual wholesale fee for .net domain name registration will increase from $7.46 to $8.20. 
And now I'd like to turn the call over to George."

Revenue for the second quarter totaled $286 million, up 9.1% year-over-year and up 1.6% sequentially. During the quarter, 58% of our revenue was from customers in the U.S. and 42% was from international customers",655,"Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the second quarter totaled $286 million, up 9.1% year-over-year and up 1.6% sequentially. During the quarter, 58% of our revenue was from customers in the U.S. and 42% was from international customers. GAAP operating income in the second quarter totaled $176 million, up 18.3% from $139 million in the second quarter of 2015. The GAAP operating margin in the quarter came to 61.5% compared with 56.7% in the same quarter a year ago. GAAP net income totaled $113 million compared to $93 million a year earlier, which produced diluted GAAP earnings per share of $0.87 in the second quarter this year compared to $0.70 for the second quarter last year. 
As of June 30, 2016, the company maintained total assets of $2.3 billion and total liabilities of $3.4 billion. Assets included $1.9 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $609 million were held domestically with the remainder held abroad. 
I'll now review some additional second quarter financial metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, diluted share count, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2016 full year guidance. 
Second quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $11 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $99 million as compared to the $103 million in the first quarter of 2016 and $102 million in the same quarter a year ago. The sequential decline in expenses is primarily a result of seasonally lower employee payroll tax withholdings in the quarter. 
Non-GAAP operating margin for the second quarter was 65.4% compared to 61.3% in the same quarter of 2015. The improved margin performance in the quarter was aided by our strong net add performance in the first quarter and the timing of some sales and marketing expenditures being moved to the second half of the year. 
Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter rose $119 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.91 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 130.6 million shares. This compares to $0.74 in the second quarter of 2015 and $0.85 last quarter based on 133.3 million and 131.6 million weighted average diluted shares, respectively. 
Dilution related to the convertible debentures was 21.9 million shares based on the average share price during the second quarter compared with 17 million for the same quarter in 2015 and 21.1 million shares last quarter. The share count was reduced by the full effect of first quarter 2016 repurchase activity and the weighted effect of the 1.7 million shares repurchased during the second quarter. 
Both operating cash flow and free cash flow for the second quarter were $161 million compared with $175 million and $171 million, respectively, for the second quarter last year. 
With respect to full year 2016 guidance, revenue for 2016 is now expected to be in the range of $1,130,000,000 to $1,140,000,000, representing an annual growth rate of approximately 6.5% to 7.5%. This revenue guidance is narrowed from the $1,125,000,000 to $1,140,000,000 range given on our last earnings call. The 2016 revenue range reflects our current outlook and our updated expectation of full year 2016 domain name base growth of between 1% and 2%. 
Full year 2016 non-GAAP operating margin is still expected to be between 62.5% and 64%. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is still expected to be an expense of between $110 million and $116 million. Capital expenditures for the year are still expected to be between $35 million and $45 million. Cash taxes for the year are also still expected to be between $10 million to $20 million. Due to our domestic tax attributes, including cash tax benefits from our convertible debentures, substantially all of the expected cash taxes in 2016 are international. 
In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the second quarter. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

In closing, during the second quarter, we continued to protect, grow and manage the business while delivering value to our shareholders. Since the start of this quarter, the company achieved 2 important milestones. First, we marked 19 continuous years of 100% availability of the .com and .net DNS. This peerless record is due to the expertise of our people and our specialized infrastructure. As businesses and economic activity rely increasingly on digital infrastructure, availability will become more important. 
Second, we were informed earlier this month by the Chinese government that we are now licensed to provide domain name registry services for .com and .net in the PRC. We believe .com and .net are the first non-China-based registries to be fully licensed in China. We think that our focus on profitable growth and disciplined execution will extend the long trend lines of growth in our top and bottom line and allow us to continue our consistent track record of generating and returning value to our shareholders in the most efficient manner.

There are a number of programs that we run, some that we direct specifically that we take a look at, others that -- programs that we open up to registrars to submit programs to us. As we evaluate some of those programs that come in for us, clearly, we're looking at those to see if they're going to have the right impact for our business and that they're going to generate positive returns for us. And so sometimes, some of those programs get submitted are not that attractive for us, and so we look to solicit additional proposals from registrars as well as redirecting some of our programs, depending on what's going on around the globe. As you might expect, there is a number of geopolitical things happening, and so we take those and other factors into place. I don't think we got anything unique here, other than we do have some programs that we did not execute on in the second half -- in the first half of the year, and we expect to execute on those in the second half of the year.

I would say what I've said before in the past that I believe that there is some data that's trending favorably for us in that ICANN has now crossed over 1,000 new gTLDs delegated to the roots. There is, I'm trying not to be too understated, but more-than-ample consumer choice for new gTLDs for consumers to choose from. And many of these TLDs are priced higher than .com. So that data is helpful, but I really can't comment on when we might do that. I think there a lot of factors we'd consider and there's a process that we follow, but I'm not able to give you any information about exactly when we might do that."

We have to evaluate them, and so we clearly want to make sure that the ones that we're pursuing and accepting meet certain financial criteria. So to some degree, it really depends on the proposals that are being submitted to us. Others that we direct, as I mentioned to an earlier caller, we're taking a variety of things into consideration. We're marketing globally. We're looking at certain markets, and there are clearly odd things that happened, whether it be, I don't know, a Brexit or whether it be something that goes on in Turkey or other areas. We may choose to delay a program or -- because of other factors outside of our control. So there's a variety of things that we take into consideration. Last year, we did spend more money. We did spend money in the second half of the year, but again, there's a variety of factors that come to lumpiness. But our intention is to invest dollars into the market that will drive incremental profitable growth for the business. So hopefully, that answers your question."

I'm pleased to report a solid first half of 2016 for VeriSign. Second quarter results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders. 
We reported revenue of $286 million, up 9.1% year-over-year, and we delivered strong financial performance, including $161 million in free cash flow. We processed 8.6 million new registrations during the second quarter and added 0.78 million net new names, ending with 143.2 million common net domain names in the domain name base. 
Our financial position is strong with $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. As a part of managing our business, during the second quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 1.7 million shares for $150 million. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. 
As we discussed during the last call, ICANN and VeriSign have been working on the Root Zone Maintainer Services Agreement and the .com Registry Agreement extension amendment. At the end of June, ICANN posted the RZMA for public review and the .com Registry Agreement amendment for public comment, after which our respective Boards of Directors will be asked to approve the agreements. After this, the .com RA extension amendment, which extends the term of the RA until November 30, 2024, will be sent to NTIA for review and approval according to their processes. 
I'll comment now on second quarter operating highlights. At the end of June, the domain name base in .com and .net was 143.2 million, consisting of 127.5 million names for .com and 15.8 million names for .net. This represents an increase of 7.3% year-over-year. In the first quarter of 2016, the renewal rate was 74.4% compared with 73.4% for the same quarter of 2015. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rates for the second quarter of 2016 will be approximately 73.7%. This preliminary rate compares favorably to 72.7% achieved in the second quarter of 2015. 
As we discussed over the last few quarters, there are many factors that drive domain growth. These include, but are not limited to, Internet adoption, economic activity, e-commerce activity and registrar go-to-market strategies. During the second quarter, as we had anticipated, activity from registrars in China normalized. Also, as discussed, during the last 2 quarters, we still expect the fourth quarter of 2016 to be somewhat unique, as the expiring domain name base in that quarter will have a larger-than-normal percentage of first-time renewing names as a result of the strong performance during Q3 and Q4 of 2015. While it is difficult to assess what the renewal characteristics of these new names will be due to large upcoming Q4 2016 expiring base, we still expect fourth quarter deletions to be elevated. Accordingly, as we stated the last 2 quarters, deletions could exceed additions for the fourth quarter of 2016. Based on these and other factors, we expect the third quarter 2016 net change to the domain name base to be an increase of 0.5 million -- between 0.5 million and 1.0 million names, and we are now forecasting the full year 2016 domain name base growth rate to be between 1% and 2%. 
Lastly, today we announced an increase in the annual wholesale fee for a .net domain name registration as allowed by our agreement with ICANN. As of February 1, 2017, the annual wholesale fee for .net domain name registration will increase from $7.46 to $8.20. 
And now I'd like to turn the call over to George."

During the quarter, 58% of our revenue was from customers in the U.S. and 42% was from international customers",655,"Thanks, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the second quarter totaled $286 million, up 9.1% year-over-year and up 1.6% sequentially. During the quarter, 58% of our revenue was from customers in the U.S. and 42% was from international customers. GAAP operating income in the second quarter totaled $176 million, up 18.3% from $139 million in the second quarter of 2015. The GAAP operating margin in the quarter came to 61.5% compared with 56.7% in the same quarter a year ago. GAAP net income totaled $113 million compared to $93 million a year earlier, which produced diluted GAAP earnings per share of $0.87 in the second quarter this year compared to $0.70 for the second quarter last year. 
As of June 30, 2016, the company maintained total assets of $2.3 billion and total liabilities of $3.4 billion. Assets included $1.9 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $609 million were held domestically with the remainder held abroad. 
I'll now review some additional second quarter financial metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, diluted share count, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2016 full year guidance. 
Second quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $11 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $99 million as compared to the $103 million in the first quarter of 2016 and $102 million in the same quarter a year ago. The sequential decline in expenses is primarily a result of seasonally lower employee payroll tax withholdings in the quarter. 
Non-GAAP operating margin for the second quarter was 65.4% compared to 61.3% in the same quarter of 2015. The improved margin performance in the quarter was aided by our strong net add performance in the first quarter and the timing of some sales and marketing expenditures being moved to the second half of the year. 
Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter was $119 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.91 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 130.6 million shares. This compares to $0.74 in the second quarter of 2015 and $0.85 last quarter based on 133.3 million and 131.6 million weighted average diluted shares, respectively. 
Dilution related to the convertible debentures was 21.9 million shares based on the average share price during the second quarter compared with 17 million for the same quarter in 2015 and 21.1 million shares last quarter. The share count was reduced by the full effect of first quarter 2016 repurchase activity and the weighted effect of the 1.7 million shares repurchased during the second quarter. 
Both operating cash flow and free cash flow for the second quarter were $161 million compared with $175 million and $171 million, respectively, for the second quarter last year. 
With respect to full year 2016 guidance, revenue for 2016 is now expected to be in the range of $1,130,000,000 to $1,140,000,000, representing an annual growth rate of approximately 6.5% to 7.5%. This revenue guidance is narrowed from the $1,125,000,000 to $1,140,000,000 range given on our last earnings call. The 2016 revenue range reflects our current outlook and our updated expectation of full year 2016 domain name base growth of between 1% and 2%. 
Full year 2016 non-GAAP operating margin is still expected to be between 62.5% and 64%. Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is still expected to be an expense of between $110 million and $116 million. Capital expenditures for the year are still expected to be between $35 million and $45 million. Cash taxes for the year are also still expected to be between $10 million to $20 million. Due to our domestic tax attributes, including cash tax benefits from our convertible debentures, substantially all of the expected cash taxes in 2016 are international. 
In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the second quarter. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

I don't think we got anything unique here, other than we do have some programs that we did not execute on in the second half -- in the first half of the year, and we expect to execute on those in the second half of the year. So we're expecting our sales and marketing expense to increase in the second half of the year."

We're marketing globally. We're looking at certain markets, and there are clearly odd things that happened, whether it be, I don't know, a Brexit or whether it be something that goes on in Turkey or other areas.

So we are licensed for those registries to operate in China, which is important, although we did expect that, that process would yield the result that it did.

I'm pleased to report another solid third quarter for VeriSign. Third quarter results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders. 
Before I get into the third quarter results, I want to comment on 2 areas of focus for the company. First, last week, VeriSign issued an 8-K detailing the completion of the Root Zone Maintainer Service Agreement or RZMA and the .com registry agreement extension amendment. The RZMA between VeriSign and ICANN is now effective and VeriSign has been discharged from those responsibilities under the Cooperative Agreement. Additionally, NTIA approved the. com extension which extends the .com registry agreement between VeriSign and ICANN until November 30, 2024, to coincide with the term of the RZMA. VeriSign agreed to cooperate with NTIA as it determines whether to exercise their right to extend the term of the Cooperative Agreement before it expires on November 30, 2018. 
Second, as we stated earlier this year, a significant part of our corporate strategy for 2016 was to evaluate for acquisition top level domains that are currently in operation and those that have not yet been awarded. Consistent with the strategy, as announced in August, VeriSign entered into an agreement for the future assignment of the .web TLD. While there's still steps that need to occur before we become the registry operator for .web, we're excited about the .net opportunity as we believe that we are well positioned to make it successful. 
I'll comment now on third quarter operating highlights. We reported revenue of $288 million, up 8.2% year-over-year, and we delivered strong financial performance, including $165 million in free cash flow. We ended the third quarter with $144.1 million .com and .net domain name registrations in the domain name base. Our financial position is strong with $1.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. As a part of managing our business, during the third quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 2.2 million shares for $177 million. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. 
At the end of September, the domain name base in .com and .net was 144.1 million, consisting of 128.4 million .com registrations and 15.8 million .net registrations. This represents an increase of 6.6% year-over-year and a net increase of 0.9 million domain name registrations from the end of the second quarter. 
During the quarter, we processed 8.3 million new registrations. In the second quarter of 2016, the renewal rate was 73.8% compared with 72.7% for the same quarter of 2015. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the third quarter of 2016 will be approximately 72.3%. This preliminary rate compares favorably to 71.9% achieved in the third quarter of 2015. 
There are many factors that drive domain growth. These include, but are not limited to, Internet adoption, economic activity, e-commerce activity and registrar go-to-market strategies. 
During the second half of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016, we experienced an increased volume of new domain name registrations, primarily from our registrars in China. The volume or these new registrations has been inconsistent and periodic compared to prior periods and by the end of the first quarter of 2016, reverted back to a more normalized registration pace. Also, as discussed for the last 3 quarters, we still expect the fourth quarter of 2016 to be somewhat unique as the value of domain name registrations up for renewal the volume of domain name registrations up for renewal in the quarter will have a larger than normal percentage of first-time renewing registrations as a result of the strong performance during Q3 and Q4 of 2015. 
While it's difficult to assess what the renewal characteristics of these registrations will be due to the large upcoming Q4 2016 expiring base, we still expect fourth quarter deletions to be elevated, with many of these deletions occurring towards the end of the fourth quarter. Based on these and other factors, we expect the full year 2016 domain name base growth range of between 1% and 2%, despite a net increase -- a net decreased to the domain name base of between 1.5 million and 2.8 million registrations in the fourth quarter. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to George."

During the quarter, 58% of our revenue was from customers in the U.S. and 42% was from international customers. GAAP operating income in the third quarter totaled $175 million, up 13.2% from $154 million in the third quarter of 2015. The GAAP operating margin in the quarter came to 60.8% compared to 58.1% in the same quarter a year ago. GAAP net income totaled $114 million compared to $92 million a year earlier, which produced diluted GAAP earnings per share of $0.90 in the third quarter this year compared to $0.70 for the third quarter last year. 
As of September 30, 2016, the company maintained total assets of $2.3 billion and total liabilities of $3.5 billion. Assets included $1.8 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $421 million were held domestically with the remainder held abroad. 
I'll now review some additional third quarter metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, diluted share count, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2016 full year guidance. 
Third quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $13 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $100 million as compared to $99 million in the second quarter of 2016 and $99 million in the same quarter a year ago. Non-GAAP operating margin for the third quarter was 65.3% compared to 62.7% in the same quarter of 2015. 
Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter was $119 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.93 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 127.7 million shares. This compares to $0.78 in the third quarter of 2015 and $0.91 last quarter based on 131.7 million and 130.6 million weighted average diluted shares, respectively. 
Dilution related to the convertible debenture was 20.8 million shares based on the average share price during the third quarter compared with 18 million for the same quarter in 2015 and 21.9 million shares last quarter. The share count was reduced by the full effect of the second quarter 2016 repurchase activity and the weighted effect of the 2.2 million shares repurchased during the third quarter. Operating cash flow was $168 million and free cash flow was $165 million for the third quarter, compared with $155 million and $157 million, respectively, for the third quarter last year. 
With respect to full year 2016 guidance, revenue for 2016 is now expected to be in the range of $1,135,000,000 to $1,140,000,000 representing an annual growth rate of approximately 7% to 7.5%. This revenue guidance is narrowed from the $1,130,000,000 to $1,140,000,000 range given on our last earnings call. Full year 2016 non-GAAP operating margin is now expected to be between 63.5% and 64.5%, increased from the 62.5% to 64% range provided during the last call. 
Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is still expected to be an expense of between $110 million and $116 million. Capital expenditures for the year are now expected to be between $30 million and $35 million, decreased from the $35 million and $45 million range given on our last call. Cash taxes for the year are still expected to be between $10 million and $20 million. Substantially all of the expected cash taxes in 2016 are international, primarily as a result of domestic tax attributes, including cash tax benefits from our convertible debentures. 
In summary, the company continue to demonstrate sound financial performance during the third quarter of 2016. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

So the next renewal cycle for .com will be in 2024, not in 2018. Third, the Root Zone Maintainer portion of the transition is now complete, as VeriSign will continue the Root Zone Maintenance function. It has historically performed, but now under a new contract called the RZMA between VeriSign and ICANN. Fourth, there are 2 amendments to the Cooperative Agreement between VeriSign and NTIA. Amendment 33 discharges VeriSign from its Root Zone Maintenance responsibilities and Amendment 34 approved the extension of the .com agreement to 2024 and gives NTIA the right to extend the Cooperative Agreement past its current expiration of 2018. It also allows NTIA to conduct a public interest review for purposes of making the extension decision. And also, VeriSign still has the right, I would point out, under Amendment 32, to seek removal of the pricing restrictions in .com registry agreement if we demonstrate to department that market conditions no longer warrant such restrictions.

I can tell you that we agreed to work with NTIA as they go through their process and make the decision. However, I would point out one thing, which is that if there's a change to or a termination of or expiration of the Cooperative Agreement, the .com registry agreement itself contains something called the Cooperation Clause that states that VeriSign and ICANN will negotiate in good faith to amend the terms of the registry agreement, .com registry agreement, as necessary for consistency with changes to or expiration of the Cooperative Agreement.

Essentially, the DOC is not in the picture if the Cooperative Agreement is allowed to sunset. So having said that, I would say that trying to determine what that would yield, I think, would be speculating but I would observe that ICANN's policies at least are fairly consistent in how they apply pricing across TLD, certainly since the new gTLD program. There are number of legacy TLDs, of course, like .com and .net and .org and others, but it's just difficult to speculate on a process that only gets invoked under a set of circumstances that are 2 years away. I think the main point is that the pricing imposed on .com since at least since 2006 has come directly from DOC. So that mechanism goes away.

I look at the 9 months on a non-GAAP basis, expenses in total are down a little bit. You're correct there. But we're seeing some movement between the groups. So we've seen an increase in our cost of goods sold. We've got more labor going on there. Sales and marketing, we've talked about that. It's been lower, but we do have an intention to put more money to work there and I would think that's really more of a timing function. R&D is down. We have reduced labor there. As, we talked about last quarter, I believe, we did close our Indian Development Corporation over there last year, so we're getting some benefit from the liberal perspective through the P&L at the present time. And then G&A is up a little bit, we do have some certainly higher labor and we've incurred some higher legal cost this quarter. As far as your questions to sustainability, we really try to manage the total expense of the company, the entire $400 million number on an annual basis. And we try to allocate those dollars to where they are. Clearly, we try to gain efficiencies but at the same time, we're not starving the business. And as you know, our business is relatively dynamic as the cyber environment continues to evolve. We absolutely want to make sure we put enough resources into maintaining security and stability of the business.

I'm pleased to report another solid third quarter for VeriSign. Third quarter results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders. 
Before I get into the third quarter results, I want to comment on 2 areas of focus for the company. First, last week, VeriSign issued an 8-K detailing the completion of the Root Zone Maintainer Service Agreement or RZMA and the .com Registry Agreement extension amendment. The RZMA between VeriSign and ICANN is now effective, and VeriSign has been discharged from those responsibilities under the cooperative agreement. Additionally, NTIA approved the .com extension which extends the .com Registry Agreement between VeriSign and ICANN until November 30, 2024, to coincide with the term of the RZMA. VeriSign agreed to cooperate with NTIA as it determines whether to exercise their right to extend the term of the Cooperative Agreement before it expires on November 30, 2018. 
Second, as we stated earlier this year, a significant part of our corporate strategy for 2016 was to evaluate for acquisition top level domains that are currently in operation and those that have not yet been awarded. Consistent with this strategy, as announced in August, VeriSign entered into an agreement for the future assignment of the .web TLD. While there's still steps that need to occur before we become the registry operator for .web, we are excited about the .web opportunity as we believe that we are well positioned to make it successful. 
I'll comment now on third quarter operating highlights. We reported revenue of $288 million, up 8.2% year-over-year, and we delivered strong financial performance, including $165 million in free cash flow. We ended the third quarter with 144.1 million .com and .net domain name registrations in the domain name base. 
Our financial position is strong with $1.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. As a part of managing our business, during the third quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 2.2 million shares for $177 million. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. 
At the end of September, the domain name base in .com and .net was 144.1 million, consisting of 128.4 million .com registrations and 15.8 million .net registrations. This represents an increase of 6.6% year-over-year and a net increase of 0.9 million domain name registrations from the end of the second quarter. During the quarter, we processed 8.3 million new registrations. 
In the second quarter of 2016, the renewal rate was 73.8% compared with 72.7% for the same quarter of 2015. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the third quarter of 2016 will be approximately 72.3%. This preliminary rate compares favorably to 71.9% achieved in the third quarter of 2015. 
There are many factors that drive domain growth. These include, but are not limited to, Internet adoption, economic activity, e-commerce activity and registrar go-to-market strategies. During the second half of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016, we experienced an increased volume of new domain name registrations, primarily from our registrars in China. The volume of these new registrations has been inconsistent and periodic compared to prior periods and, by the end of the first quarter of 2016, reverted back to a more normalized registration pace. 
Also, as discussed for the last 3 quarters, we still expect the fourth quarter of 2016 to be somewhat unique, as the value of domain name registrations up for renewal, the volume of domain name registrations up for renewal in the quarter will have a larger-than-normal percentage of first-time renewing registrations as a result of the strong performance during Q3 and Q4 of 2015. While it's difficult to assess what the renewal characteristics of these registrations will be due to the large upcoming Q4 2016 expiring base, we still expect fourth quarter deletions to be elevated, with many of these deletions occurring towards the end of the fourth quarter. Based on these and other factors, we expect the full year 2016 domain name base growth range of between 1% and 2%, despite a net increase to the -- a net decrease to the domain name base of between 1.5 million and 2.8 million registrations in the fourth quarter. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to George."

During the quarter, 58% of our revenue was from customers in the U.S. and 42% was from international customers. GAAP operating income in the third quarter totaled $175 million, up 13.2% from $154 million in the third quarter of 2015. The GAAP operating margin in the quarter came to 60.8% compared to 58.1% in the same quarter a year ago. GAAP net income totaled $114 million compared to $92 million a year earlier, which produced diluted GAAP earnings per share of $0.90 in the third quarter this year compared to $0.70 for the third quarter last year. 
As of September 30, 2016, the company maintained total assets of $2.3 billion and total liabilities of $3.5 billion. Assets included $1.8 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $421 million were held domestically, with the remainder held abroad. 
I'll now review some additional third quarter metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, diluted share count, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2016 full year guidance. 
Third quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $13 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $100 million as compared to $99 million in the second quarter of 2016 and $99 million in the same quarter a year ago. Non-GAAP operating margin for the third quarter was 65.3% compared to 62.7% in the same quarter of 2015. 
Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter was $119 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.93 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 127.7 million shares. This compares to $0.78 in the third quarter of 2015 and $0.91 last quarter based on 131.7 million and 130.6 million weighted average diluted shares, respectively. 
Dilution related to the convertible debenture was 20.8 million shares based on the average share price during the third quarter compared with 18 million for the same quarter in 2015 and 21.9 million shares last quarter. The share count was reduced by the full effect of the second quarter 2016 repurchase activity and the weighted effect of the 2.2 million shares repurchased during the third quarter. 
Operating cash flow was $168 million and free cash flow was $165 million for the third quarter compared with $155 million and $157 million, respectively, for the third quarter last year. 
With respect to full year 2016 guidance, revenue for 2016 is now expected to be in the range of $1,135,000,000 to $1,140,000,000, representing an annual growth rate of approximately 7% to 7.5%. This revenue guidance is narrowed from the $1,130,000,000 to $1,140,000,000 range given on our last earnings call. Full year 2016 non-GAAP operating margin is now expected to be between 63.5% and 64.5%, increased from the 62.5% to 64% range provided during the last call. 
Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is still expected to be an expense of between $110 million and $116 million. 
Capital expenditures for the year are now expected to be between $30 million and $35 million, decreased from the $35 million and $45 million range given on our last call. Cash taxes for the year are still expected to be between $10 million and $20 million. Substantially all of the expected cash taxes in 2016 are international, primarily as a result of domestic tax attributes, including cash tax benefits from our convertible debentures. In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the third quarter of 2016. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

So the next renewal cycle for .com will be in 2024, not in 2018. Third, the Root Zone Maintainer portion of the transition is now complete as VeriSign will continue the Root Zone Maintenance function it has historically performed, but now under a new contract called the RZMA between VeriSign and ICANN. Fourth, there are 2 amendments to the Cooperative Agreement between VeriSign and NTIA. Amendment 33 discharges VeriSign from its Root Zone Maintenance responsibilities, and Amendment 34 approved the extension of the .com agreement to 2024 and gives NTIA the right to extend the Cooperative Agreement past its current expiration of 2018. It also allows NTIA to conduct a public interest review for purposes of making the extension decision. And also, VeriSign still has the right, I would point out, under Amendment 32, to seek removal of the pricing restrictions in the com registry agreement if we demonstrate to the department that market conditions no longer warrant such restrictions. Those are the basic factual changes in all of these various events of the last 30 days or so."

I can tell you that we agreed to work with NTIA as they go through their process and make the decision. However, I would point out one thing, which is that if there's a change to or a termination of or expiration of the Cooperative Agreement, the com registry agreement itself contains something called the cooperation clause that states that VeriSign and ICANN will negotiate in good faith to amend the terms of the registry agreement, the com registry agreement, as necessary, for consistency with changes to or expiration of the Cooperative Agreement.

Essentially, the DOC is not in the picture if the Cooperative Agreement is allowed to sunset. So having said that, I would say that trying to determine what that will yield, I think, would be speculating. But I would observe that ICANN's policies at least are fairly consistent in how they've applied pricing across TLD, certainly since the new gTLD program. There are a number of legacy TLDs, of course, like .com and .net and .org and others. But it's just difficult to speculate on a process that only gets invoked under a set of circumstances that are 2 years away. And I think the main point is, is that the pricing imposed on .com since -- at least since 2006 has come directly from DOC. So that mechanism goes away. But in terms of what happens and who has the authority, it's a good-faith negotiation between VeriSign and ICANN. That much is factual."

I mean when you talk about year-over-year, you're looking at the third quarter, and I think it's probably more appropriate to look at the 9 months because things can move from quarter-to-quarter. When I look at the 9 months, on a non-GAAP basis, expenses in total are down a little bit. You're correct there. But we're seeing some movement in between the groups. So we've seen an increase in our cost of goods sold. We've got more labor going on there. Sales and marketing, we've talked about that. It's been lower, but we do have an intention to put more money to work there, and I would think that's really more of a timing function. R&D is down. We have reduced labor there. We -- as we talked about last quarter, I believe, we did close our Indian development corporation over there last year, and so we're getting some benefits from a labor perspective through the P&L at the present time. And then G&A is up a little bit. We do have some subtly higher labor, and we've incurred some higher legal costs this quarter. As far as your questions to the sustainability, we really try to manage the total expense of the company, the entire $400 million number on an annual basis, and we try to allocate those dollars to where they are. Clearly, we try to gain efficiencies, but, at the same time, we're not starving the business. And as you know, our business is relatively dynamic. As the cyber environment continues to evolve, we absolutely want to make sure we put enough resources into maintaining the security and stability of the business. So we'll continue to be vigilant on that, but to date, they've -- we've done a good job at keeping them in the range where they've been historically."

I'm pleased to report another solid third quarter for VeriSign.

I'm pleased to report another solid third quarter for VeriSign. Third quarter results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders. 
Before I get into the third quarter results, I want to comment on 2 areas of focus for the company. First, last week, VeriSign issued an 8-K detailing the completion of the Root Zone Maintainer Service Agreement or RZMA and the .com Registry Agreement extension amendment. The RZMA between VeriSign and ICANN is now effective, and VeriSign has been discharged from those responsibilities under the cooperative agreement. Additionally, NTIA approved the .com extension which extends the .com Registry Agreement between VeriSign and ICANN until November 30, 2024, to coincide with the term of the RZMA. VeriSign agreed to cooperate with NTIA as it determines whether to exercise their right to extend the term of the Cooperative Agreement before it expires on November 30, 2018. 
Second, as we stated earlier this year, a significant part of our corporate strategy for 2016 was to evaluate for acquisition top level domains that are currently in operation and those that have not yet been awarded. Consistent with this strategy, as announced in August, VeriSign entered into an agreement for the future assignment of the .web TLD. While there's still steps that need to occur before we become the registry operator for .web, we are excited about the .web opportunity as we believe that we are well positioned to make it successful. 
I'll comment now on third quarter operating highlights. We reported revenue of $288 million, up 8.2% year-over-year, and we delivered strong financial performance, including $165 million in free cash flow. We ended the third quarter with 144.1 million .com and .net domain name registrations in the domain name base. 
Our financial position is strong with $1.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. As a part of managing our business, during the third quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 2.2 million shares for $177 million. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. 
At the end of September, the domain name base in .com and .net was 144.1 million, consisting of 128.4 million .com registrations and 15.8 million .net registrations. This represents an increase of 6.6% year-over-year and a net increase of 0.9 million domain name registrations from the end of the second quarter. During the quarter, we processed 8.3 million new registrations. 
In the second quarter of 2016, the renewal rate was 73.8% compared with 72.7% for the same quarter of 2015. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the third quarter of 2016 will be approximately 72.3%. This preliminary rate compares favorably to 71.9% achieved in the third quarter of 2015. 
There are many factors that drive domain growth. These include, but are not limited to, Internet adoption, economic activity, e-commerce activity and registrar go-to-market strategies. During the second half of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016, we experienced an increased volume of new domain name registrations, primarily from our registrars in China. The volume of these new registrations has been inconsistent and periodic compared to prior periods and, by the end of the first quarter of 2016, reverted back to a more normalized registration pace. 
Also, as discussed for the last 3 quarters, we still expect the fourth quarter of 2016 to be somewhat unique, as the value of domain name registrations up for renewal, the volume of domain name registrations up for renewal in the quarter will have a larger-than-normal percentage of first-time renewing registrations as a result of the strong performance during Q3 and Q4 of 2015. While it's difficult to assess what the renewal characteristics of these registrations will be due to the large upcoming Q4 2016 expiring base, we still expect fourth quarter deletions to be elevated, with many of these deletions occurring towards the end of the fourth quarter. Based on these and other factors, we expect the full year 2016 domain name base growth range of between 1% and 2%, despite a net increase to the -- a net decrease to the domain name base of between 1.5 million and 2.8 million registrations in the fourth quarter. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to George."

During the quarter, 58% of our revenue was from customers in the U.S. and 42% was from international customers. GAAP operating income in the third quarter totaled $175 million, up 13.2% from $154 million in the third quarter of 2015. The GAAP operating margin in the quarter came to 60.8% compared to 58.1% in the same quarter a year ago. GAAP net income totaled $114 million compared to $92 million a year earlier, which produced diluted GAAP earnings per share of $0.90 in the third quarter this year compared to $0.70 for the third quarter last year. 
As of September 30, 2016, the company maintained total assets of $2.3 billion and total liabilities of $3.5 billion. Assets included $1.8 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $421 million were held domestically, with the remainder held abroad. 
I'll now review some additional third quarter metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, diluted share count, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2016 full year guidance. 
Third quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $13 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $100 million as compared to $99 million in the second quarter of 2016 and $99 million in the same quarter a year ago. Non-GAAP operating margin for the third quarter was 65.3% compared to 62.7% in the same quarter of 2015. 
Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter was $119 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.93 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 127.7 million shares. This compares to $0.78 in the third quarter of 2015 and $0.91 last quarter based on 131.7 million and 130.6 million weighted average diluted shares, respectively. 
Dilution related to the convertible debenture was 20.8 million shares based on the average share price during the third quarter compared with 18 million for the same quarter in 2015 and 21.9 million shares last quarter. The share count was reduced by the full effect of the second quarter 2016 repurchase activity and the weighted effect of the 2.2 million shares repurchased during the third quarter. 
Operating cash flow was $168 million and free cash flow was $165 million for the third quarter compared with $155 million and $157 million, respectively, for the third quarter last year. 
With respect to full year 2016 guidance, revenue for 2016 is now expected to be in the range of $1,135,000,000 to $1,140,000,000, representing an annual growth rate of approximately 7% to 7.5%. This revenue guidance is narrowed from the $1,130,000,000 to $1,140,000,000 range given on our last earnings call. Full year 2016 non-GAAP operating margin is now expected to be between 63.5% and 64.5%, increased from the 62.5% to 64% range provided during the last call. 
Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is still expected to be an expense of between $110 million and $116 million. 
Capital expenditures for the year are now expected to be between $30 million and $35 million, decreased from the $35 million and $45 million range given on our last call. Cash taxes for the year are still expected to be between $10 million and $20 million. Substantially all of the expected cash taxes in 2016 are international, primarily as a result of domestic tax attributes, including cash tax benefits from our convertible debentures. In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the third quarter of 2016. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

So the next renewal cycle for .com will be in 2024, not in 2018. Third, the Root Zone Maintainer portion of the transition is now complete as VeriSign will continue the Root Zone Maintenance function it has historically performed, but now under a new contract called the RZMA between VeriSign and ICANN. Fourth, there are 2 amendments to the Cooperative Agreement between VeriSign and NTIA. Amendment 33 discharges VeriSign from its Root Zone Maintenance responsibilities, and Amendment 34 approved the extension of the .com agreement to 2024 and gives NTIA the right to extend the Cooperative Agreement past its current expiration of 2018. It also allows NTIA to conduct a public interest review for purposes of making the extension decision. And also, VeriSign still has the right, I would point out, under Amendment 32, to seek removal of the pricing restrictions in the com registry agreement if we demonstrate to the department that market conditions no longer warrant such restrictions. Those are the basic factual changes in all of these various events of the last 30 days or so."

I can tell you that we agreed to work with NTIA as they go through their process and make the decision. However, I would point out one thing, which is that if there's a change to or a termination of or expiration of the Cooperative Agreement, the com registry agreement itself contains something called the cooperation clause that states that VeriSign and ICANN will negotiate in good faith to amend the terms of the registry agreement, the com registry agreement, as necessary, for consistency with changes to or expiration of the Cooperative Agreement.

Essentially, the DOC is not in the picture if the Cooperative Agreement is allowed to sunset. So having said that, I would say that trying to determine what that will yield, I think, would be speculating. But I would observe that ICANN's policies at least are fairly consistent in how they've applied pricing across TLD, certainly since the new gTLD program. There are a number of legacy TLDs, of course, like .com and .net and .org and others. But it's just difficult to speculate on a process that only gets invoked under a set of circumstances that are 2 years away. And I think the main point is, is that the pricing imposed on .com since -- at least since 2006 has come directly from DOC. So that mechanism goes away.

I mean when you talk about year-over-year, you're looking at the third quarter, and I think it's probably more appropriate to look at the 9 months because things can move from quarter-to-quarter. When I look at the 9 months, on a non-GAAP basis, expenses in total are down a little bit. You're correct there. But we're seeing some movement in between the groups. So we've seen an increase in our cost of goods sold. We've got more labor going on there. Sales and marketing, we've talked about that. It's been lower, but we do have an intention to put more money to work there, and I always think that's really more of a timing function. R&D is down. We have reduced labor there. We -- as we talked about last quarter, I believe, we did close our Indian development corporation over there last year, and so we're getting some benefits from a labor perspective through the P&L at the present time. And then G&A is up a little bit. We do have some subtly higher labor, and we've incurred some higher legal costs this quarter. As far as your questions to the sustainability, we really try to manage the total expense of the company, the entire $400 million number on an annual basis, and we try to allocate those dollars to where they are. Clearly, we try to gain efficiencies, but, at the same time, we're not starving the business. And as you know, our business is relatively dynamic. As the cyber environment continues to evolve, we absolutely want to make sure we put enough resources into maintaining the security and stability of the business. So we'll continue to be vigilant on that, but to date, they've -- we've done a good job at keeping them in the range where they've been historically."

I'm pleased to report another solid third quarter for VeriSign.

I'm pleased to report another solid third quarter for VeriSign. Third quarter results were in line with our objectives of offering security and stability to our customers while generating profitable growth and providing long-term value to our shareholders. 
Before I get into the third quarter results, I want to comment on 2 areas of focus for the company. First, last week, VeriSign issued an 8-K detailing the completion of the Root Zone Maintainer Service Agreement or RZMA and the .com Registry Agreement extension amendment. The RZMA between VeriSign and ICANN is now effective, and VeriSign has been discharged from those responsibilities under the cooperative agreement. Additionally, NTIA approved the .com extension which extends the .com Registry Agreement between VeriSign and ICANN until November 30, 2024, to coincide with the term of the RZMA. VeriSign agreed to cooperate with NTIA as it determines whether to exercise their right to extend the term of the Cooperative Agreement before it expires on November 30, 2018. 
Second, as we stated earlier this year, a significant part of our corporate strategy for 2016 was to evaluate for acquisition top level domains that are currently in operation and those that have not yet been awarded. Consistent with this strategy, as announced in August, VeriSign entered into an agreement for the future assignment of the .web TLD. While there's still steps that need to occur before we become the registry operator for .web, we are excited about the .web opportunity as we believe that we are well positioned to make it successful. 
I'll comment now on third quarter operating highlights. We reported revenue of $288 million, up 8.2% year-over-year, and we delivered strong financial performance, including $165 million in free cash flow. We ended the third quarter with 144.1 million .com and .net domain name registrations in the domain name base. 
Our financial position is strong with $1.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the quarter. As a part of managing our business, during the third quarter, we continued our share repurchase program by repurchasing 2.2 million shares for $177 million. We continually evaluate the overall cash and investing needs of the business and consider the best uses for our cash, including potential share repurchases. 
At the end of September, the domain name base in .com and .net was 144.1 million, consisting of 128.4 million .com registrations and 15.8 million .net registrations. This represents an increase of 6.6% year-over-year and a net increase of 0.9 million domain name registrations from the end of the second quarter. During the quarter, we processed 8.3 million new registrations. 
In the second quarter of 2016, the renewal rate was 73.8% compared with 72.7% for the same quarter of 2015. While renewal rates are not fully measurable until 45 days after the end of the quarter, we believe that the renewal rate for the third quarter of 2016 will be approximately 72.3%. This preliminary rate compares favorably to 71.9% achieved in the third quarter of 2015. 
There are many factors that drive domain growth. These include, but are not limited to, Internet adoption, economic activity, e-commerce activity and registrar go-to-market strategies. During the second half of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016, we experienced an increased volume of new domain name registrations, primarily from our registrars in China. The volume of these new registrations has been inconsistent and periodic compared to prior periods and, by the end of the first quarter of 2016, reverted back to a more normalized registration pace. 
Also, as discussed for the last 3 quarters, we still expect the fourth quarter of 2016 to be somewhat unique, as the value of domain name registrations up for renewal, the volume of domain name registrations up for renewal in the quarter will have a larger-than-normal percentage of first-time renewing registrations as a result of the strong performance during Q3 and Q4 of 2015. While it's difficult to assess what the renewal characteristics of these registrations will be due to the large upcoming Q4 2016 expiring base, we still expect fourth quarter deletions to be elevated, with many of these deletions occurring towards the end of the fourth quarter. Based on these and other factors, we expect the full year 2016 domain name base growth range of between 1% and 2%, despite a net increase to the -- a net decrease to the domain name base of between 1.5 million and 2.8 million registrations in the fourth quarter. 
Now I'd like to turn the call over to George."

During the quarter, 58% of our revenue was from customers in the U.S. and 42% was from international customers. GAAP operating income in the third quarter totaled $175 million, up 13.2% from $154 million in the third quarter of 2015. The GAAP operating margin in the quarter came to 60.8% compared to 58.1% in the same quarter a year ago. GAAP net income totaled $114 million compared to $92 million a year earlier, which produced diluted GAAP earnings per share of $0.90 in the third quarter this year compared to $0.70 for the third quarter last year. 
As of September 30, 2016, the company maintained total assets of $2.3 billion and total liabilities of $3.5 billion. Assets included $1.8 billion of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, of which $421 million were held domestically, with the remainder held abroad. 
I'll now review some additional third quarter metrics, which include non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP earnings per share, diluted share count, operating cash flow and free cash flow. I will then discuss our 2016 full year guidance. 
Third quarter non-GAAP operating expense, which excludes $13 million of stock-based compensation, totaled $100 million as compared to $99 million in the second quarter of 2016 and $99 million in the same quarter a year ago. Non-GAAP operating margin for the third quarter was 65.3% compared to 62.7% in the same quarter of 2015. 
Non-GAAP net income for the third quarter was $119 million, resulting in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.93 based on a weighted average diluted share count of 127.7 million shares. This compares to $0.78 in the third quarter of 2015 and $0.91 last quarter based on 131.7 million and 130.6 million weighted average diluted shares, respectively. 
Dilution related to the convertible debenture was 20.8 million shares based on the average share price during the third quarter compared with 18 million for the same quarter in 2015 and 21.9 million shares last quarter. The share count was reduced by the full effect of the second quarter 2016 repurchase activity and the weighted effect of the 2.2 million shares repurchased during the third quarter. 
Operating cash flow was $168 million and free cash flow was $165 million for the third quarter compared with $155 million and $157 million, respectively, for the third quarter last year. 
With respect to full year 2016 guidance, revenue for 2016 is now expected to be in the range of $1,135,000,000 to $1,140,000,000, representing an annual growth rate of approximately 7% to 7.5%. This revenue guidance is narrowed from the $1,130,000,000 to $1,140,000,000 range given on our last earnings call. Full year 2016 non-GAAP operating margin is now expected to be between 63.5% and 64.5%, increased from the 62.5% to 64% range provided during the last call. 
Our non-GAAP interest expense and non-GAAP nonoperating income net is still expected to be an expense of between $110 million and $116 million. 
Capital expenditures for the year are now expected to be between $30 million and $35 million, decreased from the $35 million and $45 million range given on our last call. Cash taxes for the year are still expected to be between $10 million and $20 million. Substantially all of the expected cash taxes in 2016 are international, primarily as a result of domestic tax attributes, including cash tax benefits from our convertible debentures. In summary, the company continued to demonstrate sound financial performance during the third quarter of 2016. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his closing remarks."

So the next renewal cycle for .com will be in 2024, not in 2018. Third, the Root Zone Maintainer portion of the transition is now complete as VeriSign will continue the Root Zone Maintenance function it has historically performed, but now under a new contract called the RZMA between VeriSign and ICANN. Fourth, there are 2 amendments to the Cooperative Agreement between VeriSign and NTIA. Amendment 33 discharges VeriSign from its Root Zone Maintenance responsibilities, and Amendment 34 approved the extension of the .com agreement to 2024 and gives NTIA the right to extend the Cooperative Agreement past its current expiration of 2018. It also allows NTIA to conduct a public interest review for purposes of making the extension decision. And also, VeriSign still has the right, I would point out, under Amendment 32, to seek removal of the pricing restrictions in the com registry agreement if we demonstrate to the department that market conditions no longer warrant such restrictions. Those are the basic factual changes in all of these various events of the last 30 days or so."

I can tell you that we agreed to work with NTIA as they go through their process and make the decision. However, I would point out one thing, which is that if there's a change to or a termination of or expiration of the Cooperative Agreement, the com registry agreement itself contains something called the cooperation clause that states that VeriSign and ICANN will negotiate in good faith to amend the terms of the registry agreement, the com registry agreement, as necessary, for consistency with changes to or expiration of the Cooperative Agreement.

Essentially, the DOC is not in the picture if the Cooperative Agreement is allowed to sunset. So having said that, I would say that trying to determine what that will yield, I think, would be speculating. But I would observe that ICANN's policies at least are fairly consistent in how they've applied pricing across TLD, certainly since the new gTLD program. There are a number of legacy TLDs, of course, like .com and .net and .org and others. But it's just difficult to speculate on a process that only gets invoked under a set of circumstances that are 2 years away. And I think the main point is, is that the pricing imposed on .com since -- at least since 2006 has come directly from DOC. So that mechanism goes away.

When I look at the 9 months, on a non-GAAP basis, expenses in total are down a little bit. You're correct there. But we're seeing some movement in between the groups. So we've seen an increase in our cost of goods sold. We've got more labor going on there. Sales and marketing, we've talked about that. It's been lower, but we do have an intention to put more money to work there, and I always think that's really more of a timing function. R&D is down. We have reduced labor there. We -- as we talked about last quarter, I believe, we did close our Indian development corporation over there last year, and so we're getting some benefits from a labor perspective through the P&L at the present time. And then G&A is up a little bit. We do have some subtly higher labor, and we've incurred some higher legal costs this quarter. As far as your questions to the sustainability, we really try to manage the total expense of the company, the entire $400 million number on an annual basis, and we try to allocate those dollars to where they are. Clearly, we try to gain efficiencies, but, at the same time, we're not starving the business. And as you know, our business is relatively dynamic. As the cyber environment continues to evolve, we absolutely want to make sure we put enough resources into maintaining the security and stability of the business.
