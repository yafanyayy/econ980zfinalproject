Lots of reasons for that. Always had to pin them down, but general excitement, absolutely, yes. If you take a look at some of our polished materials, you'll see that the average rate that consumers have seen over the last year regardless of channel, agency and direct is about 4%, which I would tell you to think more in those terms than specific rate changes. So 4% which means a good number of our consumers are still seeing rate changes that are on the high side of that. So as we mature into the rate revisions that we're now becoming even more comfortable with and rate levels that we're becoming more comfortable with, I would look forward to seeing, while continued positives, maybe not quite in the forward range, but a closer distribution or tighter distribution around the average. So we will potentially benefit even more so on retention without losing those higher end or the right-hand distribution around the average of 4 last year. So really nice movement, getting our new product into the marketplace, getting the rate level that we feel very comfortable with, maintaining that. You might remember we said at our IR meeting, we have a strong preference for 3 1% changes than 1 3% change, all of that really is a big part of how we're trying to make sure that retention is front and center and all of our thinking. So nice to see it coming through. Frankly, I'll tell you I'll be disappointed in that didn't continue."

Over the past 6, you say you guys have announced you've been rolling out a new smartphone app and I think it's in the last annual meeting you walked us through, that you were iterating the pricing design to add discounts upfront. And I guess I was curious, just want a bit of an update on how many states you've rolled these things out with and as well as more importantly, what's then the consumer response? I guess, both from the app, which feels like a different customer interface and it's kind of a question of adoption and comfort and sort of more open ended questions about that, how consumers like the app and whether perhaps something will sell. And then separately, from a discount standpoint, what kind of lift did you see from this? Is there impact in conversion rates or maybe on new sales?"

Starting into this year, we're still seeing our policies initiated with a Snapshot influence discount, whatever it might be, to be faster than the rates of growth that you're seeing as we report on aggregate. So it's still our fastest-growing sector, that remains true for a long time, but certainly, even into January, that was true. Starting to get a feel for what's sort of mix of business is attainable. So I just gave you a quick look here, not to confuse you with any numbers but in our direct book of business, where we've been able to offer Snapshot and realistically, there's only 2 states now, California and North Carolina, where we're not offering it. But over a period of time, where the cohort or the Snapshot has been available, that cohort of business is now approximating about 40% of the direct business for places where it was available for some period of time. So think in terms of, can the little train really take momentum, we're looking to sort of 40% to 50% in the direct channel. Think I've told you before the acceptance in the direct channel far exceeds the agency channel and with the new changes we made, it was very clear that we were hoping to see agency uptake on the -- or the quotes include Snapshot with that discount being
[Audio Gap]
what I'd call overly dramatic movement, but significant on the small base. Actually, we have some good news to report there. We have actually introduced into 2 hot -- what I'll call higher average premium states: Florida, Louisiana. And we've seen the agent acceptance rates there or the agent penetration into new app, new coding, actually go up significantly. So probably approximating somewhere in the league of 1/2 to 2/3, the rate on our direct channels. So starting to make some correction there. And we're going to take a closer look, I think we did a better job of rolling that out through agents in those states. We'll take a closer look if what we did well there and make sure that we reinforce that in other places in the country. So net-net, pretty good sized penetration in our direct book and I don't want to project what the threshold might be as to overall penetration. But to think in terms of more than half the book is not unreasonable based on what we've experienced to date and now we're starting to see opportunities where the agency business perhaps is, yes, slower, but certainly starting to close some part of that gap. So good stuff there. 
With regard to the app, we've discussed that. I want to make it very clear that we've had apps that have approximated in one way, shape or form the activity -- for some time. That's not being an issue. The issue is really making sure we had an app that we felt had the data integrity that really match with the dongle and we got to the point where we actually have that application and very comfortable with it. And they're all sorts of stories that some of which are not as close to as others, but you need to be able to determine the difference between a train ride and a plane ride and the car ride. You need to know was the person got in the left door, the right door, are they driving, are they passenger. All those sorts of things are actually very important to us. So it's easy enough to create an app that does part of the job. It's very hard to create an app that does -- or gives us the level of integrity that we'd be comfortable swapping out for the information we get for the dongle. We think we're there. Unfortunately, it's probably going to take us a little over to get there in the marketplace than we might like. There's a fair amount of work to do on the IT side. But certainly in '16, we expect to see that roll out, but in maybe 4 or 5 isn't large numbers later in the year. 
I think we probably mentioned, we have a relationship with GM and Armstar that's been a little bit delayed, but we expect to be marketing that more actively in about the midyear time frame. So Snapshot, for lots of reasons, continues to be something very important to us, not only as an indicator of the source of everything that we think we'll do more of in the future, but it's really taking hold and you'll know the power of Snapshot relative to a rating variable. So ultimately, when we start to talk about penetration numbers that are really in the range of that 40%, perhaps even 50%, it makes different sometimes in segmentation. So we couldn't be more happy with what we see. I just don't know what the high watermark will be, but we're going to find out. And I hope it's really high."

And maybe I'll double team here with Trish here on a couple of points. Platinum is what we're talking about. And this is, in short, I don't want to repeat the things that were already written down, but in short, is a way that ASI property business and Progressive come to the market looking as if they are simply 1. So let's not worry about the brand names, but the agents are seeing that as Platinum, we're in 12 states. We expect to be in an additional 22 this year. So that will give us some really nice penetration. Our goal is simple. Our goal is to be a valid and the most significant choice inside the agency channel for those customers who want to bundle their auto and home together. We're comfortable to face that either way, but we really like the bundles. ASI is seeing about 50% now of their new quote volume being bundled. So we really -- we're not getting the curtail in any way, shape or form monoline of either, but our real interest is in the bundle. We know what the effect of long-term retention there can be. So those things are great. Our interest is making sure on the agency channel, we offer a really viable option and a, as I put it, must-have solution for agents. We know we've got a great order of product. I don't think we need to dispute on that. We have ASI, we have a great homeowners product. We're going to work together to put that into a great package. And there's still work to be done. So we don't think we're across the finish line. We probably never got across the finish line. We can always make it better. And on the direct side, while ASI is not a bigger player on the direct side, that's obviously a future option that we have for going forward. Tricia, maybe you could talk a little bit about the sales force and how we're in the sales force to make sure that we get the message out as well as possible."

And then we had to have both an agent and a customer value proposition. So we know we need to add more commission for these preferred customers, match policy terms and then as we started to talk with our ASI partner, we realized we really needed to combine sales forces and have very specific sales reps that work with our Platinum agents. So we've just done that recently. We're very excited about that. And we continue to -- like we have 12 states out. We have continued to understand where we're competitive, we we're not, what we need to do, and I think agents understand that. We really want to make sure that we reward our agents not just with more commission, but with preference. So when they choose us as #1 or 2. In fact, just this week, John Sauerland and I were able to make some calls to agents that have reached some certain levels. We have hurdles to get over, determining how many bundles that you have in your agency. So while the data set with 12 states, I would consider 2016 really the year of execution, understanding more and more about, again, how to get that low pure premium business and on how to integrate the right sales force with these very specific agents."

And that was really the driver of why our reserves developed so favorably in 2015. When we think ahead and going forward, we don't anticipate long-term severity will continue to be negative like that. So if we look at what we actually have booked in our reserving model amount we're anticipating roughly a 4% severity going forward on liability. Now that will include BI, PD, et cetera. So if you do all those cuts by state and by line, most of them are in the 2% to 6% range. But overall, it was about 4%. When I look at commercial lines, it is about 9%. Some of that is overly to mix changes in the business marketing targets we have. So if you normalize for that, think of it probably closer to a 6% range or so, which is actually fairly consistent with our commercial line severity in 2015."

I think we're showing you at some prior IR meetings and we're more than willing to show you, as we get more and more information, that the bundled customer really does give us that motion of a meaningful, I have to stress that, a meaningful extension on our life expectancy. In my shareholders letter, I started to use some language that I think will become more common inside Progressive. Moving away from policy life expectancy to customer life expectancy. I think you get that, it's really we're looking to at least a piece of our business, and I stress that, we'll still always do the pieces that we do well. A piece of our business being customers that actually stay with us in a reasonably long period of time or actually not reasonably long, but very long period of time and have multiple products. So a way to think about that, yes, we are seeing -- yes, that was our hypothesis, yes, we're seeing it. And the data is solid and meaningful. I think quite frankly, we might even be understating the customer life expectancy yet because we haven't seen that kind of customer for a long period of time. Something just internally, and this is just to give you a little bit of a mindset how we think, we're starting to, and this is, I would say, something that 30 years ago, certainly was not was in our radar screen. How many -- what percentage of our customers are being with us for more than 10 years. And now we have a meaningful double-digit, let's say, around 15% of our customers that have been with us for more than 10 years. That wouldn't be a number that would impress USAA or State Farm, I'm sure. But relative to the repositioning of aggressive, that's a number that's very important and the type of customers that we're seeing to into that state decade and decade plus customers are the bundled customers. So nice stuff there. With regard to your question on the high net worth. I'm going to be very frank, we've got a big agenda in front of us. And we're going to probably play an something below the high net worth customer, just put it out on the table exactly that way. That doesn't mean that we won't make some phone calls and have other people's product to sell to those high net worth customers, at least in the home side, but that's probably not a focus that we can add to our property business anytime in the immediate future, given the very large market opportunity there is for us that we feel very comfortable in our realizing."

But one of the places that we were able to actually take in together is on the reserving inside and we now have an actuary that has been on our staff, working directly for Trevor, CFO of ASI, but also having very direct line or whatever you want to call it. As a integral part of our reserving group and during the course of that 9 months, we applied some different techniques, we looked at data a little bit more specifically to ASI versus industry data that have been done before, there was no right or wrong, we're digging in, in a way that perhaps there's a little bit more intense, a little more reflective of the way Progressive has done reserving. In this particular taste, it turned out they had some releases. Could have been that are, we would have adjusted that either way. But I would tell you that the reflection of the releases this time is a little bit more from a highly intense review, overlaying some models, overlaying some techniques, looking at data, looking at it more frequently and what I expect going forward, obviously, I cannot guarantee anything. But what I expect going forward is we'll be much more on a glide path of a kind of approaches that we take traditionally with our order of business and I suspect the volatility will reduce. So probably one-time volatility that is reflective of that process, but frankly, it's a great opportunity for us to really work together and taking a look.

I don't think those are medically different than the PCI reporting part of the industry. For we know that there were a couple of very large and very notable competitors who know perfectly well how to calculate frequency. They reported high numbers. And that's just a fact. I can't necessarily know other than at least in 1 case, probably a mixed adjustment that would really we needed to be made to sort of normalize those numbers. But I'm not sure that we're the anomaly on that relative to the industry. And with regard to -- but to be fair, anytime and I mean this sincerely, anytime we see anybody else seeing something that we're not seeing, trust me, the radar just goes off like crazy and we make sure that we're not the ones waiting too long to see that kind of effect. But as it's played through from order perspective, we really didn't see a great deal in frequency, we didn't see any major trends, we sort of a little bit in the third quarter, but for the most part, that 2, 2.5, not bad. Now remember, systemically, long term, we think maybe frequency is headed for reduction, just for a loss of reasons with vehicle technology. 
Miles driven, no question that would be the usual suspect for increase in frequency and to the extent we didn't see it as much as some others, I'll also tell you that our most recent reporting on mileage increases related clearly to gas prices was starting to see the second half of '15, we did see the second half of '15 be a lot less dramatic of an increase over the prior year than the first half of '15. And our most recent data points might suggest that we have hit sort of the threshold of miles to be driven. I think we'd be better off waiting for the spring and summer to see if we get another spring and summer effect, but for the most part, the more recent data points we're seeing up to and including January, since we get there in real time data, is that '16 mileage is not dramatic or not even different than '15 mileage. And we've seen that even in the last data points of '15 over '14. So the incremental, yes, there was income of the first half of '15 that was very measurable, quite notable, 3% to 5% on a month to month basis. But we're starting to see that level out. We still see in the mix of miles driven, little shift about a 1% shift still to trips over FT miles, we're not seeing dramatic and seasonal adjusted breaking rates are probably not a statistic was other companies talk about. But something that we're particularly interested in. So net-net, the gas price change may have played its way through. I'm going to say that with some ability to retract my statement next time we talk in May or whatever. So stay tuned. But I would just correct that maybe the rest of the industry didn't see the frequency quite as high as perhaps in Allstate and I think of the 2 that come to mind when we see that. And certainly, the 2 that took me though is more reflective of that."

It wasn't that many years ago",617,"Well, that's probably a longer story. But let me suggest to you that -- and we've done this and many, many calls. I've always said, when we see situations that make us believe that rates will go up, we tend to take an early. It wasn't that many years ago that we took and talking in aggregate, it's not always the best thing, but it might work for this. We took rates up and frankly, some of the trends didn't materialize to the degree that we thought. Our penalty there is we actually go a little slower with healthy margins. However, at more recent times, we got into a rate level that we thought was appropriate and perhaps, others weren't quite at that level and therefore, needed to take their rates up more. So the starting point matters. And that was sort of my point before and I like the thing that we're trying to ride the request of the breaking wave. We want to stay on the crest all the time. When you fall over the crest and your margins starts to deteriorate, typically that's associated with a big rate. And we all know the implications of that, to retention, to MPS and to growth. The trick for us is really staying on that crest. And as I had mentioned earlier, as opposed to looking at rate take by rate filings, which you could look premium weighted adjusted basis, you'll see that the industry is about just 2.5 to 3.5 last year, some exceptions to that for sure on the highside and low side. But I would always draw your attention to sort of what's their realized average premium? And you see in our case that was about 4% in both channels. And we have ways that are not going to get into in great detail but of making sure that we built in some trends into our rating factors as well. So that doesn't always come through in the published rate changes. So our objective is really to stay on that crest of the wave and answering your question, it depends on the starting point. So we were not in adequate and didn't need to take a big rate increase in we actually had been taking small bites of the apple, and really keep taking bites of the apple, my expectation is in the first quarter this year, we'll take about probably the better part of 1 point at this in our direct channel and maybe close to that in our agency channel. So we've always take that kind of a rate. I'm not going to speculate for the whole year, but it might be sort of slightly below the 4% and ask the question before about severities. And while we did have the -- for 2 of the situation, those severities going down and therefore, we can release reserves based on the negative severity trends we saw. I will tell you one of the first lessons I've ever learned in this business was people don't get less expensive to fix. So we certainly don't plan negative trends into our pricing indications and we're much more likely to reflect the kinds of numbers that Gary talked about going forward. So long way of saying, but our job is to say on the crest of the wave, and the good news is that we are not currently in the position of taking a significant hammer to our rates, we haven't had to for some time. And if we can stay in that crest of the wave without falling over by taking small bites of the apple, that's our objective. And that produces a very nice outcomes."

Lots of reasons for that. Always had to pin them down, but general excitement, absolutely, yes. If you take a look at some of our polished materials, you'll see that the average rate that consumers have seen over the last year regardless of channel, agency and direct is about 4%, which I would tell you to think more in those terms than specific rate changes. So 4% which means a good number of our consumers are still seeing rate changes that are on the high side of that. So as we mature into the rate revisions that we're now becoming even more comfortable with and rate levels that we're becoming more comfortable with, I would look forward to seeing, while continued positives, maybe not quite in the 4 range, but a closer distribution or tighter distribution around the average. So we will potentially benefit even more so on retention without losing those higher end or the right-hand distribution around the average of 4 last year. So really nice movement, getting our new product into the marketplace, getting a rate level that we feel very comfortable with, maintaining that. You might remember we said at our IR meeting, we have a strong preference for 3 1% changes than 1 3% change. All of that really is a big part of how we're trying to make sure that retention is front and center in all of our thinking. So nice to see it coming through.

I guess, both from the app, which feels like a different customer interface and it's kind of the question of adoption and comfort and sort of more open-ended questions about that, how consumers like the app and whether perhaps something will sell. And then separately, from a discounts, what kind of lift are you seeing from this? Is there an impact in conversion rates or maybe on new sales?"

Well, we haven't done a little Snapshot update for a while, so let me see if I can get all of those points and give you some flavor of what's going on.

Well, we haven't done a little Snapshot update for a while, so let me see if I can get all of those points and give you some flavor of what's going on. Starting into this year, we're still seeing our policies initiated with a Snapshot influence discount, whatever it might be, to be faster than the rates of growth that you're seeing as we report on aggregate. So it's still our fastest-growing sector, that remains true for a long time, but certainly, even into January, that was true. Starting to get a feel for what sort of mix of business is attainable. So I'll just gave you a quick look here, not to confuse you with any numbers but in our direct book of business, where we've been able to offer Snapshot and realistically, there's only 2 states now, California, North Carolina, where we're not offering it. But over a period of time, where the cohort or the Snapshot has been available, that cohort of business is now approximating about 40% of the direct business for places where it was available for some period of time. So think in terms of, can the little train really take momentum, we're looking to sort of 40% to 50% in the direct channel. I think I've told you before the acceptance in the direct channel far exceeds the agency channel and with the new change that we made, it was very clear that we were hoping to see agency uptake on the -- or the quotes include Snapshot with that discount being what I'd call overly dramatic movement, but significant on the small base. Actually, we have some good news to report there. We have actually introduced it into 2 hot, what I'll call higher average premium states: Florida, Louisiana. And we've seen the agent acceptance rates there or the agent penetration into new app, new coding, actually go up significantly, so probably approximating somewhere in the league of 1/2 to 2/3, the rate on our direct channels. So starting to make some traction there. And we're going to take a closer look, I think we did a better job of rolling that out to agents in those states, who'll take a closer look at what we did well there and make sure that we reinforce that in other places in the country. So net-net, pretty good-sized penetration in our direct book and I don't want to project what the threshold might be as to overall penetration. But to think in terms of more than half the book is not unreasonable based on what we've experienced to date and now we're starting to see opportunities, where the agency business perhaps is, yes, slower, but certainly starting to close some part of the gap. So good stuff there. With regard to the app, we've discussed that. I want to make it very clear that we've had apps that have approximated in one way, shape or form the activity that -- for some time that's not being an issue. The issue is really making sure we had an app that we felt had the data or integrity that really matched with the in-car dongle, and we have got to the point where we actually have that application and very comfortable with it. And they're all sorts of stories that some of which I'm not as close to as others, but you need to be able to determine the difference between a train ride and a plane ride and a car ride. You need to know was the person got in the left door, the right door, are they driving, are they passenger. All those sorts of things are actually very important to us. So it's easy enough to create an app that does part of the job. It's very hard to create an app that does the -- or gives us the level of integrity that we'd be comfortable swapping out for the information we get for the dongle. We think we're there. Unfortunately, it's probably going to take us a little longer to get that into marketplace than we might like. There's a fair amount of work to do on the IT side. But certainly in '16, we expect to see that rollout, but it maybe for all intents and purposes in large numbers, later in the year. 
I think we have probably mentioned, we have a relationship with GM and OnStar that's been a little bit delayed, but we expect to be marketing that more actively in about the midyear time frame. So Snapshot, for lots of reasons, continues to be something very important to us, not only as an indicator of the sorts of things that we think we'll do more of in the future, but it's really taking hold and you'll know the power of Snapshot relative to a rating variable. So ultimately, when we start talking about penetration numbers that are really in the range of that 40%, perhaps even 50%, it certainly make a difference in terms of segmentation. So we couldn't be more happy with what we see. I just don't know what the high watermark will be, but we're going to find out. And I hope it's really high."

Maybe I'll double team here with Tricia here on a couple of points. Platinum is what we're talking about. And this is, in short, I don't want to repeat the things that were already written down, but in short, is the way that ASI property business and Progressive come to the market looking as if they are simply one. So let's not worry about the brand names, but the agents are seeing that as Platinum, we're in 12 states. We expect to be in an additional 22 this year. So that will give us some really nice penetration. Our goal is simple. Our goal is to be a valid and most significant choice inside the agency channel for those customers, who want to bundle their auto and home together. We're comfortable to face that either way, but we really like the bundles. ASI is seeing about 50% now of their new quote volume being bundled. So we really -- we're not going to curtail in any way, shape or form monoline of either, but our real interest is in the bundle. We know what the effect of long-term retention there can be. So those things are great. Our interest is making sure on the agency channel, we offer a really viable option and a, as I put it, must-have solution for agents. We know we've got a great order of product. I don't think there's any dispute on that. We have ASI, we have a great homeowners product. We're going to work together to put that into a great package, and there's still work to be done. So we don't think we're across the finish line. We probably never will get across the finish line. We can always make it better. And on the direct side, while ASI is not a bigger player on the direct side, that's obviously a future option that we have for going forward. Tricia, maybe you could talk a little bit about the sales force and how we are into the sales force to make sure that we get the message out as well as possible."

Josh, I think, too, what Glenn said before I say that we really, first of all, the second half of last year, getting the product out, the AT product was really important to get that preferred business and then continue with stable rates. And then we had to have both an agent and a customer value proposition. So we know, we needed to add more commission for these preferred customers, match policy terms and then as we started to talk with our ASI partners, we realized, we really needed to combine sales forces and have very specific sales reps that work with our Platinum agents. So we've just done that recently. We're very excited about that. And we continue to -- like we have 12 states out. We have continued to understand where we're competitive, where we're not. What we need to do. And I think agents understand that. We really want to make sure that we reward our agents not just with more commission, but with preference. So when they choose us as #1 or #2. In fact, just this week, John Sauerland and I are able to make some calls to agents that have reached some certain levels. We have hurdles to get over, on determining how many bundles that you have in your agency. So while the data set with 12 states, I would consider 2016 really the year of execution, understanding more and more about, again, how to get that low pure premium business and on how to integrate the right sales force with these very specific agents."

And that was really the driver of why our reserves developed so favorably in 2015. When we think ahead and going forward, we don't anticipate long-term severity will continue to be negative like that. So if we look at what we actually have booked in our reserving models we're anticipating roughly a 4% severity going forward on liability. Now that will include BI, PD, et cetera. So if you do all those cuts by state and by line, most of them are in the 2% to 6% range. But overall, it was up to about 4%. And when I look at commercial lines, it is about 9%. Some of that though relates to mix changes in the business marketing targets we have. So if you normalized for that, think of it probably closer to a 6% range or so, which is actually fairly consistent with our commercial line severity in 2015."

In my shareholders letter, I started to use some language that I think will become more common inside Progressive. Moving away from policy life expectancy to customer life expectancy, I think you get that, it's really, we're looking to at least a piece of our business, and I stress that. We'll still always do the pieces that we do well. A piece of our business being customers that actually stay with us in a reasonably long period of time or actually not a reasonably long period, a very long period of time and have multiple products. So a way to think about that, so yes, we are seeing -- yes, that was our hypothesis, yes, we're seeing it. And the data is solid and meaningful. I think quite frankly, we might even be understating the customer life expectancy yet because we haven't seen that kind of customer for a long period of time. Something, just internally, and this is just to give you a little bit of a mindset of how we think. We're starting to, and this is, I would say, something that 30 years ago, certainly was not on our radar screen. How many -- what percentage of our customers have been with us for more than 10 years. And now we have a meaningful double-digit, let's say, around 15% of our customers that have been with us for more than 10 years. That wouldn't be a number that would impress USAA or State Farm, I'm sure. But relative to the repositioning of Progressive, that's a number that's very important and the type of customers that we're seeing go into that state are decade and decade-plus customers, the bundled customers. So nice stuff there. With regard to your question on the high net worth, I'm going to be very frank. We've got a big agenda in front of us. And we're going to probably play in something below the high net worth customer. Just put it out on a table exactly that way. That doesn't mean that we won't make some phone calls and have other people's product to sell to those high net worth customers, at least on the home side, but that's probably not the focus that we're going to add to our property business anytime in the immediate future, given the very large market opportunity there is for us, that we feel very comfortable in our realizing."

One of the things that I am delighted about in the first 9 months of being together is that we feel, and I think ASI feels, that we have some skills to offer and clearly they have product and skills to offer as well. But one of the places that we were able to actually dig in together is on the reserving inside, and we now have an actuary that has been on our actuarial staff, working directly for Trevor, CFO of ASI, but also having very direct line or guided line, whatever we want to call it. As an integral part of our reserving group and during the course of that 9 months, we applied some different techniques. We looked at data a little bit more specifically to ASI versus industry data that have been done before. There was no right or wrong. There was just -- we're digging in, in a way that perhaps there's a little bit more intense, a little more reflective of the way Progressive has done reserving. In this particular case, it turned out, we had some releases. Could have been the other way, we would have adjusted either way. But I would tell you that the reflection of the releases this time is a little bit more from a highly intense review, overlaying some models, overlaying some techniques, looking at data, looking at it more frequently. And what I expect going forward, obviously, I cannot guarantee anything. But what I expect going forward is we'll be much more on a glide path of a kind of approaches that we take traditionally, with our order of business and I suspect the volatility will reduce. So probably onetime volatility that is reflective of that process, but frankly, it's a great opportunity for us to really work together in taking a look. I have to say it's always nice of it. It's a release, not an ad, but frankly, I feel much better that we've had the deep study and everybody is very comfortable."

I don't think that is dramatically different than the PCI reporting part of the industry. Fully note that there were a couple of very large and very notable competitors, who know perfectly well how to calculate frequency. They reported higher numbers. And that's just a fact. I can't necessarily know other than at least in one case, probably a mix adjustment that would really needed to be made to sort of normalize those numbers. But I'm not sure that we're the anomaly on that relative to the industry. And with regard to -- but to be fair, anytime and I mean, this sincerely, anytime we see anybody else seeing something that we're not seeing, trust me, the radar just goes off like crazy, and we make sure that we're not the ones waiting too long to see that kind of effect. But as it's played through from an order perspective, we really didn't see a great deal in frequency. We didn't see any major trends, we saw it up a little bit in the third quarter, but for the most part, that 2%, 2.5%, not bad. Now remember, systemically, long term, we think maybe frequency is headed for reductions, just for lots of reasons with vehicle technology. Miles driven, no question that that would be the usual suspect for increase in frequency and to the extent we didn't see it as much as some others. I will also tell you that our most recent reporting on mileage increases related clearly to gas prices was starting to see the second half of '15. Well, we did see the second half of '15 be a lot less dramatic of an increase over the prior year than the first half of '15. And our most recent data points might suggest that we have hit sort of a threshold of miles to be driven. I think we'd be better off waiting to the spring and summer to see if we get another spring and summer effect, but for the most part, the more recent data points we're seeing up to and including January, since we get very real time data, is that '16 mileage is not dramatic or not even different than '15 mileage. And we've seen that even in the last data points of '15 over '14. So the incremental, yes, there was incremental first half of '15 that was very measurable, quite notable, 3% to 5% on a month-to-month basis. But we're starting to see that level out. We still see in the mix of miles driven, a little shift about a 1% shift still to trips over 15 miles. We're not seeing dramatic in seasonal-adjusted breaking rates, probably not a statistic most other companies talk about, but something that we're particularly interested in. So net-net, the gas price change may have played its way through. I'm going to say that with some ability to retract my statement, next time we talk in May or whatever. So stay tuned. But I would just correct that maybe the rest of the industry didn't see the frequency quite as high as perhaps in Allstate and Geico I think are the 2 that come to mind when we see that. And certainly, the 2 that took rate that was more reflective of that."

I've always said, when we see situations that make us believe that rates will go up, we tend to take it early. It wasn't that many years ago that we took and talking in aggregate, it's not always the best thing, but it might work for this. We took rates up and frankly, some of the trends didn't materialize to the degree that we thought. Our penalty there is that we actually grow a little slower with healthy margins. However, at more recent times, we've got into a rate level that we thought was appropriate and perhaps, others weren't quite at that level and therefore, needed to take their rates up more. So the starting point matters. And that was sort of my point before on the -- I like to think that we're trying to ride the crest of the breaking wave. We want to stay on the crest all the time. When you fall over the crest and your margins starts to deteriorate, typically that's associated with a big hammer of rate. And we all know the implications of that, to retention, to MPS and to growth. The trick for us is really staying on that crest. And as I mentioned earlier, as opposed to looking at rate take by rate filings, which you could look on a premium-weighted adjusted basis, you'll see that the industry is about the 2.5 to 3.5 last year, some exceptions to that for sure on the high side and low side. But I would always draw your attention to sort of what is the realized average premium? And you see in our case that was about 4% in both channels. And we have ways that are not going to get into in great detail but making sure that we built in some trend into our rating factors as well. So that doesn't always come through in the published rate changes. So our objective is really to stay on that crest of the wave and answering your question, it depends on the starting point. So we were not inadequate and didn't need to take a big rate increase, and we actually have been taking small bites of the apple, and we're going to keep taking bites of the apple. My expectation is in the first quarter this year, we'll take about probably the better part of a point at least in our direct channel and maybe close to that in our agency channel. So we'll always take that kind of a rate. I'm not going to speculate for the whole year, but it might be sort of slightly below the 4%, Ian asked a question before about severities. And while we did have the -- for 2 of the situation, those severities going down and therefore, we could release reserves based on the negative severity trends we saw. I will tell you one of the first lessons I ever learned in this business was people don't get less expensive to fix. So we certainly don't plan negative trends into our pricing indications, and we're much more likely to reflect the kinds of numbers that Gary talked about going forward. So long way of saying, but our job is to say on the crest of the wave, and the good news is that we are not currently in the position of taking a significant hammer to our rates, or haven't had to for some time. And if we can stay on that crest of the wave without falling over by taking small bites of the apple, that's our objective. And that produces some very nice outcomes."

Lots of reasons for that. Always had to pin them down, but general excitement, absolutely, yes. If you take a look at some of our polished materials, you'll see that the average rate that consumers have seen over the last year regardless of channel, agency and direct is about 4%, which I would tell you to think more in those terms than specific rate changes. So 4%, which means a good number of our consumers are still seeing rate changes that are on the high side of that. So as we mature into the rate revisions that we're now becoming even more comfortable with and rate levels that we're becoming more comfortable with, I would look forward to seeing, while continued positives, maybe not quite in the 4% range, but a closer distribution or tighter distribution around the average. So we will potentially benefit even more so on retention without losing those higher end or the right-hand distribution around the average of 4% last year. So really nice movement, getting our new product into the marketplace, getting a rate level that we feel very comfortable with, maintaining that. You might remember we said at our IR meeting, we have a strong preference for three 1% changes than one 3% change. All of that really is a big part of how we're trying to make sure that retention is front and center in all of our thinking. So nice to see it coming through.

Well, we haven't done a little Snapshot update for a while, so let me see if I can get all of those points and give you some flavor of what's going on. Starting into this year, we're still seeing our policies initiated with a Snapshot influence discount, whatever it might be, to be faster than the rates of growth that you're seeing as we report on aggregate. So it's still our fastest-growing sector, that remains true for a long time, but certainly, even into January, that was true. Starting to get a feel for what sort of mix of business is attainable. So I'll just gave you a quick look here, not to confuse you with any numbers but in our direct book of business, where we've been able to offer Snapshot and realistically, there's only 2 states now, California, North Carolina, where we're not offering it. But over a period of time, where the cohort or the Snapshot has been available, that cohort of business is now approximating about 40% of the direct business for places where it was available for some period of time. So think in terms of, can the little train really take momentum, we're looking to sort of 40% to 50% in the direct channel. I think I've told you before the acceptance in the direct channel far exceeds the agency channel and with the new change that we made, it was very clear that we were hoping to see agency uptake on the -- or the quotes include Snapshot with that discount being what I'd call overly dramatic movement, but significant on the small base. Actually, we have some good news to report there. We have actually introduced it into 2 what I'll call higher average premium states: Florida, Louisiana. And we've seen the agent acceptance rates there or the agent penetration into new app, new coding, actually go up significantly, so probably approximating somewhere in the league of 1/2 to 2/3, the rate on our direct channels. So starting to make some traction there. And we're going to take a closer look, I think we did a better job of rolling that out to agents in those states, we'll take a closer look at what we did well there and make sure that we reinforce that in other places in the country. So net-net, pretty good-sized penetration in our direct book and I don't want to project what the threshold might be as to overall penetration. But to think in terms of more than half the book is not unreasonable based on what we've experienced to date and now we're starting to see opportunities, where the agency business perhaps is, yes, slower, but certainly starting to close some part of the gap. So good stuff there. With regard to the app, we've discussed that. I want to make it very clear that we've had apps that have approximated in one way, shape or form the activity that -- for some time that's not being an issue. The issue is really making sure we had an app that we felt had the data or integrity that really matched with the in-car dongle, and we have got to the point where we actually have that application and very comfortable with it. And they're all sorts of stories that some of which I'm not as close to as others, but you need to be able to determine the difference between a train ride and a plane ride and a car ride. You need to know whether the person got in the left door, the right door, are they driving, are they a passenger. All those sorts of things are actually very important to us. So it's easy enough to create an app that does part of the job. It's very hard to create an app that does the -- or gives us the level of integrity that we'd be comfortable swapping out for the information we get for the dongle. We think we're there. Unfortunately, it's probably going to take us a little longer to get that into marketplace than we might like. There's a fair amount of work to do on the IT side. But certainly in '16, we expect to see that rollout, but it may be, for all intents and purposes, in large numbers later in the year. 
I think we have probably mentioned, we have a relationship with GM and OnStar that's been a little bit delayed, but we expect to be marketing that more actively in about the midyear time frame. So Snapshot, for lots of reasons, continues to be something very important to us, not only as an indicator of the sorts of things that we think we'll do more of in the future, but it's really taking hold and you all know the power of Snapshot relative to a rating variable. So ultimately, when we start talking about penetration numbers that are really in the range of that 40%, perhaps even 50%, it certainly make a difference in terms of segmentation. So we couldn't be more happy with what we see. I just don't know what the high watermark will be, but we're going to find out. And I hope it's really high."

And this is, in short, I don't want to repeat the things that were already written down, but in short, is the way that our ASI property business and Progressive come to the market looking as if they are simply one. So let's not worry about the brand names, but the agents are seeing that as Platinum, we're in 12 states. We expect to be in an additional 22 this year. So that will give us some really nice penetration. Our goal is simple. Our goal is to be a valid and most significant choice inside the agency channel for those customers who want to bundle their auto and home together. We're comfortable if they start either way, but we really like the bundles. ASI is seeing about 50% now of their new quote volume being bundled. So we really -- we're not going to curtail in any way, shape or form monoline of either, but our real interest is in the bundle. We know what the effect of long-term retention there can be. So those things are great. Our interest is making sure on the agency channel, we offer a really viable option and a, as I put it, must-have solution for agents. We know we've got a great order of product. I don't think there's any dispute on that. We have ASI, we have a great homeowners product. We're going to work together to put that into a great package, and there's still work to be done. So we don't think we're across the finish line. We probably never will get across the finish line. We can always make it better. And on the direct side, while ASI is not a -- as big a player on the direct side, that's obviously a future option that we have for going forward. Tricia, maybe you could talk a little bit about the sales force and how we are into the sales force to make sure that we get the message out as well as possible."

Josh, I think, too, what Glenn said before I say that we really, first of all, the second half of last year, getting the product out, the AT product was really important to get that preferred business and then continue with stable rates. And then we had to have both an agent and a customer value proposition. So we know we needed to add more commission for these preferred customers, match policy terms and then as we started to talk with our ASI partners, we realized, we really needed to combine sales forces and have very specific sales reps that work with our Platinum agents. So we've just done that recently. We're very excited about that. And we continue to -- like we have 12 states out. We have continued to understand where we're competitive, where we're not. What we need to do. And I think agents understand that. We really want to make sure that we reward our agents not just with more commission, but with preference. So when they choose us as #1 or #2. In fact, just this week, John Sauerland and I are able to make some calls to agents that have reached some certain levels. We have hurdles to get over, on determining how many bundles that you have in your agency. So while the data set with 12 states, I would consider 2016 really the year of execution, understanding more and more about, again, how to get that low pure premium business and on how to integrate the right sales force with these very specific agents."

And that was really the driver of why our reserves developed so favorably in 2015. When we think ahead in going forward, we don't anticipate long-term severity will continue to be negative like that. So if we look at what we actually have booked in our reserving models we're anticipating roughly a 4% severity going forward on liability. Now that will include BI, PD, et cetera. So if you do all those cuts by state and by line, most of them are in the 2% to 6% range. But overall, it was up to about 4%. And when I look at commercial lines, it is about 9%. Some of that though relates to mix changes in the business marketing targets we have. So if you normalized for that, think of it probably closer to a 6% range or so, which is actually fairly consistent with our commercial line severity in 2015."

I think we've shown you at some prior IR meetings and we're more than willing to show you, as we get more and more information, that the bundled customer really does give us that notion of a meaningful, and I'm going to stress that, a meaningful extension on life expectancy. In my shareholders letter, I started to use some language that I think will become more common inside Progressive. Moving away from policy life expectancy to customer life expectancy, I think you get that, it's really, we're looking to at least a piece of our business, and I stress that. We'll still always do the pieces that we do well. A piece of our business being customers that actually stay with us in a reasonably long period of time or actually not a reasonably long period, a very long period of time and have multiple products. So a way to think about that, so yes, we are seeing -- yes, that was our hypothesis, yes, we're seeing it. And the data is solid and meaningful. I think quite frankly, we might even be understating the customer life expectancy yet because we haven't seen that kind of customer for a long period of time. Something, just internally, and this is just to give you a little bit of a mindset of how we think. We're starting to, and this is, I would say, something that 30 years ago, certainly was not on our radar screen. How many -- what percentage of our customers have been with us for more than 10 years. And now we have a meaningful double-digit, let's say, around 15% of our customers that have been with us for more than 10 years. That wouldn't be a number that would impress USAA or State Farm, I'm sure. But relative to the repositioning of Progressive, that's a number that's very important and the type of customers that we're seeing go into that state are decade and decade-plus customers, the bundled customers. So nice stuff there. With regard to your question on the high net worth, I'm going to be very frank. We've got a big agenda in front of us. And we're going to probably play in something below the high net worth customer. Just put it out on a table exactly that way. That doesn't mean that we won't make some phone calls and have other people's product to sell to those high net worth customers, at least on the home side, but that's probably not the focus that we're going to add to our property business anytime in the immediate future, given the very large market opportunity there is for us, that we feel very comfortable in our realizing."

But one of the places that we were able to actually dig in together is on the reserving inside, and we now have an actuary that has been on our actuarial staff, working directly for Trevor, CFO of ASI, but also having very direct line or guided line, whatever we want to call it. As an integral part of our reserving group and during the course of that 9 months, we applied some different techniques. We looked at data a little bit more specifically to ASI versus industry data that have been done before. There was no right or wrong. There was just -- we're digging in, in a way that perhaps there's a little bit more intense, a little more reflective of the way Progressive has done reserving. In this particular case, it turned out, we had some releases. Could have been the other way, we would have adjusted either way. But I would tell you that the reflection of the releases this time is a little bit more from a highly intense review, overlaying some models, overlaying some techniques, looking at data, looking at it more frequently. And what I expect going forward, obviously, I cannot guarantee anything. But what I expect going forward is we'll be much more on a glide path of a kind of approaches that we take traditionally, with our order of business and I suspect the volatility will reduce. So probably onetime volatility that is reflective of that process, but frankly, it's a great opportunity for us to really work together in taking a look. I have to say it's always nice of it. It's a release, not an ad, but frankly, I feel much better that we've had the deep study and everybody is very comfortable."

I don't think that is dramatically different than the PCI reporting part of the industry. Fully note that there were a couple of very large and very notable competitors, who know perfectly well how to calculate frequency. They reported higher numbers. And that's just a fact. I can't necessarily know other than at least in one case, probably a mix adjustment that would really be -- needed to be made to sort of normalize those numbers. But I'm not sure that we're the anomaly on that relative to the industry. And with regard to -- but to be fair, anytime -- and I mean this sincerely, anytime we see anybody else seeing something that we're not seeing, trust me, the radar just goes off like crazy, and we make sure that we're not the ones waiting too long to see that kind of effect. But as it's played through from an order perspective, we really didn't see a great deal in frequency. We didn't see any major trends, we saw it up a little bit in the third quarter, but for the most part, that 2%, 2.5%, not bad. Now remember, systemically, long term, we think maybe frequency is headed for reductions, just for lots of reasons with vehicle technology. Miles driven, no question that that would be the usual suspect for increase in frequency and to the extent we didn't see it as much as some others. I will also tell you that our most recent reporting on mileage increases related clearly to gas prices was starting to see the second half of '15. Well, we did see the second half of '15 be a lot less dramatic of an increase over the prior year than the first half of '15. And our most recent data points might suggest that we have hit sort of a threshold of miles to be driven. I think we'd be better off waiting to the spring and summer to see if we get another spring and summer effect, but for the most part, the more recent data points we're seeing up to and including January, since we get very real time data, is that '16 mileage is not dramatic or not even different than '15 mileage. And we've seen that even in the last data points of '15 over '14. So the incremental, yes, there was incremental first half of '15 that was very measurable, quite notable, 3% to 5% on a month-to-month basis. But we're starting to see that level out. We still see in the mix of miles driven, a little shift about a 1% shift still to trips over 15 miles. We're not seeing dramatic in seasonal-adjusted breaking rates, probably not a statistic most other companies talk about, but something that we're particularly interested in. So net-net, the gas price change may have played its way through. I'm going to say that with some ability to retract my statement, next time we talk in May or whatever. So stay tuned. But I would just correct that maybe the rest of the industry didn't see the frequency quite as high as perhaps in Allstate and Geico I think are the 2 that come to mind when we see that. And certainly, the 2 that took rate that was more reflective of that."

It wasn't that many years ago t",624,"Well, that's probably a longer story. But let me suggest to you that -- and we've done this on many, many calls. I've always said, when we see situations that make us believe that rates will go up, we tend to take it early. It wasn't that many years ago that we took and talking in aggregate, it's not always the best thing, but it might work for this. We took rates up and frankly, some of the trends didn't materialize to the degree that we thought. Our penalty there is that we actually grow a little slower with healthy margins. However, at more recent times, we've got into a rate level that we thought was appropriate and perhaps, others weren't quite at that level and therefore, needed to take their rates up more. So the starting point matters. And that was sort of my point before on the -- I like to think that we're trying to ride the crest of the breaking wave. We want to stay on the crest all the time. When you fall over the crest and your margins starts to deteriorate, typically that's associated with a big hammer of rate. And we all know the implications of that, to retention, to MPS and to growth. The trick for us is really staying on that crest. And as I mentioned earlier, as opposed to looking at rate take by rate filings, which you could look on a premium-weighted adjusted basis, you'll see that the industry is about the 2.5 to 3.5 last year, some exceptions to that for sure on the high side and low side. But I would always draw your attention to sort of what is the realized average premium? And you see in our case that was about 4% in both channels. And we have ways that are not going to get into in great detail but making sure that we built in some trend into our rating factors as well. So that doesn't always come through in the published rate changes. So our objective is really to stay on that crest of the wave and answering your question, it depends on the starting point. So we were not inadequate and didn't need to take a big rate increase, and we actually have been taking small bites of the apple, and we're going to keep taking bites of the apple. My expectation is in the first quarter this year, we'll take about probably the better part of a point at least in our direct channel and maybe close to that in our agency channel. So we'll always take that kind of a rate. I'm not going to speculate for the whole year, but it might be sort of slightly below the 4%, Ian asked a question before about severities. And while we did have the -- for 2 of the situation, those severities going down and therefore, we could release reserves based on the negative severity trends we saw. I will tell you one of the first lessons I ever learned in this business was people don't get less expensive to fix. So we certainly don't plan negative trends into our pricing indications, and we're much more likely to reflect the kinds of numbers that Gary talked about going forward. So long way of saying, but our job is to stay on the crest of the wave, and the good news is that we are not currently in the position of taking a significant hammer to our rates, or haven't had to for some time. And if we can stay on that crest of the wave without falling over by taking small bites of the apple, that's our objective. And that produces some very nice outcomes."

You guys had a really strong, really probably 6 months here with growth rates driving. I'm wondering if you can help us a bit to segregate it because there's a lot of moving pieces. And I think the big picture question I'm sort of struggling with is how much is the cyclical story because of the environment? And how much is structural and the impact of your other various initiatives? And so when I think about it, it would be really helpful to get your sort of color on how much you think is a function of kind of just the competitive environment changing around other folks taking pricing maybe on the first point. But then you obviously have a lot of retention initiatives under way the second. And then you got new products whether  it's Snapshot or homeowners. I imagine these are having some impact and there are probably more Snapshot than homeowners at this point.  But I would like to you from your perspective as we think about looking forward, how much of this is kind of a cyclical upswing in the growth rates and how much of this is the impact of big sort of powerful initiative working your way through?"

So I'm not sure I'm going to get as specific, but think about our October meeting is a better opportunity for us to address a lot of those issues. Frankly, some of them are a little bit tricky to -- but cause-and-effect to, but growth is actually why sign me up for another first quarter like that one. I know we certainly had some hail at the end, but frankly, we also missed some winter. So no great consent there, 94, 6. Whatever. The kind of growth rates we put together. Nice quarter. Why? The fact is it's not simply not letting other competitors take rate. We try to take rate at the right time to make sure we're always positioned. I used the analogy of the wave last time. We had to ride the crest of the wave. That's a sort of the underlying core of everything we do. So forget all the other initiatives. We've got to run the base business exactly the way we want to run it, and keep it at that point where we always be in the position to take advantage of market conditions when they swing our way. We expect always to grow. That's part of our two-pronged most important statement. 96 and grow as fast or possible. But when we get that opportunity that others are perhaps scurrying where we have perhaps got ahead, we'll take those opportunities and welcome them when they come. And then second piece is you got to manufacture your own future growth. And the kind of things great Snapshot, you're more than familiar with Snapshot representing now almost close to 2 million policies being rated with Snapshot sort of fundamentals. So you've seen from the policies that I put in my letter. That's a material part of our book and you know it's more material on the direct side than on the agency side. We've got some nice initiatives that we'll continue there with Snapshot. We talked last time briefly about the app in which we think can also give us an opportunity to reach out to yet some other customers that are perhaps not as comfortable with a dongle inside the car. With now something with General Motors that will kick off within about 10 days where we have actually quite vehicles via calls data with General Motors. So we're starting to come, as I've always said, we're starting to we more about just the data, the algorithms and the impact on rating, less about the method of collection. So Snapshot has got some real gas in the tank and we'll continue that. Obviously, our brand strength. We'll continue to push on that, and we been able to do that in an environment where others have perhaps pulled back just a little bit on their advertising. So it seems nice brand strength measure is moving the right direction. You flip over into the agency channel. Actually, I'll stay with both for a while. Product advancements, we've talked primarily about 8.3, but we're always get -- we're always in the Hopper for 4 8.4, 8.5. So we're continuing to develop that forward with the biggest moving the agency channels other than rate competitiveness is our bundling initiatives that we really advanced nicely within the direct side. Lots more gas in the tank there where we use a lot of carriers and agency side. You know the story on ASI. That's not a big factor in agency growth right now, so I wouldn't overplay that. But to the extent that we talk this time next year, I expect that to be a bigger factor in the growth. So growth initiatives are all on track. Different stages of maturity. I will put Snapshot higher. We're starting to see agent acceptance. I talked about that last time when you asked the question. We started to see the more recent states with agent acceptance frankly close to double what they had been previously, so we're starting to see that move in the right direction. So Snapshot moving along very well. Platinum and the agency channel really is starting to get a grip, and we'll talk about that more on our October meeting. And as long as we're very diligent with the pricing, clearly, we see and we released numbers for at least you to have of to get a flavor for what's going to happen in April. We're still a few days away, of course, for closing out April and getting you the information 8, 10 business days, but we know that's not going to be a great months. We'll take a look at our rating overall. And I would say that probably we're still in a mode where we can think in terms of 4 to 5 in terms of annualized rate increases, which is a nice place to be. We gave you some indications on trends. So that core should keep rolling and the initiatives are doing well. I did not see a question specifically in terms of percentage relative to growth and that this how to do it. We have some feel, but I'm not confident to sort of push that out to a greater audience at this point."

In fact, a little piece of the story of being different in my comment the last time around. Frequency is pretty benign. And certainly, when I look at the BI, which I tend to worry a little bit more about BI frequency than anything else. It's really and pretty good shape there, so we're not seeing anything dramatically go away. I would tell you wait another conference call or 2 to get too concerned about commentary on PIP. We've got some issues in New Jersey that we think may be driving that number a little bit differently than the true read. I won't say true read, true long-term read. So severity really is the play, and for the most part, not too much of concern there with bodily injury. I think the interesting point for severity is really the collision. And I thank a little bit too early to suggest that we clearly point in our Q that frequency was moderated by winter weather this year in the Midwest and the Northern states. That's absolutely the case. We also discussed last time that based on our Snapshot measuring, we will not seeing fifth -- the last quarter of '15 was overlaying the last quarter of '14 more on miles driven, vehicles miles-driven. That's changed in the first quarter. So we're actually seeing an uptick now on vehicle miles-driven in the first quarter of '16 relative to first quarter of '15. So that's interesting and that tracks very much with the public gasoline demand as well. So while we all speculate on the effect of the increased miles, and I've always cautioned that you need to know what kinds of miles and we are seeing the longer trip miles be the primary driver of that, we may see a little bit of a tick up in the frequency. And we certainly need to watch that for what I'll call short to midterm pricing. But we may, we may. And please stress that. We may really be seeing you more structural long-term change and lower frequency. As we know, cars are getting safer. We've always talked about that. That's very, very hard to sort of measure on a month or even quarterly basis. But it would not be surprising to me to see in the future that we would see a long-term structural decline in frequency, and quite possibly, as history has shown us, a similar offset on the severity. So those would be my primarily issues there. Right now, frankly, given that there has never been a time in history that hasn't always been some puts and takes and frequency and severity, there's a reasonably predictable of mile time. The only outlier perhaps is a little bit of PIP severity for us right now and a little bit of collation severity that we'll take a look at. But that's sort of from a pricing perspective is being offset by frequency."

It certainly also plays to the fact that we're writing an awful lot of homeowners not necessarily with somebody's results that we have to reporting hours to the partners that we have.

Some of the things are even federal amended for emergency braking among. Those sorts of things. It's impossible for me to think there isn't a real macro driver do yet make car safer. That's my primer for declining frequency. What's interesting is that over that time period, the market for passenger auto has grown, and that is largely a severity offset to the, actually, even more than offset, it's again, over to frequency decline. And those are interesting, and accurate and observable facts. When you start to decompose it to try to sort of say exactly coverage by coverage what's driving it, that gets a little trickier.

The first layer, 45 million [ph] And the tower on the first event, we won't start quoting PMS, but trust me that it is much higher than I would expect the average industry buys too. So going to the top, so to speak, is a highly unlikely event. Yes, we then have a cash rebound facility that is an aggregate of $175 million and that this for structure calendar period. We have covered on second event similarly, not quite as high a tower, but we also prepurchased reinstatement on many of the layers. So that completely up the tower. But unlike many other players, once -- if we ever had to reinstate, those premiums are prepaid for much of the reinsurance. So ASI has an extremely robust reinsurance program. All of the players in that program are virtually all our A rate or better, so we're very comfortable with the program. And that $45 million, they had targeted previously that retention to ensure that any one event less than 10% of their surplus was at risk.

The hail and driving weather really have been the cause for both auto and home. Home is not really affected by the flood conditions in Houston. Some of our vehicles are, although that actually was a relatively manageable number. If my memory tells me, about 450 losses  directly related to floods. So that's not the big driver of our results this month. So when you see that 135, the 85 50 split, think about the really nasty peril of hail. When hail gets to be the size that it is, it is more fare out there for loose and for sheet metal and did a lot of damage. That's just plain and simple. Hail is one of the most nasty perils that we come into, so comp is going to be dramatically affected by that. And as I said, we are -- we will take a couple of opportunities even though the numbers will be what they are. The first thing that we'll do is recognize that these are first party claims. So in turn -- we're not pay the loss, so we've got to turn it into a marketing expense. This is the time that we get with our customers and make their lives better after an upset, whether it's their roof, or whether it's their windshield, or whatever. So first thing the attitude we're taking right now is turn that into a marketing expense. We know how important retention is. We know the relationship is when you give great servicing claims in the future retention, so that's the first thing. Second is take a look at our pricing, make sure that we're where we want to be. Certainly 1 spike of a month, we've seen that on numerous occasions. We're not at all concerned that we are on track for our commitments to shareholders at 96% or better. But we will reevaluate our cat loss or cat loads. And I would tell you if I was looking at the overall market, I see rate change in an overall basis, certainly some driven by the competitors. Last data point we have, February, around about a 4.5%, which is about 110 basis points stronger than earlier in the year. My suspicion based on knowing what we filed, we will get more clarity on that from competitors for April and May. But we know there's been a lot of weight changes filed, so you can see that go a little higher. And I would say if I was giving you the direction last call. I probably would've said thinking the 4 range. Think about a point per quarter if you average it out. I'd say put another 25 to 40 basis points on that per quarter as we look at the rest of the year. Now it might be a little higher when you factor in cat loss or cat loads. But for the most part, I think this is all quite manageable for us."

And frankly, I think everybody can have a theory on that. I would just tell you that what has changed is in the first quarter, we are seeing miles-driven as our Snapshot population, which is large enough to be credible. I make the claim that it's different than the claim I made for the fourth quarter where we hadn't seen it be dramatic. In fact, it had flattened off. It is now showing increase. And we're going into what is really the high vehicle mile-traveled part of the year. So it'll be interesting to see whether or not the discretionary usage continues to be higher or not.

The short-term change or the big increase in short-term in the first quarter was really not so much of portfolio strategy change as it is a definitional change. I tried to get some in the queue as we had about 1.1 billion of short coupon treasury that's accounted in our Treasurer portfolio that matured in the first quarter. And we rolled those into treasury bills, which are kind of in the short-term portfolio. So no real big change there other than end of the year decline in the duration of the portfolio. The other changes that we had was we increased our corporate's a little bit in the first quarter as we saw some more compelling opportunities with spreads go wider. And then we've made some little repositioning around the portfolio where we took control of the management portfolio on January 1. So there've been some turnover in regards to that. But other than that, no material changes in the portfolio and certainly no changes in our overall strategy there."

You guys have had a really strong, really -- probably 6 months here with growth rates driving. I'm wondering if you can help us a bit to segregate it because there's a lot of moving pieces. And I think the big picture question I'm sort of struggling with is how much is the cyclical story because of the environment? And how much is structural and the impact of your initiative -- of the various initiatives? And so when I think about it, it would be really helpful to get your sort of color on how much you think it is a function of kind of just the competitive environment changing around -- other folks taking pricing maybe on the first point. But then you obviously have a lot of retention initiatives under way the second. And then you got new products, whether it's Snapshot or homeowners. I imagine these are having some impact, and -- probably more Snapshot than homeowners at this point. But what I'd love to get from your perspective, as we think about looking forward, how much of this is kind of a cyclical upswing in the growth rates and how much of this is the impact of big sort of powerful initiatives working the way through?"

So I'm not sure I'm going to get as specific, but think about our October IR meeting is a better opportunity for us to address a lot of those issues. Frankly, some of them are a little bit tricky to -- but cause-and-effect to, but growth is actually, boy, sign me up for another first quarter like that one. I know we certainly has some hail at the end, but frankly, we also missed some winter. So no great consent there on 94.6 [ph] or whatever. The kind of growth rates we put together. Nice quarter. Why? The fact is it's not simply not let that other competitors take rate. We try to take rate at the right time to make sure we're always positioned. I use the analogy of the wave last time. We tried to ride the crest of the wave. That's sort of the underlying core of everything we do. So forget all the other initiatives. We've got to run the base business exactly the way we want to run it, and keep it at a point where we'll always be in a position to take advantage of market conditions when they swing our way. We expect always to grow. That's part of our two-pronged most important statement. 96 and grow as fast as possible. But when we get that opportunity that others are perhaps scurrying where we have perhaps got ahead, we'll take those opportunities and welcome them when they come. And then, second piece is you got to manufacture your own future growth. And the kind of things with Snapshot, you're more than familiar with Snapshot representing now almost close to 2 million policies being rated with Snapshot sort of fundamentals. So you've seen from the policies that I put in my letter. That's a material part of our book, and you know it's more material on the direct side than on the agency side. We've got some nice initiatives that we'll continue there with Snapshot. We've talked last time briefly about the app which we think can also give us an opportunity to reach out to yet some other customers that are perhaps not as comfortable with a dongle inside the car. We've announced something with General Motors that will kick off within about 10 days, where we have to actually collect vehicles -- vehicle data with General Motors. So we're starting to -- as I've always said, we're starting to worry more about just the data, the algorithms and the impact on rating, less about the method of collection. So Snapshot has got some real gas in the tank, and we'll continue that. Obviously, our brand strength, we continue to push on that, and we've been able to do that in an environment where others have perhaps pulled back just a little bit on their advertising. So it seems some nice brand strength measures move in the right direction. You flip over into the agency channel. Actually, I'll stay with both for a while. Product advancements, we've talked primarily about 8.3, but we're always get -- we're always in the hopper for 4 -- 8.4 or 8.5. So we're continuing to develop that, probably the biggest move in the agency channel. Other than rate competitiveness is our bundling initiatives that we really have done so nicely within the direct side. Lots more gas in the tank there where we use a lot of carriers. In the agency side, you know the story on ASI. That's not a big factor in agency growth right now, so I wouldn't overplay that. But to the extent that we talk this time next year, I expect that to be a bigger factor in the growth. So growth initiatives are all on track, different stages of maturity. I will put Snapshot higher. We've started to see agent acceptance. I talked about that last time when you asked the question. We started to see the more recent states with agent acceptance frankly close to double what they had been previously, so we're starting to see that move in the right direction. So Snapshot moving along very well. Platinum in the agency channel really is starting to get a grip, and we'll talk about that more on our October meeting. And as long as we're very diligent with the pricing, clearly, we see, and we release numbers for at least you to get a flavor for what's going to happen in April. We're still a few days away, of course, for closing out April and getting you the information 8, 10 business days, but we know that's not going to be a great month. So we'll take a look at our rating overall. And I would say that probably we're still in a mode where we can think in terms of 4 to 5 in terms of annualized rate increases, which is a nice place to be. We gave you some indications on trends. So that core should keep rolling and the initiatives are doing well. I did not see a question specifically in terms of percentages relative to growth and that is hard to do. We have some feel, but I'm not confident to sort of push that out to a greater audience at this point."

In fact, a little piece of the story of being different in my comments last time around. Frequency is pretty benign. And certainly, when we look at the BI, which I tend to worry a little bit more about BI frequency than anything else, we're really in pretty good shape there. So we're not seeing anything dramatically go away. I would tell you wait another conference call or 2 to get too concerned about commentary on PIP. We've got some issues in New Jersey that we think may be driving that number a little bit differently than the true read. I won't say true read, true long-term read. So severity really is the play, and for the most part, not too much of concern there with bodily injury. I think the interesting point for severity is really the collision. And I think it's a little bit too early to suggest that we're clearly quiet in our queue that frequency was moderated by winter weather this year in the Midwest and the Northern states. That's absolutely the case. We also discussed last time that based on our Snapshot measuring, we were not seeing fifth -- the last quarter of '15 was overlaying the last quarter of '14 more on miles driven -- vehicles miles driven. That's changed in the first quarter. So we're actually seeing an uptick now on vehicle miles driven in the first quarter of '16 relative to the first quarter of '15. So that's interesting and that tracks very much with the public gasoline demand as well. So while we all speculate on the effect of the increased miles, and I've always cautioned that you need to know what kinds of miles, and we are seeing the longer trip miles be the primary driver of that. We may see a little bit of a tick up in frequency, and we certainly need to watch that for what I'll call short- to mid-term pricing. But we may, we may, and please stress that. We may really be seeing a more structural long-term change in lower frequency, as we know, cars are getting safer. We've always talked about that. That's very, very hard to sort of measure on a month or even quarterly basis. But it would not be surprising to me to see in the future that we'll see a long-term structural decline in frequency, and quite possibly, as history has shown us, a similar offset on the severity. So those would be my primarily issues there. Right now, frankly, given that there has never been a time in history there hasn't never been some puts and takes on frequency and severity. This is a reasonably predictable of mile time. The only outlier perhaps is a little bit of PIP severity for us right now and little bit of collision severity that we'll take a look at. But that's sort of from a pricing perspective is being offset by frequency."

No thoughts. That doesn't mean we won't ever have thoughts. We're always going to consider that, but think about the percentage of the overall book of business that we have, we currently have a small quarter share percentage. We have a single attachment point of about $45 million for any single event, and we have an aggregate attachment of $175 million. Let us feel very much in proportion to things that we're willing to handle. Do I like volatility? Of course, not. No one does. You don't and I don't. But if this was sort of in the realm of understanding of what likely could happen when we did something like this, absolutely, it certainly also plays to the fact that we're writing an awful lot of homeowners, not necessarily with somebody's results that we have to report in-house. So the partners that we have, they're all obviously having those problems. So it's a different dynamic when we have it in the place that we absolutely needed, and as I said in my letter, it hasn't even been a momentary thought to be of any concern whatsoever. And there's no pressure from my perspective to take any less reinsurance, but equally no more reinsurance."

So if you think about new business [indiscernible] is either a function of increase in conversion of quotes and in Commercial Lines is predominantly in quotes, which generally means competitors are raising rates or just not choosing to quote the business.

Some of the things, even the federal amended for emergency braking. Those sorts of things, it's impossible for me to think there isn't a real macro driver to yet make cars safer. So that's my [indiscernible] for declining frequency. What's interesting is that over that time period, the market for private passenger auto has grown, and that is largely a severity offset to the, actually, it's even more than an offset, it's a gain, over the frequency decline.

The first layer of 45 million and the tower on the first event, we won't start quoting PMLs, but trust me that it is much higher than I would expect the average industry buys too. So going to the top, so to speak, is a highly unlikely event. Yes, we then have a [indiscernible] rebound facility that is an aggregate of $175 million and that is for -- strong throughout calendar period. We have covered on second event similarly, not quite as high a tower, but we also prepurchased reinstatement on many of the layers. So now completely up the tower. But unlike many other players, once -- if we ever had to reinstate, those premiums are prepaid for much of the reinsurance. So ASI has an extremely robust reinsurance program. All of the players in that program are virtually are A- rated or better. So we're very comfortable with the program. And that $45 million, they had targeted previously that retention to ensure that any one event less than 10% of their surplus was at risk. And, obviously, less than 10% of their surplus is a pretty small percentage of the combined entities, so a pretty robust reinsurance program.

Yes, because of where we are today, but ultimately, we want to be a meaningful bundled option for consumers, and Florida is a big state. And we will, as you just heard, make sure that we have all the right reinsurance. We're not going to put -- we're not going to go crazy.

Home is not really affected by the flood conditions in Houston. Some of our vehicles are, although that actually was a relatively manageable number. My memory tells me, about 450 losses directly related to the floods. So that's not a big driver of our results this month. So when you see that 135, the 85-50 split, think about the really nasty peril of hail. When hail gets to be the size that it is, it is more fare out there for roofs and for sheet metal and did a lot of damage. That's just plain and simple. Hail is one of the most nasty perils that we come into, so comp is going to be dramatically affected by that. And as I said, we are -- we will take a couple of opportunities even though the numbers will be what they are. The first thing that we'll do is recognize that these are first-party claims. So in turn, we're going to -- we'll not pay the loss, so we've got to turn that into a marketing expense. This is the time that we get with our customers and make their lives better after an upset, whether it's their roof or whether it's their windshield or whatever. So first thing the attitude we're taking right now is turn that into a marketing expense. We know how important retention is. We know the relationship when you give great servicing claims in the future retention, so that's the first thing. Second is take a look at our pricing, make sure that we're where we want to be. Certainly one spike of a month, we've seen that on numerous occasions. We're not at all concerned that we off-track for our commitments to shareholders, they are 96 or better. But we will reevaluate our CAT loss or CAT loads. And I would tell you if I was looking at the overall market, I see rate change in an overall basis, certainly some driven by big competitors. Last data point we have, February, around about a 4.5%, which is about 110 basis points stronger than earlier in the year. My suspicion based on knowing what's being filed, we will get more clarity on that from competitors for April and May. But we know there's been a lot of rate changes filed, so you could see that go a little higher. And I would say if I was giving you direction last call, I probably would've said think in the 4 range. Think about a point per quarter if you average it out. I'd say put another 25 to 40 basis points on that per quarter, as we look at the rest of the year. And it might be a little higher when you factor in CAT loss or CAT loads. But for the most part, I think this is all quite manageable for us."

And frankly, I think everybody can have a theory on that. I would just tell you that what has changed is in the first quarter, we are seeing miles driven as our Snapshot population, which is large enough to be credible, make the claim that it's different than the claim I made for the fourth quarter where we hadn't seen it be dramatic, In fact, it had flattened off. It is now showing increase. And we're going into what is really the high vehicle mile traveled part of the year.

We have incredible interest in this sort of thing because it makes a big difference.

You guys have had a really strong, really -- probably 6 months here with growth rates rising. I'm wondering if you can help us a bit to segregate it because there's a lot of moving pieces. And I think the big picture question I'm sort of struggling with is how much is the cyclical story because of the environment? And how much is structural and the impact of your initiative -- of the various initiatives? And so when I think about it, it would be really helpful to get your sort of color on how much you think it is a function of kind of just the competitive environment changing around -- other folks taking pricing maybe on the first point. But then you obviously have a lot of retention initiatives under way the second. And then you got new products, whether it's Snapshot or homeowners. I imagine these are having some impact, and -- probably more Snapshot than homeowners at this point. But what I'd love to get from your perspective, as we think about looking forward, how much of this is kind of a cyclical upswing in the growth rates and how much of this is the impact of big sort of powerful initiatives working the way through?"

So I'm not sure I'm going to get as specific, but think about our October IR meeting is a better opportunity for us to address a lot of those issues. Frankly, some of them are a little bit tricky to -- but cause-and-effect to, but growth is actually, boy, sign me up for another first quarter like that one. I know we certainly has some hail at the end, but frankly, we also missed some winter. So no great consent there on 94.6 [ph] or whatever. The kind of growth rates we put together. Nice quarter. Why? The fact is it's not -- it's certainly not luck that other competitors take rate. We try to take rate at the right time and make sure we're always positioned. I use the analogy of the wave last time. We tried to ride the crest of the wave. That's sort of the underlying core of everything we do. So forget all the other initiatives. We've got to run the base business exactly the way we want to run it, and keep it at a point where we'll always be in a position to take advantage of market conditions when they swing our way. We expect always to grow. That's part of our two-pronged most important statement: 96, and grow as fast as possible. But when we get that opportunity that others are perhaps scurrying where we have perhaps got ahead, we'll take those opportunities and welcome them when they come. And then, second piece is you got to manufacture your own future growth. And the kind of things with Snapshot, you're more than familiar with Snapshot representing now almost close to 2 million policies being rated with Snapshot sort of fundamentals. So you've seen from the policies that I put in my letter. That's a material part of our book, and you know it's more material on the direct side than on the agency side. We've got some nice initiatives that we'll continue there with Snapshot. We've talked last time briefly about the app which we think can also give us an opportunity to reach out to yet some other customers that are perhaps not as comfortable with a dongle inside the car. We've announced something with General Motors that will kick off within about 10 days, where we have to actually collect vehicles -- vehicle data with General Motors. So we're starting to -- as I've always said, we're starting to worry more about just the data, the algorithms and the impact on rating, less about the method of collection. So Snapshot has got some real gas in the tank, and we'll continue that. Obviously, our brand strength, we continue to push on that, and we've been able to do that in an environment where others have perhaps pulled back just a little bit on their advertising. So it seems some nice brand strength measures moving the right direction. You flip over into the agency channel. Actually, I'll stay with both for a while. Product advancements, we've talked primarily about 8.3, but we're always get -- we're always in the hopper for 4 -- 8.4 or 8.5. So we're continuing to develop that, probably the biggest move in the agency channel. Other than rate competitiveness is our bundling initiatives that we really have done so nicely within the direct side. Lots more gas in the tank there where we use a lot of carriers. In the agency side, you know the story on ASI. That's not a big factor in agency growth right now, so I wouldn't overplay that. But to the extent that we talk this time next year, I expect that to be a bigger factor in the growth. So growth initiatives are all on track, different stages of maturity. I will put Snapshot higher. We've started to see agent acceptance. I talked about that last time when you asked the question. We started to see the more recent states with agent acceptance frankly close to double what they had been previously, so we're starting to see that move in the right direction. So Snapshot moving along very well. Platinum in the agency channel really is starting to get a grip, and we'll talk about that more on our October meeting. And as long as we're very diligent with the pricing, clearly, we see, and we release numbers for at least you to get a flavor for what's going to happen in April. We're still a few days away, of course, for closing out April and getting you the information 8, 10 business days, but we know that's not going to be a great month. So we'll take a look at our rating overall. And I would say that probably we're still in a mode where we can think in terms of 4 to 5 in terms of annualized rate increases, which is a nice place to be. We gave you some indications on trends. So that core should keep rolling and the initiatives are doing well. I did not see a question specifically in terms of percentages relative to growth and that is hard to do. We have some feel, but I'm not confident to sort of push that out to a greater audience at this point."

In fact, a little piece of the story well be even different in my comments last time around. Frequency is pretty benign. And certainly, when we look at the BI, which I tend to worry a little bit more about BI frequency than anything else, so we're really in pretty good shape there. So we're not seeing anything dramatically go away. I would tell you wait another conference call or 2 to get too concerned about commentary on PIP. We've got some issues in New Jersey that we think may be driving that number a little bit differently than the true read. I won't say true read, true long-term read. So severity really is the play, and for the most part, not too much of concern there with bodily injury. I think the interesting point for severity is really the collision. And I think it's a little bit too early to suggest that we've clearly put in our Q that frequency was moderated by winter weather this year in the Midwest and the Northern states. That's absolutely the case. We also discussed last time that based on our Snapshot measuring, we were not seeing fifth -- the last quarter of '15 was overlaying the last quarter of '14 more on miles driven -- vehicles miles driven. That's changed in the first quarter. So we're actually seeing an uptick now on vehicle miles driven in the first quarter of '16 relative to the first quarter of '15. So that's interesting and that tracks very much with the public gasoline demand as well. So while we all speculate on the effect of the increased miles, and I've always cautioned that you need to know what kinds of miles, and we are seeing the longer trip miles be the primary driver of that. We may see a little bit of a tick up in frequency, and we certainly need to watch that for what I'll call short- to mid-term pricing. But we may, we may, and please stress that. We may really be seeing a more structural long-term change and in lower frequency, as we know, cars are getting safer. We've always talked about that. That's very, very hard to sort of measure on a month or even quarterly basis. But it would not be surprising to me to see in the future that we'll see a long-term structural decline in frequency, and quite possibly, as history has shown us, a similar offset on the severity. So those would be my primarily issues there. Right now, frankly, given that there has never been a time in history there hasn't never been some puts and takes on frequency and severity. This is a reasonably predictable of mile time. The only outlier perhaps is a little bit of PIP severity for us right now and little bit of collision severity that we'll take a look at. But that's sort of from a pricing perspective is being offset by frequency."

No thoughts. That doesn't mean we won't ever have thoughts. We're always going to consider that, but I think about the percentage of the overall book of business that we have, we currently have a small quarter share percentage. We have a single attachment point of about $45 million for any single event, and we have an aggregate attachment of $175 million. Those feel very much in proportion to things that we're willing to handle. Do I like volatility? Of course not. No one does. You don't and I don't. But if this was sort of in the realm of understanding of what likely could happen when we did something like this, absolutely, it certainly also plays to the fact that we're writing an awful lot of homeowners, not necessarily with some of these results that we have to report in-house. So the partners that we have, they're all obviously having those problems. So it's a different dynamic when we have it in the place that we absolutely need it, and as I said in my letter, it hasn't even been a momentary thought to be of any concern whatsoever. And there's no pressure from my perspective to take any less reinsurance, but equally no more reinsurance."

So we're really well positioned now. And yes, we are seeing a big increase in corp volumes. So if you think about new business incoming is either a function of an increase in conversion or quotes and in Commercial Lines is predominantly in quotes, which it generally means competitors are raising rates or just not choosing to quote the business. As far as where that goes, we can't know with certainty for sure. We are confident on our rate level. In some of the areas, we might take rates up a bit, but, obviously, you see combined ratios there that are very good.

Some of the things, even the federal mandate for emergency braking. Those sorts of things, it's impossible for me to think there isn't a real macro driver to yet make cars safer. So that's my primus for declining frequency. What's interesting is that over that time period, the market for private passenger auto has grown, and that is largely a severity offset to the, actually, it's even more than an offset, it's a gain, over the frequency decline. And those are interesting and accurate and observable facts. When you start to decompose it to try to sort of say exactly coverage by coverage what's driving it, that gets a little trickier.

The first layer is 45 million and the tower on the first event, we won't start quoting PMLs, but trust me that it is much higher than I would expect the average industry buys to. So going to the top, so to speak, is a highly unlikely event. Yes, we then have a pretest, pre-bond [ph] facility that is an aggregate of $175 million and that is for -- strong throughout calendar period. We have covered on second event similarly, not quite as high a tower, but we also prepurchase reinstatement on many of the layers. So now completely up the tower. But unlike many other players, once -- if we ever had to reinstate, those premiums are prepaid for much of the reinsurance. So ASI has an extremely robust reinsurance program. All of the players in that program are -- virtually all are A- rated or better. So we're very comfortable with the program. And that $45 million, they had targeted previously that retention to ensure that at any one event, less than 10% of their surplus was at risk. And, obviously, less than 10% of their surplus is a pretty small percentage of the combined entities, so a pretty robust reinsurance program.

We're very conscious of the concentration layers. But as we roll out the rest of the country, obviously, that will become less dependent on any one state. So there's a yes, and a no answer in there. Yes, because of where we are today, but ultimately, we want to be a meaningful bundled option for consumers, and Florida is a big state. And we will, as you just heard, make sure that we have all the right reinsurance. We're not going to put -- we're not going to go crazy. We know our objective here is to try to get customers and have them with us for a long period of time.

But don't assume that somehow we're going to only be marketing this in the sort of interior states or something like that. We're going to be as aggressive in states as we can be, but, hopefully, you would agree we will be very thoughtful about that and have the right level of risk sharing. That doesn't mean, and this is probably interesting, that we sort of got the layers that we have. We've got the results that we have. This may be sort of the pain point right now in terms of absorbing the results. And the real question is how do we feel about that volatility? I think we're getting, I wish it wasn't the case per se, but I think we're getting a sense of exactly what that volatility can mean to us. And my own encouragement -- just my encouragement, is given that we're monthly reporter, you're going to see that volatility just be a little bit more dramatic than you would over a longer periods of time.

Home is not really affected by the flood conditions in Houston. Some of our vehicles are, although that actually was a relatively manageable number. My memory tells me, about 450 losses directly related to the floods. So that's not a big driver of our results this month. So when you see that 135, the 85-50 split, think about the really nasty peril of hail. When hail gets to be the size that it is, it is warfare out there for roofs and for sheet metal and there's a lot of damage. That's just plain and simple. Hail is one of the most nasty perils that we come into, so comp is going to be dramatically affected by that. And as I said, we are -- we will take a couple of opportunities even though the numbers will be what they are. The first thing that we'll do is recognize that these are first-party claims. So in turn, we're going to have -- we're going to pay the loss, so we've got to turn that into a marketing expense. This is the time that we get with our customers and make their lives better after an upset, whether it's their roof or whether it's their windshield or whatever. So first thing the attitude we're taking right now is turn that into a marketing expense. We know how important retention is. We know the relationship when you give great service in claims and the future retentions, so that's the first thing. Second is take a look at our pricing, make sure that we're where we want to be. Certainly one spike of a month, we've seen that on numerous occasions. We're not at all concerned that we off-track for our commitments to shareholders, they are 96 or better. But we will reevaluate our CAT loss or CAT loads. And I would tell you if I was looking at the overall market, I see rate change in an overall basis, certainly some driven by big competitors. The last data point we have, February, around about a 4.5%, which is about 110 basis points stronger than earlier in the year. My suspicion based on knowing what's being filed, we will get more clarity on that from competitors for April and May. But we know there's been a lot of rate changes filed, so you could see that go a little higher. And I would say if I was giving you direction last call, I probably would've said think in the 4% range. Think about a point per quarter if you average it out. I'd say put another 25 to 40 basis points on that per quarter, as we look at the rest of the year. And we might be a little higher when you factor in CAT loss or CAT loads. But for the most part, I think this is all quite manageable for us."

That tracks with gasoline demand, that all makes reasonable sense. Now the question is, how high will it go? Well, people aren't going to drive infinite miles just because gas is cheaper, they're not going to drive to work more often. So this is more recreational and discretionary-type trips. And frankly, I think everybody can have a theory on that. I would just tell you that what has changed is in the first quarter, we are seeing miles driven as our Snapshot population, which is large enough to be credible, make the claim that it's different than the claim I made for the fourth quarter where we hadn't seen it be dramatic. In fact, it had flattened off. It is now showing increase. And we're going into what is really the high vehicle mile traveled part of the year. So it'll be interesting to see whether or not the discretionary usage continues to be higher or not. And this one, Bob, I think all I can do is report the news. We have incredible interest in this sort of thing because it makes a big difference. But whether I could say that we're seeing a dramatic change in frequency simply because of that, no, we take it as it comes.

You guys have had a really strong, really -- probably 6 months here with growth rates rising. I'm wondering if you can help us a bit to segregate it because there's a lot of moving pieces. And I think the big picture question I'm sort of struggling with is how much is the cyclical story because of the environment? And how much is structural and the impact of your initiative -- of the various initiatives? And so when I think about it, it would be really helpful to get your sort of color on how much you think it is a function of kind of just the competitive environment changing around -- other folks taking pricing maybe on the first point. But then you obviously have a lot of retention initiatives under way the second. And then you got new products, whether it's Snapshot or homeowners. I imagine these are having some impact, and -- probably more Snapshot than homeowners at this point. But what I'd love to get from your perspective, as we think about looking forward, how much of this is kind of a cyclical upswing in the growth rates and how much of this is the impact of big sort of powerful initiatives working the way through?"

So I'm not sure I'm going to get as specific, but think about our October IR meeting is a better opportunity for us to address a lot of those issues. Frankly, some of them are a little bit tricky to -- but cause-and-effect to, but growth is actually, boy, sign me up for another first quarter like that one. I know we certainly has some hail at the end, but frankly, we also missed some winter. So no great consent there on 94.6 [ph] or whatever. The kind of growth rates we put together. Nice quarter. Why? The fact is it's not -- it's certainly not luck that other competitors take rate. We try to take rate at the right time and make sure we're always positioned. I use the analogy of the wave last time. We tried to ride the crest of the wave. That's sort of the underlying core of everything we do. So forget all the other initiatives. We've got to run the base business exactly the way we want to run it, and keep it at a point where we'll always be in a position to take advantage of market conditions when they swing our way. We expect always to grow. That's part of our two-pronged most important statement: 96, and grow as fast as possible. But when we get that opportunity that others are perhaps scurrying where we have perhaps got ahead, we'll take those opportunities and welcome them when they come. And then, second piece is you got to manufacture your own future growth. And the kind of things with Snapshot, you're more than familiar with Snapshot representing now almost close to 2 million policies being rated with Snapshot sort of fundamentals. So you've seen from the policies that I put in my letter. That's a material part of our book, and you know it's more material on the direct side than on the agency side. We've got some nice initiatives that we'll continue there with Snapshot. We've talked last time briefly about the app which we think can also give us an opportunity to reach out to yet some other customers that are perhaps not as comfortable with a dongle inside the car. We've announced something with General Motors that will kick off within about 10 days, where we have to actually collect vehicles -- vehicle data with General Motors. So we're starting to -- as I've always said, we're starting to worry more about just the data, the algorithms and the impact on rating, less about the method of collection. So Snapshot has got some real gas in the tank, and we'll continue that. Obviously, our brand strength, we continue to push on that, and we've been able to do that in an environment where others have perhaps pulled back just a little bit on their advertising. So it seems some nice brand strength measures moving the right direction. You flip over into the agency channel. Actually, I'll stay with both for a while. Product advancements, we've talked primarily about 8.3, but we're always get -- we're always in the hopper for 4 -- 8.4 or 8.5. So we're continuing to develop that, probably the biggest move in the agency channel. Other than rate competitiveness is our bundling initiatives that we really have done so nicely within the direct side. Lots more gas in the tank there where we use a lot of carriers. In the agency side, you know the story on ASI. That's not a big factor in agency growth right now, so I wouldn't overplay that. But to the extent that we talk this time next year, I expect that to be a bigger factor in the growth. So growth initiatives are all on track, different stages of maturity. I will put Snapshot higher. We've started to see agent acceptance. I talked about that last time when you asked the question. We started to see the more recent states with agent acceptance frankly close to double what they had been previously, so we're starting to see that move in the right direction. So Snapshot moving along very well. Platinum in the agency channel really is starting to get a grip, and we'll talk about that more on our October meeting. And as long as we're very diligent with the pricing, clearly, we see, and we release numbers for at least you to get a flavor for what's going to happen in April. We're still a few days away, of course, for closing out April and getting you the information 8, 10 business days, but we know that's not going to be a great month. So we'll take a look at our rating overall. And I would say that probably we're still in a mode where we can think in terms of 4 to 5 in terms of annualized rate increases, which is a nice place to be. We gave you some indications on trends. So that core should keep rolling and the initiatives are doing well. I did not see a question specifically in terms of percentages relative to growth and that is hard to do. We have some feel, but I'm not confident to sort of push that out to a greater audience at this point."

In fact, a little piece of the story will be even different in my comments last time around. Frequency is pretty benign. And certainly, when we look at the BI, which I tend to worry a little bit more about BI frequency than anything else, so we're really in pretty good shape there. So we're not seeing anything dramatically go away. I would tell you wait another conference call or 2 to get too concerned about commentary on PIP. We've got some issues in New Jersey that we think may be driving that number a little bit differently than the true read. I won't say true read, true long-term read. So severity really is the play, and for the most part, not too much of concern there with bodily injury. I think the interesting point for severity is really the collision. And I think it's a little bit too early to suggest that we've clearly put in our Q that frequency was moderated by winter weather this year in the Midwest and the Northern states. That's absolutely the case. We also discussed last time that based on our Snapshot measuring, we were not seeing fifth -- the last quarter of '15 was overlaying the last quarter of '14 more on miles driven -- vehicles miles driven. That's changed in the first quarter. So we're actually seeing an uptick now on vehicle miles driven in the first quarter of '16 relative to the first quarter of '15. So that's interesting and that tracks very much with the public gasoline demand as well. So while we all speculate on the effect of the increased miles, and I've always cautioned that you need to know what kinds of miles, and we are seeing the longer trip miles be the primary driver of that. We may see a little bit of a tick up in frequency, and we certainly need to watch that for what I'll call short- to mid-term pricing. But we may, we may, and please stress that. We may really be seeing a more structural long-term change and in lower frequency, as we know, cars are getting safer. We've always talked about that. That's very, very hard to sort of measure on a month or even quarterly basis. But it would not be surprising to me to see in the future that we'll see a long-term structural decline in frequency, and quite possibly, as history has shown us, a similar offset on the severity. So those would be my primarily issues there. Right now, frankly, given that there has never been a time in history there hasn't never been some puts and takes on frequency and severity. This is a reasonably predictable of mile time. The only outlier perhaps is a little bit of PIP severity for us right now and little bit of collision severity that we'll take a look at. But that's sort of from a pricing perspective is being offset by frequency."

No thoughts. That doesn't mean we won't ever have thoughts. We're always going to consider that, but I think about the percentage of the overall book of business that we have, we currently have a small quarter share percentage. We have a single attachment point of about $45 million for any single event, and we have an aggregate attachment of $175 million. Those feel very much in proportion to things that we're willing to handle. Do I like volatility? Of course not. No one does. You don't and I don't. But if this was sort of in the realm of understanding of what likely could happen when we did something like this, absolutely, it certainly also plays to the fact that we're writing an awful lot of homeowners, not necessarily with some of these results that we have to report in-house. So the partners that we have, they're all obviously having those problems. So it's a different dynamic when we have it in the place that we absolutely need it, and as I said in my letter, it hasn't even been a momentary thought to be of any concern whatsoever. And there's no pressure from my perspective to take any less reinsurance, but equally no more reinsurance."

So we're really well positioned now. And yes, we are seeing a big increase in corp volumes. So if you think about new business incoming is either a function of an increase in conversion or quotes and in Commercial Lines is predominantly in quotes, which it generally means competitors are raising rates or just not choosing to quote the business. As far as where that goes, we can't know with certainty for sure. We are confident on our rate level. In some of the areas, we might take rates up a bit, but, obviously, you see combined ratios there that are very good.

Some of the things, even the federal mandate for emergency braking. Those sorts of things, it's impossible for me to think there isn't a real macro driver to yet make cars safer. So that's my primus for declining frequency. What's interesting is that over that time period, the market for private passenger auto has grown, and that is largely a severity offset to the, actually, it's even more than an offset, it's a gain, over the frequency decline. And those are interesting and accurate and observable facts. When you start to decompose it to try to sort of say exactly coverage by coverage what's driving it, that gets a little trickier.

The first layer is 45 million and the tower on the first event, we won't start quoting PMLs, but trust me that it is much higher than I would expect the average industry buys to. So going to the top, so to speak, is a highly unlikely event. Yes, we then have a pretest, pre-bond [ph] facility that is an aggregate of $175 million and that is for -- strong throughout calendar period. We have covered on second event similarly, not quite as high a tower, but we also prepurchase reinstatement on many of the layers. So now completely up the tower. But unlike many other players, once -- if we ever had to reinstate, those premiums are prepaid for much of the reinsurance. So ASI has an extremely robust reinsurance program. All of the players in that program are -- virtually all are A- rated or better. So we're very comfortable with the program. And that $45 million, they had targeted previously that retention to ensure that at any one event, less than 10% of their surplus was at risk. And, obviously, less than 10% of their surplus is a pretty small percentage of the combined entities, so a pretty robust reinsurance program.

We're very conscious of the concentration layers. But as we roll out the rest of the country, obviously, that will become less dependent on any one state. So there's a yes, and a no answer in there. Yes, because of where we are today, but ultimately, we want to be a meaningful bundled option for consumers, and Florida is a big state. And we will, as you just heard, make sure that we have all the right reinsurance. We're not going to put -- we're not going to go crazy. We know our objective here is to try to get customers and have them with us for a long period of time. And if we are more than comfortable letting someone take the layers above that and, hopefully, they'll make profits on that over a reasonable period of time because we'll achieve our objectives as well. But don't assume that somehow we're going to only be marketing this in the sort of interior states or something like that. We're going to be as aggressive in states as we can be, but, hopefully, you would agree we will be very thoughtful about that and have the right level of risk sharing. That doesn't mean, and this is probably interesting, that we sort of got the layers that we have. We've got the results that we have. This may be sort of the pain point right now in terms of absorbing the results. And the real question is how do we feel about that volatility? I think we're getting, I wish it wasn't the case per se, but I think we're getting a sense of exactly what that volatility can mean to us. And my own encouragement -- just my encouragement, is given that we're monthly reporter, you're going to see that volatility just be a little bit more dramatic than you would over a longer periods of time. There's not an ounce of us rethinking strategy or doing anything differently at this point. I shouldn't make it flippant in that case. It doesn't mean we haven't thought a great deal about it.

Home is not really affected by the flood conditions in Houston. Some of our vehicles are, although that actually was a relatively manageable number. My memory tells me, about 450 losses directly related to the floods. So that's not a big driver of our results this month. So when you see that 135, the 85-50 split, think about the really nasty peril of hail. When hail gets to be the size that it is, it is warfare out there for roofs and for sheet metal and there's a lot of damage. That's just plain and simple. Hail is one of the most nasty perils that we come into, so comp is going to be dramatically affected by that. And as I said, we are -- we will take a couple of opportunities even though the numbers will be what they are. The first thing that we'll do is recognize that these are first-party claims. So in turn, we're going to have -- we're going to pay the loss, so we've got to turn that into a marketing expense. This is the time that we get with our customers and make their lives better after an upset, whether it's their roof or whether it's their windshield or whatever. So first thing the attitude we're taking right now is turn that into a marketing expense. We know how important retention is. We know the relationship when you give great service in claims and the future retentions, so that's the first thing. Second is take a look at our pricing, make sure that we're where we want to be. Certainly one spike of a month, we've seen that on numerous occasions. We're not at all concerned that we off-track for our commitments to shareholders, they are 96 or better. But we will reevaluate our CAT loss or CAT loads. And I would tell you if I was looking at the overall market, I see rate change in an overall basis, certainly some driven by big competitors. The last data point we have, February, around about a 4.5%, which is about 110 basis points stronger than earlier in the year. My suspicion based on knowing what's being filed, we will get more clarity on that from competitors for April and May. But we know there's been a lot of rate changes filed, so you could see that go a little higher. And I would say if I was giving you direction last call, I probably would've said think in the 4% range. Think about a point per quarter if you average it out. I'd say put another 25 to 40 basis points on that per quarter, as we look at the rest of the year. And we might be a little higher when you factor in CAT loss or CAT loads. But for the most part, I think this is all quite manageable for us."

That tracks with gasoline demand, that all makes reasonable sense. Now the question is, how high will it go? Well, people aren't going to drive infinite miles just because gas is cheaper, they're not going to drive to work more often. So this is more recreational and discretionary-type trips. And frankly, I think everybody can have a theory on that. I would just tell you that what has changed is in the first quarter, we are seeing miles driven as our Snapshot population, which is large enough to be credible, make the claim that it's different than the claim I made for the fourth quarter where we hadn't seen it be dramatic. In fact, it had flattened off. It is now showing increase. And we're going into what is really the high vehicle mile traveled part of the year. So it'll be interesting to see whether or not the discretionary usage continues to be higher or not. And this one, Bob, I think all I can do is report the news. We have incredible interest in this sort of thing because it makes a big difference. But whether I could say that we're seeing a dramatic change in frequency simply because of that, no, we take it as it comes.

And we have a little bit of a mix shift intentionally to 4 higher transportation, 4 higher specialty. So with that, we want to make great adjustments to make sure we are ahead of the curve because we want to obviously bake in how those might play out and how those might develop. 
In addition, on the Commercial side, we've made a lot of investments that also put pressure on the expense ratio. So we've made some investments in the direct channel, in our brand, and more importantly, hiring in advance of needs, specifically on our CRM organization. So some of those things, we're seeing a little bit more pressure, but we feel good where we're at. We're taking a rate adjustment around 4% to 5% in the aggregate. Do you want to add anything, Glenn?"

So when we do our pricing indications, we are dialing in different margins by segment and we're also cognitive -- cognizant, excuse me, of the lifetime combined ratios for business we're putting on the books. 
So there are times when you're growing really fast in a segment that you could be putting business on at a lifetime 96, but that will cause your calendar year to go above the 96. We balance that across our various segments and look at the market opportunity across those segments and say, where do we want to grow given the scenarios we're looking at to, again, ensure we're below that 96 calendar year? So it's bringing together a bunch of different segments, different geographies as well.

There's been other periods where there was less inflation loss cost. And consequently, we didn't have the luxury of built-in inflation and premium simply due to the underlying loss cost. You're right. Those mix changes play a lot into what we see in terms of coverages, states, et cetera. You sort of hit on the #1 that we look at. But you can take out at least the effect of loss cost trends to understand what portion is the mix that we don't give you all the background around and actually loss cost trends.

That 96 calendar year target is a ceiling. And as Glenn, especially, has pointed previously, we have multiple segments to the business. We have different combined ratio targets for those segments. So when we do our pricing indications, we are dialing in different margins by segment and we're also cognitive -- cognizant, excuse me, of the lifetime combined ratios for business we're putting on the books. 
So there are times when you're growing really fast in a segment that you could be putting business on at a lifetime 96, but that will cause your calendar year to go above the 96. We balance that across our various segments and look at the market opportunity across those segments and say, where do we want to grow given the scenarios we're looking at to, again, ensure we're below that 96 calendar year? So it's bringing together a bunch of different segments, different geographies as well. And it's not that we're always targeting the exact same combined ratio by segment, we look at it before the year starts and target where we're going to have the growth, and again, ensure that calendar 96."

We all are -- have a very clear strategy where we want to go and how we want to make sure our investment in ASI and other investments that we've made come to fruition and more. 
So I've got to tell you, from being here a long time and seeing a lot of different things go on with the company, this is the most exciting time at Progressive I've ever been a part of. So I was a part of that strategy, developing what we talked about in terms of a destination era. And we've got to keep the pedal to the metal, and I'm thrilled. I don't know if you want to add anything, John, from your perspective?"

So when we say renewal, you can generally think, for Personal Auto, the 6-month term. For Commercial Lines and for homeowners they are predominately annual terms. But when we look across segments, we see different levels of disparity between the new business loss ratio and the renewal business loss ratio. And again, we're trying the lifetime price to that 96 or less, so we're considering that when we are making those selects with the product structure by segment."

I think you're all familiar with the Safe Harbor statement and if not, there's also a copy in your materials as the reference guide.
So this particular Investor Relations meeting represents a really big change. For many, many years, Glenn Renwick used to host this meeting, in fact, I think he started them. Last week, Glenn celebrated his 30th anniversary with Progressive, of which more than half of that he was our CEO and President. During his tenure as CEO, he tripled the company in size. So by most record books you would say, that is phenomenal and it is. But it's not just that. It's not just what Glenn did, it's how he did it. Always making sure to instill in us that desire to win but doing it in the right way, always following our core values. He always would set the bar higher every year for all of us. And then, he won't walk away, he will help us get over and that is really his legacy. So Glenn, on behalf of the 30,000 Progressive people, our shareholders and the customers we're privileged to serve, thank you for well being Progressive.
Okay, enough about Glenn. I thought what I do to start off is just remind you of our segments. So we outlined these several years ago when we first started talking about our destination area strategy. So I'll just swiftly go over those. The focus today will be on the Robinsons and we're really excited to talk to you about what we have done since he last met you in May of 2015.
So, Sam. Sam is the segment we grow up with, that we call him inconsistently insured. He is who Progressive -- he put us on the map, and we call him non-standard. He cares about rates, doesn't stay very long but he could come back. We love Sam. We want to write all the Sam's we can possibly write as long as it reaches our profitability goal.
Diane. Diane is a big part of the Destination Era. We talked in the past about her being a future Robertson. Diane is an auto customer and she rents. So she may have renters insurance with us and what we hope is that as her needs evolve and she buys a home, gets married, that we evolve with her. It's the notion of Diane graduating to be a Robinson. She's our largest customer base so the opportunity there is immense.
The Wrights. The Wrights are unbundled auto and home so they have Progressive home and someone else's auto. Again, we love The Wrights. We see them as future Robinsons because we hope that if they decide to shop their homeowners, they come with us and become a Robinson.
The Robinsons. That's what we today is all about and most of destination area is all about. The auto home bundle. The Robinsons are 40% of the market so the opportunity here is really great and we are really proud of how the momentum we've had in the last 18 months in particular in obtaining Robinsons.
Before we get started, what I thought I do as the new CEO is step back and just take stock of some objectives and some fundamentals that will stay the same during my tenure of things that might evolve. And clearly, with Glenn's leadership, I was a part of the team that developed the strategy around the Destination Era. So to make a turn and do something differently would make sense. I believe in this model, the execution has been great and I'm excited about our future. But things do evolve as a team as we know more.
When we start with our first and most important objective, profit. We want to make at least $0.04 of underwriting profit of every $1 of premium. 96 is essential to our culture. You're actually, sitting in there's called Studio 96 so you know how integrated it is into everything we do. It continues to be our most important objective and that won't change. There is, however, an added dimension with the auto home bundle. We're looking at how 2 independent margins can be optimized for that package. So while the 96 will stay the same, how it will be derived will absolutely evolve.
Growth. We want to grow as fast as we can with 2 constraints: One, the profit objective I just outlined; and two, our ability to service our customers. That second one is really important to us. So about 18 months ago, we had a -- 3 model on the streets, it was working, we were getting a lot more preferred customers, we also saw the opportunity when some of our competition pulled back to spend more on advertising, specifically, in the digital option. So we knew at that point we had a lot of opportunities to grow. We made a decision at that time to hire well in advance of need, so from the claims organization as well as our customer relationship management organization, both on the audit side and on the commercial side. And I'm so pleased that we did that because we did get that growth. We got that preferred growth. And in addition, we have things that happened that wouldn't necessarily planned for in the form of catastrophes. So we've been able to service our customers no matter if it's a cap or a regular just increase in losses based on growth.
It is sort of a rule here Progressive that whether on the claims side of the product side, if you think people were growing too fast, you're absolutely have to raise your hand and say, no more growth, we can't do this and we have done that in the past. I'm so delighted to say that this year, we didn't have to do that because we prepared and hired in advance of need. So when I think about growth and profit and that balance, year-to-date with audit being the most recent time frame with a 96.15% [indiscernible] net room premium growth. If we ended the year today, it's just a phenomenal year especially with the business that we've been putting on the growth. I'm extraordinarily happy. If we were the same margin at 96.2% and had 4% growth with the same set of circumstances, I wouldn't be as happy. If we were at 88% with 0% growth, I wouldn't be as happy. I'm very, very pleased with our growth. It's really sort of a perfect storm. So we have this new business and we talked and talked at the conference calls about the sort of new business hacks that you have won a combined wrench was higher in that first term and we had that coming at us and then, we had cat. This year, we have on our CR, 3 points of our combined ratio are in the form of cats, which is compared to this time last year, about a 1.5%. In fact, last month with Louisiana storm, it was over 4 points of our CR. So you can't plan for cat, I believe, I'm watching Matthew McConnaughy. You can't plan for, you can't plan for how you react to those cats. I am extraordinarily pleased with how we have reacted specifically the Louisiana storm. So about 3-weeks ago, a group of us flew down and spent some time in and Baton Rouge, Louisiana to make sure our employees were okay, our customers were okay, and I was just amazed. I was amazed that our cat team who went down there and just made sure they took it upon themselves to their customers back in their feet. We literally had employees who were laying in bed and they found out their home was flooded when they put their foot in water, yet they came to work that day to help our customers. In fact, as of yesterday, we have closed 96% of those flood claims, which is really amazing because they're complex claims, mostly total losses. So again, I'm so amazed that what we're able to do and what we're able to do. And what we are ready with whatever happens with Matthew, as of today, we have a plan and we'll figure it out. That's what we do.
So for me, again, just to wrap up in that part, profit growth, very happy, very proud especially with how we've been increasing our preferred business the Robinsons and we're going to talk a lot about that today.
I thought I'd take you to just a stab at some of the financial fundamentals. So it won't change. I think they work with our business plan. We want to continue to balance operating risk with the risk of investing in financing activities in order to have sufficient capital to support our growth. So that's the overview. On the operating side, we want to maintain pricing and reserving discipline. So when we talked about our pricing, we talked about managing targets. We talked about targets as the lowest definition, so whether it's on agency direct side, product state, we really segment our targets and that's another reason why I'm so positive about this new business because we look at the new business coming in and say, is it out of our targets? Great, that's going to run off profitably. So we're excited about that.
We want to have a premium to surplus at a below state of minimum requirement. So on auto, that's a 3:1 and about half of that for home. And on the loss reserving side, we want to make sure loss reserves are adequate and developed with a minimal variant. Year-to-date, very proud of that. We are pretty close but are limited on the favorable side, which is the side you want to be in. On investing side, we want to maintain a liquid diversified and high-quality portfolio. We managed our investments on a total return basis which are very consistent with how we report our comprehensive income. And on the risk side, we want to manage interest rate, credit, prepayment, concentration and extension risks. Lastly, on the financing side, we want to maintain sufficient capital to support the insurance operations. That's measured by maintaining a debt below 30% of total capital value. So we're just slightly over 20% right now and that's after issuing $500 million worth of debt in August. We want to neutralize dilution from equity-based compensation in the year of issuance and we do that by repurchasing shares. And finally, we were investing capital and expanding the business when it meets our objectives. A perfect example of this is our acquisition of ARX. We didn't necessarily feel like we had to have a homeowners or homeowners company. What we felt this would have to have access to that addressable market. That is a $300 billion market with auto and home. We needed to have access and it just so happened that we've been working with the company that we've had a high amount of respect for that had a very similar culture and so is a perfect relationship the start. So we're very pleased with the use of capital in acquiring ARX. Any use of under leveraged capital, we will buy back shares or issue dividends whether special or variable.
So let's get to the 96 since we are slightly over at this point, I want to walk you through how we look at it. This is just a basic refresher. So everybody gets to a 96, all of our customers it simply gets there but sometimes in vastly different ways. On the direct side, you can see we run a much higher combined ratio in that first arm. That's based on the fact that we have a little higher lost costs and some underwriting costs but most of all, we frontload all of our acquisitions cost in the direct side in that first term.
On the Asian side, we have a little bit more losses, a little bit more underwriting, but it's a relatively fixed commission expense, so much lower in the first term. I want to take you through the direct side, 2 ends of the spectrum. You have Sam and the Robinsons. Even to the same dynamic, they both blended a loss of the first term. But what is not evident is on a monthly reporting or even a quarterly reporting is the fact that this very high retaining business, the Robinsons, can stay 3 times, actually, more than 3 times longer than the Sam, are expanding our invisible balance sheet. So bringing on more of those Robinsons really build the intrinsic value of Progressive's.
So here's a basic income statement and it's directly accurate. So if you look at again, Sam and Robinsons, you look at revenue. Clearly the Robinsons are higher based on the fact that they stay longer and they have higher average written premium. If you look at the operating expenses, which of course are losses, LAEs, expense ratio, you quickly notice that neither of these equal to 96, those numbers represent a nominal value of the cash flow. So they're under 96. Our lifetime target, 96 combined ratio, for our direct business, we discount the cash flows to recover our acquisition expenses. So that will be different in different segments depending on how long they stay. The difference between those of course is our underwriting income. And then there's other income that we have, both on the investment side for both Sam and Robinsons and the commissions side for just the Robinsons. So whether it's affiliated partner like ASI or other homeowners curious, we get commissions when we have those bundles. So as you can see, the value of the Robinson, a pretax value is over 4 times that of a Sam. Again, we love Sam as long as we can make money on them but the value of a Robinson is extraordinary and the fact that we have grown Robinson substantially the last 18 months, really does grow the value, the intrinsic value of Progressive.
So for years, we have shared with you the invisible balance sheet. We talked last year about unearned lifetime and premium. So when we think about business coming on board, we look at new apps, for example. So in this year for ricin Robinson, we've grown you apps 30% and 40% respectively. That's pretty great. We look at average written premium. Our average premium has come up across all segments. and then, we look at PLE. This connectivity to be a spoiler alert for Andrew section 5 finally made a breakthrough attention purely. So both of those 3 things are really exciting. So we thought, we'd share with you one other metric that we look at internally that we call ULEP, under the lifetime underwriting process. So you'll see that the colors represent a segment so green for the Robinsons, pink for the Wrights, et cetera. On the Y axis, you see ULEP in million and on the X axis, you'll see the timeframe of which we're looking out. So why don't we start to grow right around that much of last year to our most recent data point. As you can see, the majority of our segments are growing substantially in ULEP, which again, is building that intrinsic value. In fact, the Robinsons are growing over 60%.
The chart underneath showed all of the segments year-over-year growth in ULEP and again, all are growing, so you can see the Robinsons are growing at a really quick clip. That's exciting for us.
I'm going to shift gears now and talk about how important understanding the Destination Era is to the 30,000 Progressive people that work on getting our customers indoor and making sure we nurture them along the way. We look at it in terms of our different frameworks. This is a framework for you, it's called our strategic pillars. So let me talk about the first one, our culture. Our culture is so important and it's not something you can really adequately describe unless you spent time on a Progressive, it's not something you're going to see on a spreadsheet but it is really special and it's really different and we know it's a competitive advantage. It's really at the root of how it started and that is doing the right thing and we want to win but you always want to do the right thing and it's really rooted in our core values. I am privileged to speak at every new hire class, actually, with that, with 1 Monday with a couple hundred new claims reps and my sole topic is our core value. I talked about 15 or 20 minutes, used some examples and then, let them ask questions. It's so important to me for them on their first day or the first week for their second week to know what an important part that is a Progressive, our value.
Earlier this year, many of us were in us to celebrate a milestone in Progressive, $20 billion in earned premiums and we've got face-to-face with over half of our employees, over 50,000 people just to celebrate and say thank you for all that you do and then of course talk about the next milestone and the next milestone and it was really rewarding and that again is a big part of our culture.
Our brand. We want to be the brand people want. So whether it's awareness or preference or consideration, those things are important but what we really want is to be able to, when people buy an insurance product from Progressive, that they feel confident that they've made the right position and they continue to feel confident as we service them and as we add more and more policies. Want to spend money on consumer marketing and customer marketing. We've talked often about how we wanted our customer marketing be as savvy as our consumer marketing. Andrew Quigg is going to talk a little bit about that today but we continue to resource that as an important part of nurturing our customers.
Competitive prices. In a business with all margins, this is very important to us. As we all around segmentation. You're going to hear a lot about that today, so John Sauerland is going to talk about our continued evolution with UBI and our segmentation and how important that variable is. Pat Callahan is going to talk about segmentation and the product model that we continue to elevate as well as our bundled competitiveness. Andrew Quigg will talk about segmentation of the customer part and using data to get out in front of our customers to know what they need when they need them. So this is really important part of our -- really central to things that we do is segmentation. We continue to hone in on that.
Another part of competent prices is really having a loss structure. So the claim side, we continued to have that near-perfect balance of cost and quality, so pushing down LAE while pushing up the accuracy and doing a fantastic job. On the expense side, we look at what we call non-acquisition expense ratio, so we continue to try to push that down, be more efficient and then, give that pricing advantage to our customers in the form of competitive prices.
And the last pillar is meeting the broader needs of our customers. What products do they want? When do they wanted, how do they want to shop? We want to measure we can have personalized service and products for each of our customers. So if you want to buy through an agent, yet service online or through a chat, we want to make sure if it fits your needs, we are there for you. We want to pick up the phone and say, yes, we can do that absolutely or whether or not we do that through our own products, so an affiliated products, we want to make sure that we meet the needs of our customers.
We use this framework for how we're going to go to the business, acquire, anchor, bundle and extent. We see growth in 3 ways: One, selling products to new customers; two, selling additional products to our current customers as the need arises; and three, keeping our customers longer. Let me start with acquirer. Acquires had initial relationships with us. So whether you come in with specialized product or an auto product, we just getting to know you got in fact, we are pivoting to the company and trying to be less about policies and more about customers and households. We're currently in 1 in 10 households in the United States and we would like to double that in short order. So we're doing that through acquiring more and more customers and understanding their needs and then evolving as their needs evolve.
Anchor. Our anchor products are our auto and our home. If you trust us with those assets, we believe that our relationship is much deeper. I started today talking about the opportunity, the $300 billion, almost $300 billion opportunity in auto and home. Now that we have access to that and how more and more customers coming in either at home or auto, we know we can deepen that relationship. It's such an important piece of future Robinsons.
Bundle, that's what we're going to talk about today. Our bundle our Robinson's, our auto and home together, and just even a little bit of increased market share on the bundled part, really has that big impact on the bottom line.
Lastly, extent. We have been talking about retentions for some time and we have made a significant breakthrough. Last year, if you recall, I announced that I asked Andrew Quigg to lead a team of people to try to increase our retention by 50%. He's going to talk about that today but we're extraordinarily happy with our results.
So need stand is about talking any longer about customers, say, 1 month or even 1 year. It's about having customers for decades. In fact, one of the things of our customers after the first renewals are decade customers so we're pretty pleased with that. About 1 month or so ago, some of us went out to observe some focus groups of our customers. So we listened to Dianes with renters, Dianes with out renters. We're trying to get some insights. We're Minneapolis in Dallas and we listened to some decade customers and they came because they love their brand and they love their price so that makes sense. They stayed because over that decade or more time with us, they have some sort in service with a had a claim what they need to call in the ginger vehicle or deductible and they were extraordinarily happy with the service. But what we heard from both of the decade customer groups was something I think really insightful. People are asking, why are you going to state even if they stay? Yes, because I'm proud to be a Progressive customer and that really hit us and we heard that over and over again and so we're working on filing that feeling and having it happen earlier in someone's tenure, have the feel that pride Year 3, Year 4, so we can continue to extend that and increase our customers. And in fact, we're looking at different metrics at some point, we'll continue to have policy life expectancy but why wouldn't have customer life expectancy? So that's where we'll evolve as our customers evolve.
Ultimately, our goal, our vision to become consumers #1 choice in destination for auto and other insurance. The next 4 speakers are going to talk about how we're going to do that on both the auto side and John Barbagallo will talk about how he's going to do that on the commercial side.
So now I'd like to start and invite our Personal Lines president, Pat Callahan up to talk about agency growth, our product and our bundled competitiveness."

So last year, when we talked, I laid out 3 key strategic priorities for our personal lines business.

So last year, when we talked, I laid out 3 key strategic priorities for our personal lines business. Those were restoring growth in agencies, increasing our bundled penetration and ultimately advancing in product development cycle. I want to give you updates in all 3 and what we'll do is start with an overall view of the market from an overall channel and market size perspective.
As Tricia mentioned, U.S. personal auto and home is rapidly approaching a $300 billion market and when you look at the independent agency share of that, it's a little more than 1/3 or about $100 billion of home and auto premium. And despite the fact that the technology adoption has been rapidly increasing the growth rate for direct distribution of personal lines products, the independent agency channel continues to grow premium. And that's due in part of broad distribution of the footprints but also a great value proposition from a breadth of products offered and there's a breadth of choice available. When you look more specifically at the homeowners market in the U.S, it's about a $90 billion market and that's about 90% sold to agents, more than 40% through independent agents. And as the #1 writer of auto insurance through the independent agency channel, we believe we're incredibly well-positioned to leverage our strength in the channel, combined with ASI's property offerings, to become the #1 writer of auto and home insurance through the agency channel.
Last year, I told you that we restoring growth and agency with a top priority for myself and the lust of other folks within a Personal Lines organization. So today, I'm going to show you some information that after a business drop slightly into 2014 and barely recovered into 2015, we've turned that Agency business around from a size perspective. And at this point, our agency auto business as well as ASI's home owner business through independent agents have both never before been larger. And if we zoom in on what's driving that auto improvement, we'll primarily start with at new business apps. New business growth is the lifeline our lifeblood of a great organization like Progressive. And as you see on the screen, midway through 2015, we turned new business positive on a year-over-year basis within the agency channel. Our new business growth continues to be up in the double digits and 8 year-over-year basis ever since.
New business growth originates from 2 primary metrics. The first is demand, so quoting. The second is conversion and our improvements in the agency channel are driven just about by equal parts of both, which indicate to us: number 1, we have a more competitive product in market; but number 2, that more competitive product is inducing agents to come to us more frequently to meet the needs of our clients. An absolutely fantastic combination within the channel.
But to understand how competitive we are overall in this channel, the best benchmark that we can use is how well we're converting on comparative raters. So last year, shared with you that the majority of our agency of coats we'll start on the comparative platform. I just on the level comparative rating software, desktop applications and aging softness, they run a real-time risk by risk auction most all the carriers to participate within that agent's office. And then, you'll notice that similar to what we saw from a new apps perspective, we're seeing increasing new business from a converging perspective on comparative Raiders, to positive if it around the same time was on you business apps turn overall and continues to be up solving the double digits.
The exciting part about this for us though is competitive rates absolutely matter, but competitive rates are not sufficient to drive conversion in the agency channel. Because of the plethora of choices that agents have, you'll also have to have competitive service, competitive ease-of-use and ultimately, competitive compensation. So we believe comparative rate or conversion is a fantastic benchmark for us to truly understand how competitively we are overall in the agency marketplace.
Last year at this time, I also shared that we have just introduced HR 3, our latest auto product model and while the early results were encouraging, we run a couple of states and we're seeing significant growth overall from the product model. At this point, about 18 months later, I'm thrilled to share that, that growth continues to come in at expected levels but it's had because situated on the more preferred end of the spectrum. So our growth rates with Wrights and with Robinsons are significantly higher than they are in our other segments. These segments are absolutely foundational to how we went to the Destination Era and our product design and product development is helping us get there.
But we all know that Progressive is known for new business acquisitions. With a great job. We'll probably do the best job in the industry. But the reality of it is, sustainable premium growth doesn't just come from acquiring new customers. We have to retain them. And I'm pleased to share that when you look at retention from the agency channel, we see as after a dip in early 2015 through about the middle of the year, we've been increasing our agency policy life expectancy month-on-month ever since. And Andrew will talk a little bit more about more details about decomposing that but the drivers of that are twofold: #1, it's mixed. So our mix of new customers have improved. We refer to that as in nature but equal parts of improvement in our PLE are coming from experienced improvements and relationships within our customer relationship management organization. Those investments are paying off and Andrew will tell you a little bit more about that later.
What's particularly exciting to me though when I look at our retention improvements is to overlay our rate activity during the same period of time. So your orange bars are annualized rate change within the agency channel for each month during that same period. What you'll notice is during the period time that our retention was improving, we were raising rates, somewhere between 2%, 2.5% to 4%. And we do that to keep up with dreaded to make sure that we continue to deliver our target margins but the combination of being able to improve retention while also increasing rates indicates to us 2 things: number 1, market conditions are fantastic for growth in the agency channel and we are really really well-positioned; but number 2, given the plethora of choices that agents have to move business 2 when rates go up, the fact that our rate increases are sticking indicates to us we've got stronger relationships that are forming the agency channel and that's a critical element of our long-term destination success.
In terms of the trust basis business, and trust is really a difficult thing for us to measure unlike any of our other metrics. But look at actions as opposed to words to understand how we're performing from a customer perspective. Number 1, are agents trusting us by placing their better customers with us. The answer is yes. Number 2, are they trusting us to interact with those customers on a regular basis? The answer is yes. More agents are joining in marketing programs for additional protection solicitation, et cetera. And number 3, in a recent survey of thousands of independent agents. They responded that increasingly Progressive has all the products to meet the needs of their preferred customers and more of those agents responded that they're placing their preferred customers with us. The turnaround agency channel was driven by a combination of product and stronger relationship building and we fully expect that the momentum that we established today will this turnaround while tearing into our second priority which is bundled penetration.
Growing bundled penetration is the key performance indicator of our Destination Era. Making progress selling both home and auto to our combined customers is essential to our long-term success. And the things you need to drive bundled penetration are number 1, available and competitive property insurance; number 2, available in competitive preferred auto rates; number 3, the systems tools and experiences that enables customers and agents to find, quote, buy and ultimately own a Progressive policy or a Progressive bundle. We'll stay with the agency channel for now and talk about where we're headed from a bundled penetration perspective.
Last year this year we were in the process of deploying is less poverty products countrywide. Since we last talked, we've added 9 states and by the end of this year, we'll be in 39 states representing about 95% of U.S. homeowners, great coverage for where we are in the rollout. We go to market from an agency perspective with our product through 2 tiers of agencies. Those 2 tiers of agencies are Progressive advantage agencies, Progressive Home Advantage agencies and our Platinum agencies. 2 tiers Progressive Home advantage, literally more distributed, they are our original property agencies and Platinum is much higher tier, more highly selective tariff agents and much stronger partnership with this. I shared with you last year that Platinum is a brand-new program that we're introducing last summer that combined consumer benefits of annual policies, more competitive rates through multi-policy discounts and agent benefits, such as easier-to-use systems and higher compensation. We continue to deploy the Platinum program as well. Platinum by the end of this year will be in 34 states, which represent about 80% of U.S. homeowners and because preferred auto and property availability are prereqs to the Platinum rollout, Platinum will always trail that we will love than a property products. But overall, we intend to continue pushing on a countrywide basis so we have full deployment of preferred auto, available property and Platinum on a national basis.
But with Platinum, it's less about the states that we're in and much more about the agencies that we're in within those states. So over the last year, we've identified selective and ultimately unboarded more than 1,000 agencies into our Platinum program. Based on those agencies, access to preferred customers, their bundled goldenseal processes within the agencies and their willingness to commit the placing significant portion of their bundled volume with Progressive. But to be clear, Platinum rollout will be a metered rollout. Platinum has a scarcity and a scarcely distributed offering. So agents will be actively managed by our sales reps to ensure they're using the Platinum program and understand it and using it for bundled business within their agency. So we will continue to grow Platinum but we will grow Platinum as agents are using it effectively in market.
I also shared last year that because of ease-of-use for bundled quoting is a key element of our Platinum offering. We were starting to build a new Platinum quoting program. And earlier this year, we launched Platinum quoting, which brings to the agents desktop for the first time, bundled quoting of Progressive auto and ASI's home, which enables the agent to ultimately save time, share data entry screens and external data fill and have more competitive messaging around the bundled economics available to the agent and making it easier for them to message those bundled savings to the customer. Now to be clear, this is a pilot, it's in 3 states today. We learned a bunch to date, we continue to learn from the pilot and ultimately will build those enhancements indoor quoting systems over time.
But the $1 billion question all of our minds and exactly all of your minds is, is black Platinum working? We've attacked the preferred agency a few times before and we've learned from those attacks. We've learned from those opportunities that ultimately, for us to introduce a brand-new preferred offering into some of the best agencies in an incredibly competitive independent agency channel, we would have to change agent behavior, which we all know isn't simple and frankly it take time. So to understand with Platinum was working, we look at the 2015 cohort of Platinum agents. Those were appointed as but that I'm agents June 2015, liquidator the class of 2015, if you will. And we looked at 2 key performance metrics for that group of agencies whether the bid the rest of our property insurance agencies. What you're seeing in the screeners 2 lines, the blue line is our Platinum them agencies, the orange slanderous RPG agencies and the metric here is preferred auto production. While you know this but in those lines, there's #1, the blueline starts above the orange line, not surprisingly, more productive agencies were selected to be Platinum in the first place. But it looks that after the vertical red light, this increase in separation for in perspective between our Platinum agencies and are non-Platinum other property agencies.
So this continues into our second key performance metric and that's new business home and auto bundles you'll see exactly the same pattern. Blue, Platinum agents started above our pH agencies and the gap continues to widen as our sales reps message to benefit Platinum, are agents that are understand to benefit the Platinum and for their customers based to experience some of the benefits that come from by interval Platinum agencies. The gap between that blue and orange line is what we referred to as a Platinum difference. And that Platinum difference not just present with the agents reported during 2015. If you look at the entire network of more than 1,000 of Platinum agencies compared to a Platinum property agencies. You'll see that our Platinum agency plant is responsible for creating more than 3x of the number of bundles per agent per week then are not Platinum agencies which absolutely tells us that Platinum is working.
What you'll also notice on this graph though is the trend is upward, anywhere improving over time, none was bounced around from the month but we're on an upward trend. And the deadline on the screen indicates rent we expect a program to build the from a success perspective. You'll notice we're not there and that you have exist but would know what we're going to do to close that gap. The primary driver of that is a bundled competitiveness.
We're not surprisingly, when we relaunch our programs, we started collecting data from the market as to where we were competitive and we're not competitive. And the great thing is with 1,000 agencies, using their quoting systems to call it ASI properly in Progressive auto, with a data under BR and when we our next keen. Our next conversion as a primary metric in the latest is that represent about 1/3 of our premium. We're highly competitive in the my light auto, the my line home and on the bundle for an individual risk. And those agencies, our focus is to sale of our customers but looking forward, the leader for home, selling out if they're looking for auto, selling auto or try to sell them to bundle because we are highly competitive.
However, in about 2/3 of the country right now, we're highly competitive what Madeleine home our modeling auto but not yet as competitive on the bundle for individual risks. This shouldn't come as much surprise given we had a highly successful model light auto business to be combined with highly successful Madeleine home business and the overlap between the 2 isn't quite where we need to be. But the bottom line is we know exactly what needs to be done and we're collecting a ton of data that enables us to map out how to integrate our products more closely to make sure that we're more competitive at the individual risk on a country wide basis.
So for us, the momentum that we saw as we were bringing our agency turnaround ultimately in the bundled competitiveness, combined with the infrastructure investments we continue to make in he agency channel and the early success of what we're seeing from about their perspective gives us a ton of confidence to where we are absolutely the right track from a bundled penetration perspective and very, very well-positioned to attack that $100 billion independent agency home and auto opportunity.
With that, said, we have another highly successful auto distribution channel and that's direct. So I want to update you on where we are from a bundled competitiveness perspective within the direct channel. To be a direct customer destination for auto and other insurance, we not only need to have all the parts we need throughout their lifetime but they have to be aware of them and understand that we have them available before they have a lighter than the triggers demand for that product. So they come to us first as opposed to shopping and market. We generate awareness for products with a customer's and 3 primary ways. Mass media advertising. The reach is not only our current customers but also reaches future customers. Point-of-sale messaging and this is both in our sales systems as well as our servicing systems, so both our current customers and potential customers will visit to get a quote understand the breadth of products available and economic benefits of buying through us.
And finally, targeted marketing, we have a ton of my line customers, that we are now offering the bundled package and the complementary product, to messaging and savings and ease of use benefits of bringing more of those products to Progressive overtime.
This awareness investments coupled with a general shift in consumer buying trends toward direct and some internal messaging that gets our employee's taking holistically about protecting our customers household needs continues to drive up demand for direct property insurance, both online, on the phones with current customers and with future customers. But with demand increasing demand for the wreck property products crates no value unless we can meet that demand with adequate supply. And frankly, in early 2015, our ability to meet the demand for Direct Property was less than what we wanted it to be. Only about 4 or 5 customers coming to us for Direct Property could even get a quote. Part of that is just endemic with the property insurance business. Unlike Progressive, there's virtually no property writers who have similar or broad acceptability. Property writers have a relatively mixed focus and some a not accept 20%, 30%, 40% of available risks. That's an unacceptable outcome for our direct customers. So what we've done all the time is work, #1, with our carrier partners that expand accessibility and improve rallying of traffic online and to our partner call centers to improve availability of the recording. So it's particularly exciting of this chart is the yellow line. the yellow line is our competitive advantage agency which is our in-house agency that sells multiple products from a property perspective across multiple property partners. Over the last 1.5 year, we've made significant investments to expand the footprint of that agency by adding 14 states and adding more than 100 state and carrier combinations in order to drive up availability of this, of our property products. At this point, we can meet the needs of about 95% of current or future customers who contact our agency. And we believe that agency model is a superior shopping experience for anyone shopping direct-to-consumer property insurance because it combines the technology enabled ease-of-use of a direct writer with the breadth and depth of an independent agency. We believe strongly in that model and we continue to invest to expand capabilities within our Progressive Advantage Agency.
In the last 18 months, we've more than doubled staffing and when calls come in, we route an increase percentage of those to the agency to the point that at this point, we've more than tripled the sales over the last 18 months through the agency. We will continue to invest in that space and continue to use this superior business model to delight our direct customers and from a bundled penetration perspective. But for us, bundling is not just about home and auto. It's also about home renters and auto. So in our world, we enjoy an advantage position with younger, simpler needs, auto insurance customers, many of whom don't yet own a home. So having a renters insurance available for those customers enables us: Number 1, to establish our property insurance relationship with customers and to be able to meet a broader need of those customers earlier in their insurance shopping journey. Life of Insurance will never be a massive business for us. It's only about a $4 billion market. But for us, it is a strategic investment. As renters and insurance is absolutely a goodly property product towards the coming of bundled home and customer with us. We have evidence that those who bundle renters and auto with us are significantly more likely to keep their auto with us and convert that renters to homeowners policy if and when they eventually buy a home. So from a graduating Diane perspective, this is a strategic play for us and one we continue to invest in over time.
We are absolutely thrilled that the acceleration of our penetration from a bundling perspective within our direct book of business. Today, more than 1 million direct customers trust us to provide property and protection and the key performance metrics for our Direct Property business increasing cold starts, bundled new apps and bundled pets are all up more than 20% on a year-over-year basis. And with investments we continue to make to drive demand and then, meet that demand with ample supply and great experiences, we have every confidence we will continue to accelerate bundled penetration within the direct book of business.
The third priority I shared with you last year is it continues to advance or science of risks and segmentation. Customer segmentation, matching rate to risk and pricing accuracy are in our DNA and absolutely a key source of competitive advantage for Progressive. It's been that way for decades and what of the things that truly differentiates and distinguishes our offering. As we look to invest in rate accuracy and pricing segmentation, we recognize that the value creates through more competitive new business pricing which lowers our customer acquisition costs on the fixed advertising base. It increases our retention even if customers shop and get to play similar coverage at a similar or lower price and it creates that adverse election within the marketplace, 1 the trifecta of opportunity for Progressive. So when we think about the product of element space, we focus on 3 areas, the first is rate accuracy, the second is coverages and the third is improving customer to drive policy life expectancy. These builds, bundles are these enhancements in the product model and deploy them like building blocks, stacked on top of all the segmentation that existed in the prior model.
Our pipeline from a roadmap perspective is absolutely robust from a product development standpoint.  We're currently on A3 in the majority of our states. A3 was designed to be more competitive on preferred households and will the product customers. You already heard how that's performing in market. We are thrilled with how it's working.
A4 is deploying currently. Tomorrow morning, you'll be our 7th state elevating for A4 and 8 4 brings with it more stable rates for our renewal customers as well as advanced segmentation based on building, claim experience and vehicle history. 8 4 5 is 8 4 with some additional protection for transportation network company drivers, Progressive customers who happen to work for Uber and lift. And finally, 8 5 which is under development right now and will launch in early 2018, will bring with it much more competitive rates for households with people as well as -- I'm not going to tell you what else us in this, you're going to come back next our to learn more about that. But rest assured, we're not taken our foot off the accelerator from a product development perspective and then, to continue to lead from a segmentation perspective. But that segment vision of the world creates no value if we can't get it to market quickly. And while we've always been known for our nimbleness and ability to deploy our products to market quickly, we recognized from a core value perspective that excellence is doing things better today than we did yesterday and we continue to invest to advance our speed to market. So in the last 24 months, there's been a joint research and development and ITP reengineering our process, product development and product deployment and since we last talked in May, they have been able to double the annualized rate with which we can deploy our product innovation into the market place. So what that means is when we talk in May, we have 3 states on a 3. Today, we have 32 states. As of tomorrow, we'll have 7 states on A4. When we talk next year, we'll have 38 states on A4 and A5 will be spun up just about to hit the market. This is a lethal combination of product innovation and speed to market enables us to widen our lead over the competition. And when we look to assess how well we're doing relative to the competition, we start by looking at some industry data. The industry data you're seeing on the screen is loss in LAE for PCI, essentially about 2/3 of the market, 9 of the Top 10 carriers and the orange line and then, Progressive in the blueline. What you will notice is that the environmental activities, the economic recovery, gas prices, severity on low pricing cars due to safety equipment, trend in the industry has been declining since the middle of 2012. You'll also notice that the blueline, the progress of Lawson LAE, we've been competing and that exact same environment and the reality of it is results have been rock solid. The difference between these 2 lines is products segmentation. It's our ability to better understand what risks we're ensuring and better sort out which ones are high-cost from low-costs. What that means in the marketplace is those in the orange line, the rest of the market as their loss costs declining and they don't know which risks are driving there was lost cost up, and when they raise base rates and with a rate base rates, our best customers and their book of business shop and they can often find a lower price with companies like us that are better segmented.  We're on the cycle over and over enough times and they're left with residual risks that they're still under price balance and press the dramatically high than the market on any of the better risks that we ensure. What it also means though for us is today, we enjoy about a 10 point gap in loss LAE related to the market and when you combine that with a technology enabled expense gap, specifically in the agency channel, what it enables us to do is combine incredibly competitive pricing end market, which drives the growth of the business with wider underwriting profit margins than the overall industry, delivering on our profit targets. A great combination for an insurance business.
Now I also told you last year, that emerging data sources for an opportunity as opposed to a threat to Progressive. And since making our majority investment in ASI or ARX, we've been building a massive data set of home and auto risk characteristics in home and auto loss characteristics. What this has enabled us to do is improve model accuracy, identifying new segmentation and reduce our rating costs. An early example of how we're leveraging this data set was a waiting variable that was highly predictive of home loss frequency. To the tune of about a 30% difference in pure premium. As a way to identify that if I quickly jumped on it and deployed at the market. So it's providing a segmentation risks as a bundled household that they wouldn't normally have had absent the joining of this data. And to be frank, we are just getting started to get into this massive data set and fully expect that the joint R&D team between ASI and Progressive will leverage this treasure trove of information to identify new ways to assess and ultimately, price and improve rate accuracy for our household bundled pricing.
Last year, I shared with you some fairly aggressive goals for our overall business with the turnaround in our Agency business as well as a great performance from our direct business, coupled with the investments we're making to increase model penetration across both our direct and our Agency business, robust but development pipeline, or future segmentation enhancements and the fastest speed to market on top of our ailing industry, I am absolutely confident that we are incredibly well-positioned to become consumers #1 choice in destination for auto and other insurance.
With that, I'll bring John Sauerland now to talk about Snapshot and data management."

It's been a while since we debut at deep dive on Snapshot when usage-based reading programs.

It's been a while since we debut at deep dive on Snapshot when usage-based reading programs. We have a new model in the marketplace, which are results around that but also sure more holistically why Snapshot is so powerful for Progressive.
Later this year, we will roll out a new delivery mechanism to experience for Snapshot and that is via mobile. Ultra the rollout plans there, we're very excited about that but also share what our expected benefits from that rollout are. But overarching all of this is something that I think is even more powerful than Snapshot, sort of a benefit from Snapshot to them if you will and that is the big data management and analysis capabilities that we've developed around Snapshot, there now paying dividends across the organization and I believe can be a source of competitive advantage on forward.
If you're familiar Progressive, you know that the other history of innovation, I would say that Snapshot is a result of that history of innovation. We started out many years ago installing this football sized device in the trunks of some cars in Texas, prove out the concept a little bit, Moore's Law, spanking of technology, were able to get the device that can plug on in OPB court in the vehicle. Unfortunately, back and connectivity was at issue. We mailed this device to our customers along with a cord and ask them to go find a 6 months after finding the device in their car, plugs that cord in the device and into their desktop more likely back and by the way and within likely join upload the other dial up modem. Obviously, not a big hit. What was a big hit was when we're able to get the technology and especially the cell chip well enough and the cell transmission costs low enough so that we had virtually real-time transmission of the data. In today's world, we sort of call that the Internet of things. Back then, it was just via cell towers.
Today, we're going to be moving to mobile, we do talk about that in a bit so I want spent time here now. The other model for Snapshot is that we're device, not VAR phone, it's directly from the vehicle.  We're happy to say we're actually, in the market today with that model with General Motors. General Motors is the only manufacturing to my knowledge with that capability today. As you all know, technology takes a long time to move into the fleet. This won't be a broad-based model soon. But no less we're excited to be in partnership with GM in market in Australia and all talk more about that in a moment.
If Moore's Law allows you to shrink that analogy, I believe there's going to be a corollary to Moore's law that says in the data coming out that technology doubles every 2 years or even every 1 year. You know 2.2 trillion records in our database from Snapshot. 2.2 trillion records. If you think about those records as roads in a spreadsheet, those roads widening. The blue area on the chart here is GPS data. We don't today rate GPS, we are collecting it for research purposes and that widens, the data fields, if you will. and widens the data field if you will. Deduce mobile, will be collecting even more information. Mobile will take that with that record 20 full for what it is today with that, the explosion here is incredible. It's been a challenge, it's also huge opportunity. We'll talk more about that in a moment.
But let me take a step back first and make sure I have everyone grounded in Snapshot. We have 2 models in the market place today. It's a bit to put 0 model and a 3.0 model. This report 0 model has ruled out with a 3 so the majority of the countries today is Pat Callahan just mentioned, 2 years. The 2.0 model you wouldn't give you a discount when you updated to Snapshot, you are can to progress and with an agent agreed with the Snapshot program, the today's later, we give you a discount based on your 30 days driving behavior. Drop to 5 months more, we lock-in for the rest of your tenure with Progressive. 3.0, we offer a participation discount. It varies by customer segment, we'll talk about that in a moment, then you drive for 6 months and again, we locked you in 2 year discount or a surcharge. So that's a big change but the 3.0 model. The 2.0, we're very concerned about establishing consumer acceptance for the concept because we have been the leader in UBI. We've got in consumer acceptance. Where to place our consumers are willing to opt in to the program, as you'll see, even if there's a chance for a surcharge. So in the 2.0 model, we had after 30% discount, 0% surcharge. In the 3.0 model, we had up to 20% discount it up to a 10% surcharge. So similar range, very different model. The 2.0, but to keep us in over customers partook at a discount and in 3.0  about 75% of our customers got a discount and in 3.0, more than half of our customers received more than a 10% discount, which is pretty material in the auto insurance space. So given your perspective on the different models, keep that in mind as we talk about results and also give you a little bit more perspective on the distribution of our customers driving behavior. The results. They're good. New apps are up, I can't attribute all of this to Snapshot, however, as I mentioned, the 3.0 model rolled out at the same premise it by 3, we made a lot of judges here, we can these it out completely but you Snapshot a business jet Snapshot graph in front of you. This is a hope you noticed that agency apps are up more. We've been challenging around agency adoption of Snapshot for many years now, frankly, the inclusion of an upfront discount, a participation discount helps us a lot in the agency channel. As Pat told you, it's largely driven by comparative layers, some like option environments, the more we get competitive rates up there with new business, with better chance we have of getting customers into Snapshot.
I mentioned the discounts, the participation accounts vary by customer set. Ranges from about 2 percentage per Sam's, up to about 6% for Robinsons, we need to define that participation discount not based solely other customers marketing target their but that's the average of the discount for each respective segment. Not surprisingly, conversion is up more on the upper end of the spectrum. Even with 2.0, Snapshot customers converted a higher rate than non-Snapshot customers. So be interested in Snapshot improves your conversion rates all else equal and in 3.0, we have is we that continuing but we also seeing a greater disparity not surprisingly on a more preferred end of this with a participation discounts are higher. While we look at new apps by customer segment, here again, the mix of SKUs a bit toward the preferred end. But what I hope you also notice is that the flow, if you will come of that relationship in the Agency business is higher, it's deeper. We're getting more Robinsons in the mid-50s and the Snapshot program, Pat and Tricia told you, Robinson segment is the largest segment available to us on the Personal Lines space and its the lowest market share. So to the extent we can get more customers in here, that's fantastic.
Something not necessarily specific to trio but I think a representative of where we're at today when it comes to usage-based trading is the fact that it is broadly acceptable. And I'm just trying to you 1 example here and this is age. So when you look at by customer segment, the percentage of folks 18 to 22-year-old who swapped into Snapshot is about the same as the percentage of folks were 55 and above. 100% accessible to marketplace for sure but broadly acceptable.
So hopefully, I convinced you that Snapshot is helping us on preferred, it's helping us grow. I often get the question and even got it in the lobby before this. Can you tell me how was it helping? But understood that for me. Some facts, the most powerful rating variable we have ever seen and with 3.0, even more powerful than 2.0. So our analysts were working hard in improving those algorithms. 3.08 were predictable losses than 2.0 and 2.0 was way more predictive than any other variable we've seen. Another fact. We provided more than a $0.5 billion of discounts to customers with Snapshot inception to date. More than $0.5 billion worth of discounts. Those folks think, well, that seems to be a benefit for a customer, how is that a benefit for Progressive? To help answer that, and you take you back through a slide that we showed you actually, in 2012. This chart shows the loss ratio and the retention rate across discount buckets, if you will for Snapshot customers. So we have 0% to 30% discount along the horizontal there to the left of that 0, we have non-Snapshot customers. So think of them as your base case. So Madrid of our customers don't ask into Snapshot, so that's a robust base case and what do we see? This is again to .0, when a customer got a 0% discount from us, they will actually, do a surcharge. But again, we didn't do that for consumer acceptance reasons, the highest loss ratio is for customers with 0 discount. As you see, the last ratio improved marginally us go to the right. So we look at the scale of this graph, that loss ratio is much better for the best drivers who are receiving the biggest discounts.
When you look at the retention lines, the consumers were expected to receive a discount but did not, 0 percentage, lowest retention. Those customers read more frequently and when they leave, where do they go? They go to our competitors. By and large, our competitors are not priced for this. So those customers are going for more than likely a lower rate than we're offering them, so we believe their material price at the competitor.
You go out on the right, not surprisingly, retention improves a lot as you get people bigger discounts but the big 2-point sale you have to take away here is the least profitable customers and frequently, the unprofitable customers leave most frequently and most profitable customers are way more inclined to stay.
In auto insurance, I would tell you, in any business model, if you have a program where your best, most profitable customers are most inclined to stay in your least profitable or even on preferable customers find their way to your competitive, that's a great program. Now Pat Callahan showed you the industry loss ratio graph, Progressive was here, right, the industry had a pretty decent slope up. This isn't the only reason but this is the kind of segmentation that we believe drives that disparity in the marketplace. So let's look at 3.0. Here, you can see where no surging those customers were at the lost and so our loss ratio for the customers goes down. Customers goes at the better high end of the spectrum, higher discounts. Again, better loss ratio, quite as well as with 2.0 but still exceptional. You look at that scale and when you look at retention, because customer changing customers, they leave even more preprinted and he did in the previous model and debt surprisingly, consumers were offering the discount to continue to stay at a much higher rate. So Snapshot is getting us more preferred customers. It is helping rating segmentation adverse selection a lot. I hope you got those points.
Our next step for Snapshot's mobile. We've been very deliberate in coming to market with mobile. If you think about the challenge here and mentioning driving behavior with a phone, its of his new money. Some of you take the train, some of you takes the bus, you could be with your friends, you can leave your phone at home, what have you come a lot of challenges and it wanted to make sure we got this right. There's been a ton of testing. And just to give you an appreciation of those challenges, what you're looking at here is an example of a real tough case, so an individual with the app in the device in their car. This is about 2 months of driving, each row represent a day, 24 hours across the horizontal axis over a day, not surprising, and what do we see? So the blocks are purple, that means the device and your phone are showing a trip. They're matching up. If the block is blue, that means the devices just showing a trip, not the phone. Red is the opposite. Red issuing the trip, not the device. So you say, okay, it looks like we have a commute pattern, right? 5 days a week, we drive to work and we drive home. And with a car phones and they're on. We don't see that on the community, right? what else do we see? Well, there's some blue sessions, blue sections later we can maybe that is driving the car, maybe the kid is driving the car. The red dot is a little very jigging to me. My conclusion, I don't this text case but this person has a regular scheduled Monday launch date at the buddy dress. Bunch that come interesting things. But how do they come for this and still have really active driving data to radar rate. We worked with a ton of app developers with the technology is amazing. The app is able to lend the driver fingerprint,, if you will. at once it pretty quickly, have an app and I can tell when much others driving the car, when my spouse is driving the car, it excludes those trips. Thankfully, for my own personal mind. You get the point. How about this, we can look after trip starts back to see if the driver got in the left side of the car or the right side of the car. Technology in phones is amazing now, we worked really hard to make sure this is right. Let me give you a picture of the rating reason behind why we work so hard to make sure this is right. We work with a number of different schools developing apps. Heartbreaks our most important rating of data field for UBI. So you want your phone to reflect a break about the same time as you want your device to reflect a break, right.
The graph on the right shows pretty tight relationship, back on the left, not so much. I'm really happy to tell you that we chose the app on the right. And I'm almost happy to tell you that we're pretty confident that the competitor is using the app on the left. Reports that we got it right. With and have it right, where only 2 states out before the end of the year. We expect to have the rest of the country rolled out in the first half of next year. We think it's a great rating tool, we also know it's going to be a better consumer experience. Today, we nail a lot of devices to customers, not all of them come back but the customer has to take it, back set, put it in their car, extracted from Beagle, nail it back to us, it's a logistical challenge and it's costly. We previously told you the technology expense is a current model is about a point on the P&L. Mobile will completely eliminate technology expenses for sure but it will materially reduce those costs. I mentioned to you the long-term model we believe is right for the vehicle. Again, this will be  broad-based model anytime soon because of the base of technology penetrating the fleet. But it's fantastic model, it's working really well, it's a small so far, admittedly. General Motors customers model, you have 2015 and greater at this capability, all are voluntary. They can opt in to sharing 90 days of driving behavior with possessed. If it looks like we'll get that customer a discount, we'll offer them a quote. If it looks like they wouldn't do a discount, we won't offer them a quote. Think back on that loss ratio curve. The customers we're selling to here have a very high average discount. What was true about the most highest average discount customers in a programs, they're the most profitable, right. We've got a model here where we can just sell to the most profitable drivers with their current algorithms. It will evolve and probably tailor to the various methods of measurement but today, it's a great model, we're really excited to be at market with General Motors and we're excited to be talking more about that in the future.
I told you that the data explosion have been rapid. I tell you that it's been a challenge for us, frankly. This graph shifts to terabyte is a posting trillions of records. Back in 2013, our analysts were struggling because it was taking them almost a month to process the Snapshot data set, almost a month. They literally had analysts trying to create many server farms into closets near their workspaces. We got smart, we brought in the right technology, we developed the talent internally, our processing time dropped dramatically, going up a little bit as the data set grows further, but the better use here is that we are now using this technology across other parts of the company. While we were together last year, Pat Callahan told you we were starting to look at claims for us using big data techniques. We now have that fully rolled out. Every night, we are looking at hundreds of data elements through our claims filed, through our policy files and looking for the potential for fraud. We don't identify fraud with this model, we refer to an individual who does the further investigation and does the right thing handling the claim. We're using traditional data but we're also using what's called unstructured data which, in this case, means text. So our claims adjusters are typing in notes into our systems, this minds the text and joints that with other data to look for potential fraud. What you're looking at on the screen here is a network of claims that we previously identified as fraudulent, rented to the system overnight, the claims in blue pops out, suspect claim. Our Adjuster does more investigation. 3 vehicle accidents, fixed injuries claimed in this accident, further investigation revealed at the damage of the vehicles did not match the facts as reported by the injured parties, we are able to deny the claim. Previously, our model here has been if it looks suspect, the adjuster refers to an expert. I can't tell you when we missed this one but I can tell you we bet we would've missed this one and I can tell you, we're looking at a lot more claims much more with that zero in sort of approach today than we previously did.
One more example of that arena. We previously identified a suspect claim, system overnight and we find 1 data element, and with 166 other policies in our database. What we have identified here a cover further investigation is what we call A Street broker. In urban areas were auto insurance is very expensive, there are enterprising individuals, we use our systems to take their information and create an ID card and sell you that ID card for a couple hundred bucks cash. They generally are using a stolen credit card or another means to buy the policy or immediately cancel the policy so what we have here is what 166 people will probably not at the right state with their auto, we're able to reach out to those customers and to the right thing and get them in the right place.
Another quick example, you probably know that big data has been in play in the U marketing online marketing space for a long time and we've actually, enjoyed the benefits of the vendor, a third party solutions, optimizing advertising networks online, with we've been assets, those kinds of things. We are now using this processing power to design the experience. In a direct business, prospect in the door, we do a lot to make sure we streamlined that tunnel, if you will, get them into the code, get them in to the by process. Historically, we've done really well with that, but it so much painstaking, frankly because we do BB tests. We went to try the orange button versus the blue button. The button over here versus the button over here. But we've done really really well. And historically, we did something in this case that we call the coverage packaging tool. We used 7 variables to optimize the experience with the customer and we're able to improve the funnel, the yield by about 4%. And the 4% difference feel like a lot to you, we have a lot of direct prospects, that's about 0.5 billion of lifetime premium. Today, we're using what we call real-time decisioning. We're looking at more than 3 times as many variables as were used to. We've been able to improve yield another 4% and growing and we've been able to do it in about a 1/5 of the term.
Opportunities, I could go on with examples. How you get the picture, the data space is booming, even with Snapshot due to GPS, due to mobile, this curve is going to get steeper. Layer on top of that debt unstructured data that we just talked about, the text and our call centers, we've been translating voice to text for many years now.  We're able to mind that as well. Andrew Quigg will talk about that in a moment. We're now starting to ingest images, photos and video. That will soon be, not yet for us, that will soon be data enmeshed with all the other data in our systems as well. We have been a leader in using data and analysis for segmentation, for experience design to our competitive advantage. I believe the opportunity to do that and differentiate ourselves in competition is only going to grow and we expect to lead.
And I'm going to hand the floor over to Andrew Quigg to talk customer relationship management and here again, I think you will see similar themes through Andrew's talk."

The first half of the section will be our attention, tell you about improving momentum to see them attention. And then, on the second half of the section, provide an overview of our customer marketing initiative and then, I'll describe advanced analytics as John Sauerland alluded to.
So first off, I wanted to just greater rate of preferred retention measure which is policy life for retention or purely. PLE is the average length of time we expect the new policy to stay with Progressive. We calculate PLE by first calculating our retention to K curve and then, we take the area under the curve to get our PLE statistics. That retention decay curve can be cultivated multiple ways depending on the trade-off and responsiveness versus the stability of that we see here. Our standard measure is to use 12 months for each point along that curve. That is our trailing 12 PLE that we always recorded out. We also calculate a trailing 3 PLE starting in 2014. The trailing 3 PLE uses 3 -- the most recent 3 months along that retention to get curves. So it's more responsive to more recent observations. Specific notes on the PLE calculation. The first 60 much represent actual data that we recently observed and between months 60 and 300, we used an extrapolation and we've seen all policies after 300 months, which is a conservative assumption. We think the PLE is accurate for a number of reasons and I'll highlight one of those today. We think it removes any tenure of bias. So if we use simple retention rates, as our book of business ages, all else being equal, we think we'd see higher retention rates and that would be although that retention curve getting shifted. So using those the PLE calculation remove any 10pyear bias from our statistics.
So with that, background, I wanted to give you an update on the current progress with trailing 12 PLE. I'm happy to report that we've seen very positive PLE growth in 2016. We are up 6% year-over-year. 6%, 6% year-over-year, there we go. This is a large increase since 2009 and as Tricia said on our last quarterly conference call, for every one month of PLE, we see $1.5 billion in additional lifetime or for the company. We're also seeing similar percentage increases within our agency channel and in our direct channel and the rest is at an all-time high. What we're really pleased with the overall momentum we see, we're even more pleased with what we see in the Robinsons in the Destination Era. For our Robinsons, PLE is up 17% over the past 3 years. And the past 12 months, we're up 9%. So just great momentum that we're seeing with the Robinsons. As Tricia alluded to earlier, the Robinsons are now 3x greater and 3.5x greater than our Sams for PLE. 
We'll also be adjusting the PLE calculation in the coming months. We haven't updated extrapolation for a while, and we're seeing better retention in that of the PLE curve than we've seen historically. And so when we update the PLE calculation, overall PLE go up by more than -- by about 2%. And for our Robinsons it will be given higher. Our Robinsons are disproportionately represented in the tale of the PLE curves. That means it will even more opportunity for Robinsons. We'll be able to acquire their more aggressively, and we'll be able to bundle our current customers more aggressively. So far speaking inclusively about the trailing 12 PLE, but I want to go back to the trailing 3 that I talked about in the opening. If we think about the difference between the trailing 3 and the trailing 12 PLE is the unrealized momentum in our PLE data. And we're very pleased with what we see here. For total auto, the trading 3 PLE is up 8% year-over-year. For the trailing 12 PLE, it's up 6%. So we think we have about 2 points of unrealized momentum within our PLE. As you can see across all of our segments, the trading 3 PLE is higher year-over-year than the trailing 12, so we feel like we have a lot of momentum. But the difference before Robinsons. For Robinsons, we think we have about 4 points of momentum that we haven't yet realized. I'm going to stop here and just talk about the goal that Trish outlined for us in 2015. Trish has challenged us an increased retention by 50%. We think we can achieve this in 3 ways. First, we believe we can change our. mix. In the destination era, we think we can change our mix to more preferred customers and new business. Pat outlined some of the strategies we have there. In addition to changing mix, we think we can improve our price competitiveness relative to the competition. Pat showed the slide where we have increasing Agency PLE while overall rates are being increased. And third, we believe we can improve the customer experience. We think we can nurture our customers to stay with progressive longer, and I'll spend some time on that in the next section. We think this path to a 50% increase to a more preferred segments. We see more opportunities with our more preferred segments increased retention. And then as the mix of our business changes, we believe we'll have better overall goal of and increasing retention by 50%. 
I want to switch gears here and start talking about the nurture side of things. But I want to pause and just talk about data for a minute, specifically how are using data for consumer experience. We see a virtual cycling in our pricing. I started off in Product management. This was a big part of our roles. In pricing, we see that when we acquired customers, we are paying their data. And with that data, we can derive segmentation and insights and improve our pricing, which allows us to acquire more customers, which gives us more data, which gives us better segmentation, a virtual cycle exist within our pricing. We think the same virtual cycle exists with our customers in customer experience, specifically with our customers we -- customers and then we interact with them. With interactions generate data and that data provides insight and ideas in segmentation that allows us increased retention, which allows us to have our customers. And more customers provides more interactions and more data and we get a virtual cycle here with an customer experience as well. And in the destination era, as we get more products, we think been even faster, more products, more interactions, which means more data. So as we invest in the best ever with equally have even more predictive data to use with our customers. We do that background because leveraging data as part of the larger initiative that we working on here at progressive. In the 2015 Investor Relations meeting, Glenn saw that we need to be a good customer marketing as we are at consumer marketing. And so we put a joint team together from our customer relationship management organization and corporate marketing, and that team is working on this customer marketing initiatives. There are 4 pillars that we've talked about with the customer marketing initiatives. The first is that we want to improve our customer knowledge. We want to such predictive data because we can for our customers, that we know the experience that are going through. After that, we want to improve our customer engagement. There's 2 parts this. We want to improve the practices that they go through, and we want to segment those customers better. The third pillar is interfaces. As we've come up with segmentation and processes, we need flexible interfaces that can deliver those to our customers. And then finally, we want to brand these interfaces for our customers. Jeff talked about this last year so I won't spend time on this year. So we want to have the branding that resonates with our the customers as they interact with us. 
So with that, let's -- let me launch through some of this pillars in particular, and I'll start with knowledge. As an initial example, I'll talk about small data that we are -- have been working on for our customers. Over the past 18 months, we've looked for internal and external data elements that are highly predictive for our customers. At this matter data elements on the screen. On the x axis here is the volume of data. You can think this is a number of customers described by the data. And then on the y axis, I have a general list associated with that data. You can figure that with the within retention or a lifting graduation we have Robinsons or lifted endorsements. No matter which of those 3 we're talking about with the data, it's highly profitable for progressive to know. If we know that they would, which it did that customer, we can act on it in a profitable way. Let me give you some examples. Example #1 is an internal data element. It came from out digital servicing environment, so digital servicing action that we see our customers pay. It wasn't within structure data warehouse, but we had it in house. And when we dug into, at least saw there's a 14-point difference in our retention if we saw this data element. I'll give you another example that more transparent about. Example 2 is an external data element from a data vendor, we call it the newly variable. It comes from wedding invitations, bridal registries, court house records, things associated with getting married. And one we see that data element on one of our customers. In the next 6 months, there's more than a 200% lift and whether they change their marital status. And when it comes to change their marital status, it changes the retention rate, it changes the number of vehicles and drivers in the household and sometimes it adds additional products like a property policy. Now beyond small data, we've also started to think more about big data available to us in customer relationship management. And we think technology companies saw that 80% of the world's data is unstructured, and we think that's true within CRM as well. I'm going to describe 1 area although there are others that we are working on as well. The area I'm going to describe today is the action that we're taking to put together and unstructured database of our customer works, the works that we hear from our customers. So let me give you some examples of some source of this data. The first area is from our server responses. Annually, we received more than 80,000 survey responses from our customers. In addition, we have more than 1 million chat transfers with our customers, good in our digital servicing environment, they can chat with the progressive consultant. But as alluded to, the largest and most significant source of words is from our calls with our customers. We received 36 million personalized calls per year, and we've been transcribing those calls, and we have -- using advanced analytics -- and we have all those calls in text form that we can put into data warehouse. In total, Progressive has more than 10 billion words annually from our customers. So what do we do with this? Well, I'll give you a few small examples today. One thing we've done is just search all this text first 3 word combinations, we call these trigrams. And there's some trigrams that are very predictive of, say, defection. I have 3 of those on the screen. I can tell you, for example, that trigram #3 is I never received. I never received my ID card. I never received that document that I requested. But I never received. And when a customer says that's a progressive, they are 1.4x more likely to from Progressive in the next 6 months. Another thing we look at is metadata. You can think of metadata something other than the words that are present on those phone calls. For example, metadata #2 here is the amount of silence time on a phone call. As the silence time increases, the future defection chance increases as well, so there's about a 1.1x relativity on the amount of silence time on a phone call. There's even some significant words, some single words that is spoken or written or shared, are good predictor of future deflection from Progressive. I won't share those today but we've parsed through the text and looked for those single words. 
I like to move beyond knowledge now and talk about our engagement. For those a reminder here, I'm going to talk the segmentation side of the engagements. Progressive, we've certainty built traditional models. We use generalized linear models and a number of situations. These are traders models that are used throughout insurance and throughout business. And here, I want to tell you about the probability of graduation. This was a traditional modeling excesses that we went through in CRM. So we gave a team, I call them team #1, some of that small data that I talked about in the knowledge section. And we asked them to predict which customers may become a Robinson in the future, and they did a good job with this. They built a model. And the model in the top -- had a 4x greater chance of becoming a RobinSon -- But then we took that same data and we gave it to a separate team, one that did not work with the first team. And the separate -- second team did an even better job. And the second team, we found that the team came up with a model that was 7x greater. But the best result was we combined models. And when we combined models, we found that the best transit had a 9x greater likelihood. So even in the situation where we're building traditional models, we try to put the models together and combine them in ways to create the best outcome for press. Now the world has moved beyond just generalized linear models given the vast amount of data and the computing power that's available. Let's move to things like forest or existing machines or newer networks. Some have used advanced predicted models that are now available to us. We've invested in an advanced analytics team within CRM to take advantage of these models. The first assignment for this advanced analytics team was to build a defection model, to try to predict who might we Progressive. And the best models were the existing machines and their own network that they have built. Because of the power of these models, I want to spend a little time just walking through the first generation network with you today. On the screen, I have the basic structure of a neuro network. I want to explain it to you. The first layer of a neuro network is known as the feature layer. Features are like the independent variables that you would've seen in a regression historically. There are the attributes of the policy. Here on the screen, we have 2 features. F1 is a categorical variable of whether or not the policy is on EST payments or automatic payments with Progressive. F2 is a percentage change of premium that, that policy will see in its upcoming readable. We're going to have 2 predictors in this small step of a model. I can tell you in on our first generation network, we have more than 900 predictors, and that was before we had access all those billions in words that I described previously. From the feature layer, data passes along synapses to an output layer. Synapses are weights between negative 1 and 1 that are multiplied by the data. And then the data reaches this hidden layer. That's a hidden layer, there functioning center, common function that are used in our network that transform the data. From the hidden layer, travels along another set of synapses to the output layer. Again, the synapses multiplied by number between negative 1 to 1 and then the output layer, there's another function that transforms the data. And out of that output layer comes a predictor of tension with Progressive between 0% and 100%. With that setup, let me walk you through a training of this network. On the screen are 8 policies from a training data set. These are 8 policies where we both know the predictors, the features of those policies and what happened with them. So we have some policies that renew with Progressive and some policies that defected from Progressive. What we do is we run these policies through the euro network. This is called for [indiscernible] -- each of these policies passes through the network and is calculated the retention of it. So the features feature layer, they're multiplied by that number between negative 1 and 1 and the synapse layer, they hit the hidden layer with a transform by a function. Another way hits it and finally, transformed by a final function and a predictor of attention comes there. You can see here in this first iteration that the network is almost random. All those policies are comped around the middle of the scale for through predicting retention and the overall model accuracy as well. But what happens next is 1 of the 2 reasons why newer network works. What happens next is a self-correcting mechanism exists within an euro network. It's called backward propagation. During backward propagation, each of those are recalculated. We calculate based on an iteration method called radiant success helps the model towards the maximum accuracy. So as changes models changing it become more accurate. After this network propagation, we train the model again. We take these 8 policies, we pass them again through the model. Each of the policy feature layer, hits the hidden layer and goes through the output layer. And you can see this type, the policies that renew with Progressive for certainty going higher on the renewal probability scale and those at the lower and the model accuracy improves, and then we backward propagate again, again adjusting the model. In actuality, we do this tens of thousands of times. Here in the room, I'm going to do it 10x quickly just so you can see what happens. And this is the second reason why neuro network works. It's because of the computing power that's available to us in this day and age. At the end of this, the model is You can see after 10 iterations that the model accuracy has improved, and we have a model that's now ready for production. You do want to know here when we do this in actual practice, we keep a whole out data set to make sure that we don't over fit model. What happens now? Well, we want to use this model in production. So I brought in 2 policies that we don't know the outcome for us. They be coming up for renewal with progressive, Policy 9 and Policy 10. What we do is we take the feature of each policies, and we pass them through the neuro network. And here we can see the policy 9 will repay we Progressive likely and policy 10 might defect from Progressive. We started the discriminate between policies that will say and now I hope you take 2 things away from this. First takeaway is that this is an incredibly intensive calculation process. For the first generation network, it took us 7 whole days to run. We were using our local infrastructure but still it took an incredibly long time. And that was before we had tens of billions or words. That was before we tried adding on more hidden layers to go towards cognitive computing. It very large and compex process. And it's because we have an impressive analytical infrastructure that we built through the snapshot program that we can start tackling problems like this. The second and I hope you take away is that this is in the incredibly accurate model as well. Now we showed overall model accuracy on the screen. Truth be told that's not what you're interested in. Record interested in the till the model. This policies that are very unlikely to renew. We want to have good till end. And from the data that we used to what is your network we also booked a traditional model, a GLM model. And when we did that, the network was twice as predictive as the generalized linear model. We're using the same data but using more predictive advanced analytics. We can do much more accurate in what we're doing, which has large benefits to progress. Let me walk through interfaces to tell you a little bit more about how we take these models and use them for business benefit. I want to start by talking about proactive outbound communication. This is us reaching out to out customers. On the screen, I have a couple of examples of digital ads. These are digital ads you put in front of our current customers where we want them to gradually become Robinsons. We target these digital ads based on the traditional model that I talked about previously. When we combine those models the focus of the most responsive we show them these digital ads. And when we've done that along with some other activities like this, we've increased the number of Robinsons we have by tens of thousands, adding millions of dollars in the underwriting profit to Progressive. We're able to do this because of all that acumen we built in advertising to consumers. We used this same patterns in advertising to our customers. Just another example is policy 10 from network example. We know that policy 10 may not scale with Progressive, and so we started campaign to reach out to folks that Policy 10 and invite them to call in to talk about their policy. And when we've done things like that, and we got a few in practice now, the run rate is that annually we'll save tens of thousands of customers worth tens of millions of dollars in lifetime underwriting profits progress. Beyond proactive outbound communication, there's also proactive inbound communication. We have built a 2 or better -- can use when someone calls Progressive. We call this tool the customer relationship a system. It's a user interface for our phone consultants. It took us about 2 months to build, and the beauty of this tool is that houses all that data and all those models I spoke about previously. So when Policy 10 calls, the consultant on the phone knows to talk to that consumer about their policy and about staying with Progressive. It's really personalized, right? We can pay with all these interactions and make sure we have the right treatment with consumer policy. It's very flexible. If we want to add new treatments, we can program them in about 2 hours. And earlier results from this are very impressive. We've seen increase in product set, a reduction in future calls and a listed retention. 
Let me recap what I talked about today. In 2015 in the Investor Relations meeting, Glenn said that retention was our Holy Grail. challenged us to increase retention by 50%. I'll underscore the progress that you heard today. PLE is up 6% with momentum higher. Direct to set an all-time high, and remaking the most progress with our Robinsons as our mix to that business shifts towards the Robinsons. In consumer marketing, as a direct carrier and a servicing independent agent carrier, we have access to billions and billions of pieces of customer data. We have a historical strength in mining data, driving insight segmentation and quickly moving the market. We believe we can do that with our current customers -- that virtual cycle of data and extent policy life expectancies. And with that, I will come up John Barbagallo to talk about Commercial Lines"

I'm going to share a little bit about what we're seeing in the Commercial Auto insurance marketplace. I'm going to touch on our most streets and results and share a little bit about our near-term action plan. And the",3967,"Thanks, Andrew. Hello. Good afternoon. I'm going to share a little bit about what we're seeing in the Commercial Auto insurance marketplace. I'm going to touch on our most streets and results and share a little bit about our near-term action plan. And then I'm going to shift to talk about 2 disruptive shifted transit that are coming to small business insurance and non-fleet Commercial Auto insurance. And these are trends that we have not only been monitoring, but we've actually been making investments around them over the last several years, and we think we're very prepared with position to take advantage of them. The first, let's start talking about the marketplace, and let's start with  a little history. This is the chart about shared audience in the past. It's now been updated through 2015. And what it shows is Progressive's relative performance relative to the industry on 2 measures: combined ratio and growth in directory premium. And 2 things you can take from this graph. One is that over this time period, Progressive by being intensely focused on Commercial Auto as a specific line of business has been able to consistently outperform the industry on combined ratio, usually by margin of 10 to 15 points.  And for the last few calendar years, it's actually been by 20 points. Now some of that is from our expense ratio. We have a very cost competitive expense ratio. We believe we are the low cost provider in the Commercial Auto, but a lot of that is loss ratio. And by being focused in the way we are, we believe we see things sooner and react faster, and most in the industry and that contributes to this advantage. The other thing you can take from this chart, perhaps a little more subtle, is that we will and have consistently slowed our growth in the business when we are at risk that's exceeding our underwriting target. And we can keep that commitment to those underwriting margin targets. Even with that approach, over time, we have been able to grow our market share consistently to the point where 2015 Progressive became the #1 Commercial Auto writer in the United States. Like we distribute to any 16. This is a view again same to measures combined ratio and direct written premium Progressive versus the industry with that fear of virgin competitors as of the first quarter of 2016. You can see Progressive up in the upper right, choosing along that's really good growth and the combined ratio in the high 80s at that point. And the industry about 6% growth and the combined ratio of 102, which is actually isn't too bad when you consider how it ended 2015 that would appear to be improvement. In a few updates to the second quarter, you see general degradation of combined ratio across the board, including our own. In fact, for the industry, you change in loss ratio, if you take the loss ratio for the 3 months comprising the second quarter, it is fully 8 points higher than the first quarter loss ratio. Now there's some seasonality that's played there's, but that is a huge, huge change. Now I'm sure you've noticed in our last 2 or 3 monthly earnings releases that our combined ratio has been elevated certainly above historical norms. There's a little bit of prior-year development in there. For the 3 months period, it's about 1 point, 1.25%. But the real driver of that is actually frequency. But we have on the screen now is our bodily injuries reported frequency for the last couple of years. Now the blue line is the monthly frequency as you can see that's pretty volatile jumps around the we don't tend to pay too much attention to that. Even those kind of last 2 -- last couple high watermarks there, there high but certainly, not beyond anything we've seen in our history. If you look at the Orange line, that is the trailing 6 VI frequency, and that's a much more stable measure, but it's still is relatively reactive to changes in the environment. In there you see what appears to be an infection point starting in May, maybe as early as April. We believe that is real, at least it's real enough to me that we are acting to that. We also believe it is largely environmental. Pack talked earlier about general piquancy for, although there's your turnaround that distracted driving, low fuel prices But in Commercial Auto's it's specifically particularly where we tend to compete, we are seeing positive movement in a number of the macroeconomic factors that we track that generally correlate with frequency. Things that come sales, construction spending, trade tonnage, aggregate deliveries all moving to positive direction, which project protect us higher level of economic activity also contributing to higher frequency. So we believe this is real, we are acting I talked to this obviously before about our vision infrastructure at Progressive, our ability to change rates across the broad portfolio relatively quickly, and we have kicked that into year [ph] What this graph shows is our anticipated rate change for 2016, which will come in at about 9% year-over-year changing rates. Most of that in the second half of the year. We're actually holding rates flat through the first 4 months of the year as we're operating in the high 80s. So decisively, and we quickly, and those we changes will certainly have the combined ratio. But it will take time. About 90% of our policies are written on an annual basis, but we have to get through our renewal cycle to get the full effect of it. It will certainly help new business as soon as we can get those rates in place. But in the interim, and I said, we will slow done growth to ensure we make our margins. In the interim, we're also restricting some high-frequency segments of our business for new business. We're going to stop taking it until we can get those rate in place. Now those segments have always been high-frequency, there will always be high-frequency, and we're perfectly comfortable that this is at the right, which were just not yet there. So that's what they feel going up again by being focused we think we are seeing this before much of our competition, and we're reacting before they do. And when that happened to historically, that is typically up very favorable market conditions for us down the road. So we'll see what happens. 
All right. Now I want to shift to those disruptive trends. The first of which is what I believe will be an inevitable shift to a small business accessing direct channels for the purchasing and servicing of their small business insurance policies. Consumers range across a range of industries have demonstrated not only acceptance of direct channels but many cases, preference for those channels, and we can expect small business owners to be any different, especially as digital continues to close the information gap between the buyer and the seller. And we're starting to see investment. Investment by people other than Progressive. And these are companies that are well known, they are well-funded and they have experienced management. And they are putting the assets in place. Underwriting companies, product filings, technology platforms, all to go after the direct channel small business. And they're starting to spend some money. Not a lot on the marketing front and actually, it's happening slower than we would've anticipated. We feel the largest country in the category but they're starting to spend some money as well. we're seeing investments. We also starting to see some growth. This is a view provided by the Consultant Group of the U.S. small business insurance market. Now this is all lines of business, all lines of business for small business insurance, and they pay that at about a $65 billion to $70 billion marketplace. And as of right about now, they're saying direct channels of 8% share. Probably more interesting on this chart is what they project to be the growth rate of the channels. So pretty aggressive growth rates for digital channels in fact if you buy into this, it suggests that traditional channels will begin to decline in absolute dollars as early as 2019. We'll see. But it comes to Commercial Auto where we have some pretty good data, we're seeing a somewhat similar pattern. Now, again, the direct channel for Commercial Auto is still small, less than 2%, but the growth rate relative to the industry growth rate is 2x to 3x. No full disclosure on this particular graph that orange line is largely driven by Progressive. We're just about half of the direct Commercial Auto market right now. and We actually can affect the slope of that line in terms of how much we choose to spend. And that's reflected in 2014. We pulled back in our spending. when you see that a little dip there. But then, you have a channel there's lots of investment lining up and you're starting to see signs of growth from your channel. But the question then becomes who are going to be most cost effectively demand and control the top of that sales funnel. And this is where we start to feel really good. Because while the others are just getting started, we have actually been assets since 2008. Now we've been direct commercial for a more than a decade. But is really in 2008 that we began investing in developing a business insurance brand. In 2008 we started  we embarked really on a 5-year plan, and it was a 5-year plan to prove for ourselves that we could make the economics of direct marketing commercial insurance work. And it was a very auto-centric approach charging specific verticals where we tend to do well. We concluded that 5-year plan successfully in 4 years. That gave us the confidence in 2012 to begin broadening our marketing. And by broadening, I mean, both marketing the media with access and broadening our message to be much less auto-centric and really built around insuring and protecting the business and that is now circling company, which we just launched, which cutie celebrate the small business owner. We've been investing here for a long time. As a invest working we Tate we would say it, definitely, has been. One of the key measures of brand health is awareness. And as you can see on these 2 charts in terms of total awareness and top-of-mind awareness Progressive is  the leading small business insurance. Again, this gets back to who is going to control the top of that sales  as the channel the consumer. How fast my this all happen? I don't really know but maybe we can look to auto as a guide it has happened. The chart on the left shows the shift in channel for private profit although over 20-year period. Now keep in mind that Orange line for the direct channel developed concurrently developing and acceptance of digital channel for consumers. So the Internet gradually migrated over to mobile. We believe those consumer preferences are already in place. In our opinion, that small business owners, at least a percentage of them, their expectations currently, exceeds industry's ability to deliver with the digital experiences. The chart on the right is the effect of that channel shift on progressives business. So over roughly the same time period, progressives direct out of business grew from being about 12%, 11%, 12% of our business. It's not the our agency business didn't grow during this time. It did grow. You heard earlier from Pat, it was an all-time. it's just that the direct business grew that much faster printing lots of value, creating lots of value for Progressive and for our shareholders. We've modeled this out. We've done a number of different scenarios around how quickly the direct channel may grow for small business insurance basin depend spending on the end levels by other, and we was run but with different the most likely outcomes all leads to significant growth for Progressive commercial. So we continue to invest in our capabilities. We are in midst of a major systems upgrade for commercial. One of the benefits of that will be the ability to deliver better digital expenses and perhaps, more importantly, deliver them to market faster and enhance them more quickly. And we continue to invest in and build our in-house business insurance agency. The map from the left source our footprint of being able to offer nonaffiliated partner company and general liability policies with prospects in our customers. We also sell workers comps and professional liability, but the time it coverages are and today, we can offer between 5 and 8 products covering a range of underwriting profiles. And as you can see on the graph on the right, we are growing the agency. And there again, the shape of that growth curve can largely be determined by how much we choose the spend at a given time. And we are growing the agency and we are having success bundling these small business customers with Progressive auto, be it Commercial Auto or Personal Auto, and that's an important point. We are creating a lot of bundles with a buffer GL policy and the Progressive personnel policy, which is just fine. First of all, it helps the agency's economics because the same customers are much stickier. Second, it is entirely consistent with the strategy Tricia later laid out earlier in terms of acquire's anchored bundle extend the, which may be how we acquire customers. Certainly how we bundle customers. And also, we're finding that the need for Commercial Auto in the small business oftentimes emerges wait or later in the life cycle of that business and business insurance is very situational. Unlike personal lines, really the first purchase of a personal lines products, typically auto is driven by a lost requirement to have insurance or a bank. In small business insurance, that is not usually the case. But to try to get some context to the slide, I'm going to tell you a story. And it's a story about a real life realize driving business right here in Northeast Ohio. So a work colleague of mine has a friend and she's starting a business in her home, in the kitchen actually cooking bone broth. And she sold this bone broth out of her kitchen to friends and neighbors. Now she didn't have insurance so we told her she needed insurance. You can argue she probably should insurance but she was flying below the radar, which a lot of small businesses do particular in the early stages. The sales went well. She got a lot of positive feedback and she is encouraged to take there product to one of the local farmers markets, so she decided to give that a try. She applied, she was accepted at the farmers market you want to come on premise. You have to have a vendors liability policy and you have to have a general liability policy. So where previously she was in that first circle of not really caring about insurance. She now found herself in that second circle of, well, at least temporarily I had to care about insurance if I want to go this farmers market. Not sure if I have the business yet but I'll buy the insurance. Farmers market went well. Again, a lot of positive feedback. We inquiries from local restaurants who wanted her to supply them with bone broth. So we even got a contract with a local grocery store chain and the business is starting to take off. By taking up to the point you out to her kitchen and to try to this commercial space, and she had a higher as to employees to set up more of her regular production cycle for the bone broth. Now she need back policy for premises and she needs Worker's Compensation for her employees. I'll say now she's in that third circle of do I really have to care insurance? Policy change, she hadn't hired any third-party to make a delivery. She now buys first delivery vehicle drive the Commercial Auto policy for my colleagues who actually know spirits may be nationally should realize that she has a real asset here, an asset she wants to preserve, protect and maybe pass on to the next generation. I would ask to that fourth circle that really care about insurance. The point here is with small business owners, it is a journey of 1, and they are all different, and they are not necessarily linear like the realized example I just give you. People move back and forth, some small business owners never move out of that sort small business ownership. And to deal with that, we have developed a series of customer journey next. By business type and by business stage. And what these journey maps allow us to do. It matched our creative messaging and our immediate by with those key chigger to deliver the right message at the right time to that business. It is the trend that is clearly coming. You've been reading a lot about is a little gaining traction in the biggest but to take hold, and we feel we are really, really to capitalize on that. The other I want to talk to you about is the application of telematics to non-fleet Commercial Auto insurance. That tragic but at the believe it comes. So telematics have been broadly applied in 3 situations. But even there has never been it actually strong insurance tie-in. That's been more about asset management and statistics and insurance. But we think that's about the change, particularly in the trucking sector. And John Sauerland has already talked a lot about Progressive leadership position in terms of usage-based insurance pricing science. He's talked to you and Andrew we force the predictive capabilities Progressive can bring to bear. There absolutely as it we can leverage in Commercial Lines. But we have taken a slightly different commercial when they have a personal with respect to you, and we have focused on the transportation industry. The over the road truckers. 2 reasons for that. 1, we with the version of the Snapshot product perfectly well for a lot of our business auto contractors have customers and now with Agency adoption rate of Snapshot is starting to walk and maybe the time first introduced that commercial. The other reason now we focused on transportation is we were anticipating a federal mandate, which is now law that will require mode motor carriers to have an electronic writing device in the vehicle and operational by December 2017. And in these electronic will be fully committed we have all the data, so we have for the last few years been working directly with the vendors, the  manufacturers as the ELBs to put in place date the sharing agreement and cooperative marketing agreements so we you can go-to-market together with our products as the demand increases leading up to the combined state on December '17 and the also been collected our own UBI data for the last several years. We probably about 600 of our insurance trucks on the road being monitored with collected over 41 million miles and data and data are beginning to reveal some greedy really, really interesting things. Perhaps the most interesting is that defined the commercial operators the degree of variance in their behavior is far, far greater than personalize customers terms of how, how much and where they drive. Those behaviors correlate with losses and they do/that's very exciting that allows for greater great segmentation and just ready talked to about the power of great segmentation. He told you than personal lines, Snapshot is the most predictive was powerful rating variable we have. We believe for trucking risks it am even more powerful than that so we're very excited. Let me give you a little something of some of the things we're seeing. All these examples are related to the same pre insurance vehicles. 1 of the things you weighed in Commercial Auto is something called, which is basically how far you go from your principal edges how far do you go is a rating variable you a lot of our competitors use it. Radius of operations variables it could be hard to verify, and it changes over time truckers go with the work I think that's partially because they know where the work is but you're using. Well, now electronic devices we actually know where they go in the sample we have financial vehicles that are already same release of operation 500 miles. Pretty good for vehicles probably overcharging vehicle A and vehicle B. More important than how far you drive is where you drive. Now that we have geolocations data, we can actually different roads in terms of relatively sticky risk. In there, you can overlay time of day so you can incorporate things like rush hour and potentially things like seasonal weather pattern. You begin to see where this can go but even with a relatively stochastic model for story, which is what we have here is the precision and differences in distribution, which we believe are actionable and ratable. One more is how much you drive in this is really a goal emphasis be on the federal mandate. Better regulation of hours of operation, hours of service. Driver fatigue is a major, major safety issue for over the road truckers. The graph from the bottom reflects hours per day of driving. So each bar on the graph is a day. And the light line going across is that the federal limit of 11 hours per day. So you can see pretty significant differences in the distributions. Vehicle B if you turn this from home by far, sister doing a better job of managing hours per day. Vehicle see actually have and 22 our days in there. Now but that probably means driving. To driver is taking shift still that's really ported and vibrant information on and representative at risk. Just a few samples of the types of data we are beginning to develop. Will be very, very actionable. I'm going to conclude with one more chart. It's about the data and this is another comparison between Personal Auto in this case of long-haul trucking customers. So the bottom graph was taken from a sample of Snapshot customers, personal Auto Snapshot customers. And all it does is shows kind of where their cars are during different parts of the. that you see, by and large, is most of the time those cars are at home to the driver in the garage. And during the daytime hours that's where you see the driving that some is driving than the wee morning hours, not surprising. The graph on the top is example of Progressive insured long-haul trucks. And what you see there is lots of driving, that's surprising, not unusual, 100, 120 miles a year for truckers. But when not driving, this typically from home. there doing the truck, showering using it Encumbering a pretty high leverage and this is where we really start to get excited about the data because this is where I think we can go beyond just trait great segmentation and start to develop value-added services given risk management services to hopefully make these truckers a little bit healthier and a little bit safer while they're on the road. So again, another trend and to small business insurance in this case none week uninsurance that we feel we are very, very well positioned to capitalize on. With that Susan for some closing remarks."

And commercialize, they have a lot of mobility as well to underwrite a renewal credits, debits, and they've done a lot of that over time and have targeted that, of course, as well. The personal lines were actually employing a lot of underwriting these days as well. It hasn't been what hasn't been for forte historically. But probably 4 or 5 years ago, we started around ensuring that we were bringing new business those intent it was to enter and not otherwise. And I think that helped us a lot. But higher than ever, you can improve profitability to raising rates or underwriting segments in Commercial Lines has been very faster react in turning on the underwriting more necessary, and they're now reacting very quickly in getting rates and expect to have this rates up about 9% by the end of the year."

Thank you for those out of counter, who came in, and welcome to Progressive's 2016 Investor Relations Day. We're glad to have you. I think you're all familiar with the Safe Harbor statements, and if not, there's also a copy in your materials as a reference guide.
So this particular Investor Relations meeting represents a really big change. For many, many years, Glenn Renwick was the host these meetings, in fact, I think he started them. Last week, Glenn celebrated his 30th anniversary with Progressive, of which more than half of that he was our CEO and President. During his tenure as CEO, he tripled the company in size. So by most record books you would say, that is phenomenal, and it is. But it's not just that. It's not just what Glenn did, it's how he did it. Always making sure to instill in us that desire to win but doing it in the right way, always following our core values. He always would set the bar higher every year for all of us. And then he won't walk away, he would help us get over, and that is really his legacy. So Glenn, on behalf of the 30,000 Progressive people, our shareholders and the customers we're privileged to serve, thank you for well being Progressive.
Okay, enough about Glenn. I thought what I do to start off is just remind you of our segments. So we outlined these several years ago when we first started talking about our Destination Era strategy. So I'll just briefly go over those. The focus today will be on the Robinsons, and we're really excited to talk to you about what we have done since he last met you in May 2015.
So Sam. Sam is a segment we grow up with, that we call him inconsistently insured. He is who Progressive -- he put us on the map, and we call him nonstandard. He cares about rates, doesn't stay very long but he could come back. We love Sam. We want to write all the Sam's we can possibly write as long as it reaches our profitability goal.
Diane. Diane is a big part of the Destination Era. We've talked in the past about her being a future Robinson. Diane is an auto customer, and she rents. So she may have renters insurance with us, and what we hope is that as her needs evolve and she buys a home, gets married, that we evolve with her. It's the notion of Diane graduating to be a Robinson. She's our largest customer base, so the opportunity there is immense.
The Wrights. The Wrights are unbundled auto and home. So they have Progressive home and someone else's auto. Again, we love the Wrights. We see them as future Robinsons because we hope that if they decide to shop their homeowners, they come with us and become a Robinson.
The Robinsons. That's what today is all about and what's a Destination Era is all about, the auto home bundle. The Robinsons are 40% of the market. So the opportunity here is really great, and we are really proud of how the momentum we've had in the last 18 months in particular in obtaining Robinsons.
Before we get started, what I thought I do as a new CEO is step back and just take stock of some objectives and some fundamentals that will stay the same during my tenure of things that might evolve. And clearly, with Glenn's leadership, I was a part of the team that developed the strategy around the Destination Era. So to make a turn and do something differently would make sense. I believe in this model, the execution has been great and I'm excited about our future. But things do evolve as a team as we know more.
Let me start with our first and most important objective, profit. We want to make at least $0.04 of underwriting profit of every $1 of premium. $0.96 is essential to our culture. You're actually sitting in an auditorium that's called Studio 96, so you know how integrated it is into everything we do. It continues to be our most important objective, and that won't change. There is, however, an added dimension with the auto home bundle. We're looking at how 2 independent margins can be optimized for that package. So while the $0.96 will stay the same, how it will be derived will absolutely evolve.
Growth. We want to grow as fast as we can with 2 constraints: one, the profit objective I just outlined; and two, our ability to service our customers. That second one is really important to us. So about 18 months ago, we had our A3 model on the streets, it was working, we were getting a lot more preferred customers. We also saw the opportunity when some of our competition pulled back to spend more on advertising, specifically, in the digital option. So we knew at that point we had a lot of opportunities to grow. We made a decision at that time to hire well in advance of need. So from the claims organization as well as our customer relationship management organization, both on the audit side and the commercial side. And I'm so pleased that we did that, because we did get that growth. We got that preferred growth. And in addition, we have things that happened that we didn't necessarily planned for in the form of catastrophes. So we've been able to service our customers no matter if it was a CAT or a regular -- just increase in losses based on growth.
It is sort of a rule here Progressive that whether you're on the claims side or the product side, if you think people were growing too fast, you absolutely have to raise your hand and say, ""No more growth. We can't do this. And we had to do that in the past."" I'm so delighted to say that this year we didn't have to do that because we prepared and hired in advance of need. So when I think about growth and profit and that balance, year-to-date with August being the most recent time frame with 96.2% [ph] net room premium growth. If we ended the year today, this is a phenomenal year, especially with the business that we've been putting on the book. I'm extraordinarily happy. If we were the same margin at 96.2% and had 4% growth with the same set of circumstances, I wouldn't be as happy. If we were at 88% with 0% growth, I wouldn't be happy. I'm very, very pleased with our growth. It really is sort of a perfect storm. So we have this new business, and we talked and talked at the conference calls about the sort of new business pacts that can have, when our combined ratio was higher in that first term. And we had that coming at us, and then we had CAT. This year, we have -- on our CR, 3 points of our combined ratio are in the form of CAT, which is compared to this time last year, about 1.5%. In fact, last month with Louisiana storm, it was over 4 points of our CR. So you can't plan for CAT. Believe me, I'm watching Matthew closely. You can't plan for CAT. Well, you can't plan for CAT, how you react to those CAT. I am extraordinarily pleased with how we have reacted specifically the Louisiana storm. So about 3 weeks ago, a group of us flew down and spent some time in Lafayette and Baton Rouge, Louisiana to make sure our employees were okay, our customers were okay, and I was just amazed. I was amazed that our CAT team, who went down there and just made sure they took it upon themselves to get our customers back on their feet. We literally had employees who were laying in bed, and they found out their home was flooded when they put their foot in water. Yet, they came to work that day to help our customers. In fact, as of yesterday, we have closed 96% of those flood claims, which is really amazing because they're complex claims, mostly total losses. So again, I'm so amazed that what we're able to do and what we're able to do. And what we are ready with whatever happens with Matthew. As of today, we have a plan, and we'll figure it out. That's what we do.
So for me, again, just to wrap up in that part, profit and growth, very happy, very proud, especially with how we've been increasing our preferred business, the Robinsons, and we're going to talk a lot about that today.
I thought I'd take just a stab at some of the financial fundamentals. So it won't change. I think they work with our business plan. We want to continue to balance operating risk with the risk of investing in financing activities, in order to have sufficient capital to support our growth. So that's the overview. On the operating side, we want to maintain pricing and reserving discipline. So when we talk about our pricing, we talk about managing targets. We talk about targets at the lowest definition. So whether it's on the agency and direct side, product state, we really segment our targets. And that's another reason why I'm so positive about this new business because we look at the new business coming in and say, ""Is it at or below targets? Great, that's going to run off profitably."" So we're excited about that.
We want to have a premium to surplus at or below state of minimum requirement. So on auto, that's a 3:1 and about half of that for home. And on the loss reserving side, we want to make sure loss reserves are adequate and developed with a minimal variant. Year-to-date, very proud of that. We are pretty close but are limited on the favorable side, which is the side you want to be on. On investing side, we want to maintain a liquid, diversified and high-quality portfolio. We manage our investments on a total return basis, which is very consistent with how we report our comprehensive income. And on the risk side, we want to manage interest rate, credit, prepayment, concentration and extension risk. Lastly, on the financing side, we want to maintain sufficient capital to support the insurance operations. That's measured by maintaining a debt below 30% of total capital of book value. So we're just slightly over 28% right now, and that's after issuing $500 million worth of debt in August. We want to neutralize dilution from equity-based compensation in the year of issuance, and we do that by repurchasing shares. And finally, we were investing capital and expanding the business when it meets our objectives. A perfect example of this is our acquisition of ARX. We didn't necessarily feel like we had to have a homeowners company. What we felt is we had to have access to that addressable market. That is a $300 billion market with auto and home. We needed to have access, and it just so happened that we've been working with the company that we've had a high amount of respect for, that had a very similar culture and so is a perfect relationship to start. So we're very pleased with our use of capital in acquiring ARX. Any use of underleveraged capital, we will buy back shares or issue dividends, whether special or variable.
So let's get to the 96, since we are slightly over at this point. I want to walk you through kind of how we look at it. This is just a basic refresher. So everybody gets to 96, all of our customers at some point get there, but sometimes in vastly different ways. On the direct side, you can see we run a much higher combined ratio in that first term. That's based on the fact that we have a little higher loss cost and some underwriting cost, but most of all, we front-load all of our acquisitions cost on the direct side in that first term.
On the Asian side, we have a little bit more losses, a little bit more underwriting, but it's a relatively fixed commission expense, so much lower in the first term. So let me take you through on the direct side, 2 ends of the spectrum. You have Sam and the Robinsons. So you can see the same dynamic. They both rendered a loss in the first term. But what is not evident in our monthly reporting or even our quarterly reporting is the fact that there's very high-retaining business, the Robinsons, can stay 3 times, actually, more than 3 times longer than the Sam, are expanding our invisible balance sheet. So bringing on more of those Robinsons, really build the intrinsic value of Progressive.
Here's a basic income statement, and it's directly accurate. So if you look at it again, the Sam and Robinsons, you look at revenue. Clearly, the Robinsons are higher, based on the fact that they stay longer and they have higher average written premium. If you look at the operating expenses, which of course are losses, LAE and expense ratio, you quickly notice that neither of these are equal to 96. Those numbers represent the nominal value of the cash flow, so they're under 96. Our lifetime target, 96 combined ratio, for our direct business, we discount the cash flows to recover our acquisition expenses. So that will be different in different segments depending on how long they stay. The difference between those of course is our underwriting income. And then there's other income that we have, both on the investment side for both Sam and Robinsons and the commissions side for just the Robinsons. So whether it's affiliate partner, like ASI, or other unaffiliated homeowners owners, we get commissions when we have those bundles. So as you can see, the value of a Robinson, a pretax value, is over 4x that of a Sam. Again, we love Sam as long as we can make money on them, but the value of a Robinson is extraordinary, and the fact that we have grown Robinson substantially in this last 18 months really does grow the value, the intrinsic value of Progressive.
So for years, we have shared with you the invisible balance sheet. We talked last year about unearned lifetime earned premium. So when we think about business coming on board, we look at new apps, for example. So in this year for Wrights and Robinson, we've grown new apps 30% and 40%, respectively. That's pretty great. We look at average written premium. Our average premium has come up across all segments. And then we look at PLE. This is [indiscernible] to be a spoiler alert for Andrew section that we finally have made a breakthrough on retention and PLE. So it us -- those 3 things are really exciting. So we thought we'd share with you one other metric that we look at internally, that we call ULUP, Unearned Lifetime Underwriting Process. So you'll see that the colors represent a segment so green for the Robinsons, pink for the Wrights, et cetera. On the Y axis, you see ULUP in millions, and on the X axis, you'll see the time frame with which we're looking out. So right when we started to grow, right around March of last year to our most recent data point. As you can see, the majority of our segments are growing substantially in ULUP, which, again, is building that intrinsic value. In fact, the Robinsons are growing over 60%.
The chart underneath shows all of the segments year-over-year growth in ULUP, and again, all are growing, so you can see the Robinsons are growing at a really quick clip. That's exciting for us.
I'm going to shift gears now and talk about how important understanding the Destination Era is to the 30,000 Progressive people that work on getting our customers indoor and making sure we nurture them along the way. We look at it in terms of different frameworks. This is a framework we use, called our strategic pillars. So let me talk about the first one, our culture. Our culture is so important, and it's not something you can really adequately describe unless you spent time at Progressive. It's not something you're going to see on a spreadsheet. But it is really special, and it's really different, and we know it's a competitive advantage. It's really at the root of what I started to talk about, and that is doing the right thing. And we want to win but you always want to do the right thing, and it's really rooted in our core values. I am privileged to speak at every new hire class, actually, with that with one Monday with couple hundred new claims reps. And my sole topic is our core value. I talk about 15 or 20 minutes, use some examples and then let them ask questions. It's so important to me for them on their first day or their first week or their second week to know what an important part that is of Progressive, our value.
Earlier this year, many of us went out to celebrate a milestone at Progressive, $20 billion in earned premium. And we got out face-to-face with over half of our employees, over 15,000 people, just to celebrate and say thank you for all that you do, and then of course talk about the next milestone and the next milestone, and it was really rewarding, and that again is a big part of our culture.
Our brand. We want to be the brand people want. So whether it's awareness or preference or consideration, those things are important but what we really want is to be able to, when people buy an insurance product from Progressive, that they feel confident that they've made a right decision and continue to feel confident as we service them and add more and more policies. We want to spend money on consumer marketing and customer marketing. We've talked often about how we want to have our customer marketing be as savvy as our consumer marketing. Andrew Quigg is going to talk a little bit about that today, but we continue to resource that as it is an important part of nurturing our customers.
Competitive prices. In a business with small margins, this is very important to us. It's really all around segmentation. You're going to hear a lot about that today. So John Sauerland is going to talk about our continued evolution with UBI and our segmentation, and how important that variable is. Pat Callahan is going to talk about segmentation and the product model that we continue to elevate as well as our bundled competitiveness. Andrew Quigg will talk about segmentation on the customer part and using data to get out in front of our customers to know what they need, when they need them. So this is really important part of our -- really central to things that we do is segmentation. We'll continue to hone in on that.
Another part about competitive prices is really having a competitive loss structure. So on the claim side, we continued to have -- try to have that near-perfect balance of cost and quality, so pushing down LAE, while pushing up accuracy, and we're doing a fantastic job. On the expense side, we look at what we call nonacquisition expense ratio. So we continue to try to push that down, be more efficient and then give that pricing advantage to our customers in the form of competitive prices.
And the last pillar is meeting the broader needs of our customers what products do they want, when do they wanted, how do they want to shop. We want to make sure we can have personalized service and products for each of our customers. So if you want to buy through an agent, get service online or through a chat, we want to make sure if it fits your needs, we are there for you. We want to pick up the phone and say, ""Yes, we can do that, absolutely."" And whether or not we do that through our own products or an affiliated products, we want to make sure we meet the needs of our customers.
We use this framework for how we're going to grow the business, acquire, anchor, bundle and extend. We see growth in 3 ways: one, selling products to new customers; two, selling additional products to our current customers as the need arises; and three, keeping our customers longer. Let me start with acquirer. Acquirers had initial relationships with us. So whether you come in through a special lines product or an auto product, we're just getting to know you. And in fact, we are pivoting the company and trying to be less about policies and more about customers and households. We're currently in 1 in 10 households in the United States, and we would like to double that in short order. And so we're doing that through acquiring more and more customers and understanding their needs and then evolving as their needs evolve.
Anchor. Our anchor products are our auto and our home. If you trust us with those assets, we believe that our relationship is much deeper. I started today talking about the opportunity, the $300 billion, almost $300 billion opportunity in auto and home. Now that we have access to that and how more and more customers coming in either at home or auto, we know we can deepen that relationship. It's such an important piece of future Robinsons.
Bundle, that's what we're going to talk about today. Our bundle are our Robinsons, our auto and home together, and just even a little bit of increased market share on the bundle part, really has a big impact to the bottom line.
Lastly, extend. We had been talking about retentions for some time, and we have made a significant breakthrough. Last year, if you recall, I announced that I asked Andrew Quigg to lead a team of people to try to increase our retention by 50%. He's going to talk about that today, but we're extraordinarily happy with our results.
So the extend isn't about talking any longer about customer to say 1 month or even 1 year. It's about having customers for decades. In fact, 1 out of 6 of our customers after the first renewal are decade customers. So we're pretty pleased with that. About 1 month or so ago, some of us went out to observe some focused groups of our customers. So we listened to Dianes with renters, Dianes with outrenters to try to get some insight. We went out to Minneapolis and Dallas, and we listened to some decade customers. And they came because they love the brand and they love the price, so that made sense. They had stayed because over that decade or more that they'd been with us, they'd had some sort of service whether they'd had a claim or they need to call in to change a vehicle or deductible, and they were extraordinarily happy with the service. But what we heard from both of the decade customer groups was something I think really insightful. People said, ""Why are you going to stay?"" ""Even if rates go up, will you stay?"" Yes, because I'm proud to be a Progressive customer, and that really hit us. And we heard that over and over again, and so we're working on filing that feeling and having it happen earlier in someone's tenure, have them feel that pride year 3, year 4, so we can continue to extend that and increase our decade customers. And in fact, we're looking at different metrics, and at some point, we'll continue to have policy life expectancy. So why wouldn't you have customer life expectancy? So that's where we'll evolve as our customers evolve.
Ultimately, our goal, our vision is to become consumers #1 choice and destination for auto and other insurance. The next 4 speakers are going to talk about how we're going to do that on both the auto side, and John Barbagallo will talk about how he's going to do that on the commercial side.
So now I'd like to start and invite our Personal Lines President, Pat Callahan up to talk about agency growth, our product and our bundled competitiveness."

So last year, when we talked, I laid out 3 key strategic priorities for our Personal Lines business, and those are restoring growth in agencies, increasing our bundled penetration and ultimately advancing our product development cycle. I w",4873,"Thanks, Tricia. So last year, when we talked, I laid out 3 key strategic priorities for our Personal Lines business, and those are restoring growth in agencies, increasing our bundled penetration and ultimately advancing our product development cycle. I want to give you updates on all 3. And what we'll do is start with an overview of the market from an overall channel and market size perspective.
As Tricia mentioned, U.S. personal auto and home is rapidly approaching $300 billion market. And when you look at the independent agency share of that, it's a little more than 1/3 or about $100 billion of home and auto premium. And despite the fact that technology adoption has been rapidly increasing the growth rate for direct distribution of Personal Lines products, the independent agency channel continues to grow premium. And that's due in part a broad distribution of the footprints but also a great value proposition from a breadth of products offered and depths of career choice available. When you look more specifically at the homeowners market in the U.S, it's about $90 billion market, and that's about 90% sold through agents, more than 40% through independent agents. And as a #1 writer of auto insurance through the independent agency channel, we believe we're incredibly well positioned to leverage our strength in the channel, combined with ASI's property offerings, to become the #1 writer of auto and home insurance through the agency channel.
Last year, I told you that restoring growth in agency were the top priority for myself and lots of other folks within our Personal Lines organization. So today, I'm thrilled to show you some information that after our business shrunk slightly into 2014 and barely recovered into 2015, we've turned that Agency business around from a size perspective. And at this point, our agency auto business as well as ASI's home owner business through independent agents have both never before been larger. And if we zoom in on what's driving that auto improvement, we look primarily to start with at new business apps. New business growth is the lifeline or lifeblood of a growing organization like Progressive. And as you see on the screen, mid-way through 2015, we turned new business positive on a year-over-year basis within the agency channel. Our new business growth continues to be up in the double digits on year-over-year basis ever since.
New business growth originates from 2 primary metrics. The first is demand, so quoting [ph]. The second is conversion. And our improvements in the agency channel are driven just about by equal parts of both, which indicate to us: number one, we have a more competitive product in market; but number two, that more competitive product is inducing agents to come to us more frequently to meet the needs of their clients, an absolutely fantastic combination within the channel.
But to understand how competitive we are overall in the channel, the best benchmark that we can use is how well we're converting on comparative raters. So last year, I shared with you that the majority of our agency quotes start on a comparative rating platform. And just to level set, comparative rating software, desktop applications in agent's offices, they run a real-time risk-by-risk auction amongst all the carriers that participate within that agent's office. And you'll notice that similar to what we saw from a new apps perspective, we're seeing increasing new business from a convergent perspective on comparative raters. Turn positive around the same time that we saw new business apps turn overall and continues to be up solving the double digits.
The exciting part about this, for us, though, is competitive rates absolutely matter. But competitive rates are not sufficient to drive conversion in the agency channel. Because of the plethora of choices that agents have, you'll also have to have competitive service, competitive ease-of-use and ultimately, competitive compensation. So we believe comparative rate or conversion is a fantastic benchmark for us to truly understand how competitively we are overall in the agency marketplace.
Last year at this time, I also shared that we had just introduced A3, our latest auto product model. And while the early results were encouraging, we ran a couple of states and we are seeing significant growth overall from the product model. At this point, about 18 months later, I'm thrilled to share that, that growth continues to come in at expected levels but it's highly concentrated on the more preferred end of the spectrum. So our growth rates with Wrights and with Robinsons are significantly higher than they are in our other segments. These segments are absolutely foundational to how we went in the Destination Era, and our product design and product development is helping us get there.
But we all know that Progressive is known for new business acquisitions. We do a great job. We probably do the best job in the industry. But the reality of it is, sustainable premium growth doesn't just come from acquiring new customers. We have to retain them. And I'm pleased to share [indiscernible] when you look at retention from the agency channel, we see after a dip in early 2015 through about the middle of the year, we've been increasing our agency policy life expectancy month-on-month ever since. And Andrew will talk a little bit more about -- more details around decomposing that, but the drivers of that are twofold: number one, it's mixed. So our mix of new customers has improved. We refer to that as nature. But equal parts of improvement in our PLE are coming from experienced improvements and relationships within our customer relationship management organization. Those investments are paying off, and Andrew will tell you a little bit more about that later.
What's particularly exciting to me though, when I look at our retention improvements, is to overlay our rate activity during the same period of time. So your orange bars are annualized rate change within the agency channel for each month during that same period. What you'll notice is during the period of time that our retention was improving, we were raising rates, somewhere between 2%, 2.5% to 4%. And we do that to keep up with trend and ensure we continue to deliver our target margins. But the combination of being able to improve retention while also increasing rates indicates to us 2 things: number one, market conditions are fantastic for growth in the agency channel and we are really really well positioned; but number two, given the plethora of choices that agents have to move business to, when rates go up, the fact that our rate increases are sticking indicates to us we've got stronger relationships that are forming the agency channel, and that's a critical element of our long-term destination success.
Insurance is a trust-based business. And trust is a really difficult thing for us to measure, unlike many of our other metrics. But we look at actions as opposed to words to understand how we're performing from a customer perspective. Number one, our agents trusting us by placing their better customers with us. The answer is yes. Number two, are they trusting us to interact with those customers on a regular basis? The answer is yes. More agents are opting in to our joint marketing programs for additional protection, quote resolicitation, et cetera. And number three, in a recent survey of thousands of independent agents, they responded that increasingly Progressive has all the products to meet the needs of their preferred customers and more of those agents responded that they're placing their preferred customers with us. The turnaround in the agency channel was driven by a combination of product and stronger relationship building. And we fully expect that the momentum we've established today, with this turnaround, will tear into our second priority, which is bundled penetration.
Growing bundled penetration is the key performance indicator of our Destination Era. Making progress, selling both home and auto to our combined customers, is essential to our long-term success. And the things you need to drive bundled penetration are: number one, available and competitive property insurance; number two, available and competitive preferred auto rates; and number three, the systems, tools and experiences that enable customers and agents to find, quote, buy and ultimately own a Progressive policy or a Progressive bundle. We'll stay with the agency channel for now and talk about where we're headed from a bundled penetration perspective.
Last year, we were in the process of deploying ASI's property product country-wide. Since we last talked, we've added 9 states, and by the end of this year, we'll be in 39 states, representing about 95% of U.S. homeowners, great coverage for where we are in the rollout. We go to market from an agency perspective with our property product through 2 tiers of agencies. Those 2 tiers of agencies are Progressive Advantage Agencies, Progressive Home Advantage agencies and our Platinum agencies. 2 tiers Progressive Home Advantage, a little more broadly distributed, they are our original property agency, and Platinum is a much higher tier, more highly selective tier of agents and a much stronger partnership with us. I shared with you last year that Platinum is a brand-new program that we're introducing last summer that combined consumer benefits of annual policies, more competitive rates through multi-policy discounts and agent benefits, such as easier-to-use systems and higher compensation. We continue to deploy the Platinum program as well. Platinum, by the end of this year will be in 34 states, which represent about 80% of U.S. homeowners. And because preferred auto and property availability are prereqs to the Platinum rollout, Platinum will always trail the rollout of our property product. But overall, we intend to continue pushing on a country-wide basis till we have full deployment of preferred auto, available property and Platinum on a national basis.
But with Platinum, it's less about the states that we're in and much more about the agencies that we're in within those states. So over the last year, we've identified selected and ultimately unboarded more than 1,000 agencies into our Platinum program. Based on those agencies, access to preferred customers, their bundled quote and sale processes within the agency and their willingness to commit to placing a significant portion of their bundled volume with Progressive. But to be clear, Platinum rollout will be a metered rollout. Platinum has a scarcity and a scarcely distributed offering. So agents will be actively managed by our sales reps to ensure they're using the Platinum program and understand it and are using it for bundled business within their agency. So we will continue to grow Platinum, but we will grow Platinum as agents are using it effectively in market.
I also shared last year that because of ease-of-use for bundled quoting is a key element of our Platinum offering. We were starting to build a new Platinum quoting program. And earlier this year, we launched Platinum quoting, which brings to the agent's desktop, for the first time, bundled quoting of Progressive auto and ASI's home, which enables the agent to ultimately save time, share data entry screens and external data fill and have more competitive messaging around the bundled economics available for the agent and making it easier for them to message those bundled savings to the customer. Now to be clear, this is a pilot. It's in 3 states today. We've learned a bunch to date. We'll continue to learn from the pilot, and ultimately we'll build those enhancements into our quoting systems over time.
But the billion-dollar question on all of our minds and likely all of your minds is, is Platinum working? We've attacked the preferred market and agency a few times before, and we've learned from those effects. We've learned from those opportunities that ultimately, for us to introduce a brand-new preferred offering into some of the best agencies in an incredibly competitive independent agency channel, we would have to change agent behavior, which we all know isn't simple, and frankly, it sometimes takes time. So to understand whether Platinum is working, we look at the 2015 cohort of Platinum agents. Those were the point of these Platinum agents during 2015. Think of it as a Class of 2015, if you will. And we look at 2 key performance metrics for that group of agencies relative to the rest of our property insurance agencies. What you're seeing on the screen is 2 lines, the blue line is our Platinum agencies, the orange line is our PHA agencies. And the metric here is preferred auto production. What you'll notice between those lines is, number one, the blueline starts above the orange line, not surprisingly, more productive agencies were selected to be Platinum in the first place. But you'll notice that after the vertical red line, there's an increasing separation from a production perspective between our Platinum agencies and are non-Platinum other property agencies.
This continues into our second key performance metric, and that's new business home and auto bundles, where you'll see exactly the same pattern. Blue, Platinum agents started above our PHA agencies, and the gap continues to widen as our sales reps message the benefits of Platinum, our agents better understand the benefits of Platinum and for their customers based [indiscernible] experience some of the benefits that come from buying through a Platinum agency. The gap between that blue and orange line is what we refer to as a Platinum difference. And that Platinum difference is not just present with the agents we appointed during 2015. If you look at the entire network of more than 1,000 Platinum agencies compared to a non-Platinum property agencies, you see that our Platinum agency plant is responsible for creating more than 3x the number of bundles per agent, per week than our non-Platinum agencies, which absolutely tells us that Platinum is working.
What you'll also notice on this graph, though, is the trend is upward, meaning, we're improving over time. Numbers bounce around from month-to-month, but we're on an upward trend. And the guideline on the screen indicates where we expect the program to be ultimatley from a success perspective. You'll notice we're not there. And that gap exists but we know what we're going to do to close that gap. The primary driver of it is our bundled competitiveness.
Not surprisingly, when we were launching our program, we started collecting data from the market as to where we were competitive and where not competitive. And the great thing is with 1,000 agencies, using their quoting systems to quote ASI property and Progressive auto, we are getting a ton of data on where we are and where we are not competitive. We use conversion as our primary metric, and we look at states that represent about 1/3 of our premium. We're highly competitive on the monoline auto, the monoline home and on the bundle for an individual risk. In those agencies, our focus is to sell what the customer is looking for. If they're looking for home, sell them home; if they're looking for auto, sell them auto or try to sell them the bundle because we are highly competitive.
However, in about 2/3 of the country right now, we're highly competitive on monoline home or monoline auto, but not yet as competitive on the bundle for individual risks. This shouldn't come as much surprise given we had a highly successful monoline auto business that we combine with a highly successful monoline home business. And the overlap between the 2 isn't quite where we need it to be. But the bottom line is we know exactly what needs to be done, and we're collecting a ton of data that enables us to map out how to integrate our products more closely to make sure that we're more competitive at the individual risk on a country-wide basis.
So for us, the momentum that we saw as we were bringing our agency turnaround ultimately in the bundled competitiveness, combined with the infrastructure investments we continue to make in the agency channel and early success of what we're seeing from a Platinum perspective, gives us a ton of confidence that we are absolutely on the right track from a bundled penetration perspective and very, very well positioned to attack that $100 billion independent agency home and auto opportunity.
With that said, we have another highly successful auto distribution channel and that's direct. So I want to update you on where we are from a bundled competitiveness perspective within the direct channel. To be a direct customer's destination for auto and other insurance, we not only have to have all the products that you need throughout their lifetime but they have to be aware of them and understand that we have them available before they have a life event that triggers demand for that product. So they come to us first as opposed to shopping and market. We generate awareness for our products with our direct customers in 3 primary ways: mass media advertising, the reach is not only our current customers but also reaches future customers; point-of-sale messaging, and this is both in our sales systems as well as our servicing systems, so both current customers and potential customers who visit to get a quote understand the breadth of products available and the economic benefits of buying through us; and finally, targeted marketing, we have a ton of monoline customers, that we are now offering the bundled package and the complementary product through messaging in their savings and ease-of-use benefits of bringing more of those products to Progressive over time.
These awareness investments, coupled with a general shift in consumer buying trends towards direct and some internal messaging that gets our employees thinking holistically about protecting our customers' household needs, continues to drive up demand for direct property insurance, both online, on the phones with current customers and with future customers. But great demand and increase in demand for our direct property products creates no value unless we can meet that demand with adequate supply. And frankly, in early 2015, our ability to meet the demand for direct property was less than what we wanted it to be.
Only about 4 and 5 customers coming to us for Direct Property could even get a quote. Part of that is just endemic with the property insurance business. Unlike Progressive, there's virtually no property writers who have similar broad acceptability. Property writers have a relatively mixed focus and some may not accept 20%, 30%, 40% of available risks.
That's an unacceptable outcome for our direct customers. So what we've done all the time is worked, number one, with our carrier partners to expand acceptability and improve routing of traffic online and through our partner call centers to improve availability of direct quoting. So what's particularly exciting on this chart is the yellow line. The yellow line represents our Progressive Advantage Agency, which is our in-house agency that sells multiple products from a property perspective across multiple property partners.
Over the last 1.5 year, we've made significant investments to expand the footprint of that agency by adding 14 states and adding more than 100 state and carrier combinations in order to drive up availability of this, of our property products. At this point, we can meet the needs of about 95% of current or future customers who contact our agency. And we believe that agency model is a superior shopping experience for anyone shopping direct-to-consumer property insurance because it combines the technology enabled ease-of-use of a direct writer with the breadth and depth of an independent agency. We believe strongly in that model and we continue to invest to expand capabilities within our Progressive Advantage Agency.
In the last 18 months, we more than doubled staffing and when calls come in, we route an increased percentage of those to the agency, to the point that at this point, we've more than tripled the sales over the last 18 months through the agency. We will continue to invest in that space and continue to use this superior business model to delight our direct customers from a bundled penetration perspective. But for us, bundling is not just about home and auto. It's also about home -- renters and auto. So in our world, we enjoy an advantage position with younger, simpler needs, auto insurance customers, many of whom don't yet own a home. So having a renters insurance available for those customers enables us: Number one, to establish a property insurance relationship with customers and to be able to meet a broader need of those customers earlier in their insurance shopping journey. Renters insurance will never be a massive business for us. It's only about a $4 billion market. But for us, it is a strategic investment. As renters insurance is absolutely a gateway property product towards the coming a bundled home and auto customer with us. We have evidence that those who bundle renters and auto with us are significantly more likely to keep their auto with us and convert that renters to homeowners policy if and when they eventually buy a home. So from a graduating Diane perspective, this is a strategic play for us and one we continue to invest in over time.
We are absolutely thrilled that the acceleration of our penetration from a bundling perspective within our direct book of business. Today more than 1 million direct customers trust us to provide property protection and the key performance metrics for our Direct Property business increasing quote starts, bundled new apps and bundled PES are all up more than 20% on a year-over-year basis. And with the investments we continue to make, to drive demand and then meet that demand with ample supply and great experiences, we have every confidence we will continue to accelerate bundled penetration within the direct book of business.
The third priority that I shared with you last year is to continue to advance our science of risks and segmentation. Customer segmentation, matching rate to risk and pricing accuracy are in our DNA and absolutely a key source of competitive advantage for Progressive. It's been that way for decades and one of the things that truly differentiates and distinguishes our offering. As we look to invest in rate accuracy and pricing segmentation, we recognize that the value it creates, through more competitive new business pricing, which lowers our customer acquisition costs on a fixed advertising base, it increases our retention even if customers shop, they can't replace similar coverage at a similar or lower price and it creates adverse selection within the marketplace, a fantastic trifecta of opportunity for Progressive. So when we think about the product development space, we focus on 3 areas, the first is rate accuracy, the second is coverages and the third is improving customer experience to drive policy life expectancy. These builds, bundles or these enhancements in the product model and deploy them like building blocks, stacked on top of all of the segmentation that existed in the prior model.
Our pipeline from a roadmap perspective is absolutely robust from a product development standpoint.  We're currently on 83 in the majority of our states. 83 was designed to be more competitive on preferred households and multiproduct customers. You already heard how that's performing in market. We are thrilled with how it's working.
84 is deploying currently. Tomorrow morning, it'll be our seventh state elevating for 84 and 84 brings with it more stable rates for our renewal customers as well as advanced segmentation based on billing, claims experience and vehicle history. 845 is 84 with some additional protection for transportation network company drivers, Progressive customers who happen to work for an Uber or Lyft. And finally, 85 which is under development right now and we'll launch in early 2018, will bring with it a much more competitive rates for households with usefuls as well as -- I'm not going to tell you what else is in 85, again have to come back next year to learn more about that. But rest assured, we are not taking our foot off the accelerator from a product development perspective and intend to continue to lead from a segmentation perspective. But the best segmentation in the world creates no value if we can't get it to market quickly. And while we've always been known for our nimbleness and ability to deploy our products to market quickly, we recognize from a core value perspective that excellence is doing things better today than we did yesterday and we continue to invest to advance our speed to market. So in the last 24 months, there's been a joint research and development in IT team, reengineering our process, our product development and product deployment and since we last talked in May, they've been able to double the annualized rate with which we can deploy our product innovation into the marketplace. So what that means is when we talked in May, we had 3 states on 83. Today, we have 32 states. As of tomorrow, we'll have 7 states on 84. When we talk next year, we'll have 38 states on 84 and 85 will be spun up just about to hit the market. This lethal combination of product innovation and speed to market enables us to widen our lead over the competition. And when we look to assess how well we're doing relative to the competition, we start by looking at some industry data. The industry data you're seeing on the screen is loss in LAE for PCI, essentially about 2/3 of the market, 9 of the Top 10 carriers and the orange line and then, Progressive in the blueline. What you'll notice is that environmental activities, the economic recovery, gas prices, severity on low pricing the cars due to safety equipment, trend in the industry has been climbing since the middle of 2012. So you'll also notice that the blueline, the progressive loss in LAE, we've been competing in that exact same environment and the reality of it is our results have been rock solid. The difference between these 2 lines is product segmentation. It's our ability to better understand what risks while insuring and better sort out which ones are high cost from low cost. What that means in the marketplace is those in the orange line, the rest of the market as their loss costs are climbing and they don't know which risks are driving those loss costs up, they raise base rates, and when they raise base rates, the best customers in their book of business shop and they can often find a lower price with companies like us that are better segmented.  We're on this cycle over and over enough times and they're left with residual risks that they're still underpriced on and priced dramatically higher than the market on any of the better risks that we ensure. What it also means though for us is today, we enjoy about a 10-point gap in loss in LAE relative to the market and when you combine that with our technology enabled expense gap, specifically in the agency channel, what it enables us to do is combine incredibly competitive pricing end market, which drives the growth of the business with wider underwriting profit margins than the overall industry, delivering on our profit targets. A great combination for an insurance business.
Now I also told you last year that emerging data sources for an opportunity as opposed to a threat for Progressive. And since making our majority investments in ASI or ARX, we've been building a massive data set of home and auto risk characteristics in home and auto loss characteristics. What this has enabled us to do is improve model accuracy, identify new segmentation and reduce our rating costs. An early example of how we're leveraging this data set was an auto waiting variable that was highly predictive of home loss frequency. To the tune of about a 30% difference in pure premium. As a way to identify that if I quickly jumped on it and deployed at the market. So it's providing a segmentation list as a bundled household that they wouldn't normally have had absent the joining of this data. And to be frank, we are just getting started digging into this massive data set and fully expect that the joint R&D team between ASI and Progressive will leverage this treasure trove of information to identify new ways to assess and ultimately price and improve rate accuracy for our household bundled pricing.
So last year, I shared with you some fairly aggressive goals for our overall business with the turnaround in our Agency business as well as great performance from our direct business, coupled with the investments we're making to increase bundled penetration across both our direct and our Agency business, a robust product development pipeline or future segmentation enhancements and the faster speed to market on top of our leading the industry, I am absolutely confident that we are incredibly well positioned to become consumers #1 choice in destination for auto and other insurance.
With that, I'll bring John Sauerland on to talk about Snapshot and data management."

It's been a while since we gave you a deep dive on Snapshot, our usage-based rating program. We have a new model in the marketplace, I'll share results around that, but also share more holistically why Snapshot is so powerful for Progressive.
Later this year, we will roll out a new delivery mechanism to experience for Snapshot and that is via mobile. I'll share the rollout plans there, we're very excited by that, but I'll also share what our expected benefits from that rollout are. But overarching all of this is something that I think is even more powerful than Snapshot, sort of [indiscernible] benefit from Snapshot if you will, and that is the big data management and analysis capabilities that we've developed around Snapshot that are now paying dividends across the organization and I believe can be a source in competitive advantage going forward.
If you're familiar with Progressive, you know that we have a history of innovation, I would say the Snapshot is as a result of that history of innovation. We started out many years ago installing this football-size device in the trunks of some cars in Texas, proved out the concept a little bit, to enjoy the benefits of Moore's law, shrinking of technology, I mean, we're able to get the technology into a device that could plug into an OVD port on a vehicle. Unfortunately back then connectivity was an issue. We mail this device to our customers along with a cord then we ask them to go find 6 months after plugging the device in their car, plug that cord into device, and into their desktop more than likely back then by the way and more than likely try and upload via their dial-up modem. Obviously, not a big hit. What was a big hit was when we're able to get the technology and especially the cell chip low enough and the cell transmission costs low enough so that we had virtually real-time transmission of the data. In today's world, we sort of call that the Internet of Things. Back then, it was just via cell towers.
Today, we're going to be moving to mobile. I will talk more about that in a bit, so I won't spend time here now. The offline model for Snapshot is not via device, not via your phone, it's directly from the vehicle. We're happy to say we're actually in the market today with that model with General Motors. General Motors is the only car manufacturing, to my knowledge, with that capability today. As you all know, technology takes a long time to move into the fleet. This won't be a broad-based model soon. But nevertheless we're excited to be in partnership with GM in market in Australia and I'll share a bit more about that in a moment.
If Moore's law allows you to shrink technology, I believe, there's got to be a corollary to Moore's law that says that data coming out of that technology doubles every 2 years or even every 1 year. We now have 2.2 trillion records in our database from Snapshot, 2.2 trillion records. If you think about those records as rows on a spreadsheet, those rows are widening. The blue area on the chart here is GPS data or we don't today rate on GPS, we are collecting it for research purposes and it widens the data field, if you will. Now when we introduce mobile, we'll be collecting even more information. Mobile will take that with that record 20 fold from where it is today, with that explosion here is incredible. It's been a challenge, it's also a huge opportunity. We'll talk more about that in a moment.
But let me take a step back first and make sure I have everyone grounded in Snapshot. We have 2 models in the marketplace today. We're not great with naming, it was the 2.0 model and the 3.0 model. The 3.0 model has rolled out with 83. So in the majority of the countries today as Pat Callahan just mentioned to you, in the 2.0 model we didn't give you a discount when you opted into Snapshot, you can to Progressive or an agent, agreed with the Snapshot program, 30 days later, we give you a discount based on your 30 days driving behavior. Drive for 5 months more, we lock-in for the rest of your tenure with Progressive. 3.0, we offer a participation discount. It varies by customer segment, we'll talk about that in a moment then you drive for 6 months, here again, we locked-in to your discount or a surcharge. So that's a big change with the 3.0 model. The 2.0, we're very concerned about establishing consumer acceptance for the concept because we have been the leader in UBI. We've got in consumer acceptance. We're in a place now where consumers are willing to opt into the program, as you'll see, even if there's a chance for a surcharge. So in the 2.0 model, we had up to a 30% discount, 0% surcharge. In the 3.0 model, we had up to a 20% discount and up to a 10% surcharge. So similar range, very different model. In 2.0, about 60% of our customers who partook got a discount. In 3.0, about 75% of our customers got a discount and in 3.0, more than half of our customers received more than a 10% discount, which is pretty material in the auto insurance space. So given the perspective on the different models, keep that in mind as we talk about results and also give you a little bit more perspective on the distribution of our customers driving behavior. The results. They're good. New apps are up, I can't attribute all of this to Snapshot, however, as I mentioned, the 3.0 model rolled out. At the same time with 8.3, we made a lot of changes here, we can't tease it out completely, but we are out sharp and this is just Snapshot apps on graph in front of you. Those things, I hope you will notice since that agency apps are up more. We've been challenged around agency adoption of Snapshot for many years now, frankly. The inclusion of an upfront discount, a participation discount helps us a lot in the agency channel. As Pat told you, it's largely driven by comparative layers, somewhat of an auction environment, the more we can get a more competitive rate up there at new business, the better chance we have of getting customers into Snapshot.
I mentioned those discounts, the participation discounts vary by customer set. Ranges from about 2 percentage for Sam's, up to about 6% for Robinsons, we define that participation discount not based solely on the customer marketing target there, but that's the average of the discount for each respective segment. Not surprisingly, conversion is up more on the preferred end of the spectrum. Even with 2.0, Snapshot customers converted at a higher rate than non-Snapshot customers. So being interested in Snapshot improves your conversion rate, all else equal. And in 3.0, we obviously see that continuing, but we also see a greater disparity not surprisingly on the more preferred end of the spectrum where the participation discounts are higher. 
When we look at new apps by customer segment, here again, the mix of SKUs a bit towards the preferred end. But what I hope you also notice is that the slope, if you will of that relationship in the Agency business is higher, it's deeper. We're getting more Robinsons into this [indiscernible] into the Snapshot program, Pat and Tricia told you, the Robinson segment is the largest segment available to us on the Personal Lines space and its our lowest market share. So to the extent we can get more customers in here, that's fantastic.
Something not necessarily specific to 3.0, but I think representative of where we're at today when it comes to the usage-based rating, is the fact that it is broadly acceptable. And I'm just sharing you one example here and this is age. So when you look by customer segment, the percentage of folks 18- to 22-year-old who opt in the Snapshot is about the same as the percentage of folks are 55 and above. And 100% accessible in the marketplace for sure, but broadly acceptable.
So hopefully, I convinced you that Snapshot is helping us on preferred, it's helping us grow. I often get the question and even got it in the lobby before this. And that can you tell me how is it helping? Put benders to that for me. Some facts. The most powerful rating variable we have ever seen and with 3.0, even more powerful than 2.0. So our analysts are working hard on improving those algorithms. 3.0 even more predictive with losses in 2.0, and 2.0 was way more predictive than any other rating variable we've seen. Another fact. We provided more than a $0.5 billion of discounts to customers with Snapshot inception to date. More than $0.5 billion worth of discounts. Those folks think, well, that seems to be a benefit for a customer, how is that a benefit for Progressive? To help answer that I'm going to take you back to a chart that we've showed you actually in 2012. This chart shows the loss ratio and the retention rate across discount buckets, if you will for Snapshot customers. So we have 0% to 30% discount along the horizontal there, and to the left of that 0, we have non-Snapshot customers. So think of those as your base case. So the majority of our customers don't ask into Snapshot, so that's a robust base case and what do we see? This is again 2.0, when a customer got a 0% discount from us, they will actually do a surcharge. But again, we didn't do that for consumer acceptance reasons, the highest loss ratio is for customers with 0 discount. As you see, the loss ratio improved markedly if you go to the right. It's important to look at the scale on this graph, that loss ratio is much better for the best drivers who are receiving the biggest discounts.
When you look at the retention lines, the consumers who expected to receive a discount and did not, the 0 percentage, lowest retention. Those customers leave way more frequently and when they leave, where do they go? They go to our competitors. By and large, our competitors are not priced for this. So those customers are going for more than likely a lower rate than we're offering them, so we believe they materially miss price as the competitor.
You go out on the right, not surprisingly, retention improves a lot as you get people bigger discounts, but the big 2-point [indiscernible] you have to takeaway here is the least profitable customers and frequently, the unprofitable customers leave most frequently, the most profitable customers are way more inclined to stay.
In auto insurance, I would tell you, in any business model, if you have a program where your best, most profitable customers are most inclined to stay, and your least profitable or even unprofitable customers find their way to your competitor, that's a great progress. Pat Callahan showed you the industry loss ratio graph, Progressive was here, right, the industry on a pretty decent slope up. This isn't the only reason, but this is the kind of segmentation that we believe drives that disparity in the marketplace. So let's look at 3.0. Here, you can see we announced surcharging those customers who are on the worse end. So our loss ratio for those customers goes down. Customers out on the -- more -- better driver end of the spectrum, higher discounts. Again, better loss ratio, not quite as well as with 2.0, but still exceptional. You look at that scale and when you look at retention because we're surcharging customers, they leave even more frequently than they did in the previous model and not surprisingly, consumers we're offering the discount to continue to stay at a much higher rate. So Snapshot is getting us more preferred customers. It is helping rating segmentation adverse selection a lot. Hope you got those points.
Our next step for Snapshot is mobile. We've been very deliberate in coming to market with mobile. If you think about the challenge here and measuring driving behavior with a phone, then obviously money, right? Some of you take the train, some of you take the bus, you commute with a friend, you leave your phone at home, what have you, a lot of challenges and we want to make sure we got this right  There's been a ton of testing. And just to give you an appreciation of those challenges, what you're looking at here is an example of a real tough case, so an individual with the app and the device in their car. This is about 2 months of driving, each row represents a day, 24 hours across the horizontal axis over a day, not surprising, and what do we see? So the blocks are purple, that means the device and your phone are showing a trip. They're matching up. If the block is blue, that means the device is just showing a trip, not the phone. Red the opposite. Red is the phone showing the trip, not the device. So if you stare at this, you say, okay, it looks like we have a commute pattern, right? 5 days a week, we drive to work and we drive home. And we take our phones to work and they're on. We don't see that on a commute, right? what else do you see? Well, there's some blue sections, those blue sections look to me like they're more on the weekend, maybe spouse is driving the car, maybe kid is driving the car. The red dots in the middle are very intriguing to me. My conclusion, I don't know this first case, as that this person has a regular scheduled Monday lunch date and that buddy drives. The lunch then back, interesting things. But the point is how do we account for this and still have really active driving data to rate on. We worked with a ton of app developers, the technology is amazing. The app is able to learn the driver fingerprint, if you will. It runs it pretty quickly, I have an app and I can tell when my child is driving the car, when my spouse is driving the car, it excludes those trips. Thankfully, for my own personal [indiscernible] . You get the point. How about this, we can look after a trip starts back to see if the driver got in the left side of the car or the right side of the car. Technology in phones is amazing now. We work really hard to make sure this is right. Let me give you a picture of the rating reason behind why we work so hard to make sure this is right. We work with a number of different schools developing apps. Hard brakes are our most important rating data field for UBI. So you want your phone to reflect a brake about the same time as you want your device to reflect a brake, right?
The graph on the right shows pretty tight relationship, graph on the left not so much. I'm really happy to tell you that we chose the app on the right. And I'm almost is happy to tell you that we're pretty confident the competitor was using the app on the left. Really important that we got it right. We think we had it right, we're 2 states out before the end of the year. We expect to have the rest of the country rolled out in the first half of next year. We think it's a great rating tool. We also know it's going to be a better consumer experience. Today, we mail a lot of devices to customers, not all of them come back, but the customer has to take it, embark it, put it in their car, extract it from the vehicle, mail it back to us, it's logistical challenge and it's costly. We've previously told you the technology expense is -- with our current model is about a point on the P&L. Mobile will completely eliminate technology expenses for sure, but it will materially reduce those costs. As I mentioned to you, the long-term model, we believe, is data right from the vehicle. Again, this won't be a broad-based model anytime soon because of the pace of technology penetrating the fleet. But it's a fantastic model, it's working really well, it's small so far, admittedly. General Motors customers' [indiscernible] 2015 and greater at this capability, all are voluntary. They can opt in to sharing 90 days of driving behavior with Progressive. If it looks like we'll give that customer a discount, we'll offer them a quote. If it looks like they wouldn't do a discount, we won't offer them a quote. Think back on that loss ratio curve. The customers we're selling to here have a very high average discount. What was true about the most -- the highest average discount customers in our programs, they're the most profitable, right? So we got a model here where we can just sell to the most profitable drivers with our current algorithms. It will evolve, we'll probably tailor to the various methods of measurement, but today, it's a great model, we're really excited to be in market with General Motors and we're excited to talk to you more about that in the future.
I told you that the data explosion has been rapid. I told you that it's been a challenge for us, frankly. This graph shifts to terabytes as opposed to trillions of records. Back in 2013, our analysts were struggling because it was taking them almost a month to process the Snapshot data set, almost a month. They literally had analysts trying to create many server farms in the closets near their workspaces. We got smart, we brought in the right technology, we developed the talent internally, our processing time dropped dramatically, going up a little bit as the data set grows further, but the better news here is that we are now using this technology across other parts of the company. While we were together last year, Pat Callahan told you we're starting to look at claims fraud using big data techniques. We now have that fully rolled out. Every night, we are looking at hundreds of data elements through our claims file, through our policy files and looking for the potential for fraud. We don't identify fraud with this model, we refer to an individual who does the further investigation and does the right thing handling the claim. We're using traditional data, but we're also using what's called unstructured data which, in this case, means text. So claims adjusters are typing in notes into our systems, this mines the text and joins that with other data to look for potential fraud. What you're looking at on the screen here is a network of claims that had we previously identified as fraudulent, rendered to the system overnight, the claim in blue pops out, suspect claim. Our adjuster does more investigation. 3 vehicle accidents, fixed injuries claimed in this accident, further investigation revealed the damage on the vehicles did not match the facts as reported by the injured parties, we are able to deny the claim. Previously, our model here has been if it looks suspect, the adjuster refers to an expert. I can't tell you, we would have missed this one, but I can tell you, I bet we would have missed this one and I can tell you, we're looking at a lot more claims much more with a zero in target sort of approach today than we previously did.
One more example in that arena. We previously had identified a suspect claim, right through the system overnight and we find 1 data element common with 166 other policies in our database. What we had identified here upon further investigation is what we call a Street broker. In urban areas, where auto insurance is very expensive, there are enterprising individuals, we use our systems to take their information and create an ID card and sell you that ID card for a couple of hundred bucks cash. They generally are using a stolen credit card or another means to buy the policy or immediately cancel the policy. So what we have here was our 166 people were probably not in the right state with their auto insurance, we're able to reach out to those customers and do the right thing and get them in the right place.
Another quick example, you probably know that big data has been in play in the e-marketing, online marketing space for a long time and we've actually, enjoyed the benefits of the vendor or third party solutions, optimizing advertising networks online with banner ads that kind of thing. We are now using this processing power to design the experience. In our direct business, we pay a lot to get a prospect in the door. We do a lot to make sure we streamline that tunnel, if you will, get him the quote, get him into the by-process. Historically, we've done really well with that, but we've done it so much painstaking, frankly because we do 80 tests. We want -- try the orange button versus the blue button. The button over here versus the button over here. But we've done it really, really well. And historically, we did something in this case that we call the coverage packaging tool. We used 7 variables to optimize the experience with the customer and we're able to improve the funnel, the yield by about 4%. And the 4% difference feel like a lot to you, we have a lot of direct prospects, that's about $0.5 billion of lifetime premium. Today, we're using what we call real-time decisioning. We're looking at more than 3 times as many variables as used to. We've been able to improve the yield another 4% and growing and we've been able to do it in about a 1/5 of the time.
Tons of opportunities, I could go on with examples. Hope you get the picture. The data space is booming, even with Snapshot, due to GPS, due to mobile, this curve is going to get steeper. Layered on top of that, that unstructured data we just talked about, the text. In our call centers, we've been translating voice to text for many years now.  We're able to mine that as well. Andrew Quigg will talk about that in a moment. We're now starting to ingest images, photos and video. That will soon be, not today yet for us, that will soon be data, we mesh with all the other data in our systems as well. We have been a leader in using data and analysis for segmentation, for experience design to our competitive advantage. I believe, the opportunity to do that and differentiate ourselves versus the competition, it's only going to grow and we expect to lead.
Now I'm going to hand the floor over to Andrew Quigg to talk customer relationship management and here again, I think you will see similar themes through Andrew's talk."

I have the pleasure of speaking to you today on few topics. The first half of the section will be on retention, and I'll tell you about the improving momentum we see with our retention. And then in the second half of the section, I'll pro",4171,"Thank you, John. I have the pleasure of speaking to you today on few topics. The first half of the section will be on retention, and I'll tell you about the improving momentum we see with our retention. And then in the second half of the section, I'll provide an overview of our customer marketing initiative and I'll describe the advanced analytics we're applying to this problem as John Sauerland alluded to.
So first off, I want to just reiterate our preferred retention measure which is Policy Life Expectancy or PLE. PLE is the average length of time we expect a new policy to stay with Progressive. We calculate PLE by first calculating our retention decay curve, and then we take the area under this curve to get our PLE statistics. That retention decay curve can be calculated multiple ways depending on the trade-off and responsiveness versus stability that we see here. Our standard measure is to use 12 months for each point along that curve. That is our trailing 12 PLE that we've always reported out. We also calculate a trailing 3 PLE starting in 2014. That trailing 3 PLE uses 3 -- the most recent 3 months along that retention to get curves. So it's more responsive to more recent observations. Just some notes on the PLE calculation. The first 60 months represent actual data that we've recently observed and between months 60 and 300, we use an extrapolation and we've seen all policies and after 300 months, which is a conservative assumption. We think the PLE statistic is accurate for a number of reasons and I'll highlight one of those today. We think it removes any tenured lives. So if we use simple retention rates, as our book of business ages, all else being equal, we think we'd see higher retention rates and that would be although that retention curve getting shifted. So using the PLE calculation remove any 10-year bias from our statistics.
So with that background, I wanted to give you an update on the current progress with trailing 12 PLE. I'm happy to report that we've seen very positive PLE growth in 2016. We're up 6% year-over-year. 6% year-over-year, there we go. This is the largest increase since 2009 and as Tricia said on our last quarterly conference call, for every one month of PLE, we see $1.5 billion an additional lifetime or in premium for the company. We're also pleased that we're seeing similar percentage increases within our agency channel and in our direct channel and the rest is at an all-time high. What we're really pleased with the overall momentum we see, or even more pleased with what we see with our Robinsons in the Destination Era. For our Robinsons, PLE is up 17% over the past 3 years. And the past 12 months, we're up 9%. So just great momentum that we're seeing with the Robinsons. As Tricia alluded to earlier, the Robinsons are now 3x greater and yearly 3.5x greater than our Sam's for PLE.
We'll also be adjusting the PLE calculation in the coming months. We haven't updated that extrapolation for a while, and we're seeing better retention in that tail of the PLE curve than we've seen historically. And so when we update the PLE calculation, overall PLEs will go up by more than -- by about 2%. And for our Robinsons it will be even higher. Our Robinsons are disproportionately represented in the tail of the PLE curve. This means that will add even more opportunity for Robinsons. We'll be able to acquire them more aggressively, and we'll be able to bundle our current customers more aggressively. So far I've spoken inclusively about the trailing 12 PLE, but I want to go back to the trailing 3 that I talked about in the opening. If we think about the difference between the trailing 3 and the trailing 12 PLE is the unrealized momentum in our PLE data. And we're very pleased with what we see here. For total auto, the trading 3 PLE is up 8% year-over-year. For the trailing 12 PLE, it's up 6%. So we think we have about 2 points of unrealized momentum within our PLE. As you can see across all of our segments, the trading 3 PLE is higher year-over-year than the trailing 12, so we feel like we have a lot of momentum. But the highest difference is for our Robinsons. For Robinsons, we think we have about 4 points of momentum that we haven't yet realized. I want to stop here and just talk about the goal that Tricia outlined for us in 2015. Tricia's challenged us to increase retention by 50%. We think we can achieve this in 3 ways. First, we believe we can change our mix. In the Destination Era, we think we can change our mix to more preferred customers and new business. Pat outlined some of the strategies we have there. In addition to changing mix, we think we can improve our price competitiveness relative to the competition. Pat showed the slide where we have increasing Agency PLE while overall rates are being increased. And third, we believe we can improve the customer experience. We think we can nurture our customers to stay with Progressive longer, and I'll spend some time on that in the next section. We think this path to a 50% increase runs through our more preferred segments. We see more opportunities with our more preferred segments, increased retention. And then as the mix of our business changes, we believe we'll hit better overall goal of increasing retention by 50%. 
I want to switch gears here and start talking about the nurture side of things. But I want to pause and just talk about data for a minute and specifically how we're using data for customer experience. We see a virtual cycle in our pricing. I started off in product management. This was a big part of our roles. In pricing, we see that when we acquired customers, we are paying their data. And with that data, we can derive segmentation and insights and improve our pricing, which allows us to acquire more customers, which gives us more data, which gives us better segmentation, a virtual cycle exist within our pricing. We think the same virtual cycle exists with our customers in customer experience, specifically with our customers we -- being customers and then we interact with them. With interactions generate data and that data provides insights and ideas in segmentation that allows us to increase retention, which allows us to have more customers. And more customers provides more interactions and more data and we get a virtual cycle here within customer experience as well. And in the Destination Era, as we gain more products, we think that's cycle spins even faster, more products, more interactions, which means more data. So as we invest in the Destination Era we think we'll have even more predictive data to use with our customers. We give you that background because leveraging data is part of a larger initiative that we're working on here at Progressive. In the 2015 Investor Relations meeting, Glenn said that we need to be as good at customer marketing as we are at consumer marketing. And so we've put a joint team together from our customer relationship management organization and corporate marketing, and that team is working on this customer marketing initiatives. There are 4 pillars that we've talked about with the customer marketing initiatives. The first is that we want to improve our customer knowledge. We want to assemble such predictive data because we can for our customers, that we know the experiences that they're going through. After that, we want to improve our customer engagement. There's 2 parts to this. We want to improve the prophecies that they go through, and we want to segment those customers better. The third pillar is interfaces. As we've come up with segmentation and processes, we need flexible interfaces to deliver those to our customers. And then finally, we want to brand those interfaces for our customers. Jeff Charney talked about this last year and so I won't spend time on it this year. But want to have the branding that resonates with our the customers as they interact with us. 
So with that said, let me walk through some of these pillars in particular, and I'll start with knowledge. As an initial example, I'll talk about small data that we are -- had been working on for our customers. Over the past 18 months, we've looked for internal and external data elements that are highly predictive for our customers. I'd just mattering those data elements on the screen. On the x axis here is the volume of data. You can think of this as a number of customers described by the data. And then on the y axis, I have a general list associated with that data. You can figure out what the -- as in what's the retention or a listing graduation to become Robinsons or listed endorsements. No matter which of those 3 we're talking about with the data, it's highly profitable for Progressive to know. If we know that there will be a change with that customer, we can act on it in a profitable way. So let me give you some examples. Example #1 is an internal data element. It came from our digital servicing environment, so digital servicing action that we see our customers pay. It wasn't within a structure data warehouse, but we had it in-house. And when we dug into it, we saw there's a 14-point difference in our retention if we saw this data element. To give you another example directly, a little bit more transparent about. Example 2 is an external data element from a data vendor, we call it the newlywed variable. It comes from wedding invitations, bridal registries, court house records, things associated with getting married. And when we see that data element on one of our customers. In the next 6 months, there's more than a 200% lift in whether they change their marital status. And when a customer changes their marital status, it changes the retention rates, it changes the number of vehicles and drivers in the household and sometimes it adds additional products like a property policy. Now beyond small data, we've also started to think more about the big data available to us in customer relationship management. And we think technology companies said that 80% of the world's data is unstructured, and we think that's true within CRM as well. I'm going to describe 1 area today although there are others that we are working on as well. The area I'm going to describe today is the action that we're taking to put together an unstructured database of our customer words, the words that we hear from our customers. So let me give you some examples of some sources of this data. The first area is from our survey responses. Annually, we received more than 80,000 survey responses from our customers. In addition, we have more than 1 million chat transfers with our customers, when they go to our digital servicing environment, they can chat with a Progressive consultant. But as John  Sauerland alluded to, the largest and most significant source of words is from our calls with our customers. We received 36 million personal lines calls per year, and we've been transcribing those calls, and we have -- using advanced analytics, and we have all those calls in text form that we can put into a data warehouse. In total, Progressive has more than 10 billion words annually from our customers. So what can do we do with this? Well, I'll give you a few small examples today. One thing we've done is just search all this text first 3-word combinations, we call these trigrams. And there are some trigrams that are very predictive of, say, defection. I have 3 of those on the screen. I can tell you, for example, that trigram #3 is I never received. I never received my ID card. I never received that document that I requested. But I never received. And when a customer says that to Progressive, they are 1.4x more likely to defect from Progressive in the next 6 months. Another thing we've looked at is metadata. You can think of metadata as something other than the words that are present on those phone calls. For example, metadata #2 here is the amount of silence time on a phone call. As that silence time increases, the future defection chance increases as well, so there's about a 1.1x relativity on the amount of silence time on a phone call. There's even some significant words, some single words that is spoken or written or shared are good predictor of future defection from Progressive. I won't share those today but we've parsed through the text to look for those single words. 
So I like to move beyond knowledge now and talk about our engagement. And as a reminder here, I'm going to talk the segmentation side of the engagements. In Progressive, we've certainly built traditional models. We use generalized linear models in a number of situations. These are tried and true models that are used throughout insurance and throughout business. And here, I want to tell you about the probability of Robinson graduation. This was a traditional modeling exercise that we went through in CRM. So we gave a team, I'll call them team #1, some of that small data that I talked about in the knowledge section. And we asked them to predict which customers may become a Robinson in the future, and they did a good job with this. They built a model. And the model in the top that still had a 4x greater chance of becoming a Robinson than the leased in the responses thus far. But then we took that same data and we gave it to a separate team, one that did not work with the first team. And the separate -- second team did an even better job. In the second team, we found that the team came up with a model that was 7x greater. But the best result was if we combine models. And when we combined models, we found that the best tranche had a 9x greater likelihood. So even in the situation where we're building traditional models, we try to put the models together and combine them in ways to create the best outcome for Progressive. Now the world has moved beyond just generalized linear models, given the vast amount of data and the computing power that's available. Let's move to things like rain and forest or gradient boosting machines in neural networks. Some of these advanced predictive models that are now available to us. We've invested in an advanced analytics team within CRM to take advantage of these models. The first assignment for this advanced analytics team was to build a defection model, to try to predict who might leave Progressive. And the best models were the gradient boosting machines and neural networks are being built. Because of the power of these models, I want to spend a little time just walking through the first generation neural network with you today. On the screen, I have the basic structure of a neural network. I want to explain it to you. The first layer of a neural network is known as the feature layer. Features are like the independent variables that you would've seen in a regression historically. They are the attributes to the policy. Here on the screen, we have 2 features. F1 is a categorical variable of whether or not the policy is on EFT payments or automatic payments with Progressive. F2 is a percentage change in premium that, that policy will see in its upcoming renewal. We're going to have 2 predictors in this small snippet of a model. I can tell you on our first generation neural network, we had more than 900 predictors, and that was before we had access to all those billions of words that I described previously. From the feature layer, data passes along synapses to an output layer. Synapses are weights between negative 1 and 1 that are multiplied by the data. And then the data reaches this hidden layer. At the hidden layer, there's functions that are set there, common function that are used in neural networks that transform the data. From the hidden layer, it travels along another set of synapses to the output layer. Again, the synapses multiply it by a number between negative 1 and 1 and then in the output layer, there's another function that transforms the data. And out of that output layer comes a predictor of defection or retention with Progressive between 0% and 100%. With that set up, let me walk you through a training of this neural network. On the screen are 8 policies from a training data set. These are 8 policies where we both know the predictors, the features of those policies and what happened with them. So we have some policies that renew with Progressive and some policies that defected from Progressive. What we do is we run these policies through the neural network. This is called forward propagation. Each of these policies passes through the network and is calculated the retention of it. So the features enter that feature layer, they're multiplied by that number between negative 1 and 1 and in the synapse layer, they hit the hidden layer where they're transform by a function. Another weight hits it and finally, transformed by a final function and a predictor of retention comes out. You can see here in this first iteration that the neural network is almost random. All those policies are comped around the middle of the scale for predicting retention and the overall model accuracy as well. But what happens next is 1 of the 2 reasons why neural network works. What happens next is a self-correcting mechanism exists within a neural network. It's called backward propagation. During backward propagation, each of those synapse weights are recalculated. If we calculate it based on an iteration method called stochastic gradient descent. Stochastic gradient descent helps the model move towards the maximum accuracy. So as those late changes models changing itself to become more accurate. After this network propagation, we train the model again. We take these 8 policies and we pass them again through the model. Each of the policy enters the feature layer, hits the hidden layer and goes through the output layer. And you can see this time, the policies that renew with Progressive are starting to go higher on the renewal probability scale and those that defect are starting to go lower and the model accuracy improves, and then we backward propagate again, again adjusting the model. In actuality, we do this tens of thousands of times. Here in the room, I'm going to do it 10x quickly just so you can see what happens. And this is the second reason why neural network works. It's because of brute force computing power that's available to us in this day and age. At the end of this, the model is trained. You can see after 10 iterations that the model accuracy has improved, and we have a model that's now ready for production. You do want to notice here when we do this in actual practice, we keep a hold-out data set to make sure that we don't over fit the model. So what happens now? Well, we want to use this model in production. So I brought in 2 policies that we don't know the outcome for. They maybe coming up for renewal with progressive, Policy 9 and Policy 10. What we do is we take the feature of these policies, and we pass them through the neural network. And here we can see that Policy 9 will retain with Progressive likely, and Policy 10 might defect from Progressive. We started to discriminate between policies that will stay and those that might leave. Now I hope you take 2 things away from this. First takeaway is that this was an incredibly intensive calculation process. For this first generation neural network, it took us 7 whole days to run. We were using our local infrastructure but still it took an incredibly long time. And that was before we had tens of billions of words. That was before we tried adding on more hidden layers to go towards cognitive computing it's just a very large and complex process. And it's because we have an impressive analytical infrastructure that we built through the snapshot program that we can start tackling problems like this. The second thing I hope you take away is that this is an incredibly accurate model as well. Now we showed overall model accuracy on the screen. Truth be told that's not what we're interested in. We're actually interested in the tail of the model. If we can predict those policies that are very unlikely to renew. We want to have good tail accuracy. And from the data that we used to build this neural network we also built a traditional model, a GLM model. And when we did that, the neural network was twice as predictive as the generalized linear model. We're using the same data but using more predictive advanced analytics techniques we can be much more accurate in what we're doing, which has large benefits to Progressive. Let me walk through interfaces to tell you a little bit more about how we take these models and use them for business benefit. I want to start by talking about proactive outbound communication. This is us reaching out to our customers. On the screen, I have a couple of examples of digital ads. These are digital ads you put in front of our current customers where we want them to graduate to become Robinsons. We target these digital ads based on that traditional model that I talked about previously. When we combine those models by focusing the most responsive of [ph] we show them these digital ads. And when we've done that along with some other activities like this, we've increased the number of Robinsons we have by tens of thousands, adding millions of dollars in lifetime underwriting profit to Progressive. We're able to do this because of all that acumen we built in advertising to consumers. We used those same patterns in advertising to our customers. Just another example is Policy 10 from that neural network example. We know that Policy 10 may not stay with Progressive, and so we start at campaign to reach out to folks like Policy 10 and invite them to call in to talk about their policy. And when we've done things like that, and we got a few in practice now, the run rate is that annually we'll save tens of thousands of customers worth tens of millions of dollars in lifetime underwriting profits to Progressive. Beyond proactive outbound communication, there's also proactive inbound communication. We have built a tool that our phone consultant can use when someone calls Progressive. We call this tool the customer relationship assistance. It's a user interface for our phone consultants. It took us about 2 months to build, and the beauty of this tool is that it houses all that data and all those models I spoke about previously. So when Policy 10 calls, the consultant on the phone knows to talk to that consumer about their policy and about staying put with Progressive. It's really personalized, right? We can tailor all these interactions and make sure we have the right treatments that file when that customer calls in. It's very flexible. If we want to add new treatments, we can program them in about 2 hours. And earlier results from this are very impressive. We've seen increase in product set, our reduction in future calls and a list in retention. 
Let me recap what I talked about today. In 2015 in the Investor Relations meeting, Glenn said that retention was our Holy Grail. And Tricia challenged us to increase retention by 50%. I'll underscore the progress that you heard today. PLE is up 6% with momentum higher. Direct is at an all-time high, and we're making the most progress with our Robinsons as our mix to that business shifts towards the Robinsons. In customer marketing, as a direct carrier and a servicing independent agent carrier, we have access to billions and billions of pieces of customer data. We have a historical strength in mining that data, driving insights to segmentation and quickly moving the market. We believe we can do that with our current customers. Feed that virtual cycle of data and extend policy life expectancies. And with that, I welcome up John Barbagallo to talk about Commercial Lines."

I'm going to share a little bit about what we're seeing in the Commercial Auto insurance marketplace. I'm going to touch on our most recent results and share a little bit about our near-term action plan. And then I'm going to shift to talk about 2 disruptive trends that are coming to you, small business insurance and non-fleet Commercial Auto insurance. And these are trends that we have not only been monitoring, but we've actually been making investments around them over the last several years, and we think we're favorably position to take advantage of them. But first, let's start talking about the marketplace. I'm going to start with a little history. This is the chart that I've shared with this audience in the past. It's now been updated through 2015. And what it shows is Progressive's relative performance relative to the industry on 2 measures: combined ratio and growth in direct written premium. And 2 things you can take from this graph. One is that over this time period, Progressive by being intensely focused on Commercial Auto as a specific line of business has been able to consistently outperform the industry on combined ratio, usually by a margin of 10 to 15 points.  And for the last few calendar years, it's actually been by 20 points. Now some of that is from our expense ratio. We have a very cost competitive expense ratio. We believe we are the low cost provider in the Commercial Auto, but a lot of that is loss ratio. And by being focused in the way we are, we believe we see things sooner and react faster, and most of the rest in the industry and that contributes to this advantage. The other thing you can take from this chart is perhaps a little more subtle, is that we will and have consistently slowed our growth in the business when we were at risk of exceeding our underwriting target. And we will keep that commitment to those underwriting margin targets. Even with that approach, over time, we have been able to grow our market share consistently to the point where 2015 Progressive became the #1 Commercial Auto writer in the United States. All right, let's jump in to 2016. This is a view, again, same to measures combined ratio and direct written premium. Progressive versus the industry, we've added a few of our key competitors as of the first quarter of 2016. You can see Progressive up in the upper right, cruising along with really good growth and a combined ratio in the high 80s at that point. And the industry had about 6% growth and a combined ratio of 102, which actually isn't too bad when you consider how it ended in 2015, that would appear to be improvement. But if you few update through the second quarter, you see general degradation of combined ratios across the board, including our own. In fact, for the industry, the change in loss ratio, if you take the loss ratio for the 3 months comprising the second quarter, it is fully 8 points higher than the first quarter loss ratio. Now there's some seasonality at play there, but that is a huge, huge change. Now I'm sure you've noticed in our last 2 or 3 monthly earnings releases that our combined ratio has been elevated certainly above historic norms. There's a little bit of prior-year development in there. For the 3 months period, it's about 1 point, 1.25%. But the real driver of that is actually frequency. What we have on the screen now is our bodily injury reported frequency for the last couple of years. Now the blue line is the monthly frequency as you can see that's pretty volatile, it jumps around a lot, we don't tend to pay too much attention to that. Even of those kind of last 2 -- last couple high watermarks there, they're high but certainly, not beyond anything your seen in our history. If you look at the orange line, that is the trailing 6 BI frequency, and that's a much more stable measure, but it's still -- it is relatively reactive to changes in the environment. And there you're seeing what appears to be an inflection point starting in May, maybe as early as April. We believe that is real, at least it's real enough to me that we are reacting to that. We also believe it is largely environmental. Pat talked earlier about general rise in frequency for Auto, there's theories around that, distracted driving, low fuel prices. But in Commercial Auto specifically, particularly the verticals where we tend to compete, we are seeing positive movement in a number of the macroeconomic factors that we track that generally correlate with frequency. Things that home sales, construction spending, trade tonnage, aggregate deliveries all moving in a positive direction, which projects higher levels of economic activity also contributing to higher frequency. So we believe this is real and we are reacting to it. Primarily we're acting with rates. I've talked to this audience before about our rate revision infrastructure at Progressive, our ability to change rates across the broad portfolio relatively quickly, and we have kicked that into gear. What this graph shows is our anticipated rate change for 2016, which will come in at about 9% year-over-year changing rates. Most of that in the second half of the year. We were actually holding rates flat through the first 4 months of the year as we're operating in the high 80s. So we've responded decisively and we've responded quickly, and those rate changes will certainly help the combined ratio. But it will take time. About 90% of our policies are written on an annual basis, but they have to get through a renewal cycle to get the full effect of it. It will certainly help with new business as soon as we can get those rates in place. But in the interim, and I said, we will slow down to ensure we make our margins. In the interim, we're also restricting some high-frequency segments of our business for new business. We're going to stop taking it until we can get those rates in place. Now those segments have always been high-frequency, they will always be high-frequency, and we're perfectly comfortable writing that business at the right rate, we're just not yet there. So that's what we see going on. Again, by being focused we think we are seeing this before much of our competition, and we're reacting before they do. And when that happens historically, that is typically set up very favorable market conditions for us down the road. So we'll see what happens. 
All right. Now I want to shift to those disruptive trends. The first of which is what I believe will be an inevitable shift to a small business owner accessing direct channels for the purchasing and servicing of their small business insurance policies. Consumers across a range of industries have demonstrated not only acceptance of direct channels but, in many cases, preference for those channels. And don't expect small business owners to be any different, especially as digital continues to close the information gap between the buyer and the seller. And we're starting to see investment. Investment by people other than Progressive. And these are companies that are well known. They are well-funded, and they have experienced management. And they are putting the assets in place. Underwriting companies, product filings, technology platforms, all to go after the direct channel for small business owners. And they're starting to spend some money. Not a lot on the marketing front, and actually, it's happening slower than we would've anticipated. We still are the largest spender in the category, but they're starting to spend some money as well. So we're seeing investments. We're also starting to see some growth. This is a view provided by the Boston Consulting Group of the U.S. small business insurance market. Now this is all lines of business, all lines of business for small business insurance, and they peg that at about a $65 billion to $70 billion marketplace. And as of right about now, they're saying direct channels have 8% share. Probably more interesting on this chart is what they project to be the growth rate of the channels. So a pretty aggressive growth rate for digital channels in small business insurance. In fact if you buy into this view, it suggests that traditional channels will begin to decline in absolute dollars as early as 2019. We'll see. When it comes to Commercial Auto, where we have some pretty good data, we're seeing a somewhat similar pattern. Now again, the direct channel for Commercial Auto is still small, less than 2%, but the growth rate relative to the industry growth rate is 2 to 3x. Now full disclosure on this particular graph, that orange line is largely driven by Progressive. We're just about half of the direct commercial auto market right now, and we actually can affect the slope of that line simply in terms of how much we choose to spend. And that's reflected in 2014, we pulled back in our spending, and you see that little dip there. But again, you have a channel where there's lots of investment lining up, and you're starting to see signs of growth from the channel. So the question then becomes who is going to be able to most cost effectively drive demand and control the top of that sales funnel. And this is where we start to feel really good. Because while the others are just getting started, we have actually been at this since 2008. Now we've been selling direct commercial for more than a decade, but it was really in 2008 that we began investing in developing a business insurance brand. In 2008, we started -- we embarked really on a 5-year plan, and it was a 5-year plan to prove to ourselves that we could make the economics of direct marketing commercial insurance work. And it was a very auto-centric approach, charging specific verticals where we tend to do well. We concluded that 5-year plan successfully in 4 years. That gave us the confidence in 2012 to begin broadening our marketing. And by broadening, I mean, both broadening the media we would access and broadening our message to be much less auto-centric and really built around insuring and protecting the business. And that has now evolved to our current campaign, which we just launched, which could really celebrate the small business owner. We've been investing here for a long time, and that investment has been worth it. We would say it definitely has been. One of the key measures of brand health is awareness, and as you can see on these 2 charts, in terms of total awareness and top-of-mind awareness, Progressive is the leading small business insurance brand. Again, this gets back to who is going to control the top of that sales funnel as this channel begins to grow.
How fast might this all happen? I don't really know, but maybe we can look to private passenger auto as a guide if it has happened. The chart on the left shows the shift in channel for private passenger auto over a 20-year period. Now keep in mind that orange line for the direct channel developed concurrently with the development and acceptance of digital channels for consumers. So the Internet gradually migrating over to mobile. We believe those consumer preferences are already in place. And I'll offer an opinion that small business owner, at least a percentage of them, their expectations currently exceed the industry's ability to deliver really good digital experiences. The chart on the right is the effect of that channel shift on Progressive's business. So over roughly the same time period, Progressive's direct auto business grew from being about 12 -- 11%, 12% of our total business to where it is today, half our business. Now it's not that our agency business didn't grow during this time. It did grow. You heard earlier from Pat that it is at an all-time. It's just that the direct business grew that much faster, creating lots of value for Progressive and for our shareholders. We've modeled this out. We've done a number of different scenarios around how quickly the direct channel may grow for small business insurance based on different spend levels by us, spend levels by other. And when we surround what we think are the most likely outcome, it all leads to significant growth for Progressive Commercial, I think.
So we continue to invest in our capabilities. We are in the midst of a major systems upgrade for commercial. One of the benefits of that will be the ability to deliver better digital experiences and, perhaps more importantly, deliver them to market faster and enhance them more quickly. And we continue to invest in and build our in-house business insurance agency.
The map on the left shows our footprint for being able to offer nonaffiliated partner company BOP and general liability policies to prospects and our customers. We also sell workers' comp and professional liability, but the primary coverages they're seeking are BOP and GL. And today, we have -- in virtually every state, we can offer between 5 and 8 products, covering a range of underwriting profiles. And as you can see on the graph on the right, we are growing the agency. And there again, the shape of that growth curve can largely be determined by how much we choose to spend at a given time. And we are growing the agency, and we are having success bundling these small business customers with Progressive Auto, be it Commercial Auto or Personal Auto, and that's an important point. We are creating a lot of bundles with a BOP or GL policy and a Progressive Personal Auto policy, which is just fine. First of all, it helps the agency's economics because those customers are much stickier. Second, it is entirely consistent with the strategy Tricia laid out earlier in terms of acquire, anchor, bundle, extend. This may be how we acquire customers. Certainly, could be how we bundle customers. And also, we're finding that the need for commercial auto in a  small business oftentimes emerges late or later in the life cycle of that business, and business insurance is very situational. Unlike personal lines, really the first purchase of a personal lines product, typically auto, is driven by a state law, state requirement to have insurance or a bank. In small business insurance, that is not usually the case.
So to try to give some context to this slide, I'm going to tell you a story. And it's a story about a real-life, thriving business right here in Northeast Ohio. So a work colleague of mine has a friend, and she's starting a business in her home, in her kitchen actually, cooking bone broth. And she sold this bone broth out of her kitchen to friends and neighbors. Now she didn't have insurance, so we told her she needed insurance. You can argue she'd probably shouldn't had insurance, but she was flying below the radar, which a lot of small businesses do, particularly in their early stages. The sales went well. She got a lot of positive feedback, and she was encouraged to take her product to one of the local farmers' markets, so she decided to give that a try. She applied. She was accepted, but the farmers' market told her, if you want to come on-premise, you have to have a vendor's liability policy and you have to have a liability policy. So where previously she was in that first circle of not really caring about insurance, she now found herself in that second circle of, well, at least temporarily, I have to care about insurance if I want to go to this farmers' market. Not sure if I have a real business yet, but I'll buy the insurance. Farmers' market went well. Again, a lot of positive feedback, getting inquiries from local restaurants who wanted her to supply them with bone broth. She even got a contract with a local grocery store chain, and the business is starting to take off, taking off to the point that she outgrew her kitchen, and she had to lease commercial space, and she had to hire 2 employees to set up more of her regular production cycle for the bone broth. And now she needs a BOP policy for her premises, and she needs workers' compensation for her employees. I'll say now she's in that third circle of I definitely really have to care about insurance. We still have a number of commercial auto policy, but that's about to change. She had been hiring a third party to make her delivery. She now buys her first delivery vehicle, she needs a commercial auto policy.
I understand from my colleague that she is now thinking of expanding her business regionally, maybe nationally. She's realizing she has a real asset here, an asset she wants to preserve, protect, maybe pass on to the next generation. I would argue she's moving into that fourth circle of I genuinely care about private insurance. The point here is for small business owners, it is a journey of one, and they are all different, and they are not necessarily linear like the real-life example I just gave you. People move back and forth. Some small business owners never move out of that second circle. They're kind of the Sams of small business ownership. And to deal with that, we have developed a series of customer journey maps, by business type and by business stage. And what these journey maps allow us to do? It maps our creative and our messaging and our media buying with those key trigger events to deliver the right message at the right time to that business. It is a trend that is clearly coming. You've been reading a lot about it. It's been a little slow to gaining traction. We think it's about to take hold, and we feel we are really, really well positioned to capitalize on that.
The other trend I want to talk to you about is the application of telematics to nonfleet commercial auto insurance. I'm not sure if this is a trend yet, but I do believe it's coming. So telematics have been broadly applied in fleet situations. But even there, there has never been a really strong insurance tie-in. That's been more about asset management and logistics than insurance. But we think that's about to change, particularly in the trucking sector. Now John Sauerland has already talked to you about Progressive leadership position in terms of usage-based insurance pricing science. He's talked to you, and Andrew's reinforced, the big data capabilities Progressive can bring to bear. Those are absolutely assets we can leverage in Commercial Lines. But we have taken a slightly different path in Commercial than they have in Personal with respect to UBI, and we have focused on the transportation industry, the over-the-road truckers. 2 reasons for that. One, we feel a version of the Snapshot product will work perfectly well for a lot of our business auto contractor-type customers. And now as the agency adoption rate of Snapshot is starting to go up, it may be the time for us to introduce that to commercial. The other reason that we focused on transportation is we were anticipating a federal mandate, which is now law, that will require federal motor carriers to have an electronic logging device in their vehicle and operational by December 2017. And these electronic logging devices will be fully telematics-enabled, if you will. They'd have all the data they'd possibly want. So we have for, the last few years, been working directly with the vendors, the  manufacturers of these ELDs to put in place data sharing agreement and cooperative marketing agreements so we can go-to-market together with our products as the demand increases, leading up to the compliance date in December '17 and we've also been collecting our own UBI data for the last several years. Today, we probably have about 600 of our insured trucks on the road being monitored. We've collected over 41 million miles of data, and those data are beginning to reveal some really, really interesting things.
Perhaps the most interesting is that we find with commercial operators the degree of variance in their behavior is far, far greater than Personal Lines customers in terms of how, how much and where they drive. To the extent those behaviors correlate with losses, and they do, that's very exciting because that allows for greater rate segmentation. And John's already talked to you about the power of rate segmentation. He told you that in personal lines, Snapshot is the most predictive, most powerful rating variable we have. We believe, for trucking risks, it will be even more powerful than that. So we're very excited.
Let me give you just a little sampling of some of the things we're seeing. All these examples relate to the same 3 insured vehicles. One of the things you rate on in Commercial Auto is something called radius of operation, which is basically how far do you go from your principal garaging address, how far do you go. It's a rating variable we use. ISO uses it. A lot of our competitors use it. If I'm going to rate radius of operations as a rating variable, it could be hard to verify and it changes over time. Truckers go with the work -- I think that's true of all commercial vehicles. They go where the work is, but we all use it. Well now, with electronic logging devices, we actually know where to go. And in this sample, we have 3 insured vehicles that were all rated based on the same radius of operation, 500 miles, which was pretty good for vehicle fee. We're probably overcharging Vehicle A and Vehicle B. Well, more important than how far you drive is where you drive. Now that we have geolocation data, we can actually score different routes and different roads in terms of relative safety or risk. From there, we can overlay time of day, so you incorporate things like rush hour and potentially things like seasonal weather pattern. You begin to see where this can go. But even with our relatively simplistic model for scoring, which is what we have here, you see pretty significant differences in distribution, which we believe are actionable and ratable. One more, this is how much you drive, and this is really the whole impetus behind the federal mandate. Better regulation of hours of operation, hours of service. Driver fatigue is a major, major safety issue for over-the-road truckers. The graphs on the bottom reflects hours per day of driving. So each bar on the graph is a day. And the light line going across is the federal limit of 11 hours per day. So you can see pretty significant differences in these distributions. Vehicle B -- and remember, this is the guy that goes the furthest from home by far, seems to be doing a better job of managing his hours per day. Vehicle C actually have some 20 and 22-hour days in there. Now what that probably means is we have team driving, 2 drivers taking shift. So that's really important and valuable information and represents a different risk. So this is just a few samples of the types of data we are beginning to develop, that we think will be very, very actionable.
I'm going to conclude with one more chart just because I love the data, and this is another comparison between Personal Auto and, in this case, some long-haul trucking customers. So the bottom graph was taken from a sample of Snapshot customers, Personal Auto Snapshot customers. And all it does is it shows kind of where their cars are during different parts of the day. And what you see by and large is most of the time, those cars are at home, in the driveway, in the garage. And during the daytime hours, that's where you see the driving. Not so much driving in the wee morning hours. Not surprising. The graph on the top is example of Progressive insured long-haul trucks. And what you see there is lots of driving, not surprising, not unusual, 100,000, 120,000 miles a year per trucker. But when they're not driving, they're typically away from home, sleeping in their truck, showering at a truck stop, using a, I don't know, cracker barrel. It could be a pretty hard life for a trucker, and this is where I really start to get excited about this data because this is where I think we can go beyond just straight rate segmentation and start to develop value-added services, even the risk management services, to hopefully make these truckers a little bit healthier and a little bit safer while they're on the road. So again, another trend, we think, is coming to small business insurance, in this case, nonfleet auto insurance, that we feel we're very, very well positioned to capitalize on.
With that, I'm going to bring up Tricia Griffith for some closing remarks."

John  Sauerland talked about our most important variable, our UBI or usage-based insurance, so Snapshot, and how we're continuing on that evolution and how with that work we've actually had even more data capabilities across the enterprise we believe will be a winning strategy for Progressive. Andrew Quigg talked about PLE. We've finally made that breakthrough in PLE especially in the Robinsons segment. Andrew talked about the massive amount of customer data that we have and how we're going to use that data to understand the moves of our customers and be out in front of them, give them a reason to stay.
John Barbagallo talked about the fact that we're outperforming our peers relative to profit and growth, so that's extraordinary. Bottom line then so we have to respond quickly to our frequency trend, and we're doing that with rate. John has his own era coming up in terms of the direct business with small business owners as well as technology, data-driven technology, in the commercial space.
I hope you're thrilled as our team is about what we've executed upon and what we're going to be doing in the future. And I want to thank you for your interest in Progressive. So with that, I will ask John Sauerland to join me for some Q&A."

We haven't disclosed the complete reinsurance program, but I'll give you some quick highlights. So $50 million of retention for a main storm. The first storm has a tower that is up to what -- the average model, I'll say, equates to about a 1 in 300 years storm, so that's pretty high up relative to what we believe other carriers have. We have a second event that also has a $50 million retention on it. But I think ASI has done a great thing. And it's only typical in a marketplace, and that is a prepay reinstatement for about 70% of that tower. That tower is not quite as tall as the first tower, but it's about a 1 in 100-year event, and about 70% of that has reinstatement premiums prepaid.

So in Commercial Lines, they've identified segments of new customers that they believe will be the least profitable. And they're working upfront to underwrite that. In Commercial Lines, they have a lot of ability as well to underwrite a renewal with credits, debits. And they've done a lot of that over time and have targeted that, of course, as well. In Personal Lines, we're actually employing a lot of underwriting these days as well. It hasn't been what we've been -- it hasn't been our forte historically. But probably 4, 5 years ago, we started getting a little more conservative around ensuring that we were bringing in business. The intent was to insure and not otherwise. And I think that's helped us a lot. But higher level, you can improve profitability through raising rates or underwriting segments. And Commercial Lines has been very fast to react in turning on the underwriting where necessary, and they're now reacting very quickly in getting rates up and expect to have those rates up about 9% by the end of the year."

I think you're all familiar with the Safe Harbor statements, and if not, there's also a copy in your materials as a reference guide.
So this particular investor relations meeting represents a really big change. For many, many years, Glenn Renwick was the host of these meetings. In fact, I think he started them. Last week, Glenn celebrated his 30th anniversary with Progressive, of which more than half of that he was our CEO and President. During his tenure as CEO, he tripled the company in size. So by most record books you would say that is phenomenal, and it is. But it's not just that. It's not just what Glenn did, it's how he did it: Always making sure to instill in us that desire to win, but doing it in the right way, always following our core values. He always would set the bar higher every year for all of us. And then he wouldn't walk away, he would help us get over, and that is really his legacy. So Glenn, on behalf of the 30,000 Progressive people, our shareholders and the customers we're privileged to serve, thank you for, well, being Progressive.
Okay, enough about Glenn. I thought what I'd do to start off is just remind you of our segments. So we outlined these several years ago when we first started talking about our Destination Era strategy. So I'll just briefly go over those. The focus today will be on the Robinsons, and we're really excited to talk to you about what we have done since we last met you in May of 2015.
So Sam. Sam is a segment we grew up with, and we call him inconsistently insured. He is who Progressive -- he put us on the map, and we call him nonstandard. He cares about rates, doesn't stay very long, but he could come back. We love Sam. We want to write all the Sams we can possibly write as long as it reaches our profitability goal.
Diane. Diane is a big part of the Destination Era. We've talked in the past about her being a future Robinson. Diane is an auto customer, and she rents. So she may have renters insurance with us, and what we hope is that as her needs evolve, when she buys a home, gets married, that we evolve with her. It's the notion of Diane graduating to be a Robinson. She's our largest customer base, so the opportunity there is immense.
The Wrights. The Wrights are unbundled auto and home. So they have Progressive home and someone else's auto. Again, we love the Wrights. We see them as future Robinsons because we hope that if they decide to shop their homeowners, they come with us and become a Robinson.
The Robinsons. That's really what today is all about and what the Destination Era is all about, the auto home bundle. The Robinsons are 40% of the market. So the opportunity here is really great, and we are really proud of how, the momentum we've had in the last 18 months in particular, in obtaining Robinsons.
Before we get started, what I thought I'd do as the new CEO is step back and just take stock of some objectives and some fundamentals that will stay the same during my tenure, but things that might evolve. And clearly, with Glenn's leadership, I was a part of the team that developed the strategy around the Destination Era. So to make a turn and do something differently wouldn't make sense. I believe in this model, the execution has been great and I'm excited about our future. But things do evolve as a team as we know more.
Let me start with our first and most important objective, profit. We want to make at least $0.04 of underwriting profit of every $1 of premium. 96 is central to our culture. You're actually sitting in an auditorium that is called Studio 96. So you know how integrated it is into everything we do. It continues to be our most important objective, and that won't change. There is, however, an added dimension with the auto home bundle. We're looking at how 2 independent margins can be optimized for that package. So while the 96 will stay the same, how it will be derived will absolutely evolve.
Growth. We want to grow as fast as we can with 2 constraints: one, the profit objective I just outlined; and two, our ability to service our customers. That second one is really important to us. So about 18 months ago, we had our 8.3 model on the streets, it was working, we were getting a lot more preferred customers. We also saw the opportunity, when some of our competition pulled back, to spend more on advertising, specifically, in the digital options. So we knew at that point we had a lot of opportunities to grow. We made a decision at that time to hire well in advance of need. So from the claims organization as well as our customer relationship management organizations, both on the auto side and the commercial side. And I'm so pleased that we did that, because we did get that growth. We got that preferred growth. And in addition, we had things that happened that we didn't necessarily plan for, in the form of catastrophes. So we've been able to service our customers, no matter if it was a CAT or a regular just increase in losses based on growth.
It is sort of a rule here at Progressive that whether you're on the claims side or the product side, if you think we're growing too fast, you absolutely have to raise your hand and say, ""No more growth. We can't do this."" And we've had to do that in the past. I'm so delighted to say that this year we didn't have to do that because we prepared and hired in advance of need. So when I think about growth and profit and that balance, year-to-date, with August being the most recent time frame, we're at a 96.2 
[Audio Gap] 
percent net written premium growth. If we ended the year today, this is a phenomenal year, especially with the business that we've been putting on the books. I'm extraordinarily happy. If we were at the same margin at 96.2 and had 4% growth with the same set of circumstances, I wouldn't be as happy. If we were at 88 with 0% growth, I wouldn't be happy. I'm very, very pleased with our growth. It really is sort of the perfect storm. So we had this new business, and we talked and talked at the conference calls about the sort of new business tax that you have, when our combined ratio is higher in that first term. And so we had that coming at us, and then we had CATs. This year, we have, on our CR, 3 points of our combined ratio are in the form of CATs, which is compared to this time last year, about 1.5%. In fact, last month, with the Louisiana storms, it was over 4 points of our CR. So you can't plan for CATs. Believe me, I'm watching Matthew closely, you can't plan for CATs. What you can plan for is how you react to those CATs. I am extraordinarily pleased with how we have reacted, specifically to the Louisiana 
[Audio Gap] 
So about 3 weeks ago, a group of us flew down and spent some time in Lafayette and Baton Rouge, Louisiana, to make sure our employees were okay, our customers were okay, and I was just amazed. I was amazed that our CAT team, who went down there and just made sure, they took it upon themselves to get our customers back on their feet. We literally had employees who were laying in bed, and they found out their home was flooded when they put their foot in water. Yet they came to work that day to help our customers. In fact, as of yesterday, we have closed 96% of those flood claims, which is really amazing because they're complex claims, mostly total losses. So again, I'm so amazed that what we were able to do and what we're able to do. And you know what, we are ready, with whatever happens with Matthew. As of today, we have a plan, and we'll figure it out. That's what we do.
So for me, again, just to wrap up in that part, profit and growth, very happy, very proud, especially with how we've been increasing our preferred business, the Robinsons, and we're going to talk a lot about that today.
I thought I'd take just a stab at some of the financial fundamentals. So it won't change. I think they work with our business plan. We want to continue to balance operating risk with the risk of investing in financing activities, in order to have sufficient capital to support our growth. So that's the overview. On the operating side, we want to maintain pricing and reserving discipline. So when we talk about our pricing, we talk about managing targets. We talk about targets at the lowest definition. So whether it's on the agency and direct side, product, state, we really segment our targets. And that's another reason why I'm so positive about this new business because we look at the new business coming in and say, ""Is it at or below targets? Great, that's going to run off profitably."" So we're excited about that.
We want to have premium to surplus at or below state minimum requirement. So on auto, that's a 3:1 and about half of that for home. And on the loss reserving side, we want to make sure our loss reserves are adequate and developed with the minimal variance. Year-to-date, very proud of that. We are pretty close, but a little bit on the favorable side, which is the side you want to be on. On investing side, we want to maintain a liquid, diversified and high-quality portfolio. We manage our investments on a total return basis, which is very consistent with how we report our comprehensive income. And on the risk side, we want to manage interest rate, credit, prepayment, concentration and extension risk. Lastly, on the financing side, we want to maintain sufficient capital to support the insurance operations. That's measured by maintaining a debt below 30% of total capital of book value. So we're just slightly over 28% right now, and that's after issuing $500 million worth of debt in August. We want to neutralize dilution from equity-based compensation in the year of issuance, and we do that by repurchasing shares. And finally, we will invest in capital in expanding the business when it meets our objectives. A perfect example of this is our acquisition of ARX. We didn't necessarily feel like we had to have a homeowners company. What we felt is we had to have access to that addressable market. That is a $300 billion market with auto and home. We needed to have access, and it just so happened that we had been working with a company that we had a high amount of respect for, that had a very similar culture and so was a perfect relationship to start. So we're very pleased with our use of capital in acquiring ARX. Any use of underleveraged capital, we will buy back shares or issue dividends, whether special or variable.
So let's get to the 96, since we are slightly over at this point, I want to walk you through kind of how we look at it. This is just a basic refresher. So everybody gets to a 96, all of our customers at some point get there, but sometimes in vastly different ways. On the direct side, you can see we run a much higher combined ratio in that first term. That's based on the fact that we have a little higher loss cost and some underwriting cost, but most of all, we front-load all of our acquisitions cost on the direct side in that first term.
On the agent side, we have a little bit more losses, a little bit more underwriting, but it's a relatively fixed commission expense, so much lower in the first term. So let me take you through on the direct side, 2 ends of the spectrum. You have Sam and the Robinsons. So you can see the same dynamic. They both rendered a loss in the first term. But what is not evident in our monthly reporting or even our quarterly reporting is the fact that this very high-retaining business, the Robinsons, who stay 3x, actually, more than 3x longer than the Sams, are expanding our invisible balance sheet. So bringing on more of those Robinsons really build the intrinsic value of Progressive.
Here's a basic income statement, and it's directionally accurate. So if we look at again, the Sam and Robinsons, you look at revenue. Clearly, the Robinsons are higher, based on the fact that they stay longer and they have higher average written premium. If you look at the operating expenses, which, of course, are losses, LAE and expense ratio, you quickly notice that neither of these equal a 96. Those numbers represent the nominal value of the cash flow, so they're under a 96. Our lifetime target, 96 combined ratio. For our direct business, we discount the cash flows to recover our acquisition expenses. So that will be different in different segments depending on how long they stay. The difference between those, of course, is our underwriting income. And then there's other income that we have, both on the investment side for both Sam and Robinsons, and the commissions side for just the Robinsons. So whether it's affiliated partner, like ASI, or other unaffiliated homeowners carriers, we get commissions when we have those bundles. So as you can see, the value of a Robinson, a pretax value, is over 4x that of a Sam. Again, we love Sams as long as we can make money on them, but the value of a Robinson is extraordinary, and the fact that we have grown Robinsons substantially in the last 18 months really does grow the value, the intrinsic value, of Progressive.
So for years, we have shared with you the invisible balance sheet. We talked last year about unearned lifetime earned premium. So when we think about business coming on board, we look at new apps, for example. So in this year, for Wrights and Robinsons, we've grown new apps 30% and 40%, respectively. That's pretty great. We look at average written premium. Our average written premium has come up across all segments. And then we look at PLE. This is kind of going to be a spoiler alert for Andrew's section, but we finally have made a breakthrough on retention and PLE. So to us, those 3 things are really exciting. So we thought we'd share with you one other metric that we look at internally, that we call ULUP, unearned lifetime underwriting profit. So you'll see that the colors represent a segment, so green for the Robinsons, pink for the Wrights, et cetera. On the Y axis, you see ULUP in millions, and on the X axis, you'll see the time frame with which we are looking out. So right when we started to grow, right around March of last year, to our most recent data point. As you can see, the majority of our segments are growing substantially in ULUP, which, again, is building that intrinsic value. In fact, the Robinsons are growing over 60%.
The chart underneath shows all of the segments' year-over-year growth in ULUP, and again, all are growing, but you can see the Robinsons are growing at a really quick clip. That's exciting for us.
I'm going to shift gears now and talk about how important understanding the Destination Era is to the 30,000 Progressive people that work on getting our customers in the door and making sure we nurture them along the way. We look at it in terms of different frameworks. This is a framework we use called our strategic pillars. So let me talk about the first one, our culture. Our culture is so important, and it's not something you can really adequately describe unless you've spent time at Progressive. It's not something you're going to see on a spreadsheet. But it is really special, and it's really different, and we know it's a competitive advantage. It's really at the root of what I started to talk about, and that is doing the right thing. And we want to win, but you always want to do the right thing, and it's really rooted in our core values. I have the privilege to speak at every new hire class, actually, it was that one Monday, with a couple hundred new claims reps, and my sole topic is our core values. I talk about 15 or 20 minutes, use some examples and then let them ask questions. It's so important to me for them on their first day or their first week or their second week to know what an important part that is of Progressive, our values.
Earlier this year, many of us went out to celebrate a milestone at Progressive, $20 billion in earned premium. And we got out face-to-face with over half of our employees, over 15,000 people, just to celebrate and say thank you for all that you do, and then of course talk about the next milestone and the next milestone, and it was really rewarding, and that again is a big part of our culture.
Our brand. We want to be the brand people want. So whether it's awareness or preference or consideration, those things are important, but what we really want is to be able to, when people buy an insurance product from Progressive, that they feel confident that they've made a right decision and continue to feel confident as we service them and add more and more policies. We want to spend money on consumer marketing and customer marketing. We've talked often about how we want to have our customer marketing be as savvy as our consumer marketing. Andrew Quigg is going to talk a little bit about that today, but we continue to resource that, as it is an important part of nurturing our customers.
Competitive prices. In a business with small margins, this is very important to us, and it's really all around segmentation. You're going to hear a lot about that today. So John Sauerland is going to talk about our continued evolution with UBI and our segmentation, and how important that variable is. Pat Callahan is going to talk about segmentation and the product models that we continue to elevate as well as our bundled competitiveness. Andrew Quigg will talk about segmentation on the customer part and using data to get out in front of our customers to know what they need, when they need them. So this is a really important part of our -- really central to things that we do, is segmentation. We'll continue to hone in on that.
Another part about competitive prices is really having a competitive loss structure. So on the claim side, we continue to have -- try to have that near-perfect balance of cost and quality, so pushing down LAE, while pushing up accuracy, and we're doing a fantastic job. On the expense side, we look at what we call non-acquisition expense ratio. So we continue to try to push that down, be more efficient and then give that pricing advantage to our customers in the form of competitive prices.
And the last pillar is meeting the broader needs of our customers: What products do they want, when do they want it, how do they want to shop. We want to make sure we can have personalized service and products for each of our customers. So if you want to buy through an agent, get service online or through a chat, we want to make sure if it fits your needs, we are there for you. We want to pick up the phone and say, ""Yes, we can do that, absolutely."" And whether or not we do that through our own products or on affiliated products, we want to make sure we meet the needs of our customers.
We use this framework for how we're going to grow the business: Acquire, anchor, bundle and extend. We see growth in 3 ways: one, selling products to new customers; two, selling additional products to our current customers as the need arises; and three, keeping our customers longer. Let me start with acquire. Acquire is that initial relationship with us. So whether you come in through a special lines product or an auto product, we're just getting to know you. And in fact, we are pivoting the company and trying to be less about policies and more about customers and households. We're currently in 1 in 10 households in the United States, and we would like to double that in short order. And so we're doing that through acquiring more and more customers and understanding their needs and then evolving as their needs evolve.
Anchor. Our anchor products are our auto and our home. If you trust us with those assets, we believe that our relationship is much deeper. I started today talking about the opportunity, the $300 billion, almost $300 billion opportunity in auto and home. Now that we have access to that and have more and more customers coming in either at home or auto, we know we can deepen that relationship. It's such an important piece of future Robinsons.
Bundle, that's what we're going to talk about today. Our bundle are our Robinsons, our auto and home together, and just even a little bit of increased market share on the bundle part really has a big impact to the bottom line.
Lastly, extend. We have been talking about retention for some time, and we have made a significant breakthrough. Last year, if you recall, I announced that I asked Andrew Quigg to lead a team of people to try to increase our retention by 50%. He's going to talk about that today, but we're extraordinarily happy with our results.
For me, extend isn't about talking any longer about customers who stay 1 month or even 1 year. It's about having customers for decades. In fact, 1 out of 6 of our customers after the first renewal are decade customers. So we're pretty pleased with that. About 1 month or so ago, some of us went out to observe some focus groups of our customers. So we listened to Dianes with renters, Dianes without renters to try to get some insight. We went out to Minneapolis and Dallas, and we listened to some decade customers. And they came because they love the brand and they love the price, so that made sense. They had stayed because over that decade or more that they'd been with us, they'd had some sort of service, whether they'd had a claim or they need to call in to change a vehicle or deductible, and they were extraordinarily happy with the service. But what we heard from both of the decade customer groups was something I think really insightful. People said, ""Why are you going to stay?"" ""Even if rates go up, will you stay?"" Yes, because I'm proud to be a Progressive customer."" And that really hit us. And we heard that over and over again, and so we're working on bottling that feeling and having it happen earlier in someone's tenure, have them feel that pride year 3, year 4, so we can continue to extend that and increase our decade customers. And in fact, we're looking at different metrics. At some point, we'll continue to have policy life expectancies, but why wouldn't we have customer life expectancies? So that's where we'll evolve as our customers evolve.
Ultimately, our goal, our vision, is to become consumers' #1 choice and destination for auto and other insurance. The next 4 speakers are going to talk about how we're going to do that on both the auto side, and John Barbagallo will talk about how he's going to do that on the commercial side.
So now I'd like to start and invite our Personal Lines President, Pat Callahan, up to talk about agency growth, our product and our bundled competitiveness."

So last year, when we talked, I laid out 3 key strategic priorities for our Personal Lines business. And those are: Restoring growth in agency, increasing our bundled penetration and ultimately, and then advancing our product development cycle. I want to give you updates on all 3. And what we'll do is start with an overview of the market from an overall channel and market size perspective.
As Tricia mentioned, U.S. personal auto and home is rapidly approaching a $300 billion market. And when you look at the independent agency share of that, it's a little more than 1/3, or about $100 billion of home and auto premium. And despite the fact that technology adoption has been rapidly increasing the growth rate for direct distribution of Personal Lines products, the independent agency channel continues to grow premium. And that's due in part to broad distribution of their footprint, but also a great value proposition from a breadth of products offered and depth of carrier choice available. When you look more specifically at the homeowners market in the U.S., it's about a $90 billion market, and that's about 90% sold through agents, more than 40% through independent agents. And as the #1 writer of auto insurance through the independent agency channel, we believe we're incredibly well-positioned to leverage our strength in the channel, combined with ASI's property offerings, to become the #1 writer of auto and home insurance through the agency channel.
Last year, I told you that restoring growth in agency was a top priority for myself and lots of other folks within our Personal Lines organization. So today, I'm thrilled to show you some information that after our business shrunk slightly into 2014 and barely recovered into 2015, we've turned that agency business around from a size perspective. And at this point, our agency auto business, as well as ASI's homeowner business through independent agents, have both never before been larger. And if we zoom in on what's driving that auto improvement, we look primarily to start with at new business apps. New business growth is the lifeline or lifeblood of a growing organization like Progressive. And as you see on the screen, midway through 2015, we turned new business positive on a year-over-year basis within the agency channel. Our new business growth continues to be up in the double digits on a year-over-year basis ever since.
New business growth originates from 2 primary metrics. The first is demand, so quoting. The second is conversion. And our improvements in the agency channel are driven just about by equal parts of both, which indicate to us: number one, we have a more competitive product in market; but number two, that more competitive product is inducing agents to come to us more frequently to meet the needs of their clients. An absolutely fantastic combination within the channel.
But to understand how competitive we are overall in the channel, the best benchmark that we can use is how well we're converting on comparative raters. So last year, I shared with you that the majority of our agency quotes start on a comparative rating platform. And just to level-set, comparative rating software, desktop applications in agent's offices, that run a real-time, risk-by-risk auction amongst all the carriers that participate within that agent's office. And you'll notice that similar to what we saw from a new apps perspective, we're seeing increasing new business from a conversion perspective on comparative raters. Turned positive around the same time that we saw new business apps turn overall, and continues to be up solidly in the double digits.
The exciting part about this for us, though, is competitive rates absolutely matter. But competitive rates are not sufficient to drive conversion in the agency channel. Because of the plethora of choices that agents have, you also have to have competitive service, competitive ease-of-use and ultimately, competitive compensation. So we believe comparative rater conversion is a fantastic benchmark for us to truly understand how competitive we are overall in the agency marketplace.
Last year at this time, I also shared that we had just introduced 8.3, our latest auto product model. And while the early results were encouraging, we were in a couple of states and we were seeing significant growth overall from the product model. At this point, about 18 months later, I'm thrilled to share that, that growth continues to come in at expected levels, but it's highly concentrated on the more preferred end of the spectrum. So our growth rates with Wrights and with Robinsons are significantly higher than they are in our other segments. These segments are absolutely foundational to how we win in the Destination Era, and our product design and product development is helping us get there.
But we all know that Progressive is known for new business acquisition. We do a great job. We probably do the best job in the industry. But the reality of it is, sustainable premium growth doesn't just come from acquiring new customers. We have to retain them. And I'm pleased to show that when we look at retention from the agency channel, we see after a dip in early 2015 through about the middle of the year, we've been increasing our agency policy life expectancy month-on-month ever since. And Andrew will talk a little bit more about more details around decomposing that, but the drivers of that are twofold: number one, it's mix, so our mix of new customers has improved. We refer to that as nature. But equal parts of improvement in our PLE are coming from experience improvements and relationships within our customer relationship management organization. Those investments are paying off, and Andrew will tell you a little bit more about that later.
What's particularly exciting to me though, when I look at our retention improvements, is to overlay our rate activity during the same period of time. So your orange bars are annualized rate change within the agency channel for each month during that same period. What you'll notice is during the period of time that our retention was improving, we were raising rates, somewhere between 2%, 2.5% to 4%. And we do that to keep up with trend and ensure we continue to deliver our target margins. But the combination of being able to improve retention while also increasing rates indicates to us 2 things: number one, market conditions are fantastic for growth in the agency channel and we are really, really well-positioned; but number two, given the plethora of choices that agents have to move business to, when rates go up, the fact that our rate increases are sticking indicates to us we've got stronger relationships that are forming in the agency channel, and that's a critical element of our long-term destination success.
Insurance is a trust-based business. And trust is a really difficult thing for us to measure, unlike many of our other metrics. But we look at actions as opposed to words to understand how we're performing from a trust perspective. Number one, are agents trusting us by placing their better customers with us? The answer is yes. Number two, are they trusting us to interact with those customers on a regular basis? The answer is yes. More agents are opting in to our joint marketing programs for additional protection, quote resolicitation, et cetera. And number three, in a recent survey of thousands of independent agents, they responded that increasingly, Progressive has all the products to meet the needs of their preferred customers and more of those agents responded that they're placing their preferred customers with us. The turnaround in the agency channel was driven by a combination of product and stronger relationship building. And we fully expect that the momentum we've established to date with this turnaround will carry into our second priority, which is bundled penetration.
Growing bundled penetration is the key performance indicator of our Destination Era. Making progress, selling both home and auto to our combined customers is essential to our long-term success. And the things you need to drive bundled penetration are: number one, available and competitive property insurance; number two, available and competitive preferred auto rates; and number three, the systems, tools and experiences that enable customers and agents to find, quote, buy and ultimately own a Progressive policy or a Progressive bundle. We'll stay with the agency channel for now and talk about where we're headed from a bundled penetration perspective.
Last year, I shared that we were in the process of deploying ASI's property product country-wide. Since we last talked, we've added 9 states, and by the end of this year, we'll be in 39 states, representing about 95% of U.S. homeowners, great coverage for where we are in the rollout. We go to market from an agency perspective with our property product through 2 tiers of agencies. Those 2 tiers of agencies are Progressive Advantage agencies, Progressive Home Advantage agencies and our Platinum agencies. The 2 tiers, Progressive Home Advantage a little more broadly distributed, they are our original property agencies. And Platinum is a much higher tier, more highly selective tier of agents and a much stronger partnership with us. I shared with you last year that Platinum is a brand-new program that we're introducing last summer that combined consumer benefits of annual policies, more competitive rates through multi-policy discounts and agent benefits, such as easier-to-use systems and higher compensation. We continue to deploy the Platinum program as well. Platinum, by the end of this year, will be in 34 states, which represent about 80% of U.S. homeowners. And because preferred auto and property availability are prereqs to the Platinum rollout, Platinum will always trail the rollout of our property product. But overall, we intend to continue pushing on a country-wide basis until we have full deployment of preferred auto, available property and Platinum on a national basis.
But with Platinum, it's less about the states that we're in and much more about the agencies that we're in within those states. So over the last year, we've identified, selected and ultimately, onboarded more than 1,000 agencies into our Platinum program. Based on those agencies, access to preferred customers, their bundled quote and sale processes within the agency and their willingness to commit to placing a significant portion of their bundled volume with Progressive. But to be clear, Platinum rollout will be a metered rollout. Platinum has a scarcity and a scarcely distributed offering. So agents will be actively managed by our sales reps to ensure they're using the Platinum program and understand it and are using it for bundled business within their agency. So we will continue to grow Platinum, but we will grow Platinum as agents are using it effectively in market.
I also shared last year that because ease-of-use for bundled quoting is a key element of our Platinum offering, we were starting to build a new Platinum quoting program. And earlier this year, we launched Platinum quoting which brings to the agent's desktop for the first time, bundled quoting of Progressive's auto and ASI's home, which enables the agent to ultimately save time, share data entry screens and external data fill and have more competitive messaging around the bundled economics available to the agent and making it easier for them to message those bundled savings to the customer. Now to be clear, this is a pilot. It's in 3 states today. We've learned a bunch to date, we'll continue to learn from the pilot, and ultimately, we'll build those enhancements into our quoting systems over time.
But the billion-dollar question on all of our minds, and likely all of your minds is, is Platinum working? We've attacked the preferred market in agency a few times before, and we've learned from those attacks. We've learned from those opportunities that ultimately, for us to introduce a brand-new preferred offering into some of the best agencies in an incredibly competitive independent agency channel, we would have to change agent behavior, which we all know isn't simple, and frankly, it sometimes takes time. So to understand whether Platinum is working, we look at the 2015 cohort of Platinum agents, those that were appointed as Platinum agents during 2015. Think of it as the Class of 2015, if you will. And we look at 2 key performance metrics for that group of agencies relative to the rest of our property insurance agencies. What you'll see on your screen is 2 lines, the blue line is our Platinum agencies, the orange line is our PHA agencies. And the metric here is preferred auto production. What you'll notice between those lines is, number one, the blue line starts above the orange line. Not surprisingly, more productive agencies were selected to be Platinum in the first place. But you'll notice that after the vertical red line, there's an increasing separation from a production perspective between our Platinum agencies and our non-Platinum other property agencies.
This continues into our second key performance metric, and that's new business home and auto bundles, where you'll see exactly the same pattern. Blue, Platinum agents, started above our PHA agencies, and the gap continues to widen. As our sales reps message the benefits of Platinum, our agents better understand the benefits of Platinum and for their customers, they start to experience some of the benefits that come from buying through a Platinum agency. The gap between that blue and orange line is what we refer to as the Platinum difference. And that Platinum difference is not just present with the agents we appointed during 2015. If you look at the entire network of more than 1,000 Platinum agencies compared to our non-Platinum property agencies, you'll see that our Platinum agency plant is responsible for creating more than 3x the number of bundles per agent, per week than our non-Platinum agencies, which absolutely tells us that Platinum is working.
What you'll also notice on this graph, though, is the trend is upward, meaning we're improving over time. Numbers bounce around from month-to-month, but we are on an upward trend. And the guideline on the screen indicates where we expect the program to be ultimately from a success perspective. You'll notice we're not there. And that gap exists, but we know what we're going to do to close that gap. The primary driver of it is our bundled competitiveness.
Well, not surprisingly, when we were launching our program, we started collecting data from the market as to where we were competitive and were not competitive. And the great thing is with 1,000 agencies, using their quoting systems to quote ASI property and Progressive auto, we are getting a ton of data on where we are and where we are not competitive. We use conversion as our primary metric, and when you look at states that represent about 1/3 of our premium, we are highly competitive on the monoline auto, the monoline home and on the bundle for an individual risk. In those agencies, our focus is to sell what the customer is looking for. If they're looking for home, sell them home; if they're looking for auto, sell them auto, or try to sell them the bundle, because we are highly competitive.
However, in about 2/3 of the country right now, we are highly competitive on monoline home or monoline auto, but not yet as competitive on the bundle for individual risks. This shouldn't come as much surprise given we had a highly successful monoline auto business that we combined with a highly successful monoline home business. And the overlap between the 2 isn't quite where we need it to be. But the bottom line is we know exactly what needs to be done, and we're collecting a ton of data that enables us to map out how to integrate our products more closely to make sure that we're more competitive at the individual risk on a country-wide basis.
So for us, the momentum that we saw as we were bringing our agency turnaround ultimately into bundled competitiveness, combined with the infrastructure investments we continue to make in the agency channel and early success of what we're seeing from a Platinum perspective, gives us a ton of confidence that we are absolutely on the right track from a bundled penetration perspective and very, very well-positioned to attack that $100 billion independent agency home and auto opportunity.
With that said, we have another highly successful auto distribution channel and that's direct. So I want to update you on where we are from a bundled competitiveness perspective within the direct channel. To be a direct customer's destination for auto and other insurance, we not only have to have all the products they need throughout their lifetime, but they have to be aware of them and understand that we have them available before they have a life event that triggers demand for that product. So they come to us first as opposed to shopping in market. We generate awareness for our products with our direct customers 3 primary ways: Mass media advertising, it reaches not only our current customers but also reaches future customers; point-of-sale messaging, and this is both in our sale systems as well as our servicing systems, so both current customers and potential customers who visit to get a quote understand the breadth of products available and the economic benefits of buying through us; and finally, targeted marketing. We have a ton of monoline customers that we are now offering the bundled package and the complementary product through messaging the savings and ease-of-use benefits of bringing more of those products to Progressive over time.
These awareness investments, coupled with a general shift in consumer buying trends towards direct and some internal messaging that gets our employees thinking holistically about protecting our customers' household needs, continues to drive up demand for direct property insurance, both online, on the phones, with current customers and with future customers. But great demand and increase in demand for our direct property products creates no value unless we can meet that demand with adequate supply. And frankly, in early 2015, our ability to meet the demand for direct property was less than we wanted it to be.
Only about 4 in 5 customers coming to us for direct property could even get a quote. Part of that is just endemic with the property insurance business. Unlike Progressive, there's virtually no property writers who have similar broad acceptability. Property writers have a relatively niche focus and some may not accept 20%, 30%, 40% of available risks.
That's an unacceptable outcome for our direct customers. So what we've done over time is worked, number one, with our carrier partners to expand acceptability and improve routing of traffic online and through our partner call centers to improve availability of direct quoting. But what's particularly exciting on this chart is the yellow line. The yellow line represents our Progressive Advantage Agency, which is our in-house agency that sells multiple products from a property perspective across multiple property partners.
Over the last 1.5 years, we've made significant investments to expand the footprint of that agency by adding 14 states and adding more than 100 state and carrier combinations in order to drive up availability of this, of our property products. At this point, we can meet the needs of about 95% of current or future customers who contact our agency. And we believe that agency model is a superior shopping experience for anyone shopping direct-to-consumer property insurance, because it combines the technology enabled ease-of-use of a direct writer with the breadth and depth of an independent agency. We believe strongly in that model and we continue to invest to expand capabilities within our Progressive Advantage Agency.
In the last 18 months, we more than doubled staffing and when calls come in, we route an increased percentage of those to the agency, to the point that at this point, we've more than tripled the sales over the last 18 months through the agency. We will continue to invest in that space and continue to use this superior business model to delight our direct customers from a bundled penetration perspective. But for us, bundling is not just about home and auto. It's also about home -- renters and auto. So in our world, we enjoy an advantaged position with younger, simpler needs, auto insurance customers, many of whom don't yet own a home. So having renters insurance available for those customers enables us, number one, to establish a property insurance relationship with customers and to be able to meet a broader need of those customers earlier in their insurance shopping journey. Renters insurance will never be a massive business for us. It's only about a $4 billion market. But for us, it is a strategic investment, because renters insurance is absolutely a gateway property product towards becoming a bundled home and auto customer with us. We have evidence that those who bundle renters and auto with us are significantly more likely to keep their auto with us and convert that renters to a homeowners policy if and when they eventually buy a home. So from a graduating Diane perspective, this is a strategic play for us and one we continue to invest in over time.
We are absolutely thrilled with the acceleration of our penetration from a bundling perspective within our direct book of business. Today, more than 1 million direct customers trust us to provide property protection. And the key performance metrics for our direct property business, increasing quote starts, bundled new apps and bundled PIFs, are all up more than 20% on a year-over-year basis. And with the investments we continue to make to drive demand and then meet that demand with ample supply and great experiences, we have every confidence we will continue to accelerate bundled penetration within the direct book of business.
The third priority that I shared with you last year was to continue to advance our science of risk segmentation. Customer segmentation, matching rate to risk and pricing accuracy are in our DNA and absolutely a key source of competitive advantage for Progressive. It's been that way for decades and one of the things that truly differentiates and distinguishes our offering. As we look to invest in rate accuracy and pricing segmentation, we recognize that the value it creates, through more competitive new business pricing, which lowers our customer acquisition costs on a fixed advertising base, it increases our retention even if customers shop, they can't replace similar coverage at a similar or lower price and it creates adverse selection within the marketplace, a fantastic trifecta of opportunity for Progressive. So when we think about the product development space, we focus on 3 areas, the first is rate accuracy, the second is coverages and the third is improving customer experience to drive policy life expectancy. We build bundles of these enhancements in the product model and deploy them like building blocks, stacked on top of all of the segmentation that existed in the prior model.
Our pipeline from a road map perspective is absolutely robust from a product development standpoint. We're currently on 8.3 in the majority of our states. 8.3 was designed to be more competitive on preferred households and multiproduct customers. You've already heard how that's performing in market. We are thrilled with how it's working.
84 is deploying currently. Tomorrow morning, it'll be our seventh state elevating for 84 and 84 brings with it more stable rates for our renewal customers as well as advanced segmentation based on billing, claims experience and vehicle history. 845 is 84 with some additional protection for transportation network company drivers, Progressive customers who happen to work for an Uber or Lyft. And finally, 85, which is under development right now and will launch in early 2018, will bring with it much more competitive rates for households with usefuls as well as -- well, I'm not going to tell you what else is in 85, you're going to have to come back next year to learn more about that. But rest assured, we are not taking our foot off the accelerator from the product development perspective and intend to continue to lead from the segmentation perspective. But the best segmentation in the world creates no value if we can't get it to market quickly. And while we've always been known for our nimbleness and ability to deploy our products to market quickly, we recognize from a core value perspective that excellence is doing things better today than we did yesterday and we continue to invest to advance our speed to market. So in the last 24 months, there's been a joint research and development and IT team, reengineering our process of product development and product deployment. And since we last talked in May, they've been able to double the annualized rate with which we can deploy our product innovation into the marketplace. So what that means is when we talked in May, we had 3 states on 8.3. Today, we have 32 states. As of tomorrow, we'll have 7 states on 84. When we talk next year, we'll have 38 states on 84 and 85 will be spun up just about to hit the market. This lethal combination of product innovation and speed to market enables us to widen our lead over the competition. And when we look to assess how well we're doing relative to the competition, we start by looking at some industry data. The industry data you're seeing on the screen is loss in LAE for PCI, essentially about 2/3 of the market, 9 of the Top 10 carriers in the orange line, and then Progressive in the blue line. What you'll notice is that environmental activities, be it economic recovery, gas prices, severity on low price in the cars due to safety equipment, trend in the industry has been climbing since the middle of 2012. But you'll also notice that the blue line, the progressive loss in LAE, we've been competing in that exact same environment, and the reality of it is our results have been rock solid. The difference between these 2 lines is product segmentation. It's our ability to better understand what risks we're insuring and better sort out which ones are high cost from low cost. What that means in the marketplace is those in the orange line, the rest of the market, as their loss costs are climbing and they don't know which risks are driving those loss costs up, they raise base rates. And when they raise base rates, the best customers in their book of business shop and they can often find a lower price with companies like us that are better segmented. Run this cycle over and over enough times and they're left with residual risks that they're still underpriced on and priced dramatically higher than the market on any of the better risks that we insure. What it also means, though, for us is today, we enjoy about a 10-point gap in loss in LAE relative to the market and when you combine that with our technology-enabled expense gap, specifically in the agency channel, what it enables us to do is combine incredibly competitive pricing in market, which drives the growth of the business, with wider underwriting profit margins than the overall industry, delivering on our profit targets. A great combination for an insurance business.
Now I also told you last year that emerging data sources were an opportunity as opposed to a threat for Progressive. And since making our majority investments in ASI or ARX, we've been building a massive data set of home and auto risk characteristics and home and auto loss characteristics. What this has enabled us to do is improve model accuracy, identify new segmentation and reduce our rating costs. An early example of how we're leveraging this data set was an auto rating variable that was highly predictive of home loss frequency, to the tune of about a 30% difference in pure premium. As we identified that, ASI quickly jumped on it and deployed it to market. So it's providing a segmentation list as a bundled household that they wouldn't normally have had absent the joining of this data. And to be frank, we are just getting started digging into this massive data set and fully expect that the joint R&D team between ASI and Progressive will leverage this treasure trove of information to identify new ways to assess and ultimately price and improve rate accuracy for our household bundled pricing.
So last year, I shared with you some fairly aggressive goals for our overall business. With the turnaround in our agency business as well as great performance from our direct business, coupled with the investments we're making to increase bundled penetration across both our direct and our agency business, our robust product development pipeline of future segmentation enhancements and the faster speed to market on top of already leading the industry, I am absolutely confident that we are incredibly well-positioned to become consumers' #1 choice and destination for auto and other insurance.
With that, I'll bring John Sauerland on to talk about Snapshot and data management."

It's been a while since we gave you a deep dive on Snapshot, our usage-based rating program. We have a new model in the marketplace, I'll share results around that, but also share more holistically why Snapshot is so powerful for Progressive.
Later this year, we will roll out a new delivery mechanism to experience for Snapshot and that is via mobile. I'll share the rollout plans there, we're very excited by that, but I'll also share what our expected benefits from that rollout are. But overarching all of this is something that I think is even more powerful than Snapshot, sort of an ancillary benefit from Snapshot, if you will, and that is the big data management and analysis capabilities that we've developed around Snapshot that are now paying dividends across the organization and I believe can be a source of competitive advantage going forward.
If you're familiar with Progressive, you know that we have a history of innovation. I would say that Snapshot is as a result of that history of innovation. We started out many years ago installing this football-size device in the trunks of some cars in Texas, proved out the concept a little bit. We enjoyed the benefits of Moore's law, shrinking of technology. I mean, we're able to get the technology into a device that could plug into an OBD port on a vehicle. Unfortunately, back then, connectivity was an issue. We mailed this device to our customers, along with a cord that we asked them to go find. Six months after plugging the device in their car, plug that cord in the device, into their desktop, more than likely back then, by the way, and more than likely try and upload via their dial-up modem. Obviously, not a big hit. What was a big hit was when we were able to get the technology and especially the cell chip small enough and the cell transmission costs low enough so that we had virtually real-time transmission of the data. In today's world, we sort of call that the Internet of Things. Back then, it was just via cell towers.
Soon, we're going to be moving to mobile. I will talk more about that in a bit, so I won't spend time here now. The ultimate model for Snapshot is not via device, not via your phone, it's directly from the vehicle. Really happy to say we're actually in market today with that model with General Motors. General Motors is the only car manufacturer, to my knowledge, with that capability today. As you all know, technology takes a long time to move into the fleet. This won't be a broad-based model soon. But nevertheless, we're excited to be in partnership with GM, in market, and I'll share a bit more about that in a moment.
If Moore's law allows you to shrink technology, I believe, there's got to be a corollary to Moore's law that says that data coming out of that technology doubles every 2 years or even every 1 year. We now have 2.2 trillion records in our database from Snapshot, 2.2 trillion records. If you think about those records as rows on a spreadsheet, those rows are widening. The blue area on the chart here is GPS data. While we don't today rate on GPS, we are collecting it for research purposes and it widens the data field, if you will. When we introduce mobile, we'll be collecting even more information. Mobile will take that width of that record 20-fold from where it is today. The data explosion here is incredible. It's been a challenge, it's also a huge opportunity. We'll talk more about that in a moment.
But let me take a step back first and make sure I have everyone grounded in Snapshot. We have 2 models in the marketplace today. We're not great with naming, it was the 2.0 model and the 3.0 model. The 3.0 model has rolled out with 8.3. So in the majority of the country today, as Pat Callahan just mentioned to you, in the 2.0 model, we didn't give you a discount when you opted into Snapshot. You came to Progressive or an agent, agreed to the Snapshot program, 30 days later, we give you a discount based on your 30 days of driving behavior. Drive for 5 months more, we lock you in for the rest of your tenure with Progressive. 3.0, we offer a participation discount. It varies by customer segment, we'll talk about that in a moment, then you drive for 6 months. Here again, we lock you in to your discount or a surcharge. So that's a big change with the 3.0 model. With 2.0, we're very concerned about establishing consumer acceptance for the concept because we have been the leader in UBI. We've gotten consumer acceptance, we're in a place now where consumers are willing to opt-in to the program, as you'll see, even if there's a chance for a surcharge. So in the 2.0 model, we had up to a 30% discount, 0% surcharge. In the 3.0 model, we have up to a 20% discount and up to a 10% surcharge. So similar range, very different model. In 2.0, about 60% of our customers who partook, got a discount. In 3.0, about 75% of our customers get a discount and in 3.0, more than half of our customers received more than a 10% discount, which is pretty material in the auto insurance space. So giving you perspective on the different models, keep that in mind as we talk about results. And I'll also give you a little bit more perspective on the distribution of our customers' driving behavior. The results. They're good. New apps are up, I can't attribute all of this to Snapshot, however. As I mentioned, the 3.0 model rolled out at the same time as 8.3, we made a lot of changes here, we can't tease it out completely. But new apps are up, and this is just Snapshot apps on the graph in front of you. One of the things I hope you will notice is that agency apps are up more. We've been challenged around agency adoption of Snapshot for many years now, frankly. The inclusion of an upfront discount, a participation discount, helps us a lot in the agency channel. As Pat told you, it's largely driven by comparative raters, somewhat of an auction environment, the more we can get a more competitive rate up there at new business, the better chance we have of getting customers into Snapshot.
I mentioned those discounts, the participation discounts vary by customer set. Ranges from about 2 percentage for Sams, up to about 6-ish percent for Robinsons. We define that participation discount not based solely on the customer marketing target there, but that's the average of the discount for each respective segment. Not surprisingly, conversion is up more on the preferred end of the spectrum. Even with 2.0, Snapshot customers converted at a higher rate than non-Snapshot customers. So being interested in Snapshot improves your conversion rate, all else equal. And in 3.0, we obviously see that continuing, but we also see a greater disparity, not surprisingly, on the more preferred end of the spectrum, where the participation discounts are higher. 
When we look at new apps by customer segment, here again, the mix skews a bit towards the preferred end. But what I hope you also notice is that the slope, if you will, of that relationship in the agency business is higher, it's steeper. We're getting more Robinsons into this business, into the Snapshot program. Pat and Tricia told you, the Robinson segment is the largest segment available to us in the Personal Lines space and it's our lowest market share. So to the extent we can get more customers in here, that's fantastic.
Something not necessarily specific to 3.0, but I think representative of where we're at today when it comes to usage-based rating, is the fact that it is broadly acceptable. And I'm just sharing you one example here and this is age. So when you look by customer segment, the percentage of folks 18- to 22-year-old who opt-in to Snapshot is about the same as the percentage of folks who are 55 and above. Not 100% acceptable in the marketplace for sure, but broadly acceptable.
So hopefully, I've convinced you that Snapshot is helping us on preferred, it's helping us grow. I often get the question, and even got it in the lobby before this, is that can you tell me how is it helping? Put numbers to that for me. Some facts. The most powerful rating variable we have ever seen and with 3.0, even more powerful than 2.0. So our analysts are working hard on improving those algorithms. 3.0 even more predictive of losses than 2.0, and 2.0 was way more predictive than any other rating variable we've seen. Another fact. We provided more than a $0.5 billion of discounts to customers with Snapshot inception to-date. More than $0.5 billion worth of discounts. Those folks think, well, that seems to be a benefit for a customer, how is that a benefit for Progressive? To help answer that, I'm going to take you back to a chart that we showed you actually in 2012. This chart shows the loss ratio and the retention rate across discount buckets, if you will, for Snapshot customers. So we have 0% to 30% discount along the horizontal there, and to the left of that 0, we have non-Snapshot customers. So think of those as your base case. So the majority of our customers don't opt-in to Snapshot, so that's a robust base case. And what do we see? This is again 2.0. When a customer got a 0% discount from us, they will actually do a surcharge. But again, we didn't do that for consumer acceptance reasons. The highest loss ratio is for customers with 0 discount. As you see, the loss ratio improves markedly as you go to the right. It's important to look at the scale on this graph. That loss ratio is much better for the best drivers who are receiving the biggest discounts.
When you look at the retention line, the consumers who expected to receive a discount and did not, the 0 percentage, lowest retention. Those customers leave way more frequently and when they leave, where do they go? They go to our competitors. By and large, our competitors are not priced for this. So those customers are going for more than likely a lower rate than we're offering them, so we believe they materially miss price at the competitor.
You go out on the right, not surprisingly, retention improves a lot as you give people bigger discounts, but the big 2 points I want you to take away here is the least profitable customers, and frequently, the unprofitable customers, leave most frequently. The most profitable customers are way more inclined to stay.
In auto insurance, I would tell you, in any business model, if you have a program where your best, most profitable customers are most inclined to stay, and your least profitable or even unprofitable customers find their way to your competitor, that's a great program. Pat Callahan showed you the industry loss ratio graph, Progressive was here, right, the industry on a pretty decent slope up. This isn't the only reason, but this is the kind of segmentation that we believe drives that disparity in the marketplace. So let's look at 3.0. Here, you can see we are not surcharging those customers who are on the worse end. So our loss ratio for those customers goes down. Customers out on the -- more -- better driver end of the spectrum, higher discounts. Again, better loss ratio, not quite as low as with 2.0, but still exceptional. You look at that scale. And when you look at retention, because we're surcharging customers, they leave even more frequently than they did in the previous model, and not surprisingly, consumers we're offering the discount to continue to stay at a much higher rate. So Snapshot is getting us more preferred customers. It is helping rating segmentation, adverse selection a lot. Hope you got those points.
Our next step for Snapshot is mobile. We've been very deliberate in coming to market with mobile. If you think about the challenges in measuring driving behavior with a phone, there are obviously many, right? Some of you take the train, some of you take the bus, you commute with a friend, you leave your phone at home, what have you, a lot of challenges and we wanted to make sure we got this right. We've done a ton of testing. And just to give you an appreciation of those challenges, what you're looking at here is an example of a real test case, so an individual with the app and the device in the car. This is about 2 months of driving, each row represents a day, 24 hours across the horizontal axis of a day, not surprising, and what do we see? So if the blocks are purple, that means the device and your phone are showing a trip, they're matching up. If the block is blue, that means the device is just showing a trip, not the phone. Red the opposite. Red is the phone showing the trip, not the device. So if you stare at this, you say, okay, it looks like we have a commute pattern, right? Five days a week, we drive to work and we drive home. And we take our phones to work and they're on. We don't see that on a commute, right? What else do you see? Well, there's some blue sections, those blue sections look to me like they're more on the weekend, maybe a spouse is driving the car, maybe a kid is driving the car. The red dots in the middle are very intriguing to me. My conclusion, I don't know this test case, is that this person has a regular scheduled Monday lunch date and the buddy drives, to lunch then back, interesting things. But the point is how do we account for this and still have really accurate driving data to rate on. We worked with a ton of app developers, the technology is amazing. The app is able to learn the driver's fingerprint, if you will. And it learns it pretty quickly, I have an app, and I can tell when my child is driving the car, when my spouse is driving the car, it excludes those trips. Thankfully, for my own personal rate. You get the point. How about this, we can look after a trip starts, back to see if the driver got in the left side of the car or the right side of the car. Technology in phones is amazing now. We worked really hard to make sure this is right. Let me give you a picture of the rating reason behind why we've worked so hard to make sure this is right. We worked with a number of different companies developing apps. Hard brakes are our most important rating data field for UBI. So you want your phone to reflect a brake about the same time as you want your device to reflect a brake, right?
The graph on the right shows pretty tight relationship, graph on the left not so much. I'm really happy to tell you that we chose the app on the right. And I'm almost as happy to tell you that we're pretty confident a competitor was using the app on the left. Really important that we got it right. We think we have it right, we'll have 2 states out before the end of the year. We expect to have the rest of the country rolled out in the first half of next year. We think it's a great rating tool. We also know it's going to be a better consumer experience. Today, we mail a lot of devices to customers, not all of them come back, but the customer has to take it, unbox it, put it in their car, extract it from the vehicle, mail it back to us. It's a logistical challenge and it's costly. We've previously told you the technology expenses with our current model is about a point on the P&L. Mobile will completely eliminate technology expenses for sure, but it will materially reduce those costs. As I mentioned to you, the long-term model, we believe, is data right from the vehicle. Again, this won't be a broad-based model anytime soon because of the pace of technology penetrating the fleet. But it's a fantastic model, it's working really well, it's small so far, admittedly. General Motors customers' model year 2015 and greater have this capability, all voluntary. They can opt-in to sharing 90 days of driving behavior with Progressive. If it looks like we'll give that customer a discount, we'll offer them a quote. If it looks like they wouldn't be due a discount, we won't offer them a quote. Think back on that loss ratio curve. The customers we are selling to here have a very high average discount. What was true about the most -- the highest average discount customers in our programs, they're the most profitable, right? So we've got a model here where we can just sell to the most profitable drivers with our current algorithms. It will evolve, we'll probably tailor to the various methods of measurement, but today, it's a great model, we're really excited to be in market with General Motors and we're excited to talk to you more about that in the future.
I told you that the data explosion has been rapid. I told you that it's been a challenge for us, frankly. This graph shifts to terabytes as opposed to trillions of records. Back in 2013, our analysts were struggling because it was taking them almost a month to process the Snapshot data set, almost a month. We literally had analysts trying to create mini server farms in the closets near their workspaces. We got smart, we brought in the right technology, we developed the talent internally, our processing time dropped dramatically, going up a little bit as the data set grows further, but the better news here is that we are now using this technology across other parts of the company. When we were together last year, Pat Callahan told you we were starting to look at claims fraud using big data techniques. We now have that fully rolled out. Every night, we are looking at hundreds of data elements through our claims file, through our policy files and looking for the potential for fraud. We don't identify fraud with this model, we refer it to an individual who does the further investigation and does the right thing handling the claim. We're using traditional data, but we're also using what's called unstructured data, which in this case means text. So claims adjusters are typing in notes into our systems, this mines the text and joins that with other data to look for potential fraud. What you're looking at on the screen here is a network of claims that we had previously identified as fraudulent, run it through the system overnight, the claim in blue pops out, suspect claim. Our adjuster does more investigation: 3 vehicle accident, 6 injuries claimed in this accident. Further investigation revealed the damage on the vehicles did not match the facts as reported by the injured parties, we are able to deny the claim. Previously, our model here has been if it looks suspect, the adjuster refers to an expert. I can't tell you we would have missed this one, but I can tell you, I bet we would have missed this one. And I can tell you, we're looking at a lot more claims much more with a zero in target [ph] sort of approach today than we previously did.
One more example in that arena. We previously had identified a suspect claim, run through the system overnight and we find 1 data element common with 166 other policies in our database. What we had identified here upon further investigation is what we call a street broker. In urban areas, where auto insurance is very expensive, there are enterprising individuals who use our systems to take your information and create an ID card and sell you that ID card for a couple of hundred bucks cash. They generally are using a stolen credit card or another means to buy the policy or immediately cancel the policy. So what we had here was 166 people who were probably not in the right state with their auto insurance, we were able to reach out to those customers and do the right thing and get them into the right place.
Another quick example, you probably know that big data has been in play in the e-marketing, online marketing space for a long time and we've actually enjoyed the benefits of vendor or third-party solutions, optimizing advertising networks online with banner ads, that kind of thing. We are now using this processing power to design the experience. In our direct business, we pay a lot to get a prospect in the door. We do a lot to make sure we streamline that funnel, if you will, get them the quote, get them into the buy process. Historically, we've done really well with that, but we've done it somewhat painstakingly, frankly, because we do A/B tests. We want -- try the orange button versus the blue button, the button over here versus the button over here. But we've done it really, really well. And historically, we did something in this case that we call the coverage packaging tool. We used 7 variables to optimize the experience with the customer and we were able to improve the funnel, the yield, by about 4%. And if 4% doesn't feel like a lot to you, we have a lot of direct prospects. That's about $0.5 billion of lifetime premium. Today, we're using what we call real-time decisioning. We're looking at more than 3x as many variables as we used to. We've been able to improve the yield another 4% and growing and we've been able to do it in about 1/5 of the time.
Tons of opportunities, I could go on with examples. I hope you get the picture. The data space is booming. Even with Snapshot, due to GPS, due to mobile, this curve is going to get steeper. Layer on top of that, that unstructured data we just talked about, the text. In our call centers, we've been translating voice to text for many years now. We're able to mine that as well. Andrew Quigg will talk about that in a moment. We're now starting to ingest images, photos and video. That will soon be, not today yet for us, that will soon be data we mesh with all the other data in our systems as well. We have been a leader in using data and analysis for segmentation, for experience design, to our competitive advantage. I believe the opportunity to do that and differentiate ourselves versus the competition is only going to grow and we expect to lead.
Now I'm going to hand the floor over to Andrew Quigg to talk customer relationship management. And here again, I think you will see similar themes through Andrew's talk."
33352,328425460,1054129,"Progressive Corp., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 06, 2016",2016-10-06,"Earnings Calls","The Progressive Corporation","Executives","Thank you, John. I have the pleasure of speaking to you today on 2 topics. The first half of the section will be on retention, and I'm going to tell you about the improving momentum we see with our retention. And then in the second half of the section, I'",4180,"Thank you, John. I have the pleasure of speaking to you today on 2 topics. The first half of the section will be on retention, and I'm going to tell you about the improving momentum we see with our retention. And then in the second half of the section, I'll provide an overview of our customer marketing initiative and I'll describe the advanced analytics we're applying to this problem, as John Sauerland alluded to.
So first off, I want to just reiterate our preferred retention measure, which is Policy Life Expectancy or PLE. PLE is the average length of time we expect a new policy to stay with Progressive. We calculate PLE by first calculating our retention decay curve, and then we take the area under this curve to get our PLE statistic. That retention decay curve can be calculated multiple ways depending on the trade-off in responsiveness versus stability that we see. Our standard measure is to use 12 months for each point along that curve. That is our trailing 12 PLE that we've always reported out. We also calculate a trailing 3 PLE starting in 2014. That trailing 3 PLE uses 3, the most recent 3 months along that retention decay curve. So it's more responsive to more recent observations. Just some notes on the PLE calculation. The first 60 months represent actual data that we've recently observed and between months 60 and 300, we use an extrapolation. And we've seen all policies end after 300 months, which is a conservative assumption. We think the PLE statistic is accurate for a number of reasons and I'll highlight one of those today. We think it removes any tenure bias. So if we use simple retention rates, as our book of business ages, all else being equal, we think we'd see higher retention rates and that would be although that retention curve didn't shift. So using the PLE calculation removes any tenure bias from our statistics.
So with that background, I wanted to give you an update on the current progress with trailing 12 PLE. I'm happy to report that we've seen very positive PLE growth in 2016. We are up 6% year-over-year. 6% year-over-year, there we go. This is the largest increase since 2009 and as Tricia said on our last quarterly conference call, for every one month of PLE, we see $1.5 billion in additional lifetime earned premium for the company. We're also pleased that we're seeing similar percentage increases within our agency channel and in our direct channel and direct is at an all-time high. While we're really pleased with the overall momentum we see, we're even more pleased with what we see with our Robinsons in the Destination Era. For our Robinsons, PLE is up 17% over the past 3 years. And the past 12 months, we're up 9%. So just great momentum that we're seeing with the Robinsons. As Tricia alluded to earlier, the Robinsons are now 3x greater and yearly 3.5x greater than our Sams for PLE.
We'll also be adjusting the PLE calculation in the coming months. We haven't updated that extrapolation for a while, and we're seeing better retention in that tail of the PLE curve than we've seen historically. And so when we update the PLE calculation, overall PLEs will go up by more than -- by about 2%. And for our Robinsons, it will be even higher. Our Robinsons are disproportionately represented in the tail of the PLE curve. This means that we'll have even more opportunity with our Robinsons. We'll be able to acquire them more aggressively, and we'll be able to bundle our current customers more aggressively. 
So far, I've spoken inclusively about the trailing 12 PLE, but I want to go back to the trailing 3 that I talked about in the opening. If we think about the difference between the trailing 3 and the trailing 12 PLE is the unrealized momentum in our PLE data. And we're very pleased with what we see here. For total auto, the trading 3 PLE is up 8% year-over-year. For the trailing 12 PLE, it's up 6%. So we think we have about 2 points of unrealized momentum within our PLE. As you can see across all of our segments, the trailing 3 PLE is higher year-over-year than the trailing 12, so we feel like we have a lot of momentum. But the highest difference is for our Robinsons. For Robinsons, we think we have about 4 points of momentum that we haven't yet realized. I want to stop here and just talk about the goal that Tricia outlined for us in 2015. Tricia has challenged us to increase retention by 50%. We think we can achieve this in 3 ways. First, we believe we can change our mix. In the Destination Era, we think we can change our mix to more preferred customers and new business. Pat outlined some of the strategies we have there. In addition to changing mix, we think we can improve our price competitiveness relative to the competition. Pat showed the slide where we have increasing agency PLE while overall rates are being increased. And third, we believe we can improve the customer experience. We think we can nurture our customers to stay with Progressive longer, and I'll spend some time on that in the next section. We think this path to a 50% increase runs through our more preferred segments. We see more opportunities with our more preferred segments to increase retention. And then as the mix of our business changes, we believe we'll hit that overall goal of increasing retention by 50%. 
I want to switch gears here and start talking about the nurture side of things. But I want to pause and just talk about data for a minute and specifically, how we're using data for customer experience. We see a virtuous cycle in our pricing. I started off in product management, this was a big part of our roles. In pricing, we see that when we acquire customers, we are paying their data. And with that data, we can derive segmentation and insights and improve our pricing, which allows us to acquire more customers, which gives us more data, which gives us better segmentation, a virtuous cycle exists within our pricing. We think the same virtuous cycle exists with our customers in customer experience, specifically with our customers, we gain customers and then we interact with them. Those interactions generate data and that data provides insights and ideas in segmentation. That allows us to increase retention, which allows us to have more customers. And more customers provides more interactions and more data and we get a virtuous cycle here within customer experience as well. And in the Destination Era, as we gain more products, we think that cycle spins even faster, more products means more interactions, which means more data. So as we invest in the Destination Era, we think we'll have even more predictive data to use with our customers. We give you that background because leveraging data is part of a larger initiative that we're working on here at Progressive. In the 2015 investor relations meeting, Glenn said that we need to be as good at customer marketing as we are at consumer marketing. And so we've put a joint team together from our customer relationship management organization and corporate marketing, and that team is working on this customer marketing initiative. There are 4 pillars that we talk about with the customer marketing initiatives. The first is that we want to improve our customer knowledge. We want to assemble as much predictive data as we can for our customers, so that we know the experiences that they're going through. After that, we want to improve our customer engagement. There's 2 parts to this. We want to improve the processes that they go through, and we want to segment those customers better. The third pillar is interfaces. As we've come up with segmentation and processes, we need flexible interfaces to deliver those to our customers. And then finally, we want to brand those interfaces for our customers. Jeff Charney talked about this last year and so I won't spend time on it this year, but we want to have the branding that resonates with our customers as they interact with us. 
So with that said, let me walk through some of these pillars in particular, and I'll start with knowledge. As an initial example, I'll talk about small data that we are -- have been working on for our customers. Over the past 18 months, we've looked for internal and external data elements that are highly predictive for our customers. I have a smattering of those data elements on the screen. On the X axis here is the volume of data. You can think of this as the number of customers described by the data. And then on the Y axis, I have a general lift associated with that data. You can think of that lift as a lift in retention or a lift in graduation to become a Robinson or a lift in endorsements. No matter which of those 3 we're talking about with the data, it's highly profitable for Progressive to know. If we know that there will be a change with that customer, we can act on it in a profitable way. So let me give you some examples. Example #1 is an internal data element. It came from our digital servicing environment, it's a digital servicing action that we see our customers take. It wasn't within the structured data warehouse, but we had it in-house. And when we dug into it, we saw there's a 14-point difference in retention if we saw this data element. To give you another example that I can get a little bit more transparent about, example 2 is an external data element from a data vendor, we call it the newlywed variable. It comes from wedding invitations, bridal registries, courthouse records, things associated with getting married. And when we see that data element on one of our customers. In the next 6 months, there's more than a 200% lift in whether they change their marital status. And when a customer changes their marital status, it changes the retention rates, it changes the number of vehicles and drivers in the household and sometimes it adds additional products like a property policy. Now beyond small data, we've also started to think more about the big data available to us in customer relationship management. A leading technology company said that 80% of the world's data is unstructured, and we think that's true within CRM as well. I'm going to describe one area today, although there are others that we are working on as well. The area I'm going to describe today is the action that we're taking to put together an unstructured database of our customer words, the words that we hear from our customers. So let me give you some examples of some sources of this data. The first area is from our survey responses. Annually, we receive more than 80,000 survey responses from our customers. In addition, we have more than 1 million chat transcripts with our customers. When they go to our digital servicing environment, they can chat with a Progressive consultant. But as John  Sauerland alluded to, the largest and most significant source of words is from our calls with our customers. We received 36 million Personal Lines calls per year, and we've been transcribing those calls, and we have -- using advanced analytics, and we have all those calls in text form that we can put into a data warehouse. In total, Progressive has more than 10 billion words annually from our customers. So what can do we do with this? Well, I'll give you a few small examples today. One thing we've done is just search all this text for 3-word combinations, we call these trigrams. And there are some trigrams that are very predictive of, say, defection. I have 3 of those on the screen. I can tell you, for example, that trigram #3 is, 'I never received.' I never received my ID card. I never received that document that I requested. But I never received. And when a customer says that to Progressive, they are 1.4x more likely to defect from Progressive in the next 6 months. Another thing we've looked at is metadata. You can think of metadata as something other than the words that are present on those phone calls. For example, metadata #2 here is the amount of silence time on a phone call. As that silence time increases, the future defection chance increases as well, so there's about a 1.1x relativity on the amount of silence time on a phone call. There's even some significant words, some single words that if spoken or written or shared are a good predictor of future defection from Progressive. I won't share those today, but we've parsed through the text to look for those single words. 
So I'd like to move beyond knowledge now and talk about our engagement. And as a reminder here, I'm going to talk about the segmentation side of the engagements. In Progressive, we've certainly built traditional models. We use generalized linear models in a number of situations. These are tried and true models that are used throughout insurance and throughout business. And here, I want to tell you about the probability of Robinson graduation. This was a traditional modeling exercise that we went through in CRM. So we gave a team, I'll call them team #1, some of that small data that I talked about in the knowledge section. And we asked them to predict which customers may become a Robinson in the future, and they did a good job with this. They built a model. And the model in the top decile had a 4x greater chance of becoming a Robinson than the least responsive decile. But then we took that same data and we gave it to a separate team, one that did not work with the first team. And the separate -- second team did an even better job. In the second team, we found that the team came up with a model that was 7x greater. But the best result was if we combine models. And when we combined models, we found that the best tranche had a 9x greater likelihood. So even in the situation where we're building traditional models, we try to put the models together and combine them in ways to create the best outcome for Progressive. Now the world has moved beyond just generalized linear models, given the vast amount of data and the computing power that's available. It's moved to things like random forest or gradient boosting machines or neural networks, some of these advanced predictive models that are now available to us. We've invested in an advanced analytics team within CRM to take advantage of these models. The first assignment for this advanced analytics team was to build a defection model, to try to predict who might leave Progressive. And the best models were the gradient boosting machines and neural networks are being built. Because of the power of these models, I want to spend a little time just walking through the first generation neural network with you today. On the screen, I have the basic structure of a neural network, and I want to explain it to you. The first layer of a neural network is known as the feature layer. Features are like the independent variables that you would've seen in our regression historically. They are the attributes to the policy. Here on the screen, we have 2 features. F1 is a categorical variable of whether or not the policy is on EFT payments or automatic payments with Progressive. F2 is the percentage change in premium that, that policy will see in its upcoming renewal. We're going to have 2 predictors in this small snippet of a model. I can tell you in our first generation neural network, we had more than 900 predictors, and that was before we had access to all those billions of words that I described previously. From the feature layer, data passes along synapses to an output layer. Synapses are weights between negative 1 and 1 that are multiplied by the data. And then the data reaches this hidden layer. At the hidden layer, there's functions that are set there, common functions that are used in neural networks that transform the data. From the hidden layer, it travels along another set of synapses to the output layer. Again, the synapses multiply it by a number between negative 1 and 1 and then in the output layer, there's another function that transforms the data. And out of that output layer comes a predictor of defection or retention with Progressive between 0% and 100%. With that set up, let me walk you through a training of this neural network. On the screen are 8 policies from a training data set. These are 8 policies where we both know the predictors, the features of those policies, and what happened with them. So we have some policies that renewed with Progressive and some policies that defected from Progressive. What we do is we run these policies through the neural network. This is called forward propagation. Each of these policies passes through the network and is calculated the retention of it. So the features enter that feature layer, they're multiplied by that number between negative 1 and 1 in the synapse layer, they hit the hidden layer where they're transformed by a function. Another weight hits it and finally, it's transformed by a final function and a predictor of retention comes out. You can see here in this first iteration that the neural network is almost random. All those policies are clumped around the middle of the scale for predicting retention and the overall model accuracy as well. But what happens next is 1 of the 2 reasons why a neural network works. What happens next is a self-correcting mechanism exists within a neural network. It's called backward propagation. During backward propagation, each of those synapse weights are recalculated. It's calculated based on an iteration method called stochastic gradient descent. Stochastic gradient descent helps the model move towards the maximum accuracy. So as those weights change, this model is changing itself to become more accurate. After this backward propagation, we train the model again. We take these 8 policies and we pass them again through the model. Each of the policies enters the feature layer, hits the hidden layer and goes through the output layer. And you can see this time, the policies that renew with Progressive are starting to go higher on the renewal probability scale and those that defect are starting to go lower and the model accuracy improves, and then we backward propagate again, again adjusting the model. In actuality, we do this tens of thousands of times. Here in the room, I'm going to do it 10x quickly, just so you can see what happens. And this is the second reason why a neural network works. It's because of the brute force computing power that's available to us in this day and age. At the end of this, the model is trained. You can see after 10 iterations that the model accuracy has improved, and we have a model that's now ready for production. I do want to note here when we do this in actual practice, we keep a hold-out data set to make sure that we don't over fit the model. So what happens now? Well, we want to use this model in production. So I brought in 2 policies that we don't know the outcome for. They may be coming up for renewal with Progressive, Policy 9 and Policy 10. What we do is we take the features of these policies, and we pass them through the neural network. And here we can see that Policy 9 will retain with Progressive likely, and Policy 10 might defect from Progressive. We started to discriminate between policies that will stay and those that might leave. Now I hope you take 2 things away from this. First takeaway is that this is an incredibly intensive calculation process. For this first generation neural network, it took us 7 full days to run. We were using our local infrastructure but still it took an incredibly long time. And that was before we had tens of billions of words. That was before we tried adding on more hidden layers to move towards cognitive computing. It's just a very large and complex process. And it's because we have an impressive analytical infrastructure that we built through the Snapshot program that we can start tackling problems like this. The second thing I hope you take away is that this is an incredibly accurate model as well. Now we showed overall model accuracy on the screen. Truth be told, that's not what we're interested in. We're actually interested in the tail of the model, if we can predict those policies that are very unlikely to renew. We want to have good tail accuracy. And from the data that we used to build this neural network, we also built a traditional model, a GLM model. And when we did that, the neural network was twice as predictive as the generalized linear model. We're using the same data, but using more predictive advanced analytics techniques, we can be much more accurate in what we're doing, which has larger benefits to Progressive. Let me walk through interfaces to tell you a little bit more about how we take these models and use them for business benefit. I want to start by talking about proactive outbound communication. This is us reaching out to our customers. On the screen, I have a couple of examples of digital ads. These are digital ads we put in front of our current customers when we want them to graduate to become Robinsons. We target these digital ads based on that traditional model that I talked about previously. When we combine those models, we're focusing the most responsive deciles, we show them these digital ads. And when we've done that, along with some other activities like this, we've increased the number of Robinsons we have by tens of thousands, adding millions of dollars in lifetime underwriting profit to Progressive. We're able to do this because of all that acumen we built in advertising to consumers. We use those same patterns in advertising to our customers. Just another example is Policy 10 from that neural network example. We know that Policy 10 may not stay with Progressive, and so we started campaigns to reach out to folks like Policy 10 and invite them to call in to talk about their policy. And when we've done things like that, and we've got a few in practice now, the run rate is that annually, we'll save tens of thousands of customers, worth tens of millions of dollars in lifetime underwriting profit to Progressive. Beyond proactive outbound communication, there's also proactive inbound communication. We have built a tool that our phone consultants can use when someone calls Progressive. We call this tool the customer relationship assistant. It's a user interface for our phone consultants. It took us about 2 months to build, and the beauty of this tool is that it houses all that data and all those models I spoke about previously. So when Policy 10 calls, the consultant on the phone knows to talk to that customer about their policy and about staying with Progressive. It's really personalized, right? We can tailor all these interactions and make sure we have the right treatments that fire when that customer calls in. It's very flexible. If we want to add new treatments, we can program them in about 2 hours. And earlier results from this are very impressive. We've seen an increase in products added, a reduction in future calls and a lift in retention. 
Let me recap what I talked about today. In 2015, in the investor relations meeting, Glenn said that retention was our Holy Grail. And Tricia challenged us to increase retention by 50%. I'll underscore the progress that you heard today. PLE is up 6% with momentum higher. Direct is at an all-time high, and we're making the most progress with our Robinsons as our mix in that business shifts towards the Robinsons. In customer marketing, as a direct carrier and a servicing independent agent carrier, we have access to billions and billions of pieces of customer data. We have a historical strength in mining that data, driving insights to segmentation and quickly moving to market. We believe we can do that with our current customers. Feed that virtuous cycle of data and extend policy life expectancies. And with that, I'll welcome up John Barbagallo to talk about Commercial Lines."

I'm going to touch on our most recent results and share a little bit about our near-term action plans. And then I'",4246,"Thanks, Andrew. Hello. Good afternoon. I'm going to share a little bit about what we're seeing in the Commercial Auto insurance marketplace. I'm going to touch on our most recent results and share a little bit about our near-term action plans. And then I'm going to shift to talk about 2 disruptive trends that are coming to you, small business insurance and non-fleet Commercial Auto insurance. And these are trends that we have not only been monitoring, but we've actually been making investments around them over the last several years, and we think we're very favorably positioned to take advantage of them. But first, let's start talking about the marketplace. I'm going to start with a little history. This is a chart that I've shared with this audience in the past. It's now been updated through 2015. And what it shows is Progressive's relative performance relative to the industry on 2 measures: combined ratio and growth in direct written premium. And 2 things you can take from this graph. One is that over this time period, Progressive, by being intensely focused on Commercial Auto as a specific line of business, has been able to consistently outperform the industry on combined ratio, usually by a margin of 10 to 15 points. And for the last few calendar years, it's actually been by 20 points. Now some of that is from our expense ratio. We have a very cost competitive expense ratio. We believe we are the low cost provider in Commercial Auto, but a lot of that is loss ratio. And by being focused in the way we are, we believe we see things sooner and react faster than most of the rest in the industry and that contributes to this advantage. The other thing you can take from this chart is perhaps a little more subtle, is that we will and have consistently slowed our growth in the business when we were at risk of exceeding our underwriting target. And we will keep that commitment to those underwriting margin targets. Even with that approach, over time, we have been able to grow our market share consistently to the point where 2015, Progressive became the #1 Commercial Auto writer in the United States. All right, let's jump into 2016. This is a view, again, same 2 measures, combined ratio and direct written premium, Progressive versus the industry, we've added a few of our key competitors, as of the first quarter of 2016. You can see Progressive up in the upper right, cruising along with really good growth and a combined ratio in the high 80s at that point. And the industry had about 6% growth and a combined ratio of 102, which actually isn't too bad when you consider how it ended in 2015, that would appear to be improvement. But if you update through the second quarter, you see general degradation of combined ratios across the board, including our own. In fact, for the industry, the change in loss ratio, if you take the loss ratio for the 3 months comprising the second quarter, it is fully 8 points higher than the first quarter loss ratio. Now there's some seasonality at play there, but that is a huge, huge change. Now I'm sure you've noticed in our last 2 or 3 monthly earnings releases that our combined ratio has been elevated, certainly above historic norms. There's a little bit of prior year development in there. For the 3 months period, it's about 1 point, 1.25 points. But the real driver of that is actually frequency. What we have on the screen now is our bodily injury reported frequency for the last couple of years. Now the blue line is the monthly frequency. As you can see, that's pretty volatile, it jumps around a lot. We don't tend to pay too much attention to that. Even though those kind of last 2, last couple high watermarks there, they're high, but certainly not beyond anything we've seen in our history. If you look at the orange line, that is the trailing 6 BI frequency, and that's a much more stable measure, but it's still -- it is relatively reactive to changes in the environment. And there you're seeing what appears to be an inflection point starting in May, maybe as early as April. We believe that is real, at least it's real enough to me that we are reacting to that. We also believe it is largely environmental. Pat talked earlier about general a rise in frequency for auto, there's theories around that, distracted driving, low fuel prices. But in Commercial Auto specifically, particularly the verticals where we tend to compete, we are seeing positive movement in a number of the macroeconomic factors that we track that generally correlate with frequency. Things like home sales, construction spending, trade tonnage, aggregate deliveries, all moving in a positive direction, which suggests to us higher levels of economic activity, also contributing to higher frequency. So we believe this is real and we are reacting to it. Primarily, we're reacting with rate. Now I've talked to this audience before about our rate revision infrastructure at Progressive, our ability to change rates across the broad portfolio relatively quickly, and we have kicked that into gear. What this graph shows is our anticipated rate change for 2016, which will come in at about 9% year-over-year change in rates, most of that in the second half of the year. We were actually holding rates flat through the first 4 months of the year, as we were operating in the high 80s. So we've responded decisively and we've responded quickly, and those rate changes will certainly help the combined ratio. But it will take time. About 90% of our policies are written on an annual basis, so we have to get through a renewal cycle to get the full effect of it. It will certainly help with new business as soon as we can get those rates in place. But in the interim, and I said, we will slow down growth to ensure we make our margins. In the interim, we're also restricting some high-frequency segments of our business for new business. We're going to stop taking it until we can get those rates in place. Now those segments have always been high frequency, they will always be high frequency, and we're perfectly comfortable writing that business at the right rate, we're just not there yet. So that's what we see going on. Again, by being focused, we think we are seeing this before much of our competition, and we're reacting before they do. And when that's happened historically, that has typically set up very favorable market conditions for us down the road. So we'll see what happens. 
All right. Now I want to shift to those disruptive trends. The first of which is what I believe will be an inevitable shift to small business owners accessing direct channels for the purchasing and servicing of their small business insurance policies. Consumers across a range of industries have demonstrated not only acceptance of direct channels, but in many cases, preference for those channels. And we don't expect small business owners to be any different, especially as digital continues to close the information gap between the buyer and the seller. And we're starting to see investment. Investment by people other than Progressive. And these are companies that are well-known. They are well-funded, and they have experienced management. And they are putting the assets in place. Underwriting companies, product filings, technology platforms, all to go after the direct channel for small business owners. And they're starting to spend some money. Not a lot on the marketing front, and actually, it's happening slower than we would've anticipated. We still are the largest spender in the category, but they're starting to spend some money as well. So we're seeing investments. We're also starting to see some growth. This is a view provided by the Boston Consulting Group of the U.S. small business insurance market. Now this is all lines of business, it's all lines of business for small business insurance, and they peg that at about a $65 billion to $70 billion marketplace. And as of right about now, they're saying direct channels have 8% share. Probably more interesting on this chart is what they project to be the growth rate of the channels. So a pretty aggressive growth rate for digital channels in small business insurance. In fact if you buy into this view, it suggests that traditional channels will begin to decline in absolute dollars as early as 2019. We'll see. When it comes to Commercial Auto, where we have some pretty good data, we're seeing a somewhat similar pattern. Now again, the direct channel for Commercial Auto is still small, less than 2%, but the growth rate relative to the industry growth rate is 2x to 3x. Now full disclosure, on this particular graph, that orange line is largely driven by Progressive. We're just about half of the direct commercial auto market right now, and we actually can affect the slope of that line simply in terms of how much we choose to spend. And that's reflected in 2014, we pulled back in our spending, and you see that little dip there. But again, you have a channel where there's lots of investment lining up, and you're starting to see signs of growth in the channel. So the question then becomes who is going to be able to most cost effectively drive demand and control the top of that sales funnel. And this is where we start to feel really good. Because while the others are just getting started, we have actually been at this since 2008. Now we've been selling direct commercial for more than a decade, but it was really in 2008 that we began investing in developing a business insurance brand. In 2008, we started -- we embarked, really, on a 5-year plan, and it was a 5-year plan to prove to ourselves that we could make the economics of direct marketing commercial insurance work. And it was a very auto-centric approach, targeting specific verticals where we tend to do well. We concluded that 5-year plan successfully in 4 years. That gave us the confidence in 2012 to begin broadening our marketing. And by broadening, I mean, both broadening the media we would access and broadening our message to be much less auto-centric and really built around insuring and protecting the business. And that has now evolved to our current campaign, which we just launched, which could really celebrate the small business owner. So we've been investing here for a long time. Has that investment been worth it? We would say it definitely has been. One of the key measures of brand health is awareness, and as you can see on these 2 charts, in terms of total awareness and top-of-mind awareness, Progressive is the leading small business insurance brand. Again, this gets back to who is going to control the top of that sales funnel as this channel begins to grow.
How fast might this all happen? I don't really know, but maybe we can look to private passenger auto as a guide, because this has happened. The chart on the left shows the shift in channel for private passenger auto over a 20-year period. Now keep in mind, that orange line for the direct channel developed concurrently with the development and acceptance of digital channels for consumers. So the Internet, gradually migrating over to mobile. We believe those consumer preferences are already in place. And I'll offer an opinion that small business owners, at least a percentage of them, their expectations currently exceed the industry's ability to deliver really good digital experiences. The chart on the right is the effect of that channel shift on Progressive's business. So over roughly the same time period, Progressive's direct auto business grew from being about 12 -- 11%, 12% of our total business to where it is today, half our business. Now it's not that our agency business didn't grow during this time. It did grow. You heard earlier from Pat that it is at an all-time high. It's just that the direct business grew that much faster, creating lots of value for Progressive and for our shareholders. We've modeled this out. We've done a number of different scenarios around how quickly the direct channel may grow for small business insurance, based on different spend levels by us, spend levels by other. And when we surround what we think are the most likely outcomes, it all leads to significant growth for Progressive Commercial Lines.
So we continue to invest in our capabilities. We are in the midst of a major systems upgrade for commercial. One of the benefits of that will be the ability to deliver better digital experiences, and perhaps more importantly, deliver them to market faster and enhance them more quickly. And we continue to invest in and build our in-house business insurance agency.
The map on the left shows our footprint for being able to offer non-affiliated partner company BOP and general liability policies to prospects and our customers. We also sell workers' comp and professional liability, but the primary coverages they're seeking are BOP and GL. And today, we have -- in virtually every state, we can offer between 5 and 8 products, covering a range of underwriting profiles. And as you can see on the graph on the right, we are growing the agency. And there again, the shape of that growth curve can largely be determined by how much we choose to spend at a given time. And we are growing the agency, and we are having success bundling these small business customers with Progressive Auto, be it Commercial Auto or Personal Auto, and that's an important point. We are creating a lot of bundles with a BOP or GL policy and a Progressive Personal Auto policy, which is just fine. First of all, it helps the agency's economics because those customers are much stickier. Second, it is entirely consistent with the strategy Tricia laid out earlier in terms of acquire, anchor, bundle, extend. This may be how we acquire customers. Certainly, could be how we bundle customers. And also, we're finding that the need for commercial auto in a  small business oftentimes emerges late or later in the life cycle of that business, and business insurance is very situational, unlike personal lines. Usually the first purchase of a personal lines product, typically auto, is driven by a state law, state requirement to have insurance or a bank. In small business insurance, that is not usually the case.
So to try to give some context to this slide, I'm going to tell you a story. And it's a story about a real-life, thriving business right here in Northeast Ohio. So a work colleague of mine has a friend, and she's starting a business in her home, in her kitchen actually, cooking bone broth. And she sold this bone broth out of her kitchen to friends and neighbors. Now she didn't have insurance, so we told her she needed insurance. You can argue she probably should have had insurance, but she was flying below the radar, which a lot of small businesses do, particularly in their early stages. The sales went well. She got a lot of positive feedback, and she was encouraged to take her product to one of the local farmers' markets. So she decided to give that a try. She applied. She was accepted, but the farmers' market told her, if you want to come on-premise, you have to have a vendor's liability policy and you have to have a general liability policy. So where previously, she was in that first circle of not really caring about insurance, she now found herself in that second circle of, well, at least temporarily, I have to care about insurance if I want to go to this farmers' market. Not sure if I have a real business yet, but I'll buy the insurance. Farmers' market went well. Again, a lot of positive feedback, again, getting inquiries from local restaurants who wanted her to supply them with bone broth. She even got a contract with a local grocery store chain, and the business is starting to take off. In fact, taking off to the point that she outgrew her kitchen, and she had to lease commercial space, and she had to hire 2 employees to set up more of a regular production cycle for the bone broth. And now she needs a BOP policy for her premises, and she needs workers' compensation for her employees. I would say now she's in that third circle of, I definitely really have to care about insurance. She still hasn't had a commercial auto policy, but that's about to change. She had been hiring a third party to make her deliveries. She now buys her first delivery vehicle, she needs a commercial auto policy.
I understand from my colleague that she is now thinking of expanding her business regionally, maybe nationally. She realizes she has a real asset here, an asset she wants to preserve, protect, maybe pass on to the next generation. I would argue she's moving into that fourth circle of, I genuinely care about buying insurance. The point here is for small business owners, it is a journey of one, and they are all different, and they are not necessarily linear like the real-life example I just gave you. People move back and forth. Some small business owners never move out of that second circle. They're kind of the Sams of small business ownership. And to deal with that, we have developed a series of customer journey maps, by business type and by business stage. And do what these journey maps allow us to do? It maps our creative and our messaging and our media buying with those key trigger events to deliver the right message at the right time to that business. So this a trend that is clearly coming. You've been reading a lot about it. It's been a little slow to gain traction. We think it's about to take hold, and we feel we are really, really well-positioned to capitalize on that.
The other trend I want to talk to you about is the application of telematics to non-fleet commercial auto insurance. I'm not sure if this is a trend yet, but I do believe it's coming. So telematics have been broadly applied in fleet situations. But even there, there has never been a really strong insurance tie-in. That's been more about asset management and logistics than insurance. But we think that's about to change, particularly in the trucking sector. Now John Sauerland has already talked to you about Progressive's leadership position in terms of usage-based insurance pricing science. He's talked to you, and Andrew's reinforced, the big data capabilities Progressive can bring to bear. Those are absolutely assets we can leverage in Commercial Lines. But we have taken a slightly different path in Commercial than they have in Personal with respect to UBI, and we have focused on the transportation industry, the over-the-road truckers. Two reasons for that. One, we feel a version of the Snapshot product will work perfectly well for a lot of our business auto contractor-type customers. And now as the agency adoption rate of Snapshot is starting to go up, it may be the time for us to introduce that to commercial. The other reason that we focused on transportation is we were anticipating a federal mandate, which is now law, that will require federal motor carriers to have an electronic logging device in their vehicle and operational by December 2017. And these electronic logging devices will be fully telematics-enabled, if you will. They'll have all the data you could possibly want. So we have, for the last few years, been working directly with the vendors, the  manufacturers of these ELDs to put in place data sharing agreement and cooperative marketing agreements so we can go to market together with our products as the demand increases, leading up to the compliance date in December '17 and we've also been collecting our own UBI data for the last several years. Today, we probably have about 600 of our insured trucks on the road being monitored. We've collected over 41 million miles of data, and those data are beginning to reveal some really, really interesting things.
Perhaps the most interesting is that we find with commercial operators the degree of variance in their behavior is far, far greater than Personal Lines customers in terms of how, how much and where they drive. To the extent those behaviors correlate with losses, and they do, that's very exciting, because that allows for greater rate segmentation. And John's already talked to you about the power of rate segmentation. He's told you that in Personal Lines, Snapshot is the most predictive, most powerful rating variable we have. We believe, for trucking risks, it will be even more powerful than that. So we're very excited.
Let me give you just a little sampling of some of the things we're seeing. All these examples relate to the same 3 insured vehicles. One of the things you rate on in Commercial Auto is something called radius of operation, which is basically how far do you go from your principal garaging address, how far do you go. It's a rating variable we use. ISO uses it. A lot of our competitors use it. A problem with radius of operations as a rating variable, it could be hard to verify and it changes over time. Truckers go where the work -- I think that's true of all commercial vehicles, they go where the work is. But we all use it. Well now, with electronic logging devices, we actually know where they go. And in this sample, we've got 3 insured vehicles that were all rated based on the same radius of operation, 500 miles, which was pretty good for Vehicle C. We're probably overcharging Vehicle A and Vehicle B. Well, more important than how far you drive is where you drive. Now that we have geolocation data, we can actually score different routes and different roads in terms of relative safety or risk. From there, we can overlay time of day, so you incorporate things like rush hour and potentially things like seasonal weather pattern. You begin to see where this can go. But even with a relatively simplistic model for scoring, which is what we have here, you see pretty significant differences in distribution, which we believe are actionable and ratable. One more, this is how much you drive, and this is really the whole impetus behind the federal mandate. Better regulation of hours of operation, hours of service. Driver fatigue is a major, major safety issue for over-the-road truckers. The graphs on the bottom reflects hours per day of driving. So each bar on the graph is a day. And the white line going across is the federal limit of 11 hours per day. So you can see pretty significant differences in these distributions. Vehicle B -- and remember, this is the guy that goes the furthest from home by far, seems to be doing a better job of managing his hours per day. Vehicle C actually had some 20 and 22-hour days in there. Now what that probably means is we have team driving, 2 drivers taking shifts. And still, that's really important and valuable information and represents a different risk. So this is just a few samples of the types of data we are beginning to develop, that we think will be very, very actionable.
I'm going to conclude with one more chart, just because I love the data, and this is another comparison between Personal Auto, and in this case, some long-haul trucking customers. So the bottom graph was taken from a sample of Snapshot customers, Personal Auto Snapshot customers. And all it does is it shows kind of where their cars are during different parts of the day. And what you see by and large is most of the time, those cars are at home, in the driveway, in the garage. And during the daytime hours, that's where you see the driving. Not so much driving in the wee morning hours. Not surprising. The graph on the top is a sample of Progressive-insured long-haul trucks. And what you see there is lots of driving, not surprising, not unusual, 100,000, 120,000 miles a year for a trucker. But when they're not driving, they're typically away from home, sleeping in their truck, showering at a truck stop, using a, I don't know, Cracker Barrel. It could be a pretty hard life for a trucker, and this is where I really start to get excited about these data, because this is where I think we can go beyond just straight rate segmentation and start to develop value-added services by using risk management services to hopefully make these truckers a little bit healthier and a little bit safer while they're on the road. So again, another trend, we think, is coming to small business insurance, in this case, non-fleet auto insurance, that we feel we're very, very well-positioned to capitalize on.
With that, I'm going to bring up Tricia Griffith for some closing remarks."

We continue with our segmentation of more and more product models and having deeper segmentation at the quickest amount of time ever. So we really think that's a competitive advantage. And our bundled PIFs have grown 20% to 30% across channels. John  Sauerland talked about our most important variable, our UBI or usage-based insurance, so Snapshot, and how we're continuing on that evolution and how with that work we've actually had even more data capabilities across the enterprise that we believe will be a winning strategy for Progressive. Andrew Quigg talked about PLE. We finally made that breakthrough in PLE, especially in the Robinsons segment. Andrew talked about the massive amount of customer data that we have and how we're going to use that data to understand the moves of our customers and be out in front of that, give them a reason to stay.
John Barbagallo talked about the fact that we're outperforming our peers relative to profit and growth, so that's extraordinary. Bottom line is though, we have to respond quickly to our frequency trend, and we're doing that with rate. John has his own era coming up in terms of the direct business with small business owners as well as technology and data-driven technology in the commercial space.
I hope you're thrilled as our team is about what we've executed upon and what we're going to be doing in the future. And I want to thank you for your interest in Progressive. So with that, I will ask John Sauerland to join me for some Q&A."

ASI has maintained the reinsurance philosophy they had before we acquired a majority stake in the company. We haven't disclosed the complete reinsurance program, but I'll give you some quick highlights. So $50 million of retention for a main storm. The first storm has a tower that is up to what -- the average model, I'll say, equates to about a 1 in 300 years storm, so that's pretty high up relative to what we believe other carriers have. We have a second event that also has a $50 million retention on it. But we're -- I think ASI has done a great thing in that it's only typical in the marketplace, in that they prepay reinstatement for about 70% of that tower. That tower is not quite as tall as the first tower, but it's about a 1 in 100-year event, and about 70% of that has reinstatement premiums prepaid. And Trevor Hillier and John Auer -- Trevor Hillier, CFO of ARX, and John Auer, the CEO, are both here. So if I misstate or I need corrections, please feel free to chime in. So $50 million on an ASI book, it's material for sure. $50 million on the Progressive book, you can do the math. We can absolutely sustain that and still hit our calendar year 96% targets."

We can get more profitable by raising rates or we can underwrite out segments at new business or at renewal that we think are the cause of the problem until we have rates in that segment high enough where we are then comfortable letting new customers back in. So in Commercial Lines, they've identified segments of new customers that they believe will be the least profitable. And they're working upfront to underwrite that. In Commercial Lines, they have a lot of ability as well to underwrite a renewal with credits, debits. And they've done a lot of that over time and have targeted that, of course, as well. In Personal Lines, we're actually employing a lot of underwriting these days as well. It hasn't been what we've been -- it hasn't been our forte historically. But probably 4 or 5 years ago, we started getting a little more conservative around ensuring that we were bringing in business that was intent it was to insure and not otherwise. And I think that's helped us a lot. But higher level, you can improve profitability through raising rates or underwriting segments. And Commercial Lines has been very fast to react in turning on the underwriting where necessary, and they're now reacting very quickly in getting rates up and expect to have those rates up about 9% by the end of the year."

I think you're all familiar with the Safe Harbor statements, and if not, there's also a copy in your materials as a reference guide.
So this particular investor relations meeting represents a really big change. For many, many years, Glenn Renwick was the host of these meetings. In fact, I think he started them. Last week, Glenn celebrated his 30th anniversary with Progressive, of which more than half of that he was our CEO and President. During his tenure as CEO, he tripled the company in size. So by most record books you would say that is phenomenal, and it is. But it's not just that. It's not just what Glenn did, it's how he did it: Always making sure to instill in us that desire to win, but doing it in the right way, always following our core values. He always would set the bar higher every year for all of us. And then he wouldn't walk away, he would help us get over, and that is really his legacy. So Glenn, on behalf of the 30,000 Progressive people, our shareholders and the customers we're privileged to serve, thank you for, well, being Progressive.
Okay, enough about Glenn. I thought what I'd do to start off is just remind you of our segments. So we outlined these several years ago when we first started talking about our Destination Era strategy. So I'll just briefly go over those. The focus today will be on the Robinsons, and we're really excited to talk to you about what we have done since we last met you in May of 2015.
So Sam. Sam is a segment we grew up with, and we call him inconsistently insured. He is who Progressive -- he put us on the map, and we call him nonstandard. He cares about rates, doesn't stay very long, but he could come back. We love Sam. We want to write all the Sams we can possibly write as long as it reaches our profitability goal.
Diane. Diane is a big part of the Destination Era. We've talked in the past about her being a future Robinson. Diane is an auto customer, and she rents. So she may have renters insurance with us, and what we hope is that as her needs evolve, when she buys a home, gets married, that we evolve with her. It's the notion of Diane graduating to be a Robinson. She's our largest customer base, so the opportunity there is immense.
The Wrights. The Wrights are unbundled auto and home. So they have Progressive home and someone else's auto. Again, we love the Wrights. We see them as future Robinsons because we hope that if they decide to shop their homeowners, they come with us and become a Robinson.
The Robinsons. That's really what today is all about and what the Destination Era is all about, the auto home bundle. The Robinsons are 40% of the market. So the opportunity here is really great, and we are really proud of how, the momentum we've had in the last 18 months in particular, in obtaining Robinsons.
Before we get started, what I thought I'd do as the new CEO is step back and just take stock of some objectives and some fundamentals that will stay the same during my tenure, but things that might evolve. And clearly, with Glenn's leadership, I was a part of the team that developed the strategy around the Destination Era. So to make a turn and do something differently wouldn't make sense. I believe in this model, the execution has been great and I'm excited about our future. But things do evolve as a team as we know more.
Let me start with our first and most important objective, profit. We want to make at least $0.04 of underwriting profit of every $1 of premium. 96 is central to our culture. You're actually sitting in an auditorium that is called Studio 96. So you know how integrated it is into everything we do. It continues to be our most important objective, and that won't change. There is, however, an added dimension with the auto home bundle. We're looking at how 2 independent margins can be optimized for that package. So while the 96 will stay the same, how it will be derived will absolutely evolve.
Growth. We want to grow as fast as we can with 2 constraints: one, the profit objective I just outlined; and two, our ability to service our customers. That second one is really important to us. So about 18 months ago, we had our 8.3 model on the streets, it was working, we were getting a lot more preferred customers. We also saw the opportunity, when some of our competition pulled back, to spend more on advertising, specifically, in the digital options. So we knew at that point we had a lot of opportunities to grow. We made a decision at that time to hire well in advance of need. So from the claims organization as well as our customer relationship management organizations, both on the auto side and the commercial side. And I'm so pleased that we did that, because we did get that growth. We got that preferred growth. And in addition, we had things that happened that we didn't necessarily plan for, in the form of catastrophes. So we've been able to service our customers, no matter if it was a CAT or a regular just increase in losses based on growth.
It is sort of a rule here at Progressive that whether you're on the claims side or the product side, if you think we're growing too fast, you absolutely have to raise your hand and say, ""No more growth. We can't do this."" And we've had to do that in the past. I'm so delighted to say that this year we didn't have to do that because we prepared and hired in advance of need. So when I think about growth and profit and that balance, year-to-date, with August being the most recent time frame, we're at a 96.2 
[Audio Gap] 
percent net written premium growth. If we ended the year today, this is a phenomenal year, especially with the business that we've been putting on the books. I'm extraordinarily happy. If we were at the same margin at 96.2 and had 4% growth with the same set of circumstances, I wouldn't be as happy. If we were at 88 with 0% growth, I wouldn't be happy. I'm very, very pleased with our growth. It really is sort of the perfect storm. So we had this new business, and we talked and talked at the conference calls about the sort of new business tax that you have, when our combined ratio is higher in that first term. And so we had that coming at us, and then we had CATs. This year, we have, on our CR, 3 points of our combined ratio are in the form of CATs, which is compared to this time last year, about 1.5%. In fact, last month, with the Louisiana storms, it was over 4 points of our CR. So you can't plan for CATs. Believe me, I'm watching Matthew closely, you can't plan for CATs. What you can plan for is how you react to those CATs. I am extraordinarily pleased with how we have reacted, specifically to the Louisiana 
[Audio Gap] 
So about 3 weeks ago, a group of us flew down and spent some time in Lafayette and Baton Rouge, Louisiana, to make sure our employees were okay, our customers were okay, and I was just amazed. I was amazed that our CAT team, who went down there and just made sure, they took it upon themselves to get our customers back on their feet. We literally had employees who were laying in bed, and they found out their home was flooded when they put their foot in water. Yet they came to work that day to help our customers. In fact, as of yesterday, we have closed 96% of those flood claims, which is really amazing because they're complex claims, mostly total losses. So again, I'm so amazed that what we were able to do and what we're able to do. And you know what, we are ready, with whatever happens with Matthew. As of today, we have a plan, and we'll figure it out. That's what we do.
So for me, again, just to wrap up in that part, profit and growth, very happy, very proud, especially with how we've been increasing our preferred business, the Robinsons, and we're going to talk a lot about that today.
I thought I'd take just a stab at some of the financial fundamentals. So it won't change. I think they work with our business plan. We want to continue to balance operating risk with the risk of investing in financing activities, in order to have sufficient capital to support our growth. So that's the overview. On the operating side, we want to maintain pricing and reserving discipline. So when we talk about our pricing, we talk about managing targets. We talk about targets at the lowest definition. So whether it's on the agency and direct side, product, state, we really segment our targets. And that's another reason why I'm so positive about this new business because we look at the new business coming in and say, ""Is it at or below targets? Great, that's going to run off profitably."" So we're excited about that.
We want to have premium to surplus at or below state minimum requirement. So on auto, that's a 3:1 and about half of that for home. And on the loss reserving side, we want to make sure our loss reserves are adequate and developed with the minimal variance. Year-to-date, very proud of that. We are pretty close, but a little bit on the favorable side, which is the side you want to be on. On investing side, we want to maintain a liquid, diversified and high-quality portfolio. We manage our investments on a total return basis, which is very consistent with how we report our comprehensive income. And on the risk side, we want to manage interest rate, credit, prepayment, concentration and extension risk. Lastly, on the financing side, we want to maintain sufficient capital to support the insurance operations. That's measured by maintaining a debt below 30% of total capital of book value. So we're just slightly over 28% right now, and that's after issuing $500 million worth of debt in August. We want to neutralize dilution from equity-based compensation in the year of issuance, and we do that by repurchasing shares. And finally, we will invest in capital in expanding the business when it meets our objectives. A perfect example of this is our acquisition of ARX. We didn't necessarily feel like we had to have a homeowners company. What we felt is we had to have access to that addressable market. That is a $300 billion market with auto and home. We needed to have access, and it just so happened that we had been working with a company that we had a high amount of respect for, that had a very similar culture and so was a perfect relationship to start. So we're very pleased with our use of capital in acquiring ARX. Any use of underleveraged capital, we will buy back shares or issue dividends, whether special or variable.
So let's get to the 96, since we are slightly over at this point, I want to walk you through kind of how we look at it. This is just a basic refresher. So everybody gets to a 96, all of our customers at some point get there, but sometimes in vastly different ways. On the direct side, you can see we run a much higher combined ratio in that first term. That's based on the fact that we have a little higher loss cost and some underwriting cost, but most of all, we front-load all of our acquisitions cost on the direct side in that first term.
On the agent side, we have a little bit more losses, a little bit more underwriting, but it's a relatively fixed commission expense, so much lower in the first term. So let me take you through on the direct side, 2 ends of the spectrum. You have Sam and the Robinsons. So you can see the same dynamic. They both rendered a loss in the first term. But what is not evident in our monthly reporting or even our quarterly reporting is the fact that this very high-retaining business, the Robinsons, who stay 3x, actually, more than 3x longer than the Sams, are expanding our invisible balance sheet. So bringing on more of those Robinsons really build the intrinsic value of Progressive.
Here's a basic income statement, and it's directionally accurate. So if we look at again, the Sam and Robinsons, you look at revenue. Clearly, the Robinsons are higher, based on the fact that they stay longer and they have higher average written premium. If you look at the operating expenses, which, of course, are losses, LAE and expense ratio, you quickly notice that neither of these equal a 96. Those numbers represent the nominal value of the cash flow, so they're under a 96. Our lifetime target, 96 combined ratio. For our direct business, we discount the cash flows to recover our acquisition expenses. So that will be different in different segments depending on how long they stay. The difference between those, of course, is our underwriting income. And then there's other income that we have, both on the investment side for both Sam and Robinsons, and the commissions side for just the Robinsons. So whether it's affiliated partner, like ASI, or other unaffiliated homeowners carriers, we get commissions when we have those bundles. So as you can see, the value of a Robinson, a pretax value, is over 4x that of a Sam. Again, we love Sams as long as we can make money on them, but the value of a Robinson is extraordinary, and the fact that we have grown Robinsons substantially in the last 18 months really does grow the value, the intrinsic value, of Progressive.
So for years, we have shared with you the invisible balance sheet. We talked last year about unearned lifetime earned premium. So when we think about business coming on board, we look at new apps, for example. So in this year, for Wrights and Robinsons, we've grown new apps 30% and 40%, respectively. That's pretty great. We look at average written premium. Our average written premium has come up across all segments. And then we look at PLE. This is kind of going to be a spoiler alert for Andrew's section, but we finally have made a breakthrough on retention and PLE. So to us, those 3 things are really exciting. So we thought we'd share with you one other metric that we look at internally, that we call ULUP, unearned lifetime underwriting profit. So you'll see that the colors represent a segment, so green for the Robinsons, pink for the Wrights, et cetera. On the Y axis, you see ULUP in millions, and on the X axis, you'll see the time frame with which we are looking out. So right when we started to grow, right around March of last year, to our most recent data point. As you can see, the majority of our segments are growing substantially in ULUP, which, again, is building that intrinsic value. In fact, the Robinsons are growing over 60%.
The chart underneath shows all of the segments' year-over-year growth in ULUP, and again, all are growing, but you can see the Robinsons are growing at a really quick clip. That's exciting for us.
I'm going to shift gears now and talk about how important understanding the Destination Era is to the 30,000 Progressive people that work on getting our customers in the door and making sure we nurture them along the way. We look at it in terms of different frameworks. This is a framework we use called our strategic pillars. So let me talk about the first one, our culture. Our culture is so important, and it's not something you can really adequately describe unless you've spent time at Progressive. It's not something you're going to see on a spreadsheet. But it is really special, and it's really different, and we know it's a competitive advantage. It's really at the root of what I started to talk about, and that is doing the right thing. And we want to win, but you always want to do the right thing, and it's really rooted in our core values. I have the privilege to speak at every new hire class, actually, it was that one Monday, with a couple hundred new claims reps, and my sole topic is our core values. I talk about 15 or 20 minutes, use some examples and then let them ask questions. It's so important to me for them on their first day or their first week or their second week to know what an important part that is of Progressive, our values.
Earlier this year, many of us went out to celebrate a milestone at Progressive, $20 billion in earned premium. And we got out face-to-face with over half of our employees, over 15,000 people, just to celebrate and say thank you for all that you do, and then of course talk about the next milestone and the next milestone, and it was really rewarding, and that again is a big part of our culture.
Our brand. We want to be the brand people want. So whether it's awareness or preference or consideration, those things are important, but what we really want is to be able to, when people buy an insurance product from Progressive, that they feel confident that they've made a right decision and continue to feel confident as we service them and add more and more policies. We want to spend money on consumer marketing and customer marketing. We've talked often about how we want to have our customer marketing be as savvy as our consumer marketing. Andrew Quigg is going to talk a little bit about that today, but we continue to resource that, as it is an important part of nurturing our customers.
Competitive prices. In a business with small margins, this is very important to us, and it's really all around segmentation. You're going to hear a lot about that today. So John Sauerland is going to talk about our continued evolution with UBI and our segmentation, and how important that variable is. Pat Callahan is going to talk about segmentation and the product models that we continue to elevate as well as our bundled competitiveness. Andrew Quigg will talk about segmentation on the customer part and using data to get out in front of our customers to know what they need, when they need them. So this is a really important part of our -- really central to things that we do, is segmentation. We'll continue to hone in on that.
Another part about competitive prices is really having a competitive loss structure. So on the claim side, we continue to have -- try to have that near-perfect balance of cost and quality, so pushing down LAE, while pushing up accuracy, and we're doing a fantastic job. On the expense side, we look at what we call non-acquisition expense ratio. So we continue to try to push that down, be more efficient and then give that pricing advantage to our customers in the form of competitive prices.
And the last pillar is meeting the broader needs of our customers: What products do they want, when do they want it, how do they want to shop. We want to make sure we can have personalized service and products for each of our customers. So if you want to buy through an agent, get service online or through a chat, we want to make sure if it fits your needs, we are there for you. We want to pick up the phone and say, ""Yes, we can do that, absolutely."" And whether or not we do that through our own products or on affiliated products, we want to make sure we meet the needs of our customers.
We use this framework for how we're going to grow the business: Acquire, anchor, bundle and extend. We see growth in 3 ways: one, selling products to new customers; two, selling additional products to our current customers as the need arises; and three, keeping our customers longer. Let me start with acquire. Acquire is that initial relationship with us. So whether you come in through a special lines product or an auto product, we're just getting to know you. And in fact, we are pivoting the company and trying to be less about policies and more about customers and households. We're currently in 1 in 10 households in the United States, and we would like to double that in short order. And so we're doing that through acquiring more and more customers and understanding their needs and then evolving as their needs evolve.
Anchor. Our anchor products are our auto and our home. If you trust us with those assets, we believe that our relationship is much deeper. I started today talking about the opportunity, the $300 billion, almost $300 billion opportunity in auto and home. Now that we have access to that and have more and more customers coming in either at home or auto, we know we can deepen that relationship. It's such an important piece of future Robinsons.
Bundle, that's what we're going to talk about today. Our bundle are our Robinsons, our auto and home together, and just even a little bit of increased market share on the bundle part really has a big impact to the bottom line.
Lastly, extend. We have been talking about retention for some time, and we have made a significant breakthrough. Last year, if you recall, I announced that I asked Andrew Quigg to lead a team of people to try to increase our retention by 50%. He's going to talk about that today, but we're extraordinarily happy with our results.
For me, extend isn't about talking any longer about customers who stay 1 month or even 1 year. It's about having customers for decades. In fact, 1 out of 6 of our customers after the first renewal are decade customers. So we're pretty pleased with that. About 1 month or so ago, some of us went out to observe some focus groups of our customers. So we listened to Dianes with renters, Dianes without renters to try to get some insight. We went out to Minneapolis and Dallas, and we listened to some decade customers. And they came because they love the brand and they love the price, so that made sense. They had stayed because over that decade or more that they'd been with us, they'd had some sort of service, whether they'd had a claim or they need to call in to change a vehicle or deductible, and they were extraordinarily happy with the service. But what we heard from both of the decade customer groups was something I think really insightful. People said, ""Why are you going to stay?"" ""Even if rates go up, will you stay?"" Yes, because I'm proud to be a Progressive customer."" And that really hit us. And we heard that over and over again, and so we're working on bottling that feeling and having it happen earlier in someone's tenure, have them feel that pride year 3, year 4, so we can continue to extend that and increase our decade customers. And in fact, we're looking at different metrics. At some point, we'll continue to have policy life expectancies, but why wouldn't we have customer life expectancies? So that's where we'll evolve as our customers evolve.
Ultimately, our goal, our vision, is to become consumers' #1 choice and destination for auto and other insurance. The next 4 speakers are going to talk about how we're going to do that on both the auto side, and John Barbagallo will talk about how he's going to do that on the commercial side.
So now I'd like to start and invite our Personal Lines President, Pat Callahan, up to talk about agency growth, our product and our bundled competitiveness."

So last year, when we talked, I laid out 3 key strategic priorities for our Personal Lines business. And those are: Restoring growth in agency, increasing our bundled penetration and ultimately, and then advancing our product development c",4875,"Thanks, Tricia. So last year, when we talked, I laid out 3 key strategic priorities for our Personal Lines business. And those are: Restoring growth in agency, increasing our bundled penetration and ultimately, and then advancing our product development cycle. I want to give you updates on all 3. And what we'll do is start with an overview of the market from an overall channel and market size perspective.
As Tricia mentioned, U.S. personal auto and home is rapidly approaching a $300 billion market. And when you look at the independent agency share of that, it's a little more than 1/3, or about $100 billion of home and auto premium. And despite the fact that technology adoption has been rapidly increasing the growth rate for direct distribution of Personal Lines products, the independent agency channel continues to grow premium. And that's due in part to broad distribution of their footprint, but also a great value proposition from a breadth of products offered and depth of carrier choice available. When you look more specifically at the homeowners market in the U.S., it's about a $90 billion market, and that's about 90% sold through agents, more than 40% through independent agents. And as the #1 writer of auto insurance through the independent agency channel, we believe we're incredibly well-positioned to leverage our strength in the channel, combined with ASI's property offerings, to become the #1 writer of auto and home insurance through the agency channel.
Last year, I told you that restoring growth in agency was a top priority for myself and lots of other folks within our Personal Lines organization. So today, I'm thrilled to show you some information that after our business shrunk slightly into 2014 and barely recovered into 2015, we've turned that agency business around from a size perspective. And at this point, our agency auto business, as well as ASI's homeowner business through independent agents, have both never before been larger. And if we zoom in on what's driving that auto improvement, we look primarily to start with at new business apps. New business growth is the lifeline or lifeblood of a growing organization like Progressive. And as you see on the screen, midway through 2015, we turned new business positive on a year-over-year basis within the agency channel. Our new business growth continues to be up in the double digits on a year-over-year basis ever since.
New business growth originates from 2 primary metrics. The first is demand, so quoting. The second is conversion. And our improvements in the agency channel are driven just about by equal parts of both, which indicate to us: number one, we have a more competitive product in market; but number two, that more competitive product is inducing agents to come to us more frequently to meet the needs of their clients. An absolutely fantastic combination within the channel.
But to understand how competitive we are overall in the channel, the best benchmark that we can use is how well we're converting on comparative raters. So last year, I shared with you that the majority of our agency quotes start on a comparative rating platform. And just to level-set, comparative rating software, desktop applications in agent's offices, that run a real-time, risk-by-risk auction amongst all the carriers that participate within that agent's office. And you'll notice that similar to what we saw from a new apps perspective, we're seeing increasing new business from a conversion perspective on comparative raters. Turned positive around the same time that we saw new business apps turn overall, and continues to be up solidly in the double digits.
The exciting part about this for us, though, is competitive rates absolutely matter. But competitive rates are not sufficient to drive conversion in the agency channel. Because of the plethora of choices that agents have, you also have to have competitive service, competitive ease-of-use and ultimately, competitive compensation. So we believe comparative rater conversion is a fantastic benchmark for us to truly understand how competitive we are overall in the agency marketplace.
Last year at this time, I also shared that we had just introduced 8.3, our latest auto product model. And while the early results were encouraging, we were in a couple of states and we were seeing significant growth overall from the product model. At this point, about 18 months later, I'm thrilled to share that, that growth continues to come in at expected levels, but it's highly concentrated on the more preferred end of the spectrum. So our growth rates with Wrights and with Robinsons are significantly higher than they are in our other segments. These segments are absolutely foundational to how we win in the Destination Era, and our product design and product development is helping us get there.
But we all know that Progressive is known for new business acquisition. We do a great job. We probably do the best job in the industry. But the reality of it is, sustainable premium growth doesn't just come from acquiring new customers. We have to retain them. And I'm pleased to show that when we look at retention from the agency channel, we see after a dip in early 2015 through about the middle of the year, we've been increasing our agency policy life expectancy month-on-month ever since. And Andrew will talk a little bit more about more details around decomposing that, but the drivers of that are twofold: number one, it's mix, so our mix of new customers has improved. We refer to that as nature. But equal parts of improvement in our PLE are coming from experience improvements and relationships within our customer relationship management organization. Those investments are paying off, and Andrew will tell you a little bit more about that later.
What's particularly exciting to me though, when I look at our retention improvements, is to overlay our rate activity during the same period of time. So your orange bars are annualized rate change within the agency channel for each month during that same period. What you'll notice is during the period of time that our retention was improving, we were raising rates, somewhere between 2%, 2.5% to 4%. And we do that to keep up with trend and ensure we continue to deliver our target margins. But the combination of being able to improve retention while also increasing rates indicates to us 2 things: number one, market conditions are fantastic for growth in the agency channel and we are really, really well-positioned; but number two, given the plethora of choices that agents have to move business to, when rates go up, the fact that our rate increases are sticking indicates to us we've got stronger relationships that are forming in the agency channel, and that's a critical element of our long-term destination success.
Insurance is a trust-based business. And trust is a really difficult thing for us to measure, unlike many of our other metrics. But we look at actions as opposed to words to understand how we're performing from a trust perspective. Number one, are agents trusting us by placing their better customers with us? The answer is yes. Number two, are they trusting us to interact with those customers on a regular basis? The answer is yes. More agents are opting in to our joint marketing programs for additional protection, quote resolicitation, et cetera. And number three, in a recent survey of thousands of independent agents, they responded that increasingly, Progressive has all the products to meet the needs of their preferred customers and more of those agents responded that they're placing their preferred customers with us. The turnaround in the agency channel was driven by a combination of product and stronger relationship building. And we fully expect that the momentum we've established to date with this turnaround will carry into our second priority, which is bundled penetration.
Growing bundled penetration is the key performance indicator of our Destination Era. Making progress, selling both home and auto to our combined customers is essential to our long-term success. And the things you need to drive bundled penetration are: number one, available and competitive property insurance; number two, available and competitive preferred auto rates; and number three, the systems, tools and experiences that enable customers and agents to find, quote, buy and ultimately own a Progressive policy or a Progressive bundle. We'll stay with the agency channel for now and talk about where we're headed from a bundled penetration perspective.
Last year, I shared that we were in the process of deploying ASI's property product country-wide. Since we last talked, we've added 9 states, and by the end of this year, we'll be in 39 states, representing about 95% of U.S. homeowners, great coverage for where we are in the rollout. We go to market from an agency perspective with our property product through 2 tiers of agencies. Those 2 tiers of agencies are Progressive Advantage agencies, Progressive Home Advantage agencies and our Platinum agencies. The 2 tiers, Progressive Home Advantage a little more broadly distributed, they are our original property agencies. And Platinum is a much higher tier, more highly selective tier of agents and a much stronger partnership with us. I shared with you last year that Platinum is a brand-new program that we're introducing last summer that combined consumer benefits of annual policies, more competitive rates through multi-policy discounts and agent benefits, such as easier-to-use systems and higher compensation. We continue to deploy the Platinum program as well. Platinum, by the end of this year, will be in 34 states, which represent about 80% of U.S. homeowners. And because preferred auto and property availability are prereqs to the Platinum rollout, Platinum will always trail the rollout of our property product. But overall, we intend to continue pushing on a country-wide basis until we have full deployment of preferred auto, available property and Platinum on a national basis.
But with Platinum, it's less about the states that we're in and much more about the agencies that we're in within those states. So over the last year, we've identified, selected and ultimately, onboarded more than 1,000 agencies into our Platinum program. Based on those agencies, access to preferred customers, their bundled quote and sale processes within the agency and their willingness to commit to placing a significant portion of their bundled volume with Progressive. But to be clear, Platinum rollout will be a metered rollout. Platinum has a scarcity and a scarcely distributed offering. So agents will be actively managed by our sales reps to ensure they're using the Platinum program and understand it and are using it for bundled business within their agency. So we will continue to grow Platinum, but we will grow Platinum as agents are using it effectively in market.
I also shared last year that because ease-of-use for bundled quoting is a key element of our Platinum offering, we were starting to build a new Platinum quoting program. And earlier this year, we launched Platinum quoting which brings to the agent's desktop for the first time, bundled quoting of Progressive's auto and ASI's home, which enables the agent to ultimately save time, share data entry screens and external data fill and have more competitive messaging around the bundled economics available to the agent and making it easier for them to message those bundled savings to the customer. Now to be clear, this is a pilot. It's in 3 states today. We've learned a bunch to date, we'll continue to learn from the pilot, and ultimately, we'll build those enhancements into our quoting systems over time.
But the billion-dollar question on all of our minds, and likely all of your minds is, is Platinum working? We've attacked the preferred market in agency a few times before, and we've learned from those attacks. We've learned from those opportunities that ultimately, for us to introduce a brand-new preferred offering into some of the best agencies in an incredibly competitive independent agency channel, we would have to change agent behavior, which we all know isn't simple, and frankly, it sometimes takes time. So to understand whether Platinum is working, we look at the 2015 cohort of Platinum agents, those that were appointed as Platinum agents during 2015. Think of it as the Class of 2015, if you will. And we look at 2 key performance metrics for that group of agencies relative to the rest of our property insurance agencies. What you'll see on your screen is 2 lines, the blue line is our Platinum agencies, the orange line is our PHA agencies. And the metric here is preferred auto production. What you'll notice between those lines is, number one, the blue line starts above the orange line. Not surprisingly, more productive agencies were selected to be Platinum in the first place. But you'll notice that after the vertical red line, there's an increasing separation from a production perspective between our Platinum agencies and our non-Platinum other property agencies.
This continues into our second key performance metric, and that's new business home and auto bundles, where you'll see exactly the same pattern. Blue, Platinum agents, started above our PHA agencies, and the gap continues to widen. As our sales reps message the benefits of Platinum, our agents better understand the benefits of Platinum and for their customers, they start to experience some of the benefits that come from buying through a Platinum agency. The gap between that blue and orange line is what we refer to as the Platinum difference. And that Platinum difference is not just present with the agents we appointed during 2015. If you look at the entire network of more than 1,000 Platinum agencies compared to our non-Platinum property agencies, you'll see that our Platinum agency plant is responsible for creating more than 3x the number of bundles per agent, per week than our non-Platinum agencies, which absolutely tells us that Platinum is working.
What you'll also notice on this graph, though, is the trend is upward, meaning we're improving over time. Numbers bounce around from month-to-month, but we are on an upward trend. And the guideline on the screen indicates where we expect the program to be ultimately from a success perspective. You'll notice we're not there. And that gap exists, but we know what we're going to do to close that gap. The primary driver of it is our bundled competitiveness.
Well, not surprisingly, when we were launching our program, we started collecting data from the market as to where we were competitive and were not competitive. And the great thing is with 1,000 agencies, using their quoting systems to quote ASI property and Progressive auto, we are getting a ton of data on where we are and where we are not competitive. We use conversion as our primary metric, and when you look at states that represent about 1/3 of our premium, we are highly competitive on the monoline auto, the monoline home and on the bundle for an individual risk. In those agencies, our focus is to sell what the customer is looking for. If they're looking for home, sell them home; if they're looking for auto, sell them auto, or try to sell them the bundle, because we are highly competitive.
However, in about 2/3 of the country right now, we are highly competitive on monoline home or monoline auto, but not yet as competitive on the bundle for individual risks. This shouldn't come as much surprise given we had a highly successful monoline auto business that we combined with a highly successful monoline home business. And the overlap between the 2 isn't quite where we need it to be. But the bottom line is we know exactly what needs to be done, and we're collecting a ton of data that enables us to map out how to integrate our products more closely to make sure that we're more competitive at the individual risk on a country-wide basis.
So for us, the momentum that we saw as we were bringing our agency turnaround ultimately into bundled competitiveness, combined with the infrastructure investments we continue to make in the agency channel and early success of what we're seeing from a Platinum perspective, gives us a ton of confidence that we are absolutely on the right track from a bundled penetration perspective and very, very well-positioned to attack that $100 billion independent agency home and auto opportunity.
With that said, we have another highly successful auto distribution channel and that's direct. So I want to update you on where we are from a bundled competitiveness perspective within the direct channel. To be a direct customer's destination for auto and other insurance, we not only have to have all the products they need throughout their lifetime, but they have to be aware of them and understand that we have them available before they have a life event that triggers demand for that product. So they come to us first as opposed to shopping in market. We generate awareness for our products with our direct customers 3 primary ways: Mass media advertising, it reaches not only our current customers but also reaches future customers; point-of-sale messaging, and this is both in our sale systems as well as our servicing systems, so both current customers and potential customers who visit to get a quote understand the breadth of products available and the economic benefits of buying through us; and finally, targeted marketing. We have a ton of monoline customers that we are now offering the bundled package and the complementary product through messaging the savings and ease-of-use benefits of bringing more of those products to Progressive over time.
These awareness investments, coupled with a general shift in consumer buying trends towards direct and some internal messaging that gets our employees thinking holistically about protecting our customers' household needs, continues to drive up demand for direct property insurance, both online, on the phones, with current customers and with future customers. But great demand and increase in demand for our direct property products creates no value unless we can meet that demand with adequate supply. And frankly, in early 2015, our ability to meet the demand for direct property was less than we wanted it to be.
Only about 4 in 5 customers coming to us for direct property could even get a quote. Part of that is just endemic with the property insurance business. Unlike Progressive, there's virtually no property writers who have similar broad acceptability. Property writers have a relatively niche focus and some may not accept 20%, 30%, 40% of available risks.
That's an unacceptable outcome for our direct customers. So what we've done over time is worked, number one, with our carrier partners to expand acceptability and improve routing of traffic online and through our partner call centers to improve availability of direct quoting. But what's particularly exciting on this chart is the yellow line. The yellow line represents our Progressive Advantage Agency, which is our in-house agency that sells multiple products from a property perspective across multiple property partners.
Over the last 1.5 years, we've made significant investments to expand the footprint of that agency by adding 14 states and adding more than 100 state and carrier combinations in order to drive up availability of this, of our property products. At this point, we can meet the needs of about 95% of current or future customers who contact our agency. And we believe that agency model is a superior shopping experience for anyone shopping direct-to-consumer property insurance, because it combines the technology enabled ease-of-use of a direct writer with the breadth and depth of an independent agency. We believe strongly in that model and we continue to invest to expand capabilities within our Progressive Advantage Agency.
In the last 18 months, we more than doubled staffing and when calls come in, we route an increased percentage of those to the agency, to the point that at this point, we've more than tripled the sales over the last 18 months through the agency. We will continue to invest in that space and continue to use this superior business model to delight our direct customers from a bundled penetration perspective. But for us, bundling is not just about home and auto. It's also about home -- renters and auto. So in our world, we enjoy an advantaged position with younger, simpler needs, auto insurance customers, many of whom don't yet own a home. So having renters insurance available for those customers enables us, number one, to establish a property insurance relationship with customers and to be able to meet a broader need of those customers earlier in their insurance shopping journey. Renters insurance will never be a massive business for us. It's only about a $4 billion market. But for us, it is a strategic investment, because renters insurance is absolutely a gateway property product towards becoming a bundled home and auto customer with us. We have evidence that those who bundle renters and auto with us are significantly more likely to keep their auto with us and convert that renters to a homeowners policy if and when they eventually buy a home. So from a graduating Diane perspective, this is a strategic play for us and one we continue to invest in over time.
We are absolutely thrilled with the acceleration of our penetration from a bundling perspective within our direct book of business. Today, more than 1 million direct customers trust us to provide property protection. And the key performance metrics for our direct property business, increasing quote starts, bundled new apps and bundled PIFs, are all up more than 20% on a year-over-year basis. And with the investments we continue to make to drive demand and then meet that demand with ample supply and great experiences, we have every confidence we will continue to accelerate bundled penetration within the direct book of business.
The third priority that I shared with you last year was to continue to advance our science of risk segmentation. Customer segmentation, matching rate to risk and pricing accuracy are in our DNA and absolutely a key source of competitive advantage for Progressive. It's been that way for decades and one of the things that truly differentiates and distinguishes our offering. As we look to invest in rate accuracy and pricing segmentation, we recognize that the value it creates, through more competitive new business pricing, which lowers our customer acquisition costs on a fixed advertising base, it increases our retention even if customers shop, they can't replace similar coverage at a similar or lower price and it creates adverse selection within the marketplace, a fantastic trifecta of opportunity for Progressive. So when we think about the product development space, we focus on 3 areas, the first is rate accuracy, the second is coverages and the third is improving customer experience to drive policy life expectancy. We build bundles of these enhancements in the product model and deploy them like building blocks, stacked on top of all of the segmentation that existed in the prior model.
Our pipeline from a road map perspective is absolutely robust from a product development standpoint. We're currently on 8.3 in the majority of our states. 8.3 was designed to be more competitive on preferred households and multiproduct customers. You've already heard how that's performing in market. We are thrilled with how it's working.
84 is deploying currently. Tomorrow morning, it'll be our seventh state elevating for 84 and 84 brings with it more stable rates for our renewal customers as well as advanced segmentation based on billing, claims experience and vehicle history. 845 is 84 with some additional protection for transportation network company drivers, Progressive customers who happen to work for an Uber or Lyft. And finally, 85, which is under development right now and will launch in early 2018, will bring with it much more competitive rates for households with usefuls as well as -- well, I'm not going to tell you what else is in 85, you're going to have to come back next year to learn more about that. But rest assured, we are not taking our foot off the accelerator from the product development perspective and intend to continue to lead from the segmentation perspective. But the best segmentation in the world creates no value if we can't get it to market quickly. And while we've always been known for our nimbleness and ability to deploy our products to market quickly, we recognize from a core value perspective that excellence is doing things better today than we did yesterday and we continue to invest to advance our speed to market. So in the last 24 months, there's been a joint research and development and IT team, reengineering our process of product development and product deployment. And since we last talked in May, they've been able to double the annualized rate with which we can deploy our product innovation into the marketplace. So what that means is when we talked in May, we had 3 states on 8.3. Today, we have 32 states. As of tomorrow, we'll have 7 states on 84. When we talk next year, we'll have 38 states on 84 and 85 will be spun up just about to hit the market. This lethal combination of product innovation and speed to market enables us to widen our lead over the competition. And when we look to assess how well we're doing relative to the competition, we start by looking at some industry data. The industry data you're seeing on the screen is loss in LAE for PCI, essentially about 2/3 of the market, 9 of the Top 10 carriers in the orange line, and then Progressive in the blue line. What you'll notice is that environmental activities, be it economic recovery, gas prices, severity on low price in the cars due to safety equipment, trend in the industry has been climbing since the middle of 2012. But you'll also notice that the blue line, the progressive loss in LAE, we've been competing in that exact same environment, and the reality of it is our results have been rock solid. The difference between these 2 lines is product segmentation. It's our ability to better understand what risks we're insuring and better sort out which ones are high cost from low cost. What that means in the marketplace is those in the orange line, the rest of the market, as their loss costs are climbing and they don't know which risks are driving those loss costs up, they raise base rates. And when they raise base rates, the best customers in their book of business shop and they can often find a lower price with companies like us that are better segmented. Run this cycle over and over enough times and they're left with residual risks that they're still underpriced on and priced dramatically higher than the market on any of the better risks that we insure. What it also means, though, for us is today, we enjoy about a 10-point gap in loss in LAE relative to the market and when you combine that with our technology-enabled expense gap, specifically in the agency channel, what it enables us to do is combine incredibly competitive pricing in market, which drives the growth of the business, with wider underwriting profit margins than the overall industry, delivering on our profit targets. A great combination for an insurance business.
Now I also told you last year that emerging data sources were an opportunity as opposed to a threat for Progressive. And since making our majority investments in ASI or ARX, we've been building a massive data set of home and auto risk characteristics and home and auto loss characteristics. What this has enabled us to do is improve model accuracy, identify new segmentation and reduce our rating costs. An early example of how we're leveraging this data set was an auto rating variable that was highly predictive of home loss frequency, to the tune of about a 30% difference in pure premium. As we identified that, ASI quickly jumped on it and deployed it to market. So it's providing a segmentation list as a bundled household that they wouldn't normally have had absent the joining of this data. And to be frank, we are just getting started digging into this massive data set and fully expect that the joint R&D team between ASI and Progressive will leverage this treasure trove of information to identify new ways to assess and ultimately price and improve rate accuracy for our household bundled pricing.
So last year, I shared with you some fairly aggressive goals for our overall business. With the turnaround in our agency business as well as great performance from our direct business, coupled with the investments we're making to increase bundled penetration across both our direct and our agency business, our robust product development pipeline of future segmentation enhancements and the faster speed to market on top of already leading the industry, I am absolutely confident that we are incredibly well-positioned to become consumers' #1 choice and destination for auto and other insurance.
With that, I'll bring John Sauerland on to talk about Snapshot and data management."

It's been a while since we gave you a deep dive on Snapshot, our usage-based rating program. We have a new model in the marketplace, I'll share results around that, but also share more holistically why Snapshot is so powerful for Progressive.
Later this year, we will roll out a new delivery mechanism to experience for Snapshot and that is via mobile. I'll share the rollout plans there, we're very excited by that, but I'll also share what our expected benefits from that rollout are. But overarching all of this is something that I think is even more powerful than Snapshot, sort of an ancillary benefit from Snapshot, if you will, and that is the big data management and analysis capabilities that we've developed around Snapshot that are now paying dividends across the organization and I believe can be a source of competitive advantage going forward.
If you're familiar with Progressive, you know that we have a history of innovation. I would say that Snapshot is as a result of that history of innovation. We started out many years ago installing this football-size device in the trunks of some cars in Texas, proved out the concept a little bit. We enjoyed the benefits of Moore's law, shrinking of technology. I mean, we're able to get the technology into a device that could plug into an OBD port on a vehicle. Unfortunately, back then, connectivity was an issue. We mailed this device to our customers, along with a cord that we asked them to go find. Six months after plugging the device in their car, plug that cord in the device, into their desktop, more than likely back then, by the way, and more than likely try and upload via their dial-up modem. Obviously, not a big hit. What was a big hit was when we were able to get the technology and especially the cell chip small enough and the cell transmission costs low enough so that we had virtually real-time transmission of the data. In today's world, we sort of call that the Internet of Things. Back then, it was just via cell towers.
Soon, we're going to be moving to mobile. I will talk more about that in a bit, so I won't spend time here now. The ultimate model for Snapshot is not via device, not via your phone, it's directly from the vehicle. Really happy to say we're actually in market today with that model with General Motors. General Motors is the only car manufacturer, to my knowledge, with that capability today. As you all know, technology takes a long time to move into the fleet. This won't be a broad-based model soon. But nevertheless, we're excited to be in partnership with GM, in market, and I'll share a bit more about that in a moment.
If Moore's law allows you to shrink technology, I believe, there's got to be a corollary to Moore's law that says that data coming out of that technology doubles every 2 years or even every 1 year. We now have 2.2 trillion records in our database from Snapshot, 2.2 trillion records. If you think about those records as rows on a spreadsheet, those rows are widening. The blue area on the chart here is GPS data. While we don't today rate on GPS, we are collecting it for research purposes and it widens the data field, if you will. When we introduce mobile, we'll be collecting even more information. Mobile will take that width of that record 20-fold from where it is today. The data explosion here is incredible. It's been a challenge, it's also a huge opportunity. We'll talk more about that in a moment.
But let me take a step back first and make sure I have everyone grounded in Snapshot. We have 2 models in the marketplace today. We're not great with naming, it was the 2.0 model and the 3.0 model. The 3.0 model has rolled out with 8.3. So in the majority of the country today, as Pat Callahan just mentioned to you, in the 2.0 model, we didn't give you a discount when you opted into Snapshot. You came to Progressive or an agent, agreed to the Snapshot program, 30 days later, we give you a discount based on your 30 days of driving behavior. Drive for 5 months more, we lock you in for the rest of your tenure with Progressive. 3.0, we offer a participation discount. It varies by customer segment, we'll talk about that in a moment, then you drive for 6 months. Here again, we lock you in to your discount or a surcharge. So that's a big change with the 3.0 model. With 2.0, we're very concerned about establishing consumer acceptance for the concept because we have been the leader in UBI. We've gotten consumer acceptance, we're in a place now where consumers are willing to opt-in to the program, as you'll see, even if there's a chance for a surcharge. So in the 2.0 model, we had up to a 30% discount, 0% surcharge. In the 3.0 model, we have up to a 20% discount and up to a 10% surcharge. So similar range, very different model. In 2.0, about 60% of our customers who partook, got a discount. In 3.0, about 75% of our customers get a discount and in 3.0, more than half of our customers received more than a 10% discount, which is pretty material in the auto insurance space. So giving you perspective on the different models, keep that in mind as we talk about results. And I'll also give you a little bit more perspective on the distribution of our customers' driving behavior. The results. They're good. New apps are up, I can't attribute all of this to Snapshot, however. As I mentioned, the 3.0 model rolled out at the same time as 8.3, we made a lot of changes here, we can't tease it out completely. But new apps are up, and this is just Snapshot apps on the graph in front of you. One of the things I hope you will notice is that agency apps are up more. We've been challenged around agency adoption of Snapshot for many years now, frankly. The inclusion of an upfront discount, a participation discount, helps us a lot in the agency channel. As Pat told you, it's largely driven by comparative raters, somewhat of an auction environment, the more we can get a more competitive rate up there at new business, the better chance we have of getting customers into Snapshot.
I mentioned those discounts, the participation discounts vary by customer set. Ranges from about 2 percentage for Sams, up to about 6-ish percent for Robinsons. We define that participation discount not based solely on the customer marketing target there, but that's the average of the discount for each respective segment. Not surprisingly, conversion is up more on the preferred end of the spectrum. Even with 2.0, Snapshot customers converted at a higher rate than non-Snapshot customers. So being interested in Snapshot improves your conversion rate, all else equal. And in 3.0, we obviously see that continuing, but we also see a greater disparity, not surprisingly, on the more preferred end of the spectrum, where the participation discounts are higher. 
When we look at new apps by customer segment, here again, the mix skews a bit towards the preferred end. But what I hope you also notice is that the slope, if you will, of that relationship in the agency business is higher, it's steeper. We're getting more Robinsons into this business, into the Snapshot program. Pat and Tricia told you, the Robinson segment is the largest segment available to us in the Personal Lines space and it's our lowest market share. So to the extent we can get more customers in here, that's fantastic.
Something not necessarily specific to 3.0, but I think representative of where we're at today when it comes to usage-based rating, is the fact that it is broadly acceptable. And I'm just sharing you one example here and this is age. So when you look by customer segment, the percentage of folks 18- to 22-year-old who opt-in to Snapshot is about the same as the percentage of folks who are 55 and above. Not 100% acceptable in the marketplace for sure, but broadly acceptable.
So hopefully, I've convinced you that Snapshot is helping us on preferred, it's helping us grow. I often get the question, and even got it in the lobby before this, is that can you tell me how is it helping? Put numbers to that for me. Some facts. The most powerful rating variable we have ever seen and with 3.0, even more powerful than 2.0. So our analysts are working hard on improving those algorithms. 3.0 even more predictive of losses than 2.0, and 2.0 was way more predictive than any other rating variable we've seen. Another fact. We provided more than a $0.5 billion of discounts to customers with Snapshot inception to-date. More than $0.5 billion worth of discounts. Those folks think, well, that seems to be a benefit for a customer, how is that a benefit for Progressive? To help answer that, I'm going to take you back to a chart that we showed you actually in 2012. This chart shows the loss ratio and the retention rate across discount buckets, if you will, for Snapshot customers. So we have 0% to 30% discount along the horizontal there, and to the left of that 0, we have non-Snapshot customers. So think of those as your base case. So the majority of our customers don't opt-in to Snapshot, so that's a robust base case. And what do we see? This is again 2.0. When a customer got a 0% discount from us, they will actually do a surcharge. But again, we didn't do that for consumer acceptance reasons. The highest loss ratio is for customers with 0 discount. As you see, the loss ratio improves markedly as you go to the right. It's important to look at the scale on this graph. That loss ratio is much better for the best drivers who are receiving the biggest discounts.
When you look at the retention line, the consumers who expected to receive a discount and did not, the 0 percentage, lowest retention. Those customers leave way more frequently and when they leave, where do they go? They go to our competitors. By and large, our competitors are not priced for this. So those customers are going for more than likely a lower rate than we're offering them, so we believe they materially miss price at the competitor.
You go out on the right, not surprisingly, retention improves a lot as you give people bigger discounts, but the big 2 points I want you to take away here is the least profitable customers, and frequently, the unprofitable customers, leave most frequently. The most profitable customers are way more inclined to stay.
In auto insurance, I would tell you, in any business model, if you have a program where your best, most profitable customers are most inclined to stay, and your least profitable or even unprofitable customers find their way to your competitor, that's a great program. Pat Callahan showed you the industry loss ratio graph, Progressive was here, right, the industry on a pretty decent slope up. This isn't the only reason, but this is the kind of segmentation that we believe drives that disparity in the marketplace. So let's look at 3.0. Here, you can see we are not surcharging those customers who are on the worse end. So our loss ratio for those customers goes down. Customers out on the -- more -- better driver end of the spectrum, higher discounts. Again, better loss ratio, not quite as low as with 2.0, but still exceptional. You look at that scale. And when you look at retention, because we're surcharging customers, they leave even more frequently than they did in the previous model, and not surprisingly, consumers we're offering the discount to continue to stay at a much higher rate. So Snapshot is getting us more preferred customers. It is helping rating segmentation, adverse selection a lot. Hope you got those points.
Our next step for Snapshot is mobile. We've been very deliberate in coming to market with mobile. If you think about the challenges in measuring driving behavior with a phone, there are obviously many, right? Some of you take the train, some of you take the bus, you commute with a friend, you leave your phone at home, what have you, a lot of challenges and we wanted to make sure we got this right. We've done a ton of testing. And just to give you an appreciation of those challenges, what you're looking at here is an example of a real test case, so an individual with the app and the device in the car. This is about 2 months of driving, each row represents a day, 24 hours across the horizontal axis of a day, not surprising, and what do we see? So if the blocks are purple, that means the device and your phone are showing a trip, they're matching up. If the block is blue, that means the device is just showing a trip, not the phone. Red the opposite. Red is the phone showing the trip, not the device. So if you stare at this, you say, okay, it looks like we have a commute pattern, right? Five days a week, we drive to work and we drive home. And we take our phones to work and they're on. We don't see that on a commute, right? What else do you see? Well, there's some blue sections, those blue sections look to me like they're more on the weekend, maybe a spouse is driving the car, maybe a kid is driving the car. The red dots in the middle are very intriguing to me. My conclusion, I don't know this test case, is that this person has a regular scheduled Monday lunch date and the buddy drives, to lunch then back, interesting things. But the point is how do we account for this and still have really accurate driving data to rate on. We worked with a ton of app developers, the technology is amazing. The app is able to learn the driver's fingerprint, if you will. And it learns it pretty quickly, I have an app, and I can tell when my child is driving the car, when my spouse is driving the car, it excludes those trips. Thankfully, for my own personal rate. You get the point. How about this, we can look after a trip starts, back to see if the driver got in the left side of the car or the right side of the car. Technology in phones is amazing now. We worked really hard to make sure this is right. Let me give you a picture of the rating reason behind why we've worked so hard to make sure this is right. We worked with a number of different companies developing apps. Hard brakes are our most important rating data field for UBI. So you want your phone to reflect a brake about the same time as you want your device to reflect a brake, right?
The graph on the right shows pretty tight relationship, graph on the left not so much. I'm really happy to tell you that we chose the app on the right. And I'm almost as happy to tell you that we're pretty confident a competitor was using the app on the left. Really important that we got it right. We think we have it right, we'll have 2 states out before the end of the year. We expect to have the rest of the country rolled out in the first half of next year. We think it's a great rating tool. We also know it's going to be a better consumer experience. Today, we mail a lot of devices to customers, not all of them come back, but the customer has to take it, unbox it, put it in their car, extract it from the vehicle, mail it back to us. It's a logistical challenge and it's costly. We've previously told you the technology expenses with our current model is about a point on the P&L. Mobile will completely eliminate technology expenses for sure, but it will materially reduce those costs. As I mentioned to you, the long-term model, we believe, is data right from the vehicle. Again, this won't be a broad-based model anytime soon because of the pace of technology penetrating the fleet. But it's a fantastic model, it's working really well, it's small so far, admittedly. General Motors customers' model year 2015 and greater have this capability, all voluntary. They can opt-in to sharing 90 days of driving behavior with Progressive. If it looks like we'll give that customer a discount, we'll offer them a quote. If it looks like they wouldn't be due a discount, we won't offer them a quote. Think back on that loss ratio curve. The customers we are selling to here have a very high average discount. What was true about the most -- the highest average discount customers in our programs, they're the most profitable, right? So we've got a model here where we can just sell to the most profitable drivers with our current algorithms. It will evolve, we'll probably tailor to the various methods of measurement, but today, it's a great model, we're really excited to be in market with General Motors and we're excited to talk to you more about that in the future.
I told you that the data explosion has been rapid. I told you that it's been a challenge for us, frankly. This graph shifts to terabytes as opposed to trillions of records. Back in 2013, our analysts were struggling because it was taking them almost a month to process the Snapshot data set, almost a month. We literally had analysts trying to create mini server farms in the closets near their workspaces. We got smart, we brought in the right technology, we developed the talent internally, our processing time dropped dramatically, going up a little bit as the data set grows further, but the better news here is that we are now using this technology across other parts of the company. When we were together last year, Pat Callahan told you we were starting to look at claims fraud using big data techniques. We now have that fully rolled out. Every night, we are looking at hundreds of data elements through our claims file, through our policy files and looking for the potential for fraud. We don't identify fraud with this model, we refer it to an individual who does the further investigation and does the right thing handling the claim. We're using traditional data, but we're also using what's called unstructured data, which in this case means text. So claims adjusters are typing in notes into our systems, this mines the text and joins that with other data to look for potential fraud. What you're looking at on the screen here is a network of claims that we had previously identified as fraudulent, run it through the system overnight, the claim in blue pops out, suspect claim. Our adjuster does more investigation: 3 vehicle accident, 6 injuries claimed in this accident. Further investigation revealed the damage on the vehicles did not match the facts as reported by the injured parties, we are able to deny the claim. Previously, our model here has been if it looks suspect, the adjuster refers to an expert. I can't tell you we would have missed this one, but I can tell you, I bet we would have missed this one. And I can tell you, we're looking at a lot more claims much more with a zero in target [ph] sort of approach today than we previously did.
One more example in that arena. We previously had identified a suspect claim, run through the system overnight and we find 1 data element common with 166 other policies in our database. What we had identified here upon further investigation is what we call a street broker. In urban areas, where auto insurance is very expensive, there are enterprising individuals who use our systems to take your information and create an ID card and sell you that ID card for a couple of hundred bucks cash. They generally are using a stolen credit card or another means to buy the policy or immediately cancel the policy. So what we had here was 166 people who were probably not in the right state with their auto insurance, we were able to reach out to those customers and do the right thing and get them into the right place.
Another quick example, you probably know that big data has been in play in the e-marketing, online marketing space for a long time and we've actually enjoyed the benefits of vendor or third-party solutions, optimizing advertising networks online with banner ads, that kind of thing. We are now using this processing power to design the experience. In our direct business, we pay a lot to get a prospect in the door. We do a lot to make sure we streamline that funnel, if you will, get them the quote, get them into the buy process. Historically, we've done really well with that, but we've done it somewhat painstakingly, frankly, because we do A/B tests. We want -- try the orange button versus the blue button, the button over here versus the button over here. But we've done it really, really well. And historically, we did something in this case that we call the coverage packaging tool. We used 7 variables to optimize the experience with the customer and we were able to improve the funnel, the yield, by about 4%. And if 4% doesn't feel like a lot to you, we have a lot of direct prospects. That's about $0.5 billion of lifetime premium. Today, we're using what we call real-time decisioning. We're looking at more than 3x as many variables as we used to. We've been able to improve the yield another 4% and growing and we've been able to do it in about 1/5 of the time.
Tons of opportunities, I could go on with examples. I hope you get the picture. The data space is booming. Even with Snapshot, due to GPS, due to mobile, this curve is going to get steeper. Layer on top of that, that unstructured data we just talked about, the text. In our call centers, we've been translating voice to text for many years now. We're able to mine that as well. Andrew Quigg will talk about that in a moment. We're now starting to ingest images, photos and video. That will soon be, not today yet for us, that will soon be data we mesh with all the other data in our systems as well. We have been a leader in using data and analysis for segmentation, for experience design, to our competitive advantage. I believe the opportunity to do that and differentiate ourselves versus the competition is only going to grow and we expect to lead.
Now I'm going to hand the floor over to Andrew Quigg to talk customer relationship management. And here again, I think you will see similar themes through Andrew's talk."
33352,328425460,1054312,"Progressive Corp., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 06, 2016",2016-10-06,"Earnings Calls","The Progressive Corporation","Executives","Thank you, John. I have the pleasure of speaking to you today on 2 topics. The first half of the section will be on retention, and I'm going to tell you about the improving momentum we see with our retention. And then in the second half of the section, I'",4180,"Thank you, John. I have the pleasure of speaking to you today on 2 topics. The first half of the section will be on retention, and I'm going to tell you about the improving momentum we see with our retention. And then in the second half of the section, I'll provide an overview of our customer marketing initiative and I'll describe the advanced analytics we're applying to this problem, as John Sauerland alluded to.
So first off, I want to just reiterate our preferred retention measure, which is Policy Life Expectancy or PLE. PLE is the average length of time we expect a new policy to stay with Progressive. We calculate PLE by first calculating our retention decay curve, and then we take the area under this curve to get our PLE statistic. That retention decay curve can be calculated multiple ways depending on the trade-off in responsiveness versus stability that we see. Our standard measure is to use 12 months for each point along that curve. That is our trailing 12 PLE that we've always reported out. We also calculate a trailing 3 PLE starting in 2014. That trailing 3 PLE uses 3, the most recent 3 months along that retention decay curve. So it's more responsive to more recent observations. Just some notes on the PLE calculation. The first 60 months represent actual data that we've recently observed and between months 60 and 300, we use an extrapolation. And we've seen all policies end after 300 months, which is a conservative assumption. We think the PLE statistic is accurate for a number of reasons and I'll highlight one of those today. We think it removes any tenure bias. So if we use simple retention rates, as our book of business ages, all else being equal, we think we'd see higher retention rates and that would be although that retention curve didn't shift. So using the PLE calculation removes any tenure bias from our statistics.
So with that background, I wanted to give you an update on the current progress with trailing 12 PLE. I'm happy to report that we've seen very positive PLE growth in 2016. We are up 6% year-over-year. 6% year-over-year, there we go. This is the largest increase since 2009 and as Tricia said on our last quarterly conference call, for every one month of PLE, we see $1.5 billion in additional lifetime earned premium for the company. We're also pleased that we're seeing similar percentage increases within our agency channel and in our direct channel and direct is at an all-time high. While we're really pleased with the overall momentum we see, we're even more pleased with what we see with our Robinsons in the Destination Era. For our Robinsons, PLE is up 17% over the past 3 years. And the past 12 months, we're up 9%. So just great momentum that we're seeing with the Robinsons. As Tricia alluded to earlier, the Robinsons are now 3x greater and yearly 3.5x greater than our Sams for PLE.
We'll also be adjusting the PLE calculation in the coming months. We haven't updated that extrapolation for a while, and we're seeing better retention in that tail of the PLE curve than we've seen historically. And so when we update the PLE calculation, overall PLEs will go up by more than -- by about 2%. And for our Robinsons, it will be even higher. Our Robinsons are disproportionately represented in the tail of the PLE curve. This means that we'll have even more opportunity with our Robinsons. We'll be able to acquire them more aggressively, and we'll be able to bundle our current customers more aggressively. 
So far, I've spoken inclusively about the trailing 12 PLE, but I want to go back to the trailing 3 that I talked about in the opening. If we think about the difference between the trailing 3 and the trailing 12 PLE is the unrealized momentum in our PLE data. And we're very pleased with what we see here. For total auto, the trading 3 PLE is up 8% year-over-year. For the trailing 12 PLE, it's up 6%. So we think we have about 2 points of unrealized momentum within our PLE. As you can see across all of our segments, the trailing 3 PLE is higher year-over-year than the trailing 12, so we feel like we have a lot of momentum. But the highest difference is for our Robinsons. For Robinsons, we think we have about 4 points of momentum that we haven't yet realized. I want to stop here and just talk about the goal that Tricia outlined for us in 2015. Tricia has challenged us to increase retention by 50%. We think we can achieve this in 3 ways. First, we believe we can change our mix. In the Destination Era, we think we can change our mix to more preferred customers and new business. Pat outlined some of the strategies we have there. In addition to changing mix, we think we can improve our price competitiveness relative to the competition. Pat showed the slide where we have increasing agency PLE while overall rates are being increased. And third, we believe we can improve the customer experience. We think we can nurture our customers to stay with Progressive longer, and I'll spend some time on that in the next section. We think this path to a 50% increase runs through our more preferred segments. We see more opportunities with our more preferred segments to increase retention. And then as the mix of our business changes, we believe we'll hit that overall goal of increasing retention by 50%. 
I want to switch gears here and start talking about the nurture side of things. But I want to pause and just talk about data for a minute and specifically, how we're using data for customer experience. We see a virtuous cycle in our pricing. I started off in product management, this was a big part of our roles. In pricing, we see that when we acquire customers, we are paying their data. And with that data, we can derive segmentation and insights and improve our pricing, which allows us to acquire more customers, which gives us more data, which gives us better segmentation, a virtuous cycle exists within our pricing. We think the same virtuous cycle exists with our customers in customer experience, specifically with our customers, we gain customers and then we interact with them. Those interactions generate data and that data provides insights and ideas in segmentation. That allows us to increase retention, which allows us to have more customers. And more customers provides more interactions and more data and we get a virtuous cycle here within customer experience as well. And in the Destination Era, as we gain more products, we think that cycle spins even faster, more products means more interactions, which means more data. So as we invest in the Destination Era, we think we'll have even more predictive data to use with our customers. We give you that background because leveraging data is part of a larger initiative that we're working on here at Progressive. In the 2015 investor relations meeting, Glenn said that we need to be as good at customer marketing as we are at consumer marketing. And so we've put a joint team together from our customer relationship management organization and corporate marketing, and that team is working on this customer marketing initiative. There are 4 pillars that we talk about with the customer marketing initiatives. The first is that we want to improve our customer knowledge. We want to assemble as much predictive data as we can for our customers, so that we know the experiences that they're going through. After that, we want to improve our customer engagement. There's 2 parts to this. We want to improve the processes that they go through, and we want to segment those customers better. The third pillar is interfaces. As we've come up with segmentation and processes, we need flexible interfaces to deliver those to our customers. And then finally, we want to brand those interfaces for our customers. Jeff Charney talked about this last year and so I won't spend time on it this year, but we want to have the branding that resonates with our customers as they interact with us. 
So with that said, let me walk through some of these pillars in particular, and I'll start with knowledge. As an initial example, I'll talk about small data that we are -- have been working on for our customers. Over the past 18 months, we've looked for internal and external data elements that are highly predictive for our customers. I have a smattering of those data elements on the screen. On the X axis here is the volume of data. You can think of this as the number of customers described by the data. And then on the Y axis, I have a general lift associated with that data. You can think of that lift as a lift in retention or a lift in graduation to become a Robinson or a lift in endorsements. No matter which of those 3 we're talking about with the data, it's highly profitable for Progressive to know. If we know that there will be a change with that customer, we can act on it in a profitable way. So let me give you some examples. Example #1 is an internal data element. It came from our digital servicing environment, it's a digital servicing action that we see our customers take. It wasn't within the structured data warehouse, but we had it in-house. And when we dug into it, we saw there's a 14-point difference in retention if we saw this data element. To give you another example that I can get a little bit more transparent about, example 2 is an external data element from a data vendor, we call it the newlywed variable. It comes from wedding invitations, bridal registries, courthouse records, things associated with getting married. And when we see that data element on one of our customers. In the next 6 months, there's more than a 200% lift in whether they change their marital status. And when a customer changes their marital status, it changes the retention rates, it changes the number of vehicles and drivers in the household and sometimes it adds additional products like a property policy. Now beyond small data, we've also started to think more about the big data available to us in customer relationship management. A leading technology company said that 80% of the world's data is unstructured, and we think that's true within CRM as well. I'm going to describe one area today, although there are others that we are working on as well. The area I'm going to describe today is the action that we're taking to put together an unstructured database of our customer words, the words that we hear from our customers. So let me give you some examples of some sources of this data. The first area is from our survey responses. Annually, we receive more than 80,000 survey responses from our customers. In addition, we have more than 1 million chat transcripts with our customers. When they go to our digital servicing environment, they can chat with a Progressive consultant. But as John  Sauerland alluded to, the largest and most significant source of words is from our calls with our customers. We received 36 million Personal Lines calls per year, and we've been transcribing those calls, and we have -- using advanced analytics, and we have all those calls in text form that we can put into a data warehouse. In total, Progressive has more than 10 billion words annually from our customers. So what can do we do with this? Well, I'll give you a few small examples today. One thing we've done is just search all this text for 3-word combinations, we call these trigrams. And there are some trigrams that are very predictive of, say, defection. I have 3 of those on the screen. I can tell you, for example, that trigram #3 is, 'I never received.' I never received my ID card. I never received that document that I requested. But I never received. And when a customer says that to Progressive, they are 1.4x more likely to defect from Progressive in the next 6 months. Another thing we've looked at is metadata. You can think of metadata as something other than the words that are present on those phone calls. For example, metadata #2 here is the amount of silence time on a phone call. As that silence time increases, the future defection chance increases as well, so there's about a 1.1x relativity on the amount of silence time on a phone call. There's even some significant words, some single words that if spoken or written or shared are a good predictor of future defection from Progressive. I won't share those today, but we've parsed through the text to look for those single words. 
So I'd like to move beyond knowledge now and talk about our engagement. And as a reminder here, I'm going to talk about the segmentation side of the engagements. In Progressive, we've certainly built traditional models. We use generalized linear models in a number of situations. These are tried and true models that are used throughout insurance and throughout business. And here, I want to tell you about the probability of Robinson graduation. This was a traditional modeling exercise that we went through in CRM. So we gave a team, I'll call them team #1, some of that small data that I talked about in the knowledge section. And we asked them to predict which customers may become a Robinson in the future, and they did a good job with this. They built a model. And the model in the top decile had a 4x greater chance of becoming a Robinson than the least responsive decile. But then we took that same data and we gave it to a separate team, one that did not work with the first team. And the separate -- second team did an even better job. In the second team, we found that the team came up with a model that was 7x greater. But the best result was if we combine models. And when we combined models, we found that the best tranche had a 9x greater likelihood. So even in the situation where we're building traditional models, we try to put the models together and combine them in ways to create the best outcome for Progressive. Now the world has moved beyond just generalized linear models, given the vast amount of data and the computing power that's available. It's moved to things like random forest or gradient boosting machines or neural networks, some of these advanced predictive models that are now available to us. We've invested in an advanced analytics team within CRM to take advantage of these models. The first assignment for this advanced analytics team was to build a defection model, to try to predict who might leave Progressive. And the best models were the gradient boosting machines and neural networks are being built. Because of the power of these models, I want to spend a little time just walking through the first generation neural network with you today. On the screen, I have the basic structure of a neural network, and I want to explain it to you. The first layer of a neural network is known as the feature layer. Features are like the independent variables that you would've seen in our regression historically. They are the attributes to the policy. Here on the screen, we have 2 features. F1 is a categorical variable of whether or not the policy is on EFT payments or automatic payments with Progressive. F2 is the percentage change in premium that, that policy will see in its upcoming renewal. We're going to have 2 predictors in this small snippet of a model. I can tell you in our first generation neural network, we had more than 900 predictors, and that was before we had access to all those billions of words that I described previously. From the feature layer, data passes along synapses to an output layer. Synapses are weights between negative 1 and 1 that are multiplied by the data. And then the data reaches this hidden layer. At the hidden layer, there's functions that are set there, common functions that are used in neural networks that transform the data. From the hidden layer, it travels along another set of synapses to the output layer. Again, the synapses multiply it by a number between negative 1 and 1 and then in the output layer, there's another function that transforms the data. And out of that output layer comes a predictor of defection or retention with Progressive between 0% and 100%. With that set up, let me walk you through a training of this neural network. On the screen are 8 policies from a training data set. These are 8 policies where we both know the predictors, the features of those policies, and what happened with them. So we have some policies that renewed with Progressive and some policies that defected from Progressive. What we do is we run these policies through the neural network. This is called forward propagation. Each of these policies passes through the network and is calculated the retention of it. So the features enter that feature layer, they're multiplied by that number between negative 1 and 1 in the synapse layer, they hit the hidden layer where they're transformed by a function. Another weight hits it and finally, it's transformed by a final function and a predictor of retention comes out. You can see here in this first iteration that the neural network is almost random. All those policies are clumped around the middle of the scale for predicting retention and the overall model accuracy as well. But what happens next is 1 of the 2 reasons why a neural network works. What happens next is a self-correcting mechanism exists within a neural network. It's called backward propagation. During backward propagation, each of those synapse weights are recalculated. It's calculated based on an iteration method called stochastic gradient descent. Stochastic gradient descent helps the model move towards the maximum accuracy. So as those weights change, this model is changing itself to become more accurate. After this backward propagation, we train the model again. We take these 8 policies and we pass them again through the model. Each of the policies enters the feature layer, hits the hidden layer and goes through the output layer. And you can see this time, the policies that renew with Progressive are starting to go higher on the renewal probability scale and those that defect are starting to go lower and the model accuracy improves, and then we backward propagate again, again adjusting the model. In actuality, we do this tens of thousands of times. Here in the room, I'm going to do it 10x quickly, just so you can see what happens. And this is the second reason why a neural network works. It's because of the brute force computing power that's available to us in this day and age. At the end of this, the model is trained. You can see after 10 iterations that the model accuracy has improved, and we have a model that's now ready for production. I do want to note here when we do this in actual practice, we keep a hold-out data set to make sure that we don't over fit the model. So what happens now? Well, we want to use this model in production. So I brought in 2 policies that we don't know the outcome for. They may be coming up for renewal with Progressive, Policy 9 and Policy 10. What we do is we take the features of these policies, and we pass them through the neural network. And here we can see that Policy 9 will retain with Progressive likely, and Policy 10 might defect from Progressive. We started to discriminate between policies that will stay and those that might leave. Now I hope you take 2 things away from this. First takeaway is that this is an incredibly intensive calculation process. For this first generation neural network, it took us 7 full days to run. We were using our local infrastructure but still it took an incredibly long time. And that was before we had tens of billions of words. That was before we tried adding on more hidden layers to move towards cognitive computing. It's just a very large and complex process. And it's because we have an impressive analytical infrastructure that we built through the Snapshot program that we can start tackling problems like this. The second thing I hope you take away is that this is an incredibly accurate model as well. Now we showed overall model accuracy on the screen. Truth be told, that's not what we're interested in. We're actually interested in the tail of the model, if we can predict those policies that are very unlikely to renew. We want to have good tail accuracy. And from the data that we used to build this neural network, we also built a traditional model, a GLM model. And when we did that, the neural network was twice as predictive as the generalized linear model. We're using the same data, but using more predictive advanced analytics techniques, we can be much more accurate in what we're doing, which has larger benefits to Progressive. Let me walk through interfaces to tell you a little bit more about how we take these models and use them for business benefit. I want to start by talking about proactive outbound communication. This is us reaching out to our customers. On the screen, I have a couple of examples of digital ads. These are digital ads we put in front of our current customers when we want them to graduate to become Robinsons. We target these digital ads based on that traditional model that I talked about previously. When we combine those models, we're focusing the most responsive deciles, we show them these digital ads. And when we've done that, along with some other activities like this, we've increased the number of Robinsons we have by tens of thousands, adding millions of dollars in lifetime underwriting profit to Progressive. We're able to do this because of all that acumen we built in advertising to consumers. We use those same patterns in advertising to our customers. Just another example is Policy 10 from that neural network example. We know that Policy 10 may not stay with Progressive, and so we started campaigns to reach out to folks like Policy 10 and invite them to call in to talk about their policy. And when we've done things like that, and we've got a few in practice now, the run rate is that annually, we'll save tens of thousands of customers, worth tens of millions of dollars in lifetime underwriting profit to Progressive. Beyond proactive outbound communication, there's also proactive inbound communication. We have built a tool that our phone consultants can use when someone calls Progressive. We call this tool the customer relationship assistant. It's a user interface for our phone consultants. It took us about 2 months to build, and the beauty of this tool is that it houses all that data and all those models I spoke about previously. So when Policy 10 calls, the consultant on the phone knows to talk to that customer about their policy and about staying with Progressive. It's really personalized, right? We can tailor all these interactions and make sure we have the right treatments that fire when that customer calls in. It's very flexible. If we want to add new treatments, we can program them in about 2 hours. And earlier results from this are very impressive. We've seen an increase in products added, a reduction in future calls and a lift in retention. 
Let me recap what I talked about today. In 2015, in the investor relations meeting, Glenn said that retention was our Holy Grail. And Tricia challenged us to increase retention by 50%. I'll underscore the progress that you heard today. PLE is up 6% with momentum higher. Direct is at an all-time high, and we're making the most progress with our Robinsons as our mix in that business shifts towards the Robinsons. In customer marketing, as a direct carrier and a servicing independent agent carrier, we have access to billions and billions of pieces of customer data. We have a historical strength in mining that data, driving insights to segmentation and quickly moving to market. We believe we can do that with our current customers. Feed that virtuous cycle of data and extend policy life expectancies. And with that, I'll welcome up John Barbagallo to talk about Commercial Lines."

I'm going to share a little bit about what we're seeing in the Commercial Auto insurance marketplace. I'm going to touch on our most recent results and share a little bit about our near-term action plans. And then I'",4246,"Thanks, Andrew. Hello. Good afternoon. I'm going to share a little bit about what we're seeing in the Commercial Auto insurance marketplace. I'm going to touch on our most recent results and share a little bit about our near-term action plans. And then I'm going to shift to talk about 2 disruptive trends that are coming to you, small business insurance and non-fleet Commercial Auto insurance. And these are trends that we have not only been monitoring, but we've actually been making investments around them over the last several years, and we think we're very favorably positioned to take advantage of them. But first, let's start talking about the marketplace. I'm going to start with a little history. This is a chart that I've shared with this audience in the past. It's now been updated through 2015. And what it shows is Progressive's relative performance relative to the industry on 2 measures: combined ratio and growth in direct written premium. And 2 things you can take from this graph. One is that over this time period, Progressive, by being intensely focused on Commercial Auto as a specific line of business, has been able to consistently outperform the industry on combined ratio, usually by a margin of 10 to 15 points. And for the last few calendar years, it's actually been by 20 points. Now some of that is from our expense ratio. We have a very cost competitive expense ratio. We believe we are the low cost provider in Commercial Auto, but a lot of that is loss ratio. And by being focused in the way we are, we believe we see things sooner and react faster than most of the rest in the industry and that contributes to this advantage. The other thing you can take from this chart is perhaps a little more subtle, is that we will and have consistently slowed our growth in the business when we were at risk of exceeding our underwriting target. And we will keep that commitment to those underwriting margin targets. Even with that approach, over time, we have been able to grow our market share consistently to the point where 2015, Progressive became the #1 Commercial Auto writer in the United States. All right, let's jump into 2016. This is a view, again, same 2 measures, combined ratio and direct written premium, Progressive versus the industry, we've added a few of our key competitors, as of the first quarter of 2016. You can see Progressive up in the upper right, cruising along with really good growth and a combined ratio in the high 80s at that point. And the industry had about 6% growth and a combined ratio of 102, which actually isn't too bad when you consider how it ended in 2015, that would appear to be improvement. But if you update through the second quarter, you see general degradation of combined ratios across the board, including our own. In fact, for the industry, the change in loss ratio, if you take the loss ratio for the 3 months comprising the second quarter, it is fully 8 points higher than the first quarter loss ratio. Now there's some seasonality at play there, but that is a huge, huge change. Now I'm sure you've noticed in our last 2 or 3 monthly earnings releases that our combined ratio has been elevated, certainly above historic norms. There's a little bit of prior year development in there. For the 3 months period, it's about 1 point, 1.25 points. But the real driver of that is actually frequency. What we have on the screen now is our bodily injury reported frequency for the last couple of years. Now the blue line is the monthly frequency. As you can see, that's pretty volatile, it jumps around a lot. We don't tend to pay too much attention to that. Even though those kind of last 2, last couple high watermarks there, they're high, but certainly not beyond anything we've seen in our history. If you look at the orange line, that is the trailing 6 BI frequency, and that's a much more stable measure, but it's still -- it is relatively reactive to changes in the environment. And there you're seeing what appears to be an inflection point starting in May, maybe as early as April. We believe that is real, at least it's real enough to me that we are reacting to that. We also believe it is largely environmental. Pat talked earlier about general a rise in frequency for auto, there's theories around that, distracted driving, low fuel prices. But in Commercial Auto specifically, particularly the verticals where we tend to compete, we are seeing positive movement in a number of the macroeconomic factors that we track that generally correlate with frequency. Things like home sales, construction spending, trade tonnage, aggregate deliveries, all moving in a positive direction, which suggests to us higher levels of economic activity, also contributing to higher frequency. So we believe this is real and we are reacting to it. Primarily, we're reacting with rate. Now I've talked to this audience before about our rate revision infrastructure at Progressive, our ability to change rates across the broad portfolio relatively quickly, and we have kicked that into gear. What this graph shows is our anticipated rate change for 2016, which will come in at about 9% year-over-year change in rates, most of that in the second half of the year. We were actually holding rates flat through the first 4 months of the year, as we were operating in the high 80s. So we've responded decisively and we've responded quickly, and those rate changes will certainly help the combined ratio. But it will take time. About 90% of our policies are written on an annual basis, so we have to get through a renewal cycle to get the full effect of it. It will certainly help with new business as soon as we can get those rates in place. But in the interim, and I said, we will slow down growth to ensure we make our margins. In the interim, we're also restricting some high-frequency segments of our business for new business. We're going to stop taking it until we can get those rates in place. Now those segments have always been high frequency, they will always be high frequency, and we're perfectly comfortable writing that business at the right rate, we're just not there yet. So that's what we see going on. Again, by being focused, we think we are seeing this before much of our competition, and we're reacting before they do. And when that's happened historically, that has typically set up very favorable market conditions for us down the road. So we'll see what happens. 
All right. Now I want to shift to those disruptive trends. The first of which is what I believe will be an inevitable shift to small business owners accessing direct channels for the purchasing and servicing of their small business insurance policies. Consumers across a range of industries have demonstrated not only acceptance of direct channels, but in many cases, preference for those channels. And we don't expect small business owners to be any different, especially as digital continues to close the information gap between the buyer and the seller. And we're starting to see investment. Investment by people other than Progressive. And these are companies that are well-known. They are well-funded, and they have experienced management. And they are putting the assets in place. Underwriting companies, product filings, technology platforms, all to go after the direct channel for small business owners. And they're starting to spend some money. Not a lot on the marketing front, and actually, it's happening slower than we would've anticipated. We still are the largest spender in the category, but they're starting to spend some money as well. So we're seeing investments. We're also starting to see some growth. This is a view provided by the Boston Consulting Group of the U.S. small business insurance market. Now this is all lines of business, it's all lines of business for small business insurance, and they peg that at about a $65 billion to $70 billion marketplace. And as of right about now, they're saying direct channels have 8% share. Probably more interesting on this chart is what they project to be the growth rate of the channels. So a pretty aggressive growth rate for digital channels in small business insurance. In fact if you buy into this view, it suggests that traditional channels will begin to decline in absolute dollars as early as 2019. We'll see. When it comes to Commercial Auto, where we have some pretty good data, we're seeing a somewhat similar pattern. Now again, the direct channel for Commercial Auto is still small, less than 2%, but the growth rate relative to the industry growth rate is 2x to 3x. Now full disclosure, on this particular graph, that orange line is largely driven by Progressive. We're just about half of the direct commercial auto market right now, and we actually can affect the slope of that line simply in terms of how much we choose to spend. And that's reflected in 2014, we pulled back in our spending, and you see that little dip there. But again, you have a channel where there's lots of investment lining up, and you're starting to see signs of growth in the channel. So the question then becomes who is going to be able to most cost effectively drive demand and control the top of that sales funnel. And this is where we start to feel really good. Because while the others are just getting started, we have actually been at this since 2008. Now we've been selling direct commercial for more than a decade, but it was really in 2008 that we began investing in developing a business insurance brand. In 2008, we started -- we embarked, really, on a 5-year plan, and it was a 5-year plan to prove to ourselves that we could make the economics of direct marketing commercial insurance work. And it was a very auto-centric approach, targeting specific verticals where we tend to do well. We concluded that 5-year plan successfully in 4 years. That gave us the confidence in 2012 to begin broadening our marketing. And by broadening, I mean, both broadening the media we would access and broadening our message to be much less auto-centric and really built around insuring and protecting the business. And that has now evolved to our current campaign, which we just launched, which could really celebrate the small business owner. So we've been investing here for a long time. Has that investment been worth it? We would say it definitely has been. One of the key measures of brand health is awareness, and as you can see on these 2 charts, in terms of total awareness and top-of-mind awareness, Progressive is the leading small business insurance brand. Again, this gets back to who is going to control the top of that sales funnel as this channel begins to grow.
How fast might this all happen? I don't really know, but maybe we can look to private passenger auto as a guide, because this has happened. The chart on the left shows the shift in channel for private passenger auto over a 20-year period. Now keep in mind, that orange line for the direct channel developed concurrently with the development and acceptance of digital channels for consumers. So the Internet, gradually migrating over to mobile. We believe those consumer preferences are already in place. And I'll offer an opinion that small business owners, at least a percentage of them, their expectations currently exceed the industry's ability to deliver really good digital experiences. The chart on the right is the effect of that channel shift on Progressive's business. So over roughly the same time period, Progressive's direct auto business grew from being about 12 -- 11%, 12% of our total business to where it is today, half our business. Now it's not that our agency business didn't grow during this time. It did grow. You heard earlier from Pat that it is at an all-time high. It's just that the direct business grew that much faster, creating lots of value for Progressive and for our shareholders. We've modeled this out. We've done a number of different scenarios around how quickly the direct channel may grow for small business insurance, based on different spend levels by us, spend levels by other. And when we surround what we think are the most likely outcomes, it all leads to significant growth for Progressive Commercial Lines.
So we continue to invest in our capabilities. We are in the midst of a major systems upgrade for commercial. One of the benefits of that will be the ability to deliver better digital experiences, and perhaps more importantly, deliver them to market faster and enhance them more quickly. And we continue to invest in and build our in-house business insurance agency.
The map on the left shows our footprint for being able to offer non-affiliated partner company BOP and general liability policies to prospects and our customers. We also sell workers' comp and professional liability, but the primary coverages they're seeking are BOP and GL. And today, we have -- in virtually every state, we can offer between 5 and 8 products, covering a range of underwriting profiles. And as you can see on the graph on the right, we are growing the agency. And there again, the shape of that growth curve can largely be determined by how much we choose to spend at a given time. And we are growing the agency, and we are having success bundling these small business customers with Progressive Auto, be it Commercial Auto or Personal Auto, and that's an important point. We are creating a lot of bundles with a BOP or GL policy and a Progressive Personal Auto policy, which is just fine. First of all, it helps the agency's economics because those customers are much stickier. Second, it is entirely consistent with the strategy Tricia laid out earlier in terms of acquire, anchor, bundle, extend. This may be how we acquire customers. Certainly, could be how we bundle customers. And also, we're finding that the need for commercial auto in a  small business oftentimes emerges late or later in the life cycle of that business, and business insurance is very situational, unlike personal lines. Usually the first purchase of a personal lines product, typically auto, is driven by a state law, state requirement to have insurance or a bank. In small business insurance, that is not usually the case.
So to try to give some context to this slide, I'm going to tell you a story. And it's a story about a real-life, thriving business right here in Northeast Ohio. So a work colleague of mine has a friend, and she's starting a business in her home, in her kitchen actually, cooking bone broth. And she sold this bone broth out of her kitchen to friends and neighbors. Now she didn't have insurance, so we told her she needed insurance. You can argue she probably should have had insurance, but she was flying below the radar, which a lot of small businesses do, particularly in their early stages. The sales went well. She got a lot of positive feedback, and she was encouraged to take her product to one of the local farmers' markets. So she decided to give that a try. She applied. She was accepted, but the farmers' market told her, if you want to come on-premise, you have to have a vendor's liability policy and you have to have a general liability policy. So where previously, she was in that first circle of not really caring about insurance, she now found herself in that second circle of, well, at least temporarily, I have to care about insurance if I want to go to this farmers' market. Not sure if I have a real business yet, but I'll buy the insurance. Farmers' market went well. Again, a lot of positive feedback, again, getting inquiries from local restaurants who wanted her to supply them with bone broth. She even got a contract with a local grocery store chain, and the business is starting to take off. In fact, taking off to the point that she outgrew her kitchen, and she had to lease commercial space, and she had to hire 2 employees to set up more of a regular production cycle for the bone broth. And now she needs a BOP policy for her premises, and she needs workers' compensation for her employees. I would say now she's in that third circle of, I definitely really have to care about insurance. She still hasn't had a commercial auto policy, but that's about to change. She had been hiring a third party to make her deliveries. She now buys her first delivery vehicle, she needs a commercial auto policy.
I understand from my colleague that she is now thinking of expanding her business regionally, maybe nationally. She realizes she has a real asset here, an asset she wants to preserve, protect, maybe pass on to the next generation. I would argue she's moving into that fourth circle of, I genuinely care about buying insurance. The point here is for small business owners, it is a journey of one, and they are all different, and they are not necessarily linear like the real-life example I just gave you. People move back and forth. Some small business owners never move out of that second circle. They're kind of the Sams of small business ownership. And to deal with that, we have developed a series of customer journey maps, by business type and by business stage. And do what these journey maps allow us to do? It maps our creative and our messaging and our media buying with those key trigger events to deliver the right message at the right time to that business. So this a trend that is clearly coming. You've been reading a lot about it. It's been a little slow to gain traction. We think it's about to take hold, and we feel we are really, really well-positioned to capitalize on that.
The other trend I want to talk to you about is the application of telematics to non-fleet commercial auto insurance. I'm not sure if this is a trend yet, but I do believe it's coming. So telematics have been broadly applied in fleet situations. But even there, there has never been a really strong insurance tie-in. That's been more about asset management and logistics than insurance. But we think that's about to change, particularly in the trucking sector. Now John Sauerland has already talked to you about Progressive's leadership position in terms of usage-based insurance pricing science. He's talked to you, and Andrew's reinforced, the big data capabilities Progressive can bring to bear. Those are absolutely assets we can leverage in Commercial Lines. But we have taken a slightly different path in Commercial than they have in Personal with respect to UBI, and we have focused on the transportation industry, the over-the-road truckers. Two reasons for that. One, we feel a version of the Snapshot product will work perfectly well for a lot of our business auto contractor-type customers. And now as the agency adoption rate of Snapshot is starting to go up, it may be the time for us to introduce that to commercial. The other reason that we focused on transportation is we were anticipating a federal mandate, which is now law, that will require federal motor carriers to have an electronic logging device in their vehicle and operational by December 2017. And these electronic logging devices will be fully telematics-enabled, if you will. They'll have all the data you could possibly want. So we have, for the last few years, been working directly with the vendors, the  manufacturers of these ELDs to put in place data sharing agreement and cooperative marketing agreements so we can go to market together with our products as the demand increases, leading up to the compliance date in December '17 and we've also been collecting our own UBI data for the last several years. Today, we probably have about 600 of our insured trucks on the road being monitored. We've collected over 41 million miles of data, and those data are beginning to reveal some really, really interesting things.
Perhaps the most interesting is that we find with commercial operators the degree of variance in their behavior is far, far greater than Personal Lines customers in terms of how, how much and where they drive. To the extent those behaviors correlate with losses, and they do, that's very exciting, because that allows for greater rate segmentation. And John's already talked to you about the power of rate segmentation. He's told you that in Personal Lines, Snapshot is the most predictive, most powerful rating variable we have. We believe, for trucking risks, it will be even more powerful than that. So we're very excited.
Let me give you just a little sampling of some of the things we're seeing. All these examples relate to the same 3 insured vehicles. One of the things you rate on in Commercial Auto is something called radius of operation, which is basically how far do you go from your principal garaging address, how far do you go. It's a rating variable we use. ISO uses it. A lot of our competitors use it. A problem with radius of operations as a rating variable, it could be hard to verify and it changes over time. Truckers go where the work -- I think that's true of all commercial vehicles, they go where the work is. But we all use it. Well now, with electronic logging devices, we actually know where they go. And in this sample, we've got 3 insured vehicles that were all rated based on the same radius of operation, 500 miles, which was pretty good for Vehicle C. We're probably overcharging Vehicle A and Vehicle B. Well, more important than how far you drive is where you drive. Now that we have geolocation data, we can actually score different routes and different roads in terms of relative safety or risk. From there, we can overlay time of day, so you incorporate things like rush hour and potentially things like seasonal weather pattern. You begin to see where this can go. But even with a relatively simplistic model for scoring, which is what we have here, you see pretty significant differences in distribution, which we believe are actionable and ratable. One more, this is how much you drive, and this is really the whole impetus behind the federal mandate. Better regulation of hours of operation, hours of service. Driver fatigue is a major, major safety issue for over-the-road truckers. The graphs on the bottom reflects hours per day of driving. So each bar on the graph is a day. And the white line going across is the federal limit of 11 hours per day. So you can see pretty significant differences in these distributions. Vehicle B -- and remember, this is the guy that goes the furthest from home by far, seems to be doing a better job of managing his hours per day. Vehicle C actually had some 20 and 22-hour days in there. Now what that probably means is we have team driving, 2 drivers taking shifts. And still, that's really important and valuable information and represents a different risk. So this is just a few samples of the types of data we are beginning to develop, that we think will be very, very actionable.
I'm going to conclude with one more chart, just because I love the data, and this is another comparison between Personal Auto, and in this case, some long-haul trucking customers. So the bottom graph was taken from a sample of Snapshot customers, Personal Auto Snapshot customers. And all it does is it shows kind of where their cars are during different parts of the day. And what you see by and large is most of the time, those cars are at home, in the driveway, in the garage. And during the daytime hours, that's where you see the driving. Not so much driving in the wee morning hours. Not surprising. The graph on the top is a sample of Progressive-insured long-haul trucks. And what you see there is lots of driving, not surprising, not unusual, 100,000, 120,000 miles a year for a trucker. But when they're not driving, they're typically away from home, sleeping in their truck, showering at a truck stop, using a, I don't know, Cracker Barrel. It could be a pretty hard life for a trucker, and this is where I really start to get excited about these data, because this is where I think we can go beyond just straight rate segmentation and start to develop value-added services by using risk management services to hopefully make these truckers a little bit healthier and a little bit safer while they're on the road. So again, another trend, we think, is coming to small business insurance, in this case, non-fleet auto insurance, that we feel we're very, very well-positioned to capitalize on.
With that, I'm going to bring up Tricia Griffith for some closing remarks."

We continue with our segmentation of more and more product models and having deeper segmentation at the quickest amount of time ever. So we really think that's a competitive advantage. And our bundled PIFs have grown 20% to 30% across channels. John  Sauerland talked about our most important variable, our UBI or usage-based insurance, so Snapshot, and how we're continuing on that evolution and how with that work we've actually had even more data capabilities across the enterprise that we believe will be a winning strategy for Progressive. Andrew Quigg talked about PLE. We finally made that breakthrough in PLE, especially in the Robinsons segment. Andrew talked about the massive amount of customer data that we have and how we're going to use that data to understand the moves of our customers and be out in front of that, give them a reason to stay.
John Barbagallo talked about the fact that we're outperforming our peers relative to profit and growth, so that's extraordinary. Bottom line is though, we have to respond quickly to our frequency trend, and we're doing that with rate. John has his own era coming up in terms of the direct business with small business owners as well as technology and data-driven technology in the commercial space.
I hope you're thrilled as our team is about what we've executed upon and what we're going to be doing in the future. And I want to thank you for your interest in Progressive. So with that, I will ask John Sauerland to join me for some Q&A."

The first storm has a tower that is up to what -- the average model, I'll say, equates to about a 1 in 300 years storm, so that's pretty high up relative to what we believe other carriers have. We have a second event that also has a $50 million retention on it. But we're -- I think ASI has done a great thing in that it's only typical in the marketplace, in that they prepay reinstatement for about 70% of that tower. That tower is not quite as tall as the first tower, but it's about a 1 in 100-year event, and about 70% of that has reinstatement premiums prepaid. And Trevor Hillier and John Auer -- Trevor Hillier, CFO of ARX, and John Auer, the CEO, are both here. So if I misstate or I need corrections, please feel free to chime in.

We can get more profitable by raising rates or we can underwrite out segments at new business or at renewal that we think are the cause of the problem until we have rates in that segment high enough where we are then comfortable letting new customers back in. So in Commercial Lines, they've identified segments of new customers that they believe will be the least profitable. And they're working upfront to underwrite that. In Commercial Lines, they have a lot of ability as well to underwrite a renewal with credits, debits. And they've done a lot of that over time and have targeted that, of course, as well. In Personal Lines, we're actually employing a lot of underwriting these days as well. It hasn't been what we've been -- it hasn't been our forte historically. But probably 4 or 5 years ago, we started getting a little more conservative around ensuring that we were bringing in business that was intent it was to insure and not otherwise. And I think that's helped us a lot. But higher level, you can improve profitability through raising rates or underwriting segments. And Commercial Lines has been very fast to react in turning on the underwriting where necessary, and they're now reacting very quickly in getting rates up and expect to have those rates up about 9% by the end of the year."

I think you're all familiar with the Safe Harbor statements, and if not, there's also a copy in your materials as a reference guide.
So this particular investor relations meeting represents a really big change. For many, many years, Glenn Renwick was the host of these meetings. In fact, I think he started them. Last week, Glenn celebrated his 30th anniversary with Progressive, of which more than half of that he was our CEO and President. During his tenure as CEO, he tripled the company in size. So by most record books you would say that is phenomenal, and it is. But it's not just that. It's not just what Glenn did, it's how he did it: Always making sure to instill in us that desire to win, but doing it in the right way, always following our core values. He always would set the bar higher every year for all of us. And then he wouldn't walk away, he would help us get over, and that is really his legacy. So Glenn, on behalf of the 30,000 Progressive people, our shareholders and the customers we're privileged to serve, thank you for, well, being Progressive.
Okay, enough about Glenn. I thought what I'd do to start off is just remind you of our segments. So we outlined these several years ago when we first started talking about our Destination Era strategy. So I'll just briefly go over those. The focus today will be on the Robinsons, and we're really excited to talk to you about what we have done since we last met you in May of 2015.
So Sam. Sam is a segment we grew up with, and we call him inconsistently insured. He is who Progressive -- he put us on the map, and we call him nonstandard. He cares about rates, doesn't stay very long, but he could come back. We love Sam. We want to write all the Sams we can possibly write as long as it reaches our profitability goal.
Diane. Diane is a big part of the Destination Era. We've talked in the past about her being a future Robinson. Diane is an auto customer, and she rents. So she may have renters insurance with us, and what we hope is that as her needs evolve, when she buys a home, gets married, that we evolve with her. It's the notion of Diane graduating to be a Robinson. She's our largest customer base, so the opportunity there is immense.
The Wrights. The Wrights are unbundled auto and home. So they have Progressive home and someone else's auto. Again, we love the Wrights. We see them as future Robinsons because we hope that if they decide to shop their homeowners, they come with us and become a Robinson.
The Robinsons. That's really what today is all about and what the Destination Era is all about, the auto home bundle. The Robinsons are 40% of the market. So the opportunity here is really great, and we are really proud of how, the momentum we've had in the last 18 months in particular, in obtaining Robinsons.
Before we get started, what I thought I'd do as the new CEO is step back and just take stock of some objectives and some fundamentals that will stay the same during my tenure, but things that might evolve. And clearly, with Glenn's leadership, I was a part of the team that developed the strategy around the Destination Era. So to make a turn and do something differently wouldn't make sense. I believe in this model, the execution has been great and I'm excited about our future. But things do evolve as a team as we know more.
Let me start with our first and most important objective, profit. We want to make at least $0.04 of underwriting profit of every $1 of premium. 96 is central to our culture. You're actually sitting in an auditorium that is called Studio 96. So you know how integrated it is into everything we do. It continues to be our most important objective, and that won't change. There is, however, an added dimension with the auto home bundle. We're looking at how 2 independent margins can be optimized for that package. So while the 96 will stay the same, how it will be derived will absolutely evolve.
Growth. We want to grow as fast as we can with 2 constraints: one, the profit objective I just outlined; and two, our ability to service our customers. That second one is really important to us. So about 18 months ago, we had our 8.3 model on the streets, it was working, we were getting a lot more preferred customers. We also saw the opportunity, when some of our competition pulled back, to spend more on advertising, specifically, in the digital options. So we knew at that point we had a lot of opportunities to grow. We made a decision at that time to hire well in advance of need. So from the claims organization as well as our customer relationship management organizations, both on the auto side and the commercial side. And I'm so pleased that we did that, because we did get that growth. We got that preferred growth. And in addition, we had things that happened that we didn't necessarily plan for, in the form of catastrophes. So we've been able to service our customers, no matter if it was a CAT or a regular just increase in losses based on growth.
It is sort of a rule here at Progressive that whether you're on the claims side or the product side, if you think we're growing too fast, you absolutely have to raise your hand and say, ""No more growth. We can't do this."" And we've had to do that in the past. I'm so delighted to say that this year we didn't have to do that because we prepared and hired in advance of need. So when I think about growth and profit and that balance, year-to-date, with August being the most recent time frame, we're at a 96.2 
[Audio Gap] 
percent net written premium growth. If we ended the year today, this is a phenomenal year, especially with the business that we've been putting on the books. I'm extraordinarily happy. If we were at the same margin at 96.2 and had 4% growth with the same set of circumstances, I wouldn't be as happy. If we were at 88 with 0% growth, I wouldn't be happy. I'm very, very pleased with our growth. It really is sort of the perfect storm. So we had this new business, and we talked and talked at the conference calls about the sort of new business tax that you have, when our combined ratio is higher in that first term. And so we had that coming at us, and then we had CATs. This year, we have, on our CR, 3 points of our combined ratio are in the form of CATs, which is compared to this time last year, about 1.5%. In fact, last month, with the Louisiana storms, it was over 4 points of our CR. So you can't plan for CATs. Believe me, I'm watching Matthew closely, you can't plan for CATs. What you can plan for is how you react to those CATs. I am extraordinarily pleased with how we have reacted, specifically to the Louisiana 
[Audio Gap] 
So about 3 weeks ago, a group of us flew down and spent some time in Lafayette and Baton Rouge, Louisiana, to make sure our employees were okay, our customers were okay, and I was just amazed. I was amazed that our CAT team, who went down there and just made sure, they took it upon themselves to get our customers back on their feet. We literally had employees who were laying in bed, and they found out their home was flooded when they put their foot in water. Yet they came to work that day to help our customers. In fact, as of yesterday, we have closed 96% of those flood claims, which is really amazing because they're complex claims, mostly total losses. So again, I'm so amazed that what we were able to do and what we're able to do. And you know what, we are ready, with whatever happens with Matthew. As of today, we have a plan, and we'll figure it out. That's what we do.
So for me, again, just to wrap up in that part, profit and growth, very happy, very proud, especially with how we've been increasing our preferred business, the Robinsons, and we're going to talk a lot about that today.
I thought I'd take just a stab at some of the financial fundamentals. So it won't change. I think they work with our business plan. We want to continue to balance operating risk with the risk of investing in financing activities, in order to have sufficient capital to support our growth. So that's the overview. On the operating side, we want to maintain pricing and reserving discipline. So when we talk about our pricing, we talk about managing targets. We talk about targets at the lowest definition. So whether it's on the agency and direct side, product, state, we really segment our targets. And that's another reason why I'm so positive about this new business because we look at the new business coming in and say, ""Is it at or below targets? Great, that's going to run off profitably."" So we're excited about that.
We want to have premium to surplus at or below state minimum requirement. So on auto, that's a 3:1 and about half of that for home. And on the loss reserving side, we want to make sure our loss reserves are adequate and developed with the minimal variance. Year-to-date, very proud of that. We are pretty close, but a little bit on the favorable side, which is the side you want to be on. On investing side, we want to maintain a liquid, diversified and high-quality portfolio. We manage our investments on a total return basis, which is very consistent with how we report our comprehensive income. And on the risk side, we want to manage interest rate, credit, prepayment, concentration and extension risk. Lastly, on the financing side, we want to maintain sufficient capital to support the insurance operations. That's measured by maintaining a debt below 30% of total capital of book value. So we're just slightly over 28% right now, and that's after issuing $500 million worth of debt in August. We want to neutralize dilution from equity-based compensation in the year of issuance, and we do that by repurchasing shares. And finally, we will invest in capital in expanding the business when it meets our objectives. A perfect example of this is our acquisition of ARX. We didn't necessarily feel like we had to have a homeowners company. What we felt is we had to have access to that addressable market. That is a $300 billion market with auto and home. We needed to have access, and it just so happened that we had been working with a company that we had a high amount of respect for, that had a very similar culture and so was a perfect relationship to start. So we're very pleased with our use of capital in acquiring ARX. Any use of underleveraged capital, we will buy back shares or issue dividends, whether special or variable.
So let's get to the 96, since we are slightly over at this point, I want to walk you through kind of how we look at it. This is just a basic refresher. So everybody gets to a 96, all of our customers at some point get there, but sometimes in vastly different ways. On the direct side, you can see we run a much higher combined ratio in that first term. That's based on the fact that we have a little higher loss cost and some underwriting cost, but most of all, we front-load all of our acquisitions cost on the direct side in that first term.
On the agent side, we have a little bit more losses, a little bit more underwriting, but it's a relatively fixed commission expense, so much lower in the first term. So let me take you through on the direct side, 2 ends of the spectrum. You have Sam and the Robinsons. So you can see the same dynamic. They both rendered a loss in the first term. But what is not evident in our monthly reporting or even our quarterly reporting is the fact that this very high-retaining business, the Robinsons, who stay 3x, actually, more than 3x longer than the Sams, are expanding our invisible balance sheet. So bringing on more of those Robinsons really build the intrinsic value of Progressive.
Here's a basic income statement, and it's directionally accurate. So if we look at again, the Sam and Robinsons, you look at revenue. Clearly, the Robinsons are higher, based on the fact that they stay longer and they have higher average written premium. If you look at the operating expenses, which, of course, are losses, LAE and expense ratio, you quickly notice that neither of these equal a 96. Those numbers represent the nominal value of the cash flow, so they're under a 96. Our lifetime target, 96 combined ratio. For our direct business, we discount the cash flows to recover our acquisition expenses. So that will be different in different segments depending on how long they stay. The difference between those, of course, is our underwriting income. And then there's other income that we have, both on the investment side for both Sam and Robinsons, and the commissions side for just the Robinsons. So whether it's affiliated partner, like ASI, or other unaffiliated homeowners carriers, we get commissions when we have those bundles. So as you can see, the value of a Robinson, a pretax value, is over 4x that of a Sam. Again, we love Sams as long as we can make money on them, but the value of a Robinson is extraordinary, and the fact that we have grown Robinsons substantially in the last 18 months really does grow the value, the intrinsic value, of Progressive.
So for years, we have shared with you the invisible balance sheet. We talked last year about unearned lifetime earned premium. So when we think about business coming on board, we look at new apps, for example. So in this year, for Wrights and Robinsons, we've grown new apps 30% and 40%, respectively. That's pretty great. We look at average written premium. Our average written premium has come up across all segments. And then we look at PLE. This is kind of going to be a spoiler alert for Andrew's section, but we finally have made a breakthrough on retention and PLE. So to us, those 3 things are really exciting. So we thought we'd share with you one other metric that we look at internally, that we call ULUP, unearned lifetime underwriting profit. So you'll see that the colors represent a segment, so green for the Robinsons, pink for the Wrights, et cetera. On the Y axis, you see ULUP in millions, and on the X axis, you'll see the time frame with which we are looking out. So right when we started to grow, right around March of last year, to our most recent data point. As you can see, the majority of our segments are growing substantially in ULUP, which, again, is building that intrinsic value. In fact, the Robinsons are growing over 60%.
The chart underneath shows all of the segments' year-over-year growth in ULUP, and again, all are growing, but you can see the Robinsons are growing at a really quick clip. That's exciting for us.
I'm going to shift gears now and talk about how important understanding the Destination Era is to the 30,000 Progressive people that work on getting our customers in the door and making sure we nurture them along the way. We look at it in terms of different frameworks. This is a framework we use called our strategic pillars. So let me talk about the first one, our culture. Our culture is so important, and it's not something you can really adequately describe unless you've spent time at Progressive. It's not something you're going to see on a spreadsheet. But it is really special, and it's really different, and we know it's a competitive advantage. It's really at the root of what I started to talk about, and that is doing the right thing. And we want to win, but you always want to do the right thing, and it's really rooted in our core values. I have the privilege to speak at every new hire class, actually, it was that one Monday, with a couple hundred new claims reps, and my sole topic is our core values. I talk about 15 or 20 minutes, use some examples and then let them ask questions. It's so important to me for them on their first day or their first week or their second week to know what an important part that is of Progressive, our values.
Earlier this year, many of us went out to celebrate a milestone at Progressive, $20 billion in earned premium. And we got out face-to-face with over half of our employees, over 15,000 people, just to celebrate and say thank you for all that you do, and then of course talk about the next milestone and the next milestone, and it was really rewarding, and that again is a big part of our culture.
Our brand. We want to be the brand people want. So whether it's awareness or preference or consideration, those things are important, but what we really want is to be able to, when people buy an insurance product from Progressive, that they feel confident that they've made a right decision and continue to feel confident as we service them and add more and more policies. We want to spend money on consumer marketing and customer marketing. We've talked often about how we want to have our customer marketing be as savvy as our consumer marketing. Andrew Quigg is going to talk a little bit about that today, but we continue to resource that, as it is an important part of nurturing our customers.
Competitive prices. In a business with small margins, this is very important to us, and it's really all around segmentation. You're going to hear a lot about that today. So John Sauerland is going to talk about our continued evolution with UBI and our segmentation, and how important that variable is. Pat Callahan is going to talk about segmentation and the product models that we continue to elevate as well as our bundled competitiveness. Andrew Quigg will talk about segmentation on the customer part and using data to get out in front of our customers to know what they need, when they need them. So this is a really important part of our -- really central to things that we do, is segmentation. We'll continue to hone in on that.
Another part about competitive prices is really having a competitive loss structure. So on the claim side, we continue to have -- try to have that near-perfect balance of cost and quality, so pushing down LAE, while pushing up accuracy, and we're doing a fantastic job. On the expense side, we look at what we call non-acquisition expense ratio. So we continue to try to push that down, be more efficient and then give that pricing advantage to our customers in the form of competitive prices.
And the last pillar is meeting the broader needs of our customers: What products do they want, when do they want it, how do they want to shop. We want to make sure we can have personalized service and products for each of our customers. So if you want to buy through an agent, get service online or through a chat, we want to make sure if it fits your needs, we are there for you. We want to pick up the phone and say, ""Yes, we can do that, absolutely."" And whether or not we do that through our own products or on affiliated products, we want to make sure we meet the needs of our customers.
We use this framework for how we're going to grow the business: Acquire, anchor, bundle and extend. We see growth in 3 ways: one, selling products to new customers; two, selling additional products to our current customers as the need arises; and three, keeping our customers longer. Let me start with acquire. Acquire is that initial relationship with us. So whether you come in through a special lines product or an auto product, we're just getting to know you. And in fact, we are pivoting the company and trying to be less about policies and more about customers and households. We're currently in 1 in 10 households in the United States, and we would like to double that in short order. And so we're doing that through acquiring more and more customers and understanding their needs and then evolving as their needs evolve.
Anchor. Our anchor products are our auto and our home. If you trust us with those assets, we believe that our relationship is much deeper. I started today talking about the opportunity, the $300 billion, almost $300 billion opportunity in auto and home. Now that we have access to that and have more and more customers coming in either at home or auto, we know we can deepen that relationship. It's such an important piece of future Robinsons.
Bundle, that's what we're going to talk about today. Our bundle are our Robinsons, our auto and home together, and just even a little bit of increased market share on the bundle part really has a big impact to the bottom line.
Lastly, extend. We have been talking about retention for some time, and we have made a significant breakthrough. Last year, if you recall, I announced that I asked Andrew Quigg to lead a team of people to try to increase our retention by 50%. He's going to talk about that today, but we're extraordinarily happy with our results.
For me, extend isn't about talking any longer about customers who stay 1 month or even 1 year. It's about having customers for decades. In fact, 1 out of 6 of our customers after the first renewal are decade customers. So we're pretty pleased with that. About 1 month or so ago, some of us went out to observe some focus groups of our customers. So we listened to Dianes with renters, Dianes without renters to try to get some insight. We went out to Minneapolis and Dallas, and we listened to some decade customers. And they came because they love the brand and they love the price, so that made sense. They had stayed because over that decade or more that they'd been with us, they'd had some sort of service, whether they'd had a claim or they need to call in to change a vehicle or deductible, and they were extraordinarily happy with the service. But what we heard from both of the decade customer groups was something I think really insightful. People said, ""Why are you going to stay?"" ""Even if rates go up, will you stay?"" Yes, because I'm proud to be a Progressive customer."" And that really hit us. And we heard that over and over again, and so we're working on bottling that feeling and having it happen earlier in someone's tenure, have them feel that pride year 3, year 4, so we can continue to extend that and increase our decade customers. And in fact, we're looking at different metrics. At some point, we'll continue to have policy life expectancies, but why wouldn't we have customer life expectancies? So that's where we'll evolve as our customers evolve.
Ultimately, our goal, our vision, is to become consumers' #1 choice and destination for auto and other insurance. The next 4 speakers are going to talk about how we're going to do that on both the auto side, and John Barbagallo will talk about how he's going to do that on the commercial side.
So now I'd like to start and invite our Personal Lines President, Pat Callahan, up to talk about agency growth, our product and our bundled competitiveness."

So last year, when we talked, I laid out 3 key strategic priorities for our Personal Lines business. And those are: Restoring growth in agency, increasing our bundled penetration and ultimately, and then advancing our product development cycle. I want to give you updates on all 3. And what we'll do is start with an overview of the market from an overall channel and market size perspective.
As Tricia mentioned, U.S. personal auto and home is rapidly approaching a $300 billion market. And when you look at the independent agency share of that, it's a little more than 1/3, or about $100 billion of home and auto premium. And despite the fact that technology adoption has been rapidly increasing the growth rate for direct distribution of Personal Lines products, the independent agency channel continues to grow premium. And that's due in part to broad distribution of their footprint, but also a great value proposition from a breadth of products offered and depth of carrier choice available. When you look more specifically at the homeowners market in the U.S., it's about a $90 billion market, and that's about 90% sold through agents, more than 40% through independent agents. And as the #1 writer of auto insurance through the independent agency channel, we believe we're incredibly well-positioned to leverage our strength in the channel, combined with ASI's property offerings, to become the #1 writer of auto and home insurance through the agency channel.
Last year, I told you that restoring growth in agency was a top priority for myself and lots of other folks within our Personal Lines organization. So today, I'm thrilled to show you some information that after our business shrunk slightly into 2014 and barely recovered into 2015, we've turned that agency business around from a size perspective. And at this point, our agency auto business, as well as ASI's homeowner business through independent agents, have both never before been larger. And if we zoom in on what's driving that auto improvement, we look primarily to start with at new business apps. New business growth is the lifeline or lifeblood of a growing organization like Progressive. And as you see on the screen, midway through 2015, we turned new business positive on a year-over-year basis within the agency channel. Our new business growth continues to be up in the double digits on a year-over-year basis ever since.
New business growth originates from 2 primary metrics. The first is demand, so quoting. The second is conversion. And our improvements in the agency channel are driven just about by equal parts of both, which indicate to us: number one, we have a more competitive product in market; but number two, that more competitive product is inducing agents to come to us more frequently to meet the needs of their clients. An absolutely fantastic combination within the channel.
But to understand how competitive we are overall in the channel, the best benchmark that we can use is how well we're converting on comparative raters. So last year, I shared with you that the majority of our agency quotes start on a comparative rating platform. And just to level-set, comparative rating software, desktop applications in agent's offices, that run a real-time, risk-by-risk auction amongst all the carriers that participate within that agent's office. And you'll notice that similar to what we saw from a new apps perspective, we're seeing increasing new business from a conversion perspective on comparative raters. Turned positive around the same time that we saw new business apps turn overall, and continues to be up solidly in the double digits.
The exciting part about this for us, though, is competitive rates absolutely matter. But competitive rates are not sufficient to drive conversion in the agency channel. Because of the plethora of choices that agents have, you also have to have competitive service, competitive ease-of-use and ultimately, competitive compensation. So we believe comparative rater conversion is a fantastic benchmark for us to truly understand how competitive we are overall in the agency marketplace.
Last year at this time, I also shared that we had just introduced 8.3, our latest auto product model. And while the early results were encouraging, we were in a couple of states and we were seeing significant growth overall from the product model. At this point, about 18 months later, I'm thrilled to share that, that growth continues to come in at expected levels, but it's highly concentrated on the more preferred end of the spectrum. So our growth rates with Wrights and with Robinsons are significantly higher than they are in our other segments. These segments are absolutely foundational to how we win in the Destination Era, and our product design and product development is helping us get there.
But we all know that Progressive is known for new business acquisition. We do a great job. We probably do the best job in the industry. But the reality of it is, sustainable premium growth doesn't just come from acquiring new customers. We have to retain them. And I'm pleased to show that when we look at retention from the agency channel, we see after a dip in early 2015 through about the middle of the year, we've been increasing our agency policy life expectancy month-on-month ever since. And Andrew will talk a little bit more about more details around decomposing that, but the drivers of that are twofold: number one, it's mix, so our mix of new customers has improved. We refer to that as nature. But equal parts of improvement in our PLE are coming from experience improvements and relationships within our customer relationship management organization. Those investments are paying off, and Andrew will tell you a little bit more about that later.
What's particularly exciting to me though, when I look at our retention improvements, is to overlay our rate activity during the same period of time. So your orange bars are annualized rate change within the agency channel for each month during that same period. What you'll notice is during the period of time that our retention was improving, we were raising rates, somewhere between 2%, 2.5% to 4%. And we do that to keep up with trend and ensure we continue to deliver our target margins. But the combination of being able to improve retention while also increasing rates indicates to us 2 things: number one, market conditions are fantastic for growth in the agency channel and we are really, really well-positioned; but number two, given the plethora of choices that agents have to move business to, when rates go up, the fact that our rate increases are sticking indicates to us we've got stronger relationships that are forming in the agency channel, and that's a critical element of our long-term destination success.
Insurance is a trust-based business. And trust is a really difficult thing for us to measure, unlike many of our other metrics. But we look at actions as opposed to words to understand how we're performing from a trust perspective. Number one, are agents trusting us by placing their better customers with us? The answer is yes. Number two, are they trusting us to interact with those customers on a regular basis? The answer is yes. More agents are opting in to our joint marketing programs for additional protection, quote resolicitation, et cetera. And number three, in a recent survey of thousands of independent agents, they responded that increasingly, Progressive has all the products to meet the needs of their preferred customers and more of those agents responded that they're placing their preferred customers with us. The turnaround in the agency channel was driven by a combination of product and stronger relationship building. And we fully expect that the momentum we've established to date with this turnaround will carry into our second priority, which is bundled penetration.
Growing bundled penetration is the key performance indicator of our Destination Era. Making progress, selling both home and auto to our combined customers is essential to our long-term success. And the things you need to drive bundled penetration are: number one, available and competitive property insurance; number two, available and competitive preferred auto rates; and number three, the systems, tools and experiences that enable customers and agents to find, quote, buy and ultimately own a Progressive policy or a Progressive bundle. We'll stay with the agency channel for now and talk about where we're headed from a bundled penetration perspective.
Last year, I shared that we were in the process of deploying ASI's property product country-wide. Since we last talked, we've added 9 states, and by the end of this year, we'll be in 39 states, representing about 95% of U.S. homeowners, great coverage for where we are in the rollout. We go to market from an agency perspective with our property product through 2 tiers of agencies. Those 2 tiers of agencies are Progressive Advantage agencies, Progressive Home Advantage agencies and our Platinum agencies. The 2 tiers, Progressive Home Advantage a little more broadly distributed, they are our original property agencies. And Platinum is a much higher tier, more highly selective tier of agents and a much stronger partnership with us. I shared with you last year that Platinum is a brand-new program that we're introducing last summer that combined consumer benefits of annual policies, more competitive rates through multi-policy discounts and agent benefits, such as easier-to-use systems and higher compensation. We continue to deploy the Platinum program as well. Platinum, by the end of this year, will be in 34 states, which represent about 80% of U.S. homeowners. And because preferred auto and property availability are prereqs to the Platinum rollout, Platinum will always trail the rollout of our property product. But overall, we intend to continue pushing on a country-wide basis until we have full deployment of preferred auto, available property and Platinum on a national basis.
But with Platinum, it's less about the states that we're in and much more about the agencies that we're in within those states. So over the last year, we've identified, selected and ultimately, onboarded more than 1,000 agencies into our Platinum program. Based on those agencies, access to preferred customers, their bundled quote and sale processes within the agency and their willingness to commit to placing a significant portion of their bundled volume with Progressive. But to be clear, Platinum rollout will be a metered rollout. Platinum has a scarcity and a scarcely distributed offering. So agents will be actively managed by our sales reps to ensure they're using the Platinum program and understand it and are using it for bundled business within their agency. So we will continue to grow Platinum, but we will grow Platinum as agents are using it effectively in market.
I also shared last year that because ease-of-use for bundled quoting is a key element of our Platinum offering, we were starting to build a new Platinum quoting program. And earlier this year, we launched Platinum quoting which brings to the agent's desktop for the first time, bundled quoting of Progressive's auto and ASI's home, which enables the agent to ultimately save time, share data entry screens and external data fill and have more competitive messaging around the bundled economics available to the agent and making it easier for them to message those bundled savings to the customer. Now to be clear, this is a pilot. It's in 3 states today. We've learned a bunch to date, we'll continue to learn from the pilot, and ultimately, we'll build those enhancements into our quoting systems over time.
But the billion-dollar question on all of our minds, and likely all of your minds is, is Platinum working? We've attacked the preferred market in agency a few times before, and we've learned from those attacks. We've learned from those opportunities that ultimately, for us to introduce a brand-new preferred offering into some of the best agencies in an incredibly competitive independent agency channel, we would have to change agent behavior, which we all know isn't simple, and frankly, it sometimes takes time. So to understand whether Platinum is working, we look at the 2015 cohort of Platinum agents, those that were appointed as Platinum agents during 2015. Think of it as the Class of 2015, if you will. And we look at 2 key performance metrics for that group of agencies relative to the rest of our property insurance agencies. What you'll see on your screen is 2 lines, the blue line is our Platinum agencies, the orange line is our PHA agencies. And the metric here is preferred auto production. What you'll notice between those lines is, number one, the blue line starts above the orange line. Not surprisingly, more productive agencies were selected to be Platinum in the first place. But you'll notice that after the vertical red line, there's an increasing separation from a production perspective between our Platinum agencies and our non-Platinum other property agencies.
This continues into our second key performance metric, and that's new business home and auto bundles, where you'll see exactly the same pattern. Blue, Platinum agents, started above our PHA agencies, and the gap continues to widen. As our sales reps message the benefits of Platinum, our agents better understand the benefits of Platinum and for their customers, they start to experience some of the benefits that come from buying through a Platinum agency. The gap between that blue and orange line is what we refer to as the Platinum difference. And that Platinum difference is not just present with the agents we appointed during 2015. If you look at the entire network of more than 1,000 Platinum agencies compared to our non-Platinum property agencies, you'll see that our Platinum agency plant is responsible for creating more than 3x the number of bundles per agent, per week than our non-Platinum agencies, which absolutely tells us that Platinum is working.
What you'll also notice on this graph, though, is the trend is upward, meaning we're improving over time. Numbers bounce around from month-to-month, but we are on an upward trend. And the guideline on the screen indicates where we expect the program to be ultimately from a success perspective. You'll notice we're not there. And that gap exists, but we know what we're going to do to close that gap. The primary driver of it is our bundled competitiveness.
Well, not surprisingly, when we were launching our program, we started collecting data from the market as to where we were competitive and were not competitive. And the great thing is with 1,000 agencies, using their quoting systems to quote ASI property and Progressive auto, we are getting a ton of data on where we are and where we are not competitive. We use conversion as our primary metric, and when you look at states that represent about 1/3 of our premium, we are highly competitive on the monoline auto, the monoline home and on the bundle for an individual risk. In those agencies, our focus is to sell what the customer is looking for. If they're looking for home, sell them home; if they're looking for auto, sell them auto, or try to sell them the bundle, because we are highly competitive.
However, in about 2/3 of the country right now, we are highly competitive on monoline home or monoline auto, but not yet as competitive on the bundle for individual risks. This shouldn't come as much surprise given we had a highly successful monoline auto business that we combined with a highly successful monoline home business. And the overlap between the 2 isn't quite where we need it to be. But the bottom line is we know exactly what needs to be done, and we're collecting a ton of data that enables us to map out how to integrate our products more closely to make sure that we're more competitive at the individual risk on a country-wide basis.
So for us, the momentum that we saw as we were bringing our agency turnaround ultimately into bundled competitiveness, combined with the infrastructure investments we continue to make in the agency channel and early success of what we're seeing from a Platinum perspective, gives us a ton of confidence that we are absolutely on the right track from a bundled penetration perspective and very, very well-positioned to attack that $100 billion independent agency home and auto opportunity.
With that said, we have another highly successful auto distribution channel and that's direct. So I want to update you on where we are from a bundled competitiveness perspective within the direct channel. To be a direct customer's destination for auto and other insurance, we not only have to have all the products they need throughout their lifetime, but they have to be aware of them and understand that we have them available before they have a life event that triggers demand for that product. So they come to us first as opposed to shopping in market. We generate awareness for our products with our direct customers 3 primary ways: Mass media advertising, it reaches not only our current customers but also reaches future customers; point-of-sale messaging, and this is both in our sale systems as well as our servicing systems, so both current customers and potential customers who visit to get a quote understand the breadth of products available and the economic benefits of buying through us; and finally, targeted marketing. We have a ton of monoline customers that we are now offering the bundled package and the complementary product through messaging the savings and ease-of-use benefits of bringing more of those products to Progressive over time.
These awareness investments, coupled with a general shift in consumer buying trends towards direct and some internal messaging that gets our employees thinking holistically about protecting our customers' household needs, continues to drive up demand for direct property insurance, both online, on the phones, with current customers and with future customers. But great demand and increase in demand for our direct property products creates no value unless we can meet that demand with adequate supply. And frankly, in early 2015, our ability to meet the demand for direct property was less than we wanted it to be.
Only about 4 in 5 customers coming to us for direct property could even get a quote. Part of that is just endemic with the property insurance business. Unlike Progressive, there's virtually no property writers who have similar broad acceptability. Property writers have a relatively niche focus and some may not accept 20%, 30%, 40% of available risks.
That's an unacceptable outcome for our direct customers. So what we've done over time is worked, number one, with our carrier partners to expand acceptability and improve routing of traffic online and through our partner call centers to improve availability of direct quoting. But what's particularly exciting on this chart is the yellow line. The yellow line represents our Progressive Advantage Agency, which is our in-house agency that sells multiple products from a property perspective across multiple property partners.
Over the last 1.5 years, we've made significant investments to expand the footprint of that agency by adding 14 states and adding more than 100 state and carrier combinations in order to drive up availability of this, of our property products. At this point, we can meet the needs of about 95% of current or future customers who contact our agency. And we believe that agency model is a superior shopping experience for anyone shopping direct-to-consumer property insurance, because it combines the technology enabled ease-of-use of a direct writer with the breadth and depth of an independent agency. We believe strongly in that model and we continue to invest to expand capabilities within our Progressive Advantage Agency.
In the last 18 months, we more than doubled staffing and when calls come in, we route an increased percentage of those to the agency, to the point that at this point, we've more than tripled the sales over the last 18 months through the agency. We will continue to invest in that space and continue to use this superior business model to delight our direct customers from a bundled penetration perspective. But for us, bundling is not just about home and auto. It's also about home -- renters and auto. So in our world, we enjoy an advantaged position with younger, simpler needs, auto insurance customers, many of whom don't yet own a home. So having renters insurance available for those customers enables us, number one, to establish a property insurance relationship with customers and to be able to meet a broader need of those customers earlier in their insurance shopping journey. Renters insurance will never be a massive business for us. It's only about a $4 billion market. But for us, it is a strategic investment, because renters insurance is absolutely a gateway property product towards becoming a bundled home and auto customer with us. We have evidence that those who bundle renters and auto with us are significantly more likely to keep their auto with us and convert that renters to a homeowners policy if and when they eventually buy a home. So from a graduating Diane perspective, this is a strategic play for us and one we continue to invest in over time.
We are absolutely thrilled with the acceleration of our penetration from a bundling perspective within our direct book of business. Today, more than 1 million direct customers trust us to provide property protection. And the key performance metrics for our direct property business, increasing quote starts, bundled new apps and bundled PIFs, are all up more than 20% on a year-over-year basis. And with the investments we continue to make to drive demand and then meet that demand with ample supply and great experiences, we have every confidence we will continue to accelerate bundled penetration within the direct book of business.
The third priority that I shared with you last year was to continue to advance our science of risk segmentation. Customer segmentation, matching rate to risk and pricing accuracy are in our DNA and absolutely a key source of competitive advantage for Progressive. It's been that way for decades and one of the things that truly differentiates and distinguishes our offering. As we look to invest in rate accuracy and pricing segmentation, we recognize that the value it creates, through more competitive new business pricing, which lowers our customer acquisition costs on a fixed advertising base, it increases our retention even if customers shop, they can't replace similar coverage at a similar or lower price and it creates adverse selection within the marketplace, a fantastic trifecta of opportunity for Progressive. So when we think about the product development space, we focus on 3 areas, the first is rate accuracy, the second is coverages and the third is improving customer experience to drive policy life expectancy. We build bundles of these enhancements in the product model and deploy them like building blocks, stacked on top of all of the segmentation that existed in the prior model.
Our pipeline from a road map perspective is absolutely robust from a product development standpoint. We're currently on 8.3 in the majority of our states. 8.3 was designed to be more competitive on preferred households and multiproduct customers. You've already heard how that's performing in market. We are thrilled with how it's working.
84 is deploying currently. Tomorrow morning, it'll be our seventh state elevating for 84 and 84 brings with it more stable rates for our renewal customers as well as advanced segmentation based on billing, claims experience and vehicle history. 845 is 84 with some additional protection for transportation network company drivers, Progressive customers who happen to work for an Uber or Lyft. And finally, 85, which is under development right now and will launch in early 2018, will bring with it much more competitive rates for households with usefuls as well as -- well, I'm not going to tell you what else is in 85, you're going to have to come back next year to learn more about that. But rest assured, we are not taking our foot off the accelerator from the product development perspective and intend to continue to lead from the segmentation perspective. But the best segmentation in the world creates no value if we can't get it to market quickly. And while we've always been known for our nimbleness and ability to deploy our products to market quickly, we recognize from a core value perspective that excellence is doing things better today than we did yesterday and we continue to invest to advance our speed to market. So in the last 24 months, there's been a joint research and development and IT team, reengineering our process of product development and product deployment. And since we last talked in May, they've been able to double the annualized rate with which we can deploy our product innovation into the marketplace. So what that means is when we talked in May, we had 3 states on 8.3. Today, we have 32 states. As of tomorrow, we'll have 7 states on 84. When we talk next year, we'll have 38 states on 84 and 85 will be spun up just about to hit the market. This lethal combination of product innovation and speed to market enables us to widen our lead over the competition. And when we look to assess how well we're doing relative to the competition, we start by looking at some industry data. The industry data you're seeing on the screen is loss in LAE for PCI, essentially about 2/3 of the market, 9 of the Top 10 carriers in the orange line, and then Progressive in the blue line. What you'll notice is that environmental activities, be it economic recovery, gas prices, severity on low price in the cars due to safety equipment, trend in the industry has been climbing since the middle of 2012. But you'll also notice that the blue line, the progressive loss in LAE, we've been competing in that exact same environment, and the reality of it is our results have been rock solid. The difference between these 2 lines is product segmentation. It's our ability to better understand what risks we're insuring and better sort out which ones are high cost from low cost. What that means in the marketplace is those in the orange line, the rest of the market, as their loss costs are climbing and they don't know which risks are driving those loss costs up, they raise base rates. And when they raise base rates, the best customers in their book of business shop and they can often find a lower price with companies like us that are better segmented. Run this cycle over and over enough times and they're left with residual risks that they're still underpriced on and priced dramatically higher than the market on any of the better risks that we insure. What it also means, though, for us is today, we enjoy about a 10-point gap in loss in LAE relative to the market and when you combine that with our technology-enabled expense gap, specifically in the agency channel, what it enables us to do is combine incredibly competitive pricing in market, which drives the growth of the business, with wider underwriting profit margins than the overall industry, delivering on our profit targets. A great combination for an insurance business.
Now I also told you last year that emerging data sources were an opportunity as opposed to a threat for Progressive. And since making our majority investments in ASI or ARX, we've been building a massive data set of home and auto risk characteristics and home and auto loss characteristics. What this has enabled us to do is improve model accuracy, identify new segmentation and reduce our rating costs. An early example of how we're leveraging this data set was an auto rating variable that was highly predictive of home loss frequency, to the tune of about a 30% difference in pure premium. As we identified that, ASI quickly jumped on it and deployed it to market. So it's providing a segmentation list as a bundled household that they wouldn't normally have had absent the joining of this data. And to be frank, we are just getting started digging into this massive data set and fully expect that the joint R&D team between ASI and Progressive will leverage this treasure trove of information to identify new ways to assess and ultimately price and improve rate accuracy for our household bundled pricing.
So last year, I shared with you some fairly aggressive goals for our overall business. With the turnaround in our agency business as well as great performance from our direct business, coupled with the investments we're making to increase bundled penetration across both our direct and our agency business, our robust product development pipeline of future segmentation enhancements and the faster speed to market on top of already leading the industry, I am absolutely confident that we are incredibly well-positioned to become consumers' #1 choice and destination for auto and other insurance.
With that, I'll bring John Sauerland on to talk about Snapshot and data management."

It's been a while since we gave you a deep dive on Snapshot, our usage-based rating program. We have a new model in the marketplace, I'll share results around that, but also share more holistically why Snapshot is so powerful for Progressive.
Later this year, we will roll out a new delivery mechanism to experience for Snapshot and that is via mobile. I'll share the rollout plans there, we're very excited by that, but I'll also share what our expected benefits from that rollout are. But overarching all of this is something that I think is even more powerful than Snapshot, sort of an ancillary benefit from Snapshot, if you will, and that is the big data management and analysis capabilities that we've developed around Snapshot that are now paying dividends across the organization and I believe can be a source of competitive advantage going forward.
If you're familiar with Progressive, you know that we have a history of innovation. I would say that Snapshot is as a result of that history of innovation. We started out many years ago installing this football-size device in the trunks of some cars in Texas, proved out the concept a little bit. We enjoyed the benefits of Moore's law, shrinking of technology. I mean, we're able to get the technology into a device that could plug into an OBD port on a vehicle. Unfortunately, back then, connectivity was an issue. We mailed this device to our customers, along with a cord that we asked them to go find. Six months after plugging the device in their car, plug that cord in the device, into their desktop, more than likely back then, by the way, and more than likely try and upload via their dial-up modem. Obviously, not a big hit. What was a big hit was when we were able to get the technology and especially the cell chip small enough and the cell transmission costs low enough so that we had virtually real-time transmission of the data. In today's world, we sort of call that the Internet of Things. Back then, it was just via cell towers.
Soon, we're going to be moving to mobile. I will talk more about that in a bit, so I won't spend time here now. The ultimate model for Snapshot is not via device, not via your phone, it's directly from the vehicle. Really happy to say we're actually in market today with that model with General Motors. General Motors is the only car manufacturer, to my knowledge, with that capability today. As you all know, technology takes a long time to move into the fleet. This won't be a broad-based model soon. But nevertheless, we're excited to be in partnership with GM, in market, and I'll share a bit more about that in a moment.
If Moore's law allows you to shrink technology, I believe, there's got to be a corollary to Moore's law that says that data coming out of that technology doubles every 2 years or even every 1 year. We now have 2.2 trillion records in our database from Snapshot, 2.2 trillion records. If you think about those records as rows on a spreadsheet, those rows are widening. The blue area on the chart here is GPS data. While we don't today rate on GPS, we are collecting it for research purposes and it widens the data field, if you will. When we introduce mobile, we'll be collecting even more information. Mobile will take that width of that record 20-fold from where it is today. The data explosion here is incredible. It's been a challenge, it's also a huge opportunity. We'll talk more about that in a moment.
But let me take a step back first and make sure I have everyone grounded in Snapshot. We have 2 models in the marketplace today. We're not great with naming, it was the 2.0 model and the 3.0 model. The 3.0 model has rolled out with 8.3. So in the majority of the country today, as Pat Callahan just mentioned to you, in the 2.0 model, we didn't give you a discount when you opted into Snapshot. You came to Progressive or an agent, agreed to the Snapshot program, 30 days later, we give you a discount based on your 30 days of driving behavior. Drive for 5 months more, we lock you in for the rest of your tenure with Progressive. 3.0, we offer a participation discount. It varies by customer segment, we'll talk about that in a moment, then you drive for 6 months. Here again, we lock you in to your discount or a surcharge. So that's a big change with the 3.0 model. With 2.0, we're very concerned about establishing consumer acceptance for the concept because we have been the leader in UBI. We've gotten consumer acceptance, we're in a place now where consumers are willing to opt-in to the program, as you'll see, even if there's a chance for a surcharge. So in the 2.0 model, we had up to a 30% discount, 0% surcharge. In the 3.0 model, we have up to a 20% discount and up to a 10% surcharge. So similar range, very different model. In 2.0, about 60% of our customers who partook, got a discount. In 3.0, about 75% of our customers get a discount and in 3.0, more than half of our customers received more than a 10% discount, which is pretty material in the auto insurance space. So giving you perspective on the different models, keep that in mind as we talk about results. And I'll also give you a little bit more perspective on the distribution of our customers' driving behavior. The results. They're good. New apps are up, I can't attribute all of this to Snapshot, however. As I mentioned, the 3.0 model rolled out at the same time as 8.3, we made a lot of changes here, we can't tease it out completely. But new apps are up, and this is just Snapshot apps on the graph in front of you. One of the things I hope you will notice is that agency apps are up more. We've been challenged around agency adoption of Snapshot for many years now, frankly. The inclusion of an upfront discount, a participation discount, helps us a lot in the agency channel. As Pat told you, it's largely driven by comparative raters, somewhat of an auction environment, the more we can get a more competitive rate up there at new business, the better chance we have of getting customers into Snapshot.
I mentioned those discounts, the participation discounts vary by customer set. Ranges from about 2 percentage for Sams, up to about 6-ish percent for Robinsons. We define that participation discount not based solely on the customer marketing target there, but that's the average of the discount for each respective segment. Not surprisingly, conversion is up more on the preferred end of the spectrum. Even with 2.0, Snapshot customers converted at a higher rate than non-Snapshot customers. So being interested in Snapshot improves your conversion rate, all else equal. And in 3.0, we obviously see that continuing, but we also see a greater disparity, not surprisingly, on the more preferred end of the spectrum, where the participation discounts are higher. 
When we look at new apps by customer segment, here again, the mix skews a bit towards the preferred end. But what I hope you also notice is that the slope, if you will, of that relationship in the agency business is higher, it's steeper. We're getting more Robinsons into this business, into the Snapshot program. Pat and Tricia told you, the Robinson segment is the largest segment available to us in the Personal Lines space and it's our lowest market share. So to the extent we can get more customers in here, that's fantastic.
Something not necessarily specific to 3.0, but I think representative of where we're at today when it comes to usage-based rating, is the fact that it is broadly acceptable. And I'm just sharing you one example here and this is age. So when you look by customer segment, the percentage of folks 18- to 22-year-old who opt-in to Snapshot is about the same as the percentage of folks who are 55 and above. Not 100% acceptable in the marketplace for sure, but broadly acceptable.
So hopefully, I've convinced you that Snapshot is helping us on preferred, it's helping us grow. I often get the question, and even got it in the lobby before this, is that can you tell me how is it helping? Put numbers to that for me. Some facts. The most powerful rating variable we have ever seen and with 3.0, even more powerful than 2.0. So our analysts are working hard on improving those algorithms. 3.0 even more predictive of losses than 2.0, and 2.0 was way more predictive than any other rating variable we've seen. Another fact. We provided more than a $0.5 billion of discounts to customers with Snapshot inception to-date. More than $0.5 billion worth of discounts. Those folks think, well, that seems to be a benefit for a customer, how is that a benefit for Progressive? To help answer that, I'm going to take you back to a chart that we showed you actually in 2012. This chart shows the loss ratio and the retention rate across discount buckets, if you will, for Snapshot customers. So we have 0% to 30% discount along the horizontal there, and to the left of that 0, we have non-Snapshot customers. So think of those as your base case. So the majority of our customers don't opt-in to Snapshot, so that's a robust base case. And what do we see? This is again 2.0. When a customer got a 0% discount from us, they will actually do a surcharge. But again, we didn't do that for consumer acceptance reasons. The highest loss ratio is for customers with 0 discount. As you see, the loss ratio improves markedly as you go to the right. It's important to look at the scale on this graph. That loss ratio is much better for the best drivers who are receiving the biggest discounts.
When you look at the retention line, the consumers who expected to receive a discount and did not, the 0 percentage, lowest retention. Those customers leave way more frequently and when they leave, where do they go? They go to our competitors. By and large, our competitors are not priced for this. So those customers are going for more than likely a lower rate than we're offering them, so we believe they materially miss price at the competitor.
You go out on the right, not surprisingly, retention improves a lot as you give people bigger discounts, but the big 2 points I want you to take away here is the least profitable customers, and frequently, the unprofitable customers, leave most frequently. The most profitable customers are way more inclined to stay.
In auto insurance, I would tell you, in any business model, if you have a program where your best, most profitable customers are most inclined to stay, and your least profitable or even unprofitable customers find their way to your competitor, that's a great program. Pat Callahan showed you the industry loss ratio graph, Progressive was here, right, the industry on a pretty decent slope up. This isn't the only reason, but this is the kind of segmentation that we believe drives that disparity in the marketplace. So let's look at 3.0. Here, you can see we are not surcharging those customers who are on the worse end. So our loss ratio for those customers goes down. Customers out on the -- more -- better driver end of the spectrum, higher discounts. Again, better loss ratio, not quite as low as with 2.0, but still exceptional. You look at that scale. And when you look at retention, because we're surcharging customers, they leave even more frequently than they did in the previous model, and not surprisingly, consumers we're offering the discount to continue to stay at a much higher rate. So Snapshot is getting us more preferred customers. It is helping rating segmentation, adverse selection a lot. Hope you got those points.
Our next step for Snapshot is mobile. We've been very deliberate in coming to market with mobile. If you think about the challenges in measuring driving behavior with a phone, there are obviously many, right? Some of you take the train, some of you take the bus, you commute with a friend, you leave your phone at home, what have you, a lot of challenges and we wanted to make sure we got this right. We've done a ton of testing. And just to give you an appreciation of those challenges, what you're looking at here is an example of a real test case, so an individual with the app and the device in the car. This is about 2 months of driving, each row represents a day, 24 hours across the horizontal axis of a day, not surprising, and what do we see? So if the blocks are purple, that means the device and your phone are showing a trip, they're matching up. If the block is blue, that means the device is just showing a trip, not the phone. Red the opposite. Red is the phone showing the trip, not the device. So if you stare at this, you say, okay, it looks like we have a commute pattern, right? Five days a week, we drive to work and we drive home. And we take our phones to work and they're on. We don't see that on a commute, right? What else do you see? Well, there's some blue sections, those blue sections look to me like they're more on the weekend, maybe a spouse is driving the car, maybe a kid is driving the car. The red dots in the middle are very intriguing to me. My conclusion, I don't know this test case, is that this person has a regular scheduled Monday lunch date and the buddy drives, to lunch then back, interesting things. But the point is how do we account for this and still have really accurate driving data to rate on. We worked with a ton of app developers, the technology is amazing. The app is able to learn the driver's fingerprint, if you will. And it learns it pretty quickly, I have an app, and I can tell when my child is driving the car, when my spouse is driving the car, it excludes those trips. Thankfully, for my own personal rate. You get the point. How about this, we can look after a trip starts, back to see if the driver got in the left side of the car or the right side of the car. Technology in phones is amazing now. We worked really hard to make sure this is right. Let me give you a picture of the rating reason behind why we've worked so hard to make sure this is right. We worked with a number of different companies developing apps. Hard brakes are our most important rating data field for UBI. So you want your phone to reflect a brake about the same time as you want your device to reflect a brake, right?
The graph on the right shows pretty tight relationship, graph on the left not so much. I'm really happy to tell you that we chose the app on the right. And I'm almost as happy to tell you that we're pretty confident a competitor was using the app on the left. Really important that we got it right. We think we have it right, we'll have 2 states out before the end of the year. We expect to have the rest of the country rolled out in the first half of next year. We think it's a great rating tool. We also know it's going to be a better consumer experience. Today, we mail a lot of devices to customers, not all of them come back, but the customer has to take it, unbox it, put it in their car, extract it from the vehicle, mail it back to us. It's a logistical challenge and it's costly. We've previously told you the technology expenses with our current model is about a point on the P&L. Mobile will completely eliminate technology expenses for sure, but it will materially reduce those costs. As I mentioned to you, the long-term model, we believe, is data right from the vehicle. Again, this won't be a broad-based model anytime soon because of the pace of technology penetrating the fleet. But it's a fantastic model, it's working really well, it's small so far, admittedly. General Motors customers' model year 2015 and greater have this capability, all voluntary. They can opt-in to sharing 90 days of driving behavior with Progressive. If it looks like we'll give that customer a discount, we'll offer them a quote. If it looks like they wouldn't be due a discount, we won't offer them a quote. Think back on that loss ratio curve. The customers we are selling to here have a very high average discount. What was true about the most -- the highest average discount customers in our programs, they're the most profitable, right? So we've got a model here where we can just sell to the most profitable drivers with our current algorithms. It will evolve, we'll probably tailor to the various methods of measurement, but today, it's a great model, we're really excited to be in market with General Motors and we're excited to talk to you more about that in the future.
I told you that the data explosion has been rapid. I told you that it's been a challenge for us, frankly. This graph shifts to terabytes as opposed to trillions of records. Back in 2013, our analysts were struggling because it was taking them almost a month to process the Snapshot data set, almost a month. We literally had analysts trying to create mini server farms in the closets near their workspaces. We got smart, we brought in the right technology, we developed the talent internally, our processing time dropped dramatically, going up a little bit as the data set grows further, but the better news here is that we are now using this technology across other parts of the company. When we were together last year, Pat Callahan told you we were starting to look at claims fraud using big data techniques. We now have that fully rolled out. Every night, we are looking at hundreds of data elements through our claims file, through our policy files and looking for the potential for fraud. We don't identify fraud with this model, we refer it to an individual who does the further investigation and does the right thing handling the claim. We're using traditional data, but we're also using what's called unstructured data, which in this case means text. So claims adjusters are typing in notes into our systems, this mines the text and joins that with other data to look for potential fraud. What you're looking at on the screen here is a network of claims that we had previously identified as fraudulent, run it through the system overnight, the claim in blue pops out, suspect claim. Our adjuster does more investigation: 3 vehicle accident, 6 injuries claimed in this accident. Further investigation revealed the damage on the vehicles did not match the facts as reported by the injured parties, we are able to deny the claim. Previously, our model here has been if it looks suspect, the adjuster refers to an expert. I can't tell you we would have missed this one, but I can tell you, I bet we would have missed this one. And I can tell you, we're looking at a lot more claims much more with a zero in target [ph] sort of approach today than we previously did.
One more example in that arena. We previously had identified a suspect claim, run through the system overnight and we find 1 data element common with 166 other policies in our database. What we had identified here upon further investigation is what we call a street broker. In urban areas, where auto insurance is very expensive, there are enterprising individuals who use our systems to take your information and create an ID card and sell you that ID card for a couple of hundred bucks cash. They generally are using a stolen credit card or another means to buy the policy or immediately cancel the policy. So what we had here was 166 people who were probably not in the right state with their auto insurance, we were able to reach out to those customers and do the right thing and get them into the right place.
Another quick example, you probably know that big data has been in play in the e-marketing, online marketing space for a long time and we've actually enjoyed the benefits of vendor or third-party solutions, optimizing advertising networks online with banner ads, that kind of thing. We are now using this processing power to design the experience. In our direct business, we pay a lot to get a prospect in the door. We do a lot to make sure we streamline that funnel, if you will, get them the quote, get them into the buy process. Historically, we've done really well with that, but we've done it somewhat painstakingly, frankly, because we do A/B tests. We want -- try the orange button versus the blue button, the button over here versus the button over here. But we've done it really, really well. And historically, we did something in this case that we call the coverage packaging tool. We used 7 variables to optimize the experience with the customer and we were able to improve the funnel, the yield, by about 4%. And if 4% doesn't feel like a lot to you, we have a lot of direct prospects. That's about $0.5 billion of lifetime premium. Today, we're using what we call real-time decisioning. We're looking at more than 3x as many variables as we used to. We've been able to improve the yield another 4% and growing and we've been able to do it in about 1/5 of the time.
Tons of opportunities, I could go on with examples. I hope you get the picture. The data space is booming. Even with Snapshot, due to GPS, due to mobile, this curve is going to get steeper. Layer on top of that, that unstructured data we just talked about, the text. In our call centers, we've been translating voice to text for many years now. We're able to mine that as well. Andrew Quigg will talk about that in a moment. We're now starting to ingest images, photos and video. That will soon be, not today yet for us, that will soon be data we mesh with all the other data in our systems as well. We have been a leader in using data and analysis for segmentation, for experience design, to our competitive advantage. I believe the opportunity to do that and differentiate ourselves versus the competition is only going to grow and we expect to lead.
Now I'm going to hand the floor over to Andrew Quigg to talk customer relationship management. And here again, I think you will see similar themes through Andrew's talk."
33352,328425460,1054443,"Progressive Corp., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 06, 2016",2016-10-06,"Earnings Calls","The Progressive Corporation","Executives","Thank you, John. I have the pleasure of speaking to you today on 2 topics. The first half of the section will be on retention, and I'm going to tell you about the improving momentum we see with our retention. And then in the second half of the section, I'",4180,"Thank you, John. I have the pleasure of speaking to you today on 2 topics. The first half of the section will be on retention, and I'm going to tell you about the improving momentum we see with our retention. And then in the second half of the section, I'll provide an overview of our customer marketing initiative and I'll describe the advanced analytics we're applying to this problem, as John Sauerland alluded to.
So first off, I want to just reiterate our preferred retention measure, which is Policy Life Expectancy or PLE. PLE is the average length of time we expect a new policy to stay with Progressive. We calculate PLE by first calculating our retention decay curve, and then we take the area under this curve to get our PLE statistic. That retention decay curve can be calculated multiple ways depending on the trade-off in responsiveness versus stability that we see. Our standard measure is to use 12 months for each point along that curve. That is our trailing 12 PLE that we've always reported out. We also calculate a trailing 3 PLE starting in 2014. That trailing 3 PLE uses 3, the most recent 3 months along that retention decay curve. So it's more responsive to more recent observations. Just some notes on the PLE calculation. The first 60 months represent actual data that we've recently observed and between months 60 and 300, we use an extrapolation. And we've seen all policies end after 300 months, which is a conservative assumption. We think the PLE statistic is accurate for a number of reasons and I'll highlight one of those today. We think it removes any tenure bias. So if we use simple retention rates, as our book of business ages, all else being equal, we think we'd see higher retention rates and that would be although that retention curve didn't shift. So using the PLE calculation removes any tenure bias from our statistics.
So with that background, I wanted to give you an update on the current progress with trailing 12 PLE. I'm happy to report that we've seen very positive PLE growth in 2016. We are up 6% year-over-year. 6% year-over-year, there we go. This is the largest increase since 2009 and as Tricia said on our last quarterly conference call, for every one month of PLE, we see $1.5 billion in additional lifetime earned premium for the company. We're also pleased that we're seeing similar percentage increases within our agency channel and in our direct channel and direct is at an all-time high. While we're really pleased with the overall momentum we see, we're even more pleased with what we see with our Robinsons in the Destination Era. For our Robinsons, PLE is up 17% over the past 3 years. And the past 12 months, we're up 9%. So just great momentum that we're seeing with the Robinsons. As Tricia alluded to earlier, the Robinsons are now 3x greater and yearly 3.5x greater than our Sams for PLE.
We'll also be adjusting the PLE calculation in the coming months. We haven't updated that extrapolation for a while, and we're seeing better retention in that tail of the PLE curve than we've seen historically. And so when we update the PLE calculation, overall PLEs will go up by more than -- by about 2%. And for our Robinsons, it will be even higher. Our Robinsons are disproportionately represented in the tail of the PLE curve. This means that we'll have even more opportunity with our Robinsons. We'll be able to acquire them more aggressively, and we'll be able to bundle our current customers more aggressively. 
So far, I've spoken inclusively about the trailing 12 PLE, but I want to go back to the trailing 3 that I talked about in the opening. If we think about the difference between the trailing 3 and the trailing 12 PLE is the unrealized momentum in our PLE data. And we're very pleased with what we see here. For total auto, the trading 3 PLE is up 8% year-over-year. For the trailing 12 PLE, it's up 6%. So we think we have about 2 points of unrealized momentum within our PLE. As you can see across all of our segments, the trailing 3 PLE is higher year-over-year than the trailing 12, so we feel like we have a lot of momentum. But the highest difference is for our Robinsons. For Robinsons, we think we have about 4 points of momentum that we haven't yet realized. I want to stop here and just talk about the goal that Tricia outlined for us in 2015. Tricia has challenged us to increase retention by 50%. We think we can achieve this in 3 ways. First, we believe we can change our mix. In the Destination Era, we think we can change our mix to more preferred customers and new business. Pat outlined some of the strategies we have there. In addition to changing mix, we think we can improve our price competitiveness relative to the competition. Pat showed the slide where we have increasing agency PLE while overall rates are being increased. And third, we believe we can improve the customer experience. We think we can nurture our customers to stay with Progressive longer, and I'll spend some time on that in the next section. We think this path to a 50% increase runs through our more preferred segments. We see more opportunities with our more preferred segments to increase retention. And then as the mix of our business changes, we believe we'll hit that overall goal of increasing retention by 50%. 
I want to switch gears here and start talking about the nurture side of things. But I want to pause and just talk about data for a minute and specifically, how we're using data for customer experience. We see a virtuous cycle in our pricing. I started off in product management, this was a big part of our roles. In pricing, we see that when we acquire customers, we are paying their data. And with that data, we can derive segmentation and insights and improve our pricing, which allows us to acquire more customers, which gives us more data, which gives us better segmentation, a virtuous cycle exists within our pricing. We think the same virtuous cycle exists with our customers in customer experience, specifically with our customers, we gain customers and then we interact with them. Those interactions generate data and that data provides insights and ideas in segmentation. That allows us to increase retention, which allows us to have more customers. And more customers provides more interactions and more data and we get a virtuous cycle here within customer experience as well. And in the Destination Era, as we gain more products, we think that cycle spins even faster, more products means more interactions, which means more data. So as we invest in the Destination Era, we think we'll have even more predictive data to use with our customers. We give you that background because leveraging data is part of a larger initiative that we're working on here at Progressive. In the 2015 investor relations meeting, Glenn said that we need to be as good at customer marketing as we are at consumer marketing. And so we've put a joint team together from our customer relationship management organization and corporate marketing, and that team is working on this customer marketing initiative. There are 4 pillars that we talk about with the customer marketing initiatives. The first is that we want to improve our customer knowledge. We want to assemble as much predictive data as we can for our customers, so that we know the experiences that they're going through. After that, we want to improve our customer engagement. There's 2 parts to this. We want to improve the processes that they go through, and we want to segment those customers better. The third pillar is interfaces. As we've come up with segmentation and processes, we need flexible interfaces to deliver those to our customers. And then finally, we want to brand those interfaces for our customers. Jeff Charney talked about this last year and so I won't spend time on it this year, but we want to have the branding that resonates with our customers as they interact with us. 
So with that said, let me walk through some of these pillars in particular, and I'll start with knowledge. As an initial example, I'll talk about small data that we are -- have been working on for our customers. Over the past 18 months, we've looked for internal and external data elements that are highly predictive for our customers. I have a smattering of those data elements on the screen. On the X axis here is the volume of data. You can think of this as the number of customers described by the data. And then on the Y axis, I have a general lift associated with that data. You can think of that lift as a lift in retention or a lift in graduation to become a Robinson or a lift in endorsements. No matter which of those 3 we're talking about with the data, it's highly profitable for Progressive to know. If we know that there will be a change with that customer, we can act on it in a profitable way. So let me give you some examples. Example #1 is an internal data element. It came from our digital servicing environment, it's a digital servicing action that we see our customers take. It wasn't within the structured data warehouse, but we had it in-house. And when we dug into it, we saw there's a 14-point difference in retention if we saw this data element. To give you another example that I can get a little bit more transparent about, example 2 is an external data element from a data vendor, we call it the newlywed variable. It comes from wedding invitations, bridal registries, courthouse records, things associated with getting married. And when we see that data element on one of our customers. In the next 6 months, there's more than a 200% lift in whether they change their marital status. And when a customer changes their marital status, it changes the retention rates, it changes the number of vehicles and drivers in the household and sometimes it adds additional products like a property policy. Now beyond small data, we've also started to think more about the big data available to us in customer relationship management. A leading technology company said that 80% of the world's data is unstructured, and we think that's true within CRM as well. I'm going to describe one area today, although there are others that we are working on as well. The area I'm going to describe today is the action that we're taking to put together an unstructured database of our customer words, the words that we hear from our customers. So let me give you some examples of some sources of this data. The first area is from our survey responses. Annually, we receive more than 80,000 survey responses from our customers. In addition, we have more than 1 million chat transcripts with our customers. When they go to our digital servicing environment, they can chat with a Progressive consultant. But as John  Sauerland alluded to, the largest and most significant source of words is from our calls with our customers. We received 36 million Personal Lines calls per year, and we've been transcribing those calls, and we have -- using advanced analytics, and we have all those calls in text form that we can put into a data warehouse. In total, Progressive has more than 10 billion words annually from our customers. So what can do we do with this? Well, I'll give you a few small examples today. One thing we've done is just search all this text for 3-word combinations, we call these trigrams. And there are some trigrams that are very predictive of, say, defection. I have 3 of those on the screen. I can tell you, for example, that trigram #3 is, 'I never received.' I never received my ID card. I never received that document that I requested. But I never received. And when a customer says that to Progressive, they are 1.4x more likely to defect from Progressive in the next 6 months. Another thing we've looked at is metadata. You can think of metadata as something other than the words that are present on those phone calls. For example, metadata #2 here is the amount of silence time on a phone call. As that silence time increases, the future defection chance increases as well, so there's about a 1.1x relativity on the amount of silence time on a phone call. There's even some significant words, some single words that if spoken or written or shared are a good predictor of future defection from Progressive. I won't share those today, but we've parsed through the text to look for those single words. 
So I'd like to move beyond knowledge now and talk about our engagement. And as a reminder here, I'm going to talk about the segmentation side of the engagements. In Progressive, we've certainly built traditional models. We use generalized linear models in a number of situations. These are tried and true models that are used throughout insurance and throughout business. And here, I want to tell you about the probability of Robinson graduation. This was a traditional modeling exercise that we went through in CRM. So we gave a team, I'll call them team #1, some of that small data that I talked about in the knowledge section. And we asked them to predict which customers may become a Robinson in the future, and they did a good job with this. They built a model. And the model in the top decile had a 4x greater chance of becoming a Robinson than the least responsive decile. But then we took that same data and we gave it to a separate team, one that did not work with the first team. And the separate -- second team did an even better job. In the second team, we found that the team came up with a model that was 7x greater. But the best result was if we combine models. And when we combined models, we found that the best tranche had a 9x greater likelihood. So even in the situation where we're building traditional models, we try to put the models together and combine them in ways to create the best outcome for Progressive. Now the world has moved beyond just generalized linear models, given the vast amount of data and the computing power that's available. It's moved to things like random forest or gradient boosting machines or neural networks, some of these advanced predictive models that are now available to us. We've invested in an advanced analytics team within CRM to take advantage of these models. The first assignment for this advanced analytics team was to build a defection model, to try to predict who might leave Progressive. And the best models were the gradient boosting machines and neural networks are being built. Because of the power of these models, I want to spend a little time just walking through the first generation neural network with you today. On the screen, I have the basic structure of a neural network, and I want to explain it to you. The first layer of a neural network is known as the feature layer. Features are like the independent variables that you would've seen in our regression historically. They are the attributes to the policy. Here on the screen, we have 2 features. F1 is a categorical variable of whether or not the policy is on EFT payments or automatic payments with Progressive. F2 is the percentage change in premium that, that policy will see in its upcoming renewal. We're going to have 2 predictors in this small snippet of a model. I can tell you in our first generation neural network, we had more than 900 predictors, and that was before we had access to all those billions of words that I described previously. From the feature layer, data passes along synapses to an output layer. Synapses are weights between negative 1 and 1 that are multiplied by the data. And then the data reaches this hidden layer. At the hidden layer, there's functions that are set there, common functions that are used in neural networks that transform the data. From the hidden layer, it travels along another set of synapses to the output layer. Again, the synapses multiply it by a number between negative 1 and 1 and then in the output layer, there's another function that transforms the data. And out of that output layer comes a predictor of defection or retention with Progressive between 0% and 100%. With that set up, let me walk you through a training of this neural network. On the screen are 8 policies from a training data set. These are 8 policies where we both know the predictors, the features of those policies, and what happened with them. So we have some policies that renewed with Progressive and some policies that defected from Progressive. What we do is we run these policies through the neural network. This is called forward propagation. Each of these policies passes through the network and is calculated the retention of it. So the features enter that feature layer, they're multiplied by that number between negative 1 and 1 in the synapse layer, they hit the hidden layer where they're transformed by a function. Another weight hits it and finally, it's transformed by a final function and a predictor of retention comes out. You can see here in this first iteration that the neural network is almost random. All those policies are clumped around the middle of the scale for predicting retention and the overall model accuracy as well. But what happens next is 1 of the 2 reasons why a neural network works. What happens next is a self-correcting mechanism exists within a neural network. It's called backward propagation. During backward propagation, each of those synapse weights are recalculated. It's calculated based on an iteration method called stochastic gradient descent. Stochastic gradient descent helps the model move towards the maximum accuracy. So as those weights change, this model is changing itself to become more accurate. After this backward propagation, we train the model again. We take these 8 policies and we pass them again through the model. Each of the policies enters the feature layer, hits the hidden layer and goes through the output layer. And you can see this time, the policies that renew with Progressive are starting to go higher on the renewal probability scale and those that defect are starting to go lower and the model accuracy improves, and then we backward propagate again, again adjusting the model. In actuality, we do this tens of thousands of times. Here in the room, I'm going to do it 10x quickly, just so you can see what happens. And this is the second reason why a neural network works. It's because of the brute force computing power that's available to us in this day and age. At the end of this, the model is trained. You can see after 10 iterations that the model accuracy has improved, and we have a model that's now ready for production. I do want to note here when we do this in actual practice, we keep a hold-out data set to make sure that we don't over fit the model. So what happens now? Well, we want to use this model in production. So I brought in 2 policies that we don't know the outcome for. They may be coming up for renewal with Progressive, Policy 9 and Policy 10. What we do is we take the features of these policies, and we pass them through the neural network. And here we can see that Policy 9 will retain with Progressive likely, and Policy 10 might defect from Progressive. We started to discriminate between policies that will stay and those that might leave. Now I hope you take 2 things away from this. First takeaway is that this is an incredibly intensive calculation process. For this first generation neural network, it took us 7 full days to run. We were using our local infrastructure but still it took an incredibly long time. And that was before we had tens of billions of words. That was before we tried adding on more hidden layers to move towards cognitive computing. It's just a very large and complex process. And it's because we have an impressive analytical infrastructure that we built through the Snapshot program that we can start tackling problems like this. The second thing I hope you take away is that this is an incredibly accurate model as well. Now we showed overall model accuracy on the screen. Truth be told, that's not what we're interested in. We're actually interested in the tail of the model, if we can predict those policies that are very unlikely to renew. We want to have good tail accuracy. And from the data that we used to build this neural network, we also built a traditional model, a GLM model. And when we did that, the neural network was twice as predictive as the generalized linear model. We're using the same data, but using more predictive advanced analytics techniques, we can be much more accurate in what we're doing, which has larger benefits to Progressive. Let me walk through interfaces to tell you a little bit more about how we take these models and use them for business benefit. I want to start by talking about proactive outbound communication. This is us reaching out to our customers. On the screen, I have a couple of examples of digital ads. These are digital ads we put in front of our current customers when we want them to graduate to become Robinsons. We target these digital ads based on that traditional model that I talked about previously. When we combine those models, we're focusing the most responsive deciles, we show them these digital ads. And when we've done that, along with some other activities like this, we've increased the number of Robinsons we have by tens of thousands, adding millions of dollars in lifetime underwriting profit to Progressive. We're able to do this because of all that acumen we built in advertising to consumers. We use those same patterns in advertising to our customers. Just another example is Policy 10 from that neural network example. We know that Policy 10 may not stay with Progressive, and so we started campaigns to reach out to folks like Policy 10 and invite them to call in to talk about their policy. And when we've done things like that, and we've got a few in practice now, the run rate is that annually, we'll save tens of thousands of customers, worth tens of millions of dollars in lifetime underwriting profit to Progressive. Beyond proactive outbound communication, there's also proactive inbound communication. We have built a tool that our phone consultants can use when someone calls Progressive. We call this tool the customer relationship assistant. It's a user interface for our phone consultants. It took us about 2 months to build, and the beauty of this tool is that it houses all that data and all those models I spoke about previously. So when Policy 10 calls, the consultant on the phone knows to talk to that customer about their policy and about staying with Progressive. It's really personalized, right? We can tailor all these interactions and make sure we have the right treatments that fire when that customer calls in. It's very flexible. If we want to add new treatments, we can program them in about 2 hours. And earlier results from this are very impressive. We've seen an increase in products added, a reduction in future calls and a lift in retention. 
Let me recap what I talked about today. In 2015, in the investor relations meeting, Glenn said that retention was our Holy Grail. And Tricia challenged us to increase retention by 50%. I'll underscore the progress that you heard today. PLE is up 6% with momentum higher. Direct is at an all-time high, and we're making the most progress with our Robinsons as our mix in that business shifts towards the Robinsons. In customer marketing, as a direct carrier and a servicing independent agent carrier, we have access to billions and billions of pieces of customer data. We have a historical strength in mining that data, driving insights to segmentation and quickly moving to market. We believe we can do that with our current customers. Feed that virtuous cycle of data and extend policy life expectancies. And with that, I'll welcome up John Barbagallo to talk about Commercial Lines."

I'm going to touch on our most recent results and share a little bit about our near-term action plans. And then I'",4246,"Thanks, Andrew. Hello. Good afternoon. I'm going to share a little bit about what we're seeing in the Commercial Auto insurance marketplace. I'm going to touch on our most recent results and share a little bit about our near-term action plans. And then I'm going to shift to talk about 2 disruptive trends that are coming to you, small business insurance and non-fleet Commercial Auto insurance. And these are trends that we have not only been monitoring, but we've actually been making investments around them over the last several years, and we think we're very favorably positioned to take advantage of them. But first, let's start talking about the marketplace. I'm going to start with a little history. This is a chart that I've shared with this audience in the past. It's now been updated through 2015. And what it shows is Progressive's relative performance relative to the industry on 2 measures: combined ratio and growth in direct written premium. And 2 things you can take from this graph. One is that over this time period, Progressive, by being intensely focused on Commercial Auto as a specific line of business, has been able to consistently outperform the industry on combined ratio, usually by a margin of 10 to 15 points. And for the last few calendar years, it's actually been by 20 points. Now some of that is from our expense ratio. We have a very cost competitive expense ratio. We believe we are the low cost provider in Commercial Auto, but a lot of that is loss ratio. And by being focused in the way we are, we believe we see things sooner and react faster than most of the rest in the industry and that contributes to this advantage. The other thing you can take from this chart is perhaps a little more subtle, is that we will and have consistently slowed our growth in the business when we were at risk of exceeding our underwriting target. And we will keep that commitment to those underwriting margin targets. Even with that approach, over time, we have been able to grow our market share consistently to the point where 2015, Progressive became the #1 Commercial Auto writer in the United States. All right, let's jump into 2016. This is a view, again, same 2 measures, combined ratio and direct written premium, Progressive versus the industry, we've added a few of our key competitors, as of the first quarter of 2016. You can see Progressive up in the upper right, cruising along with really good growth and a combined ratio in the high 80s at that point. And the industry had about 6% growth and a combined ratio of 102, which actually isn't too bad when you consider how it ended in 2015, that would appear to be improvement. But if you update through the second quarter, you see general degradation of combined ratios across the board, including our own. In fact, for the industry, the change in loss ratio, if you take the loss ratio for the 3 months comprising the second quarter, it is fully 8 points higher than the first quarter loss ratio. Now there's some seasonality at play there, but that is a huge, huge change. Now I'm sure you've noticed in our last 2 or 3 monthly earnings releases that our combined ratio has been elevated, certainly above historic norms. There's a little bit of prior year development in there. For the 3 months period, it's about 1 point, 1.25 points. But the real driver of that is actually frequency. What we have on the screen now is our bodily injury reported frequency for the last couple of years. Now the blue line is the monthly frequency. As you can see, that's pretty volatile, it jumps around a lot. We don't tend to pay too much attention to that. Even though those kind of last 2, last couple high watermarks there, they're high, but certainly not beyond anything we've seen in our history. If you look at the orange line, that is the trailing 6 BI frequency, and that's a much more stable measure, but it's still -- it is relatively reactive to changes in the environment. And there you're seeing what appears to be an inflection point starting in May, maybe as early as April. We believe that is real, at least it's real enough to me that we are reacting to that. We also believe it is largely environmental. Pat talked earlier about general a rise in frequency for auto, there's theories around that, distracted driving, low fuel prices. But in Commercial Auto specifically, particularly the verticals where we tend to compete, we are seeing positive movement in a number of the macroeconomic factors that we track that generally correlate with frequency. Things like home sales, construction spending, trade tonnage, aggregate deliveries, all moving in a positive direction, which suggests to us higher levels of economic activity, also contributing to higher frequency. So we believe this is real and we are reacting to it. Primarily, we're reacting with rate. Now I've talked to this audience before about our rate revision infrastructure at Progressive, our ability to change rates across the broad portfolio relatively quickly, and we have kicked that into gear. What this graph shows is our anticipated rate change for 2016, which will come in at about 9% year-over-year change in rates, most of that in the second half of the year. We were actually holding rates flat through the first 4 months of the year, as we were operating in the high 80s. So we've responded decisively and we've responded quickly, and those rate changes will certainly help the combined ratio. But it will take time. About 90% of our policies are written on an annual basis, so we have to get through a renewal cycle to get the full effect of it. It will certainly help with new business as soon as we can get those rates in place. But in the interim, and I said, we will slow down growth to ensure we make our margins. In the interim, we're also restricting some high-frequency segments of our business for new business. We're going to stop taking it until we can get those rates in place. Now those segments have always been high frequency, they will always be high frequency, and we're perfectly comfortable writing that business at the right rate, we're just not there yet. So that's what we see going on. Again, by being focused, we think we are seeing this before much of our competition, and we're reacting before they do. And when that's happened historically, that has typically set up very favorable market conditions for us down the road. So we'll see what happens. 
All right. Now I want to shift to those disruptive trends. The first of which is what I believe will be an inevitable shift to small business owners accessing direct channels for the purchasing and servicing of their small business insurance policies. Consumers across a range of industries have demonstrated not only acceptance of direct channels, but in many cases, preference for those channels. And we don't expect small business owners to be any different, especially as digital continues to close the information gap between the buyer and the seller. And we're starting to see investment. Investment by people other than Progressive. And these are companies that are well-known. They are well-funded, and they have experienced management. And they are putting the assets in place. Underwriting companies, product filings, technology platforms, all to go after the direct channel for small business owners. And they're starting to spend some money. Not a lot on the marketing front, and actually, it's happening slower than we would've anticipated. We still are the largest spender in the category, but they're starting to spend some money as well. So we're seeing investments. We're also starting to see some growth. This is a view provided by the Boston Consulting Group of the U.S. small business insurance market. Now this is all lines of business, it's all lines of business for small business insurance, and they peg that at about a $65 billion to $70 billion marketplace. And as of right about now, they're saying direct channels have 8% share. Probably more interesting on this chart is what they project to be the growth rate of the channels. So a pretty aggressive growth rate for digital channels in small business insurance. In fact if you buy into this view, it suggests that traditional channels will begin to decline in absolute dollars as early as 2019. We'll see. When it comes to Commercial Auto, where we have some pretty good data, we're seeing a somewhat similar pattern. Now again, the direct channel for Commercial Auto is still small, less than 2%, but the growth rate relative to the industry growth rate is 2x to 3x. Now full disclosure, on this particular graph, that orange line is largely driven by Progressive. We're just about half of the direct commercial auto market right now, and we actually can affect the slope of that line simply in terms of how much we choose to spend. And that's reflected in 2014, we pulled back in our spending, and you see that little dip there. But again, you have a channel where there's lots of investment lining up, and you're starting to see signs of growth in the channel. So the question then becomes who is going to be able to most cost effectively drive demand and control the top of that sales funnel. And this is where we start to feel really good. Because while the others are just getting started, we have actually been at this since 2008. Now we've been selling direct commercial for more than a decade, but it was really in 2008 that we began investing in developing a business insurance brand. In 2008, we started -- we embarked, really, on a 5-year plan, and it was a 5-year plan to prove to ourselves that we could make the economics of direct marketing commercial insurance work. And it was a very auto-centric approach, targeting specific verticals where we tend to do well. We concluded that 5-year plan successfully in 4 years. That gave us the confidence in 2012 to begin broadening our marketing. And by broadening, I mean, both broadening the media we would access and broadening our message to be much less auto-centric and really built around insuring and protecting the business. And that has now evolved to our current campaign, which we just launched, which could really celebrate the small business owner. So we've been investing here for a long time. Has that investment been worth it? We would say it definitely has been. One of the key measures of brand health is awareness, and as you can see on these 2 charts, in terms of total awareness and top-of-mind awareness, Progressive is the leading small business insurance brand. Again, this gets back to who is going to control the top of that sales funnel as this channel begins to grow.
How fast might this all happen? I don't really know, but maybe we can look to private passenger auto as a guide, because this has happened. The chart on the left shows the shift in channel for private passenger auto over a 20-year period. Now keep in mind, that orange line for the direct channel developed concurrently with the development and acceptance of digital channels for consumers. So the Internet, gradually migrating over to mobile. We believe those consumer preferences are already in place. And I'll offer an opinion that small business owners, at least a percentage of them, their expectations currently exceed the industry's ability to deliver really good digital experiences. The chart on the right is the effect of that channel shift on Progressive's business. So over roughly the same time period, Progressive's direct auto business grew from being about 12 -- 11%, 12% of our total business to where it is today, half our business. Now it's not that our agency business didn't grow during this time. It did grow. You heard earlier from Pat that it is at an all-time high. It's just that the direct business grew that much faster, creating lots of value for Progressive and for our shareholders. We've modeled this out. We've done a number of different scenarios around how quickly the direct channel may grow for small business insurance, based on different spend levels by us, spend levels by other. And when we surround what we think are the most likely outcomes, it all leads to significant growth for Progressive Commercial Lines.
So we continue to invest in our capabilities. We are in the midst of a major systems upgrade for commercial. One of the benefits of that will be the ability to deliver better digital experiences, and perhaps more importantly, deliver them to market faster and enhance them more quickly. And we continue to invest in and build our in-house business insurance agency.
The map on the left shows our footprint for being able to offer non-affiliated partner company BOP and general liability policies to prospects and our customers. We also sell workers' comp and professional liability, but the primary coverages they're seeking are BOP and GL. And today, we have -- in virtually every state, we can offer between 5 and 8 products, covering a range of underwriting profiles. And as you can see on the graph on the right, we are growing the agency. And there again, the shape of that growth curve can largely be determined by how much we choose to spend at a given time. And we are growing the agency, and we are having success bundling these small business customers with Progressive Auto, be it Commercial Auto or Personal Auto, and that's an important point. We are creating a lot of bundles with a BOP or GL policy and a Progressive Personal Auto policy, which is just fine. First of all, it helps the agency's economics because those customers are much stickier. Second, it is entirely consistent with the strategy Tricia laid out earlier in terms of acquire, anchor, bundle, extend. This may be how we acquire customers. Certainly, could be how we bundle customers. And also, we're finding that the need for commercial auto in a  small business oftentimes emerges late or later in the life cycle of that business, and business insurance is very situational, unlike personal lines. Usually the first purchase of a personal lines product, typically auto, is driven by a state law, state requirement to have insurance or a bank. In small business insurance, that is not usually the case.
So to try to give some context to this slide, I'm going to tell you a story. And it's a story about a real-life, thriving business right here in Northeast Ohio. So a work colleague of mine has a friend, and she's starting a business in her home, in her kitchen actually, cooking bone broth. And she sold this bone broth out of her kitchen to friends and neighbors. Now she didn't have insurance, so we told her she needed insurance. You can argue she probably should have had insurance, but she was flying below the radar, which a lot of small businesses do, particularly in their early stages. The sales went well. She got a lot of positive feedback, and she was encouraged to take her product to one of the local farmers' markets. So she decided to give that a try. She applied. She was accepted, but the farmers' market told her, if you want to come on-premise, you have to have a vendor's liability policy and you have to have a general liability policy. So where previously, she was in that first circle of not really caring about insurance, she now found herself in that second circle of, well, at least temporarily, I have to care about insurance if I want to go to this farmers' market. Not sure if I have a real business yet, but I'll buy the insurance. Farmers' market went well. Again, a lot of positive feedback, again, getting inquiries from local restaurants who wanted her to supply them with bone broth. She even got a contract with a local grocery store chain, and the business is starting to take off. In fact, taking off to the point that she outgrew her kitchen, and she had to lease commercial space, and she had to hire 2 employees to set up more of a regular production cycle for the bone broth. And now she needs a BOP policy for her premises, and she needs workers' compensation for her employees. I would say now she's in that third circle of, I definitely really have to care about insurance. She still hasn't had a commercial auto policy, but that's about to change. She had been hiring a third party to make her deliveries. She now buys her first delivery vehicle, she needs a commercial auto policy.
I understand from my colleague that she is now thinking of expanding her business regionally, maybe nationally. She realizes she has a real asset here, an asset she wants to preserve, protect, maybe pass on to the next generation. I would argue she's moving into that fourth circle of, I genuinely care about buying insurance. The point here is for small business owners, it is a journey of one, and they are all different, and they are not necessarily linear like the real-life example I just gave you. People move back and forth. Some small business owners never move out of that second circle. They're kind of the Sams of small business ownership. And to deal with that, we have developed a series of customer journey maps, by business type and by business stage. And do what these journey maps allow us to do? It maps our creative and our messaging and our media buying with those key trigger events to deliver the right message at the right time to that business. So this a trend that is clearly coming. You've been reading a lot about it. It's been a little slow to gain traction. We think it's about to take hold, and we feel we are really, really well-positioned to capitalize on that.
The other trend I want to talk to you about is the application of telematics to non-fleet commercial auto insurance. I'm not sure if this is a trend yet, but I do believe it's coming. So telematics have been broadly applied in fleet situations. But even there, there has never been a really strong insurance tie-in. That's been more about asset management and logistics than insurance. But we think that's about to change, particularly in the trucking sector. Now John Sauerland has already talked to you about Progressive's leadership position in terms of usage-based insurance pricing science. He's talked to you, and Andrew's reinforced, the big data capabilities Progressive can bring to bear. Those are absolutely assets we can leverage in Commercial Lines. But we have taken a slightly different path in Commercial than they have in Personal with respect to UBI, and we have focused on the transportation industry, the over-the-road truckers. Two reasons for that. One, we feel a version of the Snapshot product will work perfectly well for a lot of our business auto contractor-type customers. And now as the agency adoption rate of Snapshot is starting to go up, it may be the time for us to introduce that to commercial. The other reason that we focused on transportation is we were anticipating a federal mandate, which is now law, that will require federal motor carriers to have an electronic logging device in their vehicle and operational by December 2017. And these electronic logging devices will be fully telematics-enabled, if you will. They'll have all the data you could possibly want. So we have, for the last few years, been working directly with the vendors, the  manufacturers of these ELDs to put in place data sharing agreement and cooperative marketing agreements so we can go to market together with our products as the demand increases, leading up to the compliance date in December '17 and we've also been collecting our own UBI data for the last several years. Today, we probably have about 600 of our insured trucks on the road being monitored. We've collected over 41 million miles of data, and those data are beginning to reveal some really, really interesting things.
Perhaps the most interesting is that we find with commercial operators the degree of variance in their behavior is far, far greater than Personal Lines customers in terms of how, how much and where they drive. To the extent those behaviors correlate with losses, and they do, that's very exciting, because that allows for greater rate segmentation. And John's already talked to you about the power of rate segmentation. He's told you that in Personal Lines, Snapshot is the most predictive, most powerful rating variable we have. We believe, for trucking risks, it will be even more powerful than that. So we're very excited.
Let me give you just a little sampling of some of the things we're seeing. All these examples relate to the same 3 insured vehicles. One of the things you rate on in Commercial Auto is something called radius of operation, which is basically how far do you go from your principal garaging address, how far do you go. It's a rating variable we use. ISO uses it. A lot of our competitors use it. A problem with radius of operations as a rating variable, it could be hard to verify and it changes over time. Truckers go where the work -- I think that's true of all commercial vehicles, they go where the work is. But we all use it. Well now, with electronic logging devices, we actually know where they go. And in this sample, we've got 3 insured vehicles that were all rated based on the same radius of operation, 500 miles, which was pretty good for Vehicle C. We're probably overcharging Vehicle A and Vehicle B. Well, more important than how far you drive is where you drive. Now that we have geolocation data, we can actually score different routes and different roads in terms of relative safety or risk. From there, we can overlay time of day, so you incorporate things like rush hour and potentially things like seasonal weather pattern. You begin to see where this can go. But even with a relatively simplistic model for scoring, which is what we have here, you see pretty significant differences in distribution, which we believe are actionable and ratable. One more, this is how much you drive, and this is really the whole impetus behind the federal mandate. Better regulation of hours of operation, hours of service. Driver fatigue is a major, major safety issue for over-the-road truckers. The graphs on the bottom reflects hours per day of driving. So each bar on the graph is a day. And the white line going across is the federal limit of 11 hours per day. So you can see pretty significant differences in these distributions. Vehicle B -- and remember, this is the guy that goes the furthest from home by far, seems to be doing a better job of managing his hours per day. Vehicle C actually had some 20 and 22-hour days in there. Now what that probably means is we have team driving, 2 drivers taking shifts. And still, that's really important and valuable information and represents a different risk. So this is just a few samples of the types of data we are beginning to develop, that we think will be very, very actionable.
I'm going to conclude with one more chart, just because I love the data, and this is another comparison between Personal Auto, and in this case, some long-haul trucking customers. So the bottom graph was taken from a sample of Snapshot customers, Personal Auto Snapshot customers. And all it does is it shows kind of where their cars are during different parts of the day. And what you see by and large is most of the time, those cars are at home, in the driveway, in the garage. And during the daytime hours, that's where you see the driving. Not so much driving in the wee morning hours. Not surprising. The graph on the top is a sample of Progressive-insured long-haul trucks. And what you see there is lots of driving, not surprising, not unusual, 100,000, 120,000 miles a year for a trucker. But when they're not driving, they're typically away from home, sleeping in their truck, showering at a truck stop, using a, I don't know, Cracker Barrel. It could be a pretty hard life for a trucker, and this is where I really start to get excited about these data, because this is where I think we can go beyond just straight rate segmentation and start to develop value-added services by using risk management services to hopefully make these truckers a little bit healthier and a little bit safer while they're on the road. So again, another trend, we think, is coming to small business insurance, in this case, non-fleet auto insurance, that we feel we're very, very well-positioned to capitalize on.
With that, I'm going to bring up Tricia Griffith for some closing remarks."

We continue with our segmentation of more and more product models and having deeper segmentation at the quickest amount of time ever. So we really think that's a competitive advantage. And our bundled PIFs have grown 20% to 30% across channels. John  Sauerland talked about our most important variable, our UBI or usage-based insurance, so Snapshot, and how we're continuing on that evolution and how with that work we've actually had even more data capabilities across the enterprise that we believe will be a winning strategy for Progressive. Andrew Quigg talked about PLE. We finally made that breakthrough in PLE, especially in the Robinsons segment. Andrew talked about the massive amount of customer data that we have and how we're going to use that data to understand the moves of our customers and be out in front of that, give them a reason to stay.
John Barbagallo talked about the fact that we're outperforming our peers relative to profit and growth, so that's extraordinary. Bottom line is though, we have to respond quickly to our frequency trend, and we're doing that with rate. John has his own era coming up in terms of the direct business with small business owners as well as technology and data-driven technology in the commercial space.
I hope you're thrilled as our team is about what we've executed upon and what we're going to be doing in the future. And I want to thank you for your interest in Progressive. So with that, I will ask John Sauerland to join me for some Q&A."

ASI has maintained the reinsurance philosophy they had before we acquired a majority stake in the company. We haven't disclosed the complete reinsurance program, but I'll give you some quick highlights. So $50 million of retention for a main storm. The first storm has a tower that is up to what -- the average model, I'll say, equates to about a 1 in 300 years storm, so that's pretty high up relative to what we believe other carriers have. We have a second event that also has a $50 million retention on it. But we're -- I think ASI has done a great thing in that it's only typical in the marketplace, in that they prepay reinstatement for about 70% of that tower. That tower is not quite as tall as the first tower, but it's about a 1 in 100-year event, and about 70% of that has reinstatement premiums prepaid. And Trevor Hillier and John Auer -- Trevor Hillier, CFO of ARX, and John Auer, the CEO, are both here. So if I misstate or I need corrections, please feel free to chime in. So $50 million on an ASI book, it's material for sure. $50 million on the Progressive book, you can do the math. We can absolutely sustain that and still hit our calendar year 96% targets."

We can get more profitable by raising rates or we can underwrite out segments at new business or at renewal that we think are the cause of the problem until we have rates in that segment high enough where we are then comfortable letting new customers back in. So in Commercial Lines, they've identified segments of new customers that they believe will be the least profitable. And they're working upfront to underwrite that. In Commercial Lines, they have a lot of ability as well to underwrite a renewal with credits, debits. And they've done a lot of that over time and have targeted that, of course, as well. In Personal Lines, we're actually employing a lot of underwriting these days as well. It hasn't been what we've been -- it hasn't been our forte historically. But probably 4 or 5 years ago, we started getting a little more conservative around ensuring that we were bringing in business that was intent it was to insure and not otherwise. And I think that's helped us a lot. But higher level, you can improve profitability through raising rates or underwriting segments. And Commercial Lines has been very fast to react in turning on the underwriting where necessary, and they're now reacting very quickly in getting rates up and expect to have those rates up about 9% by the end of the year."
