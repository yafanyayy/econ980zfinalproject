Yesterday afternoon, we announced fourth quarter earnings of $0.94 per share within our guidance range of $0.93 to $1.03 per share. That compares to $1.19 per share reported for the same period last year. Durin",551,"Okay, thank you, Sterling, and good morning. Yesterday afternoon, we announced fourth quarter earnings of $0.94 per share within our guidance range of $0.93 to $1.03 per share. That compares to $1.19 per share reported for the same period last year. During the 2015 fourth quarter, in our Inland market, utilization declined slightly into the high 80s to low 90% range. The additional capacity created by the decline in crude oil volumes has put pressure on both utilization and rates. Although petrochemicals and refined product volumes are stable, we do sense that there's some underlying weakness in the U.S. and global economy. With respect to the industry fleet, we estimate that approximately 375 barges that were in crude oil service are no longer in crude oil service. And on that positive note, the overhang of crude oil barges moving into other services has continued to decline. We now estimate that fewer than 5% of the industry tank barges are in crude oil service today compared to the peak of 15%. 
Moving to the coastal markets. Utilization has also remained stable with utilization in the, again, high 80s and low 90% range. This modest drop in utilization from earlier in the year is explained principally by seasonally driven barges that are not in service in Alaska at this time of the year. Contract renewal prices on coastal equipment was flat to slightly up. However, we do see some preference by customers to the spot market, referring the flexibility of not having to commit to contract tonnage. The utilization levels we've been achieving in the spot market remained at high levels. However, the spot market does expose us to potentially more downtime. 
With respect to our land-based Diesel Engine Service business, it remains under significant pressure. We continue to aggressively take cost and streamline our processes, but we are prepared for another difficult low oil price environment. In the Marine and Power Generation business, it continues to perform well, except to our limited exposure to the Oil Service business, which services the Gulf of Mexico. 
David is going to provide more color to the key drivers in our 2016 guidance, but before he does, I'd like to comment on our sense of the economy and the outlook for our businesses. We find ourselves in an interesting market with respect to our Inland business with utilization levels remaining high but rates under pressure. I think the migration of barges working in crude oil service to other products has diminished market confidence and allowed for rates to deteriorate. Historically, rates should not decline when utilization is in current levels. When we think about why this is happening in the Inland business, we think it's a combination of loss of market confidence combined with what were historically high rate levels. On a positive note, we do believe that the excess crude oil barges are being absorbed. If we're at the leading edge of a more significant economic downturn, which of course is possible, Kirby will follow the same playbook which has served us well for decades. We will stay patient, work on reducing cost, focus on safety and customer service and take advantage of good and prudent capital allocation opportunities that usually come our way during hard times. 
I'll now turn the call over to David."

Let me start with some comments on the fourth quarter results across our business. I will then turn the call over to Andy to give some added details on our financials before coming back and concluding comments on our 2016 guidance. 
In the Marine Transportation segment, our Inland Marine barge demand remains at good levels with utilization in the high 80% to low 90% range. Although we do believe industry utilization outside of Kirby maybe slightly lower. As Joe mentioned, customer demand has held up relatively well and the market continues to absorb barges coming out of crude service. That said, volume has been less robust than we would expect in a healthy growing economy. Long-term Inland Marine Transportation contracts, those contracts with the term of 1 year or longer in duration, contributed approximately 80% of revenue for the 2015 fourth quarter with 55% attributable to time charters and 45% from contracts of affreightment. Pricing on Inland Marine Transportation term contracts that renewed during the fourth quarter was down in the low to mid-single digits. Spot contract rates were at or below contract rates during the quarter. In the spot market, we continue to book the majority of our spot equipment with our term contract customers. 
In our Coastal Marine Transportation segment, demand for the coastwise transportation of refined products like oil and petrochemicals remained consistent with the third quarter of 2015. 
As we have discussed in our third quarter conference call, we've continued to see the trend of the reluctance of customers to term up equipment and electing to access the spot market for their coastal transportation needs. During the fourth quarter, 79% of coastal revenues were under term contracts. Kirby's coastal equipment utilization averaged above 90%, but did briefly touch the high 80s. With respect to Coastal Marine Transportation pricing, term contracts that renewed during the fourth quarter were flat to slightly up. In our Diesel Engine Services segment, our Marine Diesel and Power Generation markets experienced stable demand in most regions of the country and pockets of strong demand, particularly in the nuclear power market and in the Midwest Marine market. Largely offsetting these areas of strength was continued weakness in the Gulf of Mexico oil service business where the OSBs [ph] and PSVs are. 
Our land-based Diesel Engine Services market remains challenging. Inbound orders for pressure pumping, manufacturing and remanufacturing were virtually nonexistent during the quarter. Demand for service parts and distribution also weakened slightly from the 2015 third quarter. We are pleased to say that our transition from 4 manufacturing and remanufacturing facilities into an expanded single location went smoothly during the quarter and should help us continue to streamline costs and bring down the working capital intensity of this business. While this market is depressed, the pace of inquiries for our remanufacturing service has increased recently as consistent attrition in the industry frac fleet continues. This gives us some guarded optimism for a modest recovery in late '16 or early '17. 
During the 2015 fourth quarter, we continued to execute on our share repurchase authorization buying approximately 641,000 shares for $39 million or an average of just over $60 per share. The stock price, in our estimation, continues to offer compelling long-term value. In total, for all of 2015, we've repurchased over 3.3 million shares or approximately 5.8% of shares outstanding on January 1, 2015. Currently, our unused repurchase authorization is 1.4 million shares. 
I'll now turn the call over to Andy to provide some detailed financial information before I finish with the discussion on the outlook."
283986,321699234,922531,"Kirby Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2016",2016-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Kirby Corporation","Executives","Thank you, David, and good morning. In the 2015 fourth quarter, Marine Transportation segment revenue declined 7% and operating income declined 16% as compared with the 2014 fourth quarter. The decline in revenue in the fourth quarter as compared to the p",1177,"Thank you, David, and good morning. In the 2015 fourth quarter, Marine Transportation segment revenue declined 7% and operating income declined 16% as compared with the 2014 fourth quarter. The decline in revenue in the fourth quarter as compared to the prior year was primarily due to a 41% decline in the average cost of marine diesel fuel, an increase in inland marine delay days and an increase in available spot market days for certain offshore marine equipment. The Marine Transportation segment's operating margin was 22% compared with 24.3% for the 2014 fourth quarter. The Inland sector contributed approximately 2/3 of Marine Transportation revenue with the coastal sector contributing 1/3. 
Inland Marine weather presented several challenges during the quarter. In the first half of the quarter, we experienced flooding and strong cost crosscurrents at certain river crossings on the gulf intercoastal waterway as well as the closure of 2 major logs [ph], which will reopen in mid-November. 
Late in the quarter, high water on the Mississippi River system led to total restrictions and the closure of the river near St. Louis during the final 3 days of the quarter. These conditions contributed to a 15% year-over-year increase in delay days. High water on the Mississippi River system is continuing into this quarter, and in fact, still impacting the industry in the fourth quarter. Despite these challenges, the Inland sector generated an operating margin in the mid-20% range for the quarter. 
In the coastal sector, the number of contract renewals was limited, but pricing on those that did renew were flat to up slightly. As David and Joe each mentioned, we continue to have equipment move into the spot market as customers are reluctant to agree to term contracts and they are increasingly confident that sufficient spot equipment will be available to handle their needs. We have been successful in keeping spot equipment employed at high levels of utilization, which for the quarter averaged over 90%. Nevertheless, even at high levels of utilization, unutilized days for equipment in the spot market have a negative financial impact relative to the contribution provided under time-charter contracts. Additionally, voyage and positioning costs incurred in order to take advantage of spot opportunities can impact profitability. The fourth quarter operating margin for the coastal sector was in the mid-teens. 
Over the course of 2015, we took delivery of 36 new tank barges, and when combined with the 6 pressure barges purchased in the first quarter, increased capacity by approximately 590,000 barrels. The number of barges we retired, including returned charter barges, totaled 26. We're moving approximately 380,000 barrels of capacity. We also transferred 2 coastal tank barges that we're working inland back into the coastal fleet. The net result was an addition of 14 tank barges to our inland tank barge fleet at approximately 165,000 barrels of additional capacity. 
In the 2016 first quarter, we expect to take delivery of 3 30,000 barrel inland tank barges with a total capacity of approximately 90,000 barrels. We currently have no plans to build any tank barges beyond the first quarter. Although we will continue to evaluate our needs throughout the year. We expect to retire or return 30 barges over the course of the year and in 2016 with approximately 17.6 million barrels of capacity, a reduction of approximately 365,000 barrels from the end of 2015. In addition to the inland retirements, we retired a 38-year-old [indiscernible] drive bolt ATB on the last day of 2015. We expect this will have an approximate $1 million negative year-over-year earnings effect on 2016. 
In the coastwise transportation sector, with respect to our new vessels, construction of our 4 coastal articulated tank barge and tugboat units continues to progress along the schedule we last presented. The first of our 4 planned ATBs, a 185,000-barrel 10,000-horsepower ATB entered service late in 2015. Our second new coastal vessel, also a 185,000-barrel ATB, is likely to deliver in mid-2016. Both 185,000-barrel ATBs are under multiyear customer contracts. We continue to expect delivery of the first 155,000-barrel ATB in late 2016 and our second 155,000-barrel ATB is scheduled to deliver by mid second quarter 2017. Additionally, we're building a coastal chemical bar that we expect to enter service in early 2017 as a replacement for equipment expected to retire simultaneously. The coastal equipment requirements that we expect to impact our 2016 results include a 150,000-barrel coastal barge that we retired at the end of 2015 and an 80,000-barrel ATB that we expect to retire in the first quarter of this year. 
You may notice that our total capital expenditures for 2015 were $343 million, approximately $15 million higher than we had anticipated in our last earnings call. This was the result of progress payments on our new coastal units that we incurred in December 2015, a month earlier than anticipated. 
Moving on to our Diesel Engine Services segment. Revenue for the 2015 fourth quarter declined 65% from the 2014 fourth quarter and we had a small operating loss for the segment. The segment's operating margin was a negative 0.6% compared with 5.4% for the 2014 fourth quarter. The Marine and Power Generation operations contributed approximately 50% of the Diesel Engine Services' revenue in the fourth quarter with an operating margin in the low double digits. Our land-based operations contributed roughly half of the Diesel Engine Services segment's revenue in the fourth quarter with a negative operating margin in the low to mid-teens. During the quarter, we recognized some costs related to consolidating our manufacturing facilities into a single location and to inventory adjustments which led to a more significant operating loss. Also modestly impacting results was our finalization of the previously announced sale of Unique Impression, LLC early in the 2015 fourth quarter [ph]. 
On the corporate side of things, our cash flow remained strong during the quarter which helped spun our marine equipment construction plans and $39 million of treasury stock purchases during the quarter. Any future decision to repurchase stock will be based on a number of factors, including the stock price, our long-term earnings and cash flow forecast as well as alternative opportunities available to deploy capital, including acquisitions. On -- our 2016 capital spending guidance range is $220 million to $240 million, including completion of the 3 and 1 tank barges and 1 in 1 towboat to be delivered in 2016 and approximately $95 million in progress payments on new coastal equipment, including 1 185,000-barrel coastal ATB, 2 155,000-barrel coastal ATBs, 2 4,900 horsepower coastal tugboats and a new coastal petrochemical tank barge. The balance of $124 million to $154 million [ph] is primarily for capital upgrades and improvements to existing inland and coastal marine equipment and facilities as well as Diesel Engine Services facilities. Total debt as of December 31, 2015 was $779 million, a $31.6 million decrease from September 30, 2015. Our debt-to-cap ratio at December 31, 2015 was 25.5% compared with 24% as of December 31, 2014. As of today, our debt stands at $734 million.

I'll provide some additional clarity behind the assumptions used in our guidance",826,"Thank you, Andy. In our press release, we announced our 2016 first quarter guidance of $0.75 to $0.85 per share and for the 2016 full year guidance of $3 to $3.50 per share. I'll provide some additional clarity behind the assumptions used in our guidance range in a moment, but first, let me address the environment more holistically. 
The outlook for our market is more opiate right now than it has been in many years. Economists tell us that GDP in the U.S. continues to grow, but the source of that growth is not clear. Perhaps the consumer economy is doing okay, but there is a depression in the energy economy and it feels like there is a general malaise, if not, a recession looming in the industrial and manufacturing economies. Most of our markets are being impacted by the volatility in global commodity markets. With these trends as a backdrop, many of our customers are uncertain about the outlook for 2016, which makes the budgeting and forecasting process more difficult. Overall, we think our guidance is pragmatic. Although $0.50 is a wider guidance range than we traditionally get for the year, it reflects the uncertainty we see. We do think with captured our view of the business as they currently stand. Hopefully, commodity prices will stabilize and the factors that led economists to believe GDP is growing become more evident as the year progresses. In which case, our guidance may prove conservative. 
Now let me provide some details on our guidance. In our Inland market, our guidance is based on continued modest pricing pressure and high levels of utilization for both the first quarter and full year. At the low end, our guidance factors in spot and contract renewal pricing declined in the mid-single digits and utilization remaining in the high 80% range. At the high end, we're assuming pricing stabilizes at current levels and utilization largely remains in the low 90% range. In both of these scenarios I described, the most influential factor in the income decline from last year is the full year earnings impact from contracts which were repriced at lower levels in 2015. With respect to the first quarter, we also expect an impact from high water that Andy described. We're assuming normal seasonal weather patterns for the remainder of the year. 
In the coastal market, we continue to realize favorable pricing on spot and contract equipment and the benefit from the new 185,000-barrel ATB, which went into service in the fourth quarter of last year. Additionally, the second 185,000-barrel ATB, 185,000-barrel ATB, should deliver towards the middle of the year. The new vessels provide some support for coastal operating margins, but they are largely offset by a combination of the retirement of older vessels and from additional unreimbursed costs for those of vessels in service in the spot market when they are not working, which Andy walked through. On the low end, our guidance range contemplates a deterioration in coastal rates, and on the high-end of guidance, we're contemplating coastal rates up in the low single-digit percent range. We expect utilization for the first quarter and the full year to remain consistent with the 2015 fourth quarter. 
For our Diesel Engine Services segment and our land-based sector, we expect their markets to remain extremely challenged. Our most current information suggests that capital spending levels for most of our customers will fall further during 2016. As a result, we expect continued small quarterly operating losses in this business. In the second half of the year, there is the potential for a modest amount of remanufacturing and repair work, which is simply based on the premise that pressure pumping activity will not go to 0 and that there is a finite amount of equipment that can be cannibalized. This is a belief that is backed up with recent customer antidotes. 
In our Marine, Diesel and Power Generation markets, we anticipate overall results to be similar to 2015 with weakness in the Gulf of Mexico oil field service market persisting. 
In summary, 2015 was a challenging year, but through the challenges, we were able to grow both operating and free cash flow and take steps to position and improve our company for long-term success. We spent over 600 million on a combination of capital expenditures, share repurchases and acquisitions, yet our leverage remained largely unchanged. As always, we will remain focused on what we can control:
cost, customer service, safety and disciplined capital allocation. This approach has served Kirby well over our history. While we entered 2016 with an uncertain outlook in a number of market challenges, our 2016 guidance anticipates another year -- year-over-year increase and free cash flow that combined with our already strong balance sheet, positions us well to take care best to take advantage of high return opportunities that are often available in these difficult markets. 
Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take questions."

So that overhang of crude oil barges is finite and there may be a level that the industry will just need because there are some moves, for example, that will continue, for example, maybe Utica. And then if you also think about new barge construction, we're hearing that there's very little on the books to be built this year, maybe 50 or less, and we certainly think retirements will be accelerated this year. So that sets up pretty good environment potentially. Now the caveat again has been the economy, but you're right. If things stabilize where we're at, we could be at the upper end of that range."

We're not sure where the retirements are, but they should have been more significant in 2015. Typically, we would expect 100 to 150. It may have been more, not sure of it. But Informa puts out industry survey later this year kind of April I believe is when it comes out. We'll get a better feel of how much is been retired. But clearly, going into '16, we would expect retirements to be more aggressive and we certainly haven't heard of much building being planned for this year. As it relates to chemicals, we have in our IR presentation a list of over $100 billion, $150 billion worth of chemical plants and we're tracking them. And over, we think it's around 70% are under construction right now. So we don't think any of them getting canned. Certainly, if they're under construction, we don't believe they'll be canceled. And the good majority of those or many of them will start up in 2017, to your point. Now quantifying what that does to barge utilization, it's hard to put an absolute barge count on it. But certainly, it should be a backdrop, a tailwind, if you will, that will drive barge demand. We've talked about it in terms of GDP plus something. And now what is that plus? I'm not sure we can quantify it, but in alone, I think, through 2017, the capacity will increase on the order of about 50%. Well, through 2022, yes. They've got it scheduled out through 2022, but it should be positive. It's very difficult to quantify the absolute number."

And it is unusual. I mean, I would would've told you that if you'd asked me this before it happened, it wouldn't happen. But I think that there was some overenthusiasm in the business that was then crushed by equipment suddenly being returned and having to be placed in other service. As I look at this market, I think that we're a lot closer to balance than really any other period where you saw pricing declines occur in the past. And as things settle down, I think as people get a little more confident, that utilization isn't going to continue to go down. I think that you will -- you should get some stability. With respect to regaining some of that pricing, I think that's going to take a little time, but I don't see anything really out there other than the potential recession that David alluded to. That's more just a feeling that we're not generating the growth in this country that we'd like to see and that if you're in Houston, you're in the depression, which colors your outlook also and a lot of our customers of course are in Houston.

Yesterday afternoon, we announced fourth quarter earnings of $0.94 per share, within our guidance range of $0.93 to $1.03 per share. That compares to $1.19 per share reported for the same period last year. Du",559,"Okay. Thank you, Sterling, and good morning. Yesterday afternoon, we announced fourth quarter earnings of $0.94 per share, within our guidance range of $0.93 to $1.03 per share. That compares to $1.19 per share reported for the same period last year. 
During the 2015 fourth quarter, in our inland market, utilization declined slightly into the high 80s to low 90% range. The additional capacity created by the decline in crude oil volumes has put pressure on both utilization and rates. Although petrochemicals and refined product volumes are stable, we do sense that there's some underlying weakness in the U.S. and global economy. With respect to the industry fleet, we estimate that approximately 375 barges that were in crude oil service are no longer in crude oil service. And on that positive note, the overhang of crude oil barges moving into other services has continued to decline. We now estimate that fewer than 5% of the industry tank barges are in crude oil service today compared to the peak of 15%. 
Moving to the coastal markets. Utilization has also remained stable, with utilization in the, again, high 80s and low 90% range. This modest drop in utilization from earlier in the year is explained principally by seasonal-driven -- seasonally driven barges that are not in service in Alaska at this time of the year. Contact -- contract renewal prices on coastal equipment was flat to slightly up. However, we do see some preference by customers to the spot market, referring the flexibility of not having to commit to contract tonnage. The utilization levels we have been achieving in the spot market remained at high levels. However, the spot market does expose us to potentially more downtime. 
With respect to our land-based diesel engine service business, it remains under significant pressure. We continue to aggressively take cost and streamline our processes, but we are prepared for another difficult low oil price environment. In the marine and power generation business, it continues to perform well, except to our limited exposure to the oil service business, which services the Gulf of Mexico. 
David is going to provide more color to the key drivers in our 2016 guidance, but before he does, I'd like to comment on our sense of the economy and the outlook for our businesses. 
We find ourselves in an interesting market with respect to our inland business, with utilization levels remaining high but rates under pressure. I think the migration of barges working in the -- in crude oil service to other products has diminished market confidence and allowed for rates to deteriorate. Historically, rates should not decline when utilization is at current levels. When we think about why this is happening in the inland business, we think it's a combination of loss of market confidence combined with what were historically high rate levels. On a positive note, we do believe that the excess crude oil barges are being absorbed. If we're at the leading edge of a more significant economic downturn, which of course is possible, Kirby will follow the same playbook which has served us well for decades. We will stay patient, work on reducing cost, focus on safety and customer service and take advantage of good and prudent capital allocation opportunities that usually come our way during hard times. 
I'll now turn the call over to David."

Let me start with some comments on the fourth quarter results across our business. I will then turn the call over to Andy to give some added details on our financials before coming back and concluding with comments on our 2016 guidance. 
In the marine transportation segment, our inland marine barge demand remains at good levels, with utilization in the high 80% to low 90% range. Although we do believe industry utilization outside of Kirby may be slightly lower. As Joe mentioned, customer demand has held up relatively well and the market continues to absorb barges coming out of crude service. That said, volume has been less robust than we would expect in a healthy growing economy. Long-term inland marine transportation contracts, those contracts with the term of 1 year or longer in duration, contributed approximately 80% of revenue for the 2015 fourth quarter, with 55% attributable to time charters and 45% from contracts of affreightment. Pricing on inland marine transportation term contracts that renewed during the fourth quarter was down in the low to mid-single digits. Spot contract rates were at or below contract rates during the quarter. In the spot market, we continue to book the majority of our spot equipment with our term contract customers. 
In our coastal marine transportation segment, demand for the coastwise transportation of refined products like oil and petrochemicals remained consistent with the third quarter of 2015. As we have discussed in our third quarter conference call, we've continued to see the trend of the reluctance of customers to term up equipment and electing to access the spot market for their coastal transportation needs. During the fourth quarter, 79% of coastal revenues were under term contracts. Kirby's coastal equipment utilization averaged above 90%, but did briefly touch the high 80s. With respect to coastal marine transportation pricing, term contracts that renewed during the fourth quarter were flat to slightly up. 
In our diesel engine services segment, our marine diesel and power generation markets experienced stable demand in most regions of the country and pockets of strong demand, particularly in the nuclear power market and in the midwest marine market. Largely offsetting these areas of strength was continued weakness in the Gulf of Mexico oil service business where the OSVs and PSVs are. 
Our land-based diesel engine services market remains challenging. Inbound orders for pressure pumping, manufacturing and remanufacturing were virtually nonexistent during the quarter. Demand for service parts and distribution also weakened slightly from the 2015 third quarter. We are pleased to say that our transition from 4 manufacturing and remanufacturing facilities into an expanded single location went smoothly during the quarter and should help us continue to streamline costs and bring down the working capital intensity of this business. While this market is depressed, the pace of inquiries for our remanufacturing service has increased recently as consistent attrition in the industry frac fleet continues. This gives us some guarded optimism for a modest recovery in late '16 or early '17. 
During the 2015 fourth quarter, we continued to execute on our share repurchase authorization, buying approximately 641,000 shares for $39 million or an average of just over $60 per share. The stock price, in our estimation, continues to offer compelling long-term value. In total, for all of 2015, we've repurchased over 3.3 million shares or approximately 5.8% of shares outstanding on January 1, 2015. Currently, our unused repurchase authorization is 1.4 million shares. 
I'll now turn the call over to Andy to provide some detailed financial information before I finish with a discussion on the outlook."
283986,321699234,922765,"Kirby Corporation, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 28, 2016",2016-01-28,"Earnings Calls","Kirby Corporation","Executives","Great. Thank you, David, and good morning. In the 2015 fourth quarter, marine transportation segment revenue declined 7% and operating income declined 16% as compared with the 2014 fourth quarter. The decline in revenue in the fourth quarter as compared t",1169,"Great. Thank you, David, and good morning. In the 2015 fourth quarter, marine transportation segment revenue declined 7% and operating income declined 16% as compared with the 2014 fourth quarter. The decline in revenue in the fourth quarter as compared to the prior year was primarily due to a 41% decline in the average cost of marine diesel fuel, an increase in inland marine delay days and an increase in available spot market days for certain offshore marine equipment. The marine transportation segment's operating margin was 22% compared with 24.3% for the 2014 fourth quarter. The inland sector contributed approximately 2/3 of marine transportation revenue, with the coastal sector contributing 1/3. 
Inland marine weather presented several challenges during the quarter. In the first half of the quarter, we experienced flooding and strong crosscurrents at certain river crossings on the gulf intercoastal waterway as well as the closure of 2 major lochs, which will reopen in mid-November. 
Late in the quarter, high water on the Mississippi River system led to tow restrictions and the closure of the river near St. Louis during the final 3 days of the quarter. These conditions contributed to a 15% year-over-year increase in delay days. High water on the Mississippi River system is continuing into this quarter and, in fact, still impacting the industry in the fourth quarter. Despite these challenges, the inland sector generated an operating margin in the mid-20% range for the quarter. 
In the coastal sector, the number of contract renewals was limited, but pricing on those that did renew were flat to up slightly. As David and Joe each mentioned, we continue to have equipment move into the spot market as customers are reluctant to agree to term contracts and they are increasingly confident that sufficient spot equipment will be available to handle their needs. We have been successful in keeping spot equipment employed at high levels of utilization, which for the quarter averaged over 90%. Nevertheless, even at high levels of utilization, unutilized days for equipment in the spot market have a negative financial impact relative to the contribution provided under time charter contracts. Additionally, voyage and positioning costs incurred in order to take advantage of spot opportunities can impact profitability. The fourth quarter operating margin for the coastal sector was in the mid-teens. 
Over the course of 2015, we took delivery of 36 new tank barges, and when combined with the 6 pressure barges purchased in the first quarter, increased capacity by approximately 590,000 barrels. The number of barges we retired, including returned charter barges, totaled 26. We're moving approximately 380,000 barrels of capacity. We also transferred 2 coastal tank barges that we're working inland back into the coastal fleet. The net result was an addition of 14 tank barges to our inland tank barge fleet at approximately 165,000 barrels of additional capacity. 
In the 2016 first quarter, we expect to take delivery of 3 30,000 barrel inland tank barges, with a total capacity of approximately 90,000 barrels. We currently have no plans to build any tank barges beyond the first quarter, although we will continue to evaluate our needs throughout the year. We expect to retire or return 30 barges over the course of the year and in 2016, with approximately 17.6 million barrels of capacity, a reduction of approximately 365,000 barrels from the end of 2015. In addition to the inland retirements, we retired a 38-year-old ocean-going dry-bulk ATB on the last day of 2015. We expect this will have an approximate $1 million negative year-over-year earnings effect on 2016. 
In the coastwise transportation sector, with respect to our new vessels, construction of our 4 coastal articulated tank barge and tugboat units continues to progress along the schedule we last presented. The first of our 4 planned ATBs, a 185,000-barrel, 10,000-horsepower ATB, entered service late in 2015. Our second new coastal vessel, also a 185,000-barrel ATB, is likely to deliver in mid-2016. Both 185,000-barrel ATBs are under multiyear customer contracts. We continue to expect delivery of the first 155,000-barrel ATB in late 2016, and our second 155,000-barrel ATB is scheduled to deliver by mid-second quarter 2017. 
Additionally, we're building a coastal chemical bar that we expect to enter service in early 2017 as a replacement for equipment expected to retire simultaneously. The coastal equipment requirements that we expect to impact our 2016 results include a 150,000-barrel coastal barge that we retired at the end of 2015 and an 80,000-barrel ATB that we expect to retire in the first quarter of this year. 
You may notice that our total capital expenditures for 2015 were $343 million, approximately $15 million higher than we had anticipated in our last earnings call. This was the result of progress payments on our new coastal units that we incurred in December 2015, a month earlier than anticipated. 
Moving on to our diesel engine services segment. Revenue for the 2015 fourth quarter declined 65% from the 2014 fourth quarter, and we had a small operating loss for the segment. The segment's operating margin was a negative 0.6% compared with 5.4% for the 2014 fourth quarter. The marine and power generation operations contributed approximately 50% of the diesel engine services' revenue in the fourth quarter, with an operating margin in the low double digits. Our land-based operations contributed roughly half of the diesel engine services segment's revenue in the fourth quarter, with a negative operating margin in the low to mid-teens. During the quarter, we recognized some costs related to consolidating our manufacturing facilities into a single location and to inventory adjustments, which led to a more significant operating loss. Also modestly impacting results was our finalization of the previously announced sale of UE Compression LLC early in the 2014 fourth [ph] quarter. 
On the corporate side of things, our cash flow remained strong during the quarter, which helped fund our marine equipment construction plans and $39 million of treasury stock purchases during the quarter. Any future decision to repurchase stock will be based on a number of factors, including the stock price, our long-term earnings and cash flow forecasts as well as alternative opportunities available to deploy capital, including acquisitions. On -- our 2016 capital spending guidance range is $220 million to $240 million, including completion of the 3-in-1 tank barges and 1-in-1 towboat to be delivered in 2016 and approximately $95 million in progress payments on new coastal equipment, including 1 185,000-barrel coastal ATB, 2 155,000-barrel coastal ATBs, 2 4,900-horsepower coastal tugboats and a new coastal petrochemical tank barge. The balance of $124 million to $144 million is primarily for capital upgrades and improvements to existing inland and coastal marine equipment and facilities as well as diesel engine services facilities. Total debt as of December 31, 2015, was $779 million, a $31.6 million decrease from September 30, 2015. Our debt-to-cap ratio at December 31, 2015, was 25.5% compared with 24% as of December 31, 2014. As of today, our debt stands at $734 million.

The outlook for our market is more opaque right now than it has been in many years. Economists tell us that GDP in the U.S. continues to grow, but the source of that growth is not clear. Perhaps the consumer economy is doing okay, but there is a depression in the energy economy and it feels like there is a general malaise, if not, a recession looming in the industrial and manufacturing economies. Most of our markets are being impacted by the volatility in global commodity markets. With these trends as a backdrop, many of our customers are uncertain about the outlook for 2016, which makes the budgeting and forecasting process more difficult. 
Overall, we think our guidance is pragmatic. Although $0.50 is a wider guidance range than we traditionally give for the year, it reflects the uncertainty we see. We do think we've captured our view of the business as they currently stand. Hopefully, commodity prices will stabilize and the factors that led economists to believe GDP is growing become more evident as the year progresses, in which case, our guidance may prove conservative. 
Now let me provide some details on our guidance. In our inland market, our guidance is based on continued modest pricing pressure and high levels of utilization for both the first quarter and full year. At the low end, our guidance factors in spot and contract renewal pricing declined in the mid-single digits and utilization remaining in the high 80% range. At the high end, we are assuming pricing stabilizes at current levels and utilization largely remains in the low 90% range. In both of the scenarios I described, the most influential factor in the income decline from last year is the full year earnings impact from contracts which were repriced at lower levels in 2015. With respect to the first quarter, we also expect an impact from high water that Andy described. We are assuming normal seasonal weather patterns for the remainder of the year. 
In the coastal market, we continue to realize favorable pricing on spot and contract equipment and the benefit from the new 185,000-barrel ATB, which went into service in the fourth quarter of last year. Additionally, the second 185-barrel ATB -- 185,000-barrel ATB, should deliver towards the middle of the year. The new vessels provide some support for coastal operating margins, but they are largely offset by a combination of the retirement of older vessels and from additional unreimbursed costs for those vessels in service in the spot market when they are not working, which Andy walked through. On the low end, our guidance range contemplates a deterioration in coastal rates, and on the high-end of guidance, we are contemplating coastal rates up in the low single-digit percent range. We expect utilization for the first quarter and the full year to remain consistent with the 2015 fourth quarter. 
For our diesel engine services segment and our land-based sector, we expect the markets to remain extremely challenged. Our most current information suggests that capital spending levels for most of our customers will fall further during 2016. As a result, we expect continued small quarterly operating losses in this business. In the second half of the year, there is the potential for a modest amount of remanufacturing and repair work, which is simply based on the premise that pressure pumping activity will not go to 0 and that there is a finite amount of equipment that can be cannibalized. This is a belief that is backed up with recent customer antidotes. 
In our marine diesel and power generation markets, we anticipate overall results to be similar to 2015, with weakness in the Gulf of Mexico oilfield service market persisting. 
In summary, 2015 was a challenging year, but through the challenges, we were able to grow both operating and free cash flow and take steps to position and improve our company for long-term success. We spent over 600 million on a combination of capital expenditures, share repurchases and acquisitions, yet our leverage remained largely unchanged. As always, we will remain focused on what we can control:
cost, customer service, safety and disciplined capital allocation. This approach has served Kirby well over our history. While we entered 2016 with an uncertain outlook and a number of market challenges, our 2016 guidance anticipates another year -- year-over-year increase and free cash flow that combined with our already strong balance sheet, positions us well to take care -- to take advantage of high return opportunities that are often available in these difficult markets. 
Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take questions."

So we think about kind of the anniversarying of those -- of that pressure maybe middle of this year and the -- kind of the start of the build-out of some of the new petrochemical capacity. Is it realistic to think that 350 would not be the high end of the range if pricing were to bottom in the middle of this year?"

So that overhang of crude oil barges is finite, and it -- there may be a level that the industry will just need because there are some moves, for example, that will continue, for example, maybe Utica. And then if you also think about new barge construction, we're hearing that there's very little on the books to be built this year, maybe 50 or less. And we certainly think retirements will be accelerated this year. So that sets up pretty good environment potentially. Now the caveat again has been the economy. But you're right, if things stabilize where we're at, we could be at the upper end of that range."

And then how does that match up with -- we keep hearing about petrochemical build-out late '16, but really having more of an impact on '17. Is there any way to kind of quantify the barge capacity that's required for a lot of this new petrochemical capacity and how that would help balance kind of what's going on the supply side?"

We're not sure where the retirements are, but they should have been more significant in 2015. Typically, we would expect 100 to 150. It may have been more. We're not sure. But Informa puts out a industry survey later this year. Kind of in April, I believe, is when it comes out. We'll get a better feel for how much had been retired. But clearly, going into '16, we would expect retirements to be more aggressive, and we certainly haven't heard of much building being planned for this year. As it relates to chemicals, we have in our IR presentation a list of over $100 billion, $150 billion worth of chemical plants, and we're tracking them. And over -- we think it's around 70% are under construction right now. So we don't think any of them get -- certainly, if they're under construction, we don't believe they'll be canceled. And the good majority of those, or many of them, will start up in 2017, to your point. Now quantifying what that does to barge utilization, it's hard to put an absolute barge count on it. But certainly, it should be a backdrop, a tailwind, if you will, that will drive barge demand. We've talked about it in terms of GDP, plus something. And now what is that plus? I'm not sure we can quantify it, but in ethylene alone, I think, through 2017, the capacity will increase on the order of about 50%. Well, through 2022, yes. They've got it scheduled out through 2022, but it should be positive. It's very difficult to quantify the absolute number."

And the concern is that those levels aren't sustainable as you get additional capacity back from the crude oil service. And it is unusual. I mean, I would have told you that if you'd asked me this before it happened, then it wouldn't happen.

As I look at this market, I think that we're a lot closer to balance than really any other period where you saw pricing declines occur in the past. And as things settle down, I think as people get a little more confident, that utilization isn't going to continue to go down. I think that you'll -- you should get some stability. With respect to regaining some of that pricing, I think that's going to take a little time. But I don't see anything really out there, other than a -- the potential recession that David alluded to. That's more just a feeling that we're not generating the growth in this country that we'd like to see and that if you're in Houston, you're in a depression, which colors your outlook also. And a lot of our customers, of course, are in Houston. So there is some general concern out there that I think you pick up because of the environment that suggests that maybe the economy's going to get worse. But let's assume that doesn't happen.

During the 2015 fourth quarter, in our inland market, utilization declined slightly into the high 80s to low 90% range. The additional capacity created by the decline in crude oil volumes has put pressure on both utilization and rates. Although petrochemicals and refined product volumes are stable, we do sense that there's some underlying weakness in the U.S. and global economy. With respect to the industry fleet, we estimate that approximately 375 barges that were in crude oil service are no longer in crude oil service. And on that positive note, the overhang of crude oil barges moving into other services has continued to decline. We now estimate that fewer than 5% of the industry tank barges are in crude oil service today compared to the peak of 15%. 
Moving to the coastal markets. Utilization has also remained stable -- with utilization in the, again, high 80s and low 90% range. This modest drop in utilization from earlier in the year is explained principally by seasonal-driven -- seasonally-driven barges that are not in service in Alaska at this time of the year. Contact -- contract renewal prices on coastal equipment was flat to slightly up. However, we do see some preference by customers to the spot market, preferring the flexibility of not having to commit to contract tonnage. The utilization levels we have been achieving in the spot market remain at high levels. However, the spot market does expose us to potentially more downtime. 
With respect to our land-based diesel engine service business, it remains under significant pressure. We continue to aggressively take cost and streamline our processes, but we are prepared for another difficult low oil price environment. In the marine and power generation business, it continues to perform well, except to our limited exposure to the oil service business, which services the Gulf of Mexico. 
David is going to provide more color to the key drivers in our 2016 guidance, but before he does, I'd like to comment on our sense of the economy and the outlook for our businesses. 
We find ourselves in an interesting market with respect to our inland business, with utilization levels remaining high but rates under pressure. I think the migration of barges working in the -- in crude oil service to other products has diminished market confidence and allowed for rates to deteriorate. Historically, rates have not declined when utilization is at current levels. When we think about why this is happening in the inland business, we think it's a combination of loss of market confidence combined with what were historically high rate levels. On a positive note, we do believe that the excess crude oil barges are being absorbed. If we're at the leading edge of a more significant economic downturn, which of course is possible, Kirby will follow the same playbook which has served us well for decades. We will stay patient, work on reducing cost, focus on safety and customer service and take advantage of good and prudent capital allocation opportunities that usually come our way during hard times. 
I'll now turn the call over to David."

Let me start with some comments on the fourth quarter results across our business. I will then turn the call over to Andy to give some added details on our financials before coming back and concluding with comments on our 2016 guidance. 
In the marine transportation segment, our inland marine barge demand remains at good levels, with utilization in the high 80% to low 90% range. Although we do believe industry utilization outside of Kirby may be slightly lower. As Joe mentioned, customer demand has held up relatively well and the market continues to absorb barges coming out of crude service. That said, volume has been less robust than we would expect in a healthy growing economy. Long-term inland marine transportation contracts, those contracts with a term of 1 year or longer in duration, contributed approximately 80% of revenue for the 2015 fourth quarter, with 55% attributable to time charters and 45% from contracts of affreightment. Pricing on inland marine transportation term contracts that renewed during the fourth quarter was down in the low to mid-single digits. Spot contract rates were at or below contract rates during the quarter. In the spot market, we continue to book the majority of our spot equipment with our term contract customers. 
In our coastal marine transportation segment, demand for the coastwise transportation of refined products, black oil and petrochemicals remained consistent with the third quarter of 2015. As we have discussed in our third quarter conference call, we've continued to see the trend of the reluctance of customers to term up equipment and electing to access the spot market for their coastal transportation needs. During the fourth quarter, 79% of coastal revenues were under term contracts. Kirby's coastal equipment utilization averaged above 90%, but did briefly touch the high 80s. With respect to coastal marine transportation pricing, term contracts that renewed during the fourth quarter were flat to slightly up. 
In our diesel engine services segment, our marine diesel and power generation markets experienced stable demand in most regions of the country and pockets of strong demand, particularly in the nuclear power market and in the midwest marine market. Largely offsetting these areas of strength was continued weakness in the Gulf of Mexico oil service business where the OSVs and PSVs are. 
Our land-based diesel engine services market remains challenging. Inbound orders for pressure pumping, manufacturing and remanufacturing were virtually nonexistent during the quarter. Demand for service parts and distribution also weakened slightly from the 2015 third quarter. We are pleased to say that our transition from 4 manufacturing and remanufacturing facilities into an expanded single location went smoothly during the quarter and should help us continue to streamline costs and bring down the working capital intensity of this business. While this market is depressed, the pace of inquiries for our remanufacturing service has increased recently as consistent attrition in the industry frac fleet continues. This gives us some guarded optimism for a modest recovery in late '16 or early '17. 
During the 2015 fourth quarter, we continued to execute on our share repurchase authorization, buying approximately 641,000 shares for $39 million or an average of just over $60 per share. The stock price, in our estimation, continues to offer compelling long-term value. In total, for all of 2015, we repurchased over 3.3 million shares or approximately 5.8% of shares outstanding on January 1 of 2015. Currently, our unused repurchase authorization is 1.4 million shares. 
I'll now turn the call over to Andy to provide some detailed financial information before I finish with a discussion on the outlook."

In the 2015 fourth quarter, marine transportation segment revenue declined 7% and operating income declined 16% as compared with the 2014 fourth quarter. The decline in revenue in the fourth quarter as compared t",1168,"Great. Thank you, David, and good morning. In the 2015 fourth quarter, marine transportation segment revenue declined 7% and operating income declined 16% as compared with the 2014 fourth quarter. The decline in revenue in the fourth quarter as compared to the prior year was primarily due to a 41% decline in the average cost of marine diesel fuel, an increase in inland marine delay days and an increase in available spot market days for certain offshore marine equipment. The marine transportation segment's operating margin was 22% compared with 24.3% for the 2014 fourth quarter. The inland sector contributed approximately 2/3 of marine transportation revenue, with the coastal sector contributing 1/3. 
Inland marine weather presented several challenges during the quarter. In the first half of the quarter, we experienced flooding and strong crosscurrents at certain river crossings on the gulf intercoastal waterway as well as the closure of 2 major locks, which were reopened in mid-November. 
Late in the quarter, high water on the Mississippi River system led to tow restrictions and the closure of the river near St. Louis during the final 3 days of the quarter. These conditions contributed to a 15% year-over-year increase in delay days. High water on the Mississippi River system is continuing into this quarter and, in fact, still impacting the industry in the fourth quarter. Despite these challenges, the inland sector generated an operating margin in the mid-20% range for the quarter. 
In the coastal sector, the number of contract renewals was limited, but pricing on those that did renew were flat to up slightly. As David and Joe each mentioned, we continue to have equipment move into the spot market as customers are reluctant to agree to term contracts and they are increasingly confident that sufficient spot equipment will be available to handle their needs. We have been successful in keeping spot equipment employed at high levels of utilization, which for the quarter averaged over 90%. Nevertheless, even at high levels of utilization, unutilized days for equipment in the spot market have a negative financial impact relative to the contribution provided under time charter contracts. Additionally, voyage and positioning costs incurred in order to take advantage of spot opportunities can impact profitability. The fourth quarter operating margin for the coastal sector was in the mid-teens. 
Over the course of 2015, we took delivery of 36 new tank barges, and when combined with the 6 pressure barges purchased in the first quarter, increased capacity by approximately 590,000 barrels. The number of barges we retired, including returned charter barges, totaled 26, removing approximately 380,000 barrels of capacity. We also transferred 2 coastal tank barges that were working inland back into the coastal fleet. The net result was an addition of 14 tank barges to our inland tank barge fleet and approximately 165,000 barrels of additional capacity. 
In the 2016 first quarter, we expect to take delivery of 3 30,000 barrel inland tank barges, with a total capacity of approximately 90,000 barrels. We currently have no plans to build any tank barges beyond the first quarter, although we will continue to evaluate our needs throughout the year. We expect to retire or return 30 barges over the course of the year and in 2016, with approximately 17.6 million barrels of capacity, a reduction of approximately 365,000 barrels from the end of 2015. In addition to the inland retirements, we retired a 38-year-old ocean-going dry-bulk ATB on the last day of 2015. We expect this will have an approximate $1 million negative year-over-year earnings effect on 2016. 
In the coastwise transportation sector, with respect to our new vessels, construction of our 4 coastal articulated tank barge and tugboat units continues to progress along the schedule we last presented. The first of our 4 planned ATBs, a 185,000-barrel, 10,000-horsepower ATB, entered service late in 2015. Our second new coastal vessel, also a 185,000-barrel ATB, is likely to deliver in mid-2016. Both 185,000-barrel ATBs are under multiyear customer contracts. We continue to expect delivery of the first 155,000-barrel ATB in late 2016, and our second 155,000-barrel ATB is scheduled to deliver by mid-second quarter 2017. 
Additionally, we are building a coastal chemical barge that we expect to enter service in early 2017 as a replacement for equipment expected to retire simultaneously. The coastal equipment requirements that we expect to impact our 2016 results include a 150,000-barrel coastal barge that we retired at the end of 2015 and an 80,000-barrel ATB that we expect to retire in the first quarter of this year. 
You may notice that our total capital expenditures for 2015 were $343 million, approximately $15 million higher than we had anticipated in our last earnings call. This was the result of progress payments on our new coastal units that we incurred in December 2015, a month earlier than anticipated. 
Moving on to our diesel engine services segment. Revenue for the 2015 fourth quarter declined 65% from the 2014 fourth quarter, and we had a small operating loss for the segment. The segment's operating margin was a negative 0.6% compared with 5.4% for the 2014 fourth quarter. The marine and power generation operations contributed approximately 50% of the diesel engine services revenue in the fourth quarter, with an operating margin in the low double digits. Our land-based operations contributed roughly half of the diesel engine services segment's revenue in the fourth quarter, with a negative operating margin in the low to mid-teens. During the quarter, we recognized some costs related to consolidating our manufacturing facilities into a single location and to inventory adjustments, which led to a more significant operating loss. Also modestly impacting results was our finalization of the previously-announced sale of UE Compression LLC early in the 2015 fourth [ph] quarter. 
On the corporate side of things, our cash flow remained strong during the quarter, which helped fund our marine equipment construction plans and $39 million of treasury stock purchases during the quarter. Any future decision to repurchase stock will be based on a number of factors, including the stock price, our long-term earnings and cash flow forecasts as well as alternative opportunities available to deploy capital, including acquisitions. On -- our 2016 capital spending guidance range is $220 million to $240 million, including completion of the 3-in-1 tank barges and 1-in-1 towboat to be delivered in 2016 and approximately $95 million in progress payments on new coastal equipment, including 1 185,000-barrel coastal ATB, 2 155,000-barrel coastal ATBs, 2 4,900-horsepower coastal tugboats and a new coastal petrochemical tank barge. The balance of $124 million to $144 million is primarily for capital upgrades and improvements to existing inland and coastal marine equipment and facilities as well as diesel engine services facilities. Total debt as of December 31, 2015, was $779 million, a $31.6 million decrease from September 30, 2015. Our debt-to-cap ratio at December 31, 2015, was 25.5% compared with 24% as of December 31, 2014. As of today, our debt stands at $734 million.

In our press release, we announced our 2016 first quarter guidance of $0.75 to $0.85 per share and for the 2016 full year guidance of $3 to $3.50 per share. I'll provide some additional clarity behind the assumptions used in our guidance",828,"Thank you, Andy. In our press release, we announced our 2016 first quarter guidance of $0.75 to $0.85 per share and for the 2016 full year guidance of $3 to $3.50 per share. I'll provide some additional clarity behind the assumptions used in our guidance range in a moment, but first, let me address the environment more holistically. 
The outlook for our markets is more opaque right now than it has been in many years. Economists tell us that GDP in the U.S. continues to grow, but the source of that growth is not clear. Perhaps the consumer economy is doing okay, but there is a depression in the energy economy and it feels like there is a general malaise, if not a recession looming, in the industrial and manufacturing economies. Most of our markets are being impacted by the volatility in global commodity markets. With these trends as a backdrop, many of our customers are uncertain about the outlook for 2016, which makes the budgeting and forecasting process more difficult. 
Overall, we think our guidance is pragmatic. Although $0.50 is a wider guidance range than we traditionally give for the year, it reflects the uncertainty we see. We do think we've captured our view of the business as they currently stand. Hopefully, commodity prices will stabilize and the factors that led economists to believe GDP is growing become more evident as the year progresses, in which case, our guidance may prove conservative. 
Now let me provide some details on our guidance. In our inland market, our guidance is based on continued modest pricing pressure and high levels of utilization for both the first quarter and full year. At the low end, our guidance factors in spot and contract renewal pricing declines in the mid-single digits and utilization remaining in the high 80% range. At the high end, we are assuming pricing stabilizes at current levels and utilization largely remains in the low 90% range. In both of the scenarios I describe, the most influential factor in the income decline from last year is the full year earnings impact from contracts which were repriced at lower levels in 2015. With respect to the first quarter, we also expect an impact from high water that Andy described. We are assuming normal seasonal weather patterns for the remainder of the year. 
In the coastal market, we continue to realize favorable pricing on spot and contract equipment and the benefit from the new 185,000-barrel ATB, which went into service in the fourth quarter of last year. Additionally, the second 185-barrel ATB -- 185,000-barrel ATB, should deliver towards the middle of the year. The new vessels provide some support for coastal operating margins, but they are largely offset by a combination of the retirement of older vessels and from additional unreimbursed costs for those vessels in service in the spot market when they are not working, which Andy walked through. On the low end, our guidance range contemplates a deterioration in coastal rates, and on the high-end of guidance, we are contemplating coastal rates up in the low single-digit percent range. We expect utilization for the first quarter and the full year to remain consistent with the 2015 fourth quarter. 
For our diesel engine services segment and our land-based sector, we expect the market to remain extremely challenged. Our most current information suggests that capital spending levels for most of our customers will fall further during 2016. As a result, we expect continued small quarterly operating losses in this business. In the second half of the year, there is the potential for a modest amount of remanufacturing and repair work, which is simply based on the premise that pressure pumping activity will not go to 0 and that there is a finite amount of equipment that can be cannibalized. This is a belief that is backed up with recent customer antidotes. 
In our marine diesel and power generation markets, we anticipate overall results to be similar to 2015, with weakness in the Gulf of Mexico oilfield service market persisting. 
In summary, 2015 was a challenging year, but through the challenges, we were able to grow both operating and free cash flow and take steps to position and improve our company for long-term success. We spent over 600 million on a combination of capital expenditures, share repurchases and acquisitions, yet our leverage remained largely unchanged. As always, we will remain focused on what we can control:
costs, customer service, safety and disciplined capital allocation. This approach has served Kirby well over our history. While we entered 2016 with an uncertain outlook and a number of market challenges, our 2016 guidance anticipates another year -- year-over-year increase in free cash flow that, combined with our already strong balance sheet, positions us well to take care -- to take advantage of high return opportunities that are often available in these difficult markets.

So that overhang of crude oil barges is finite, and it -- there may be a level that the industry will just need because there are some moves, for example, that will continue; for example, maybe Utica. And then if you also think about new barge construction, we're hearing that there's very little on the books to be built this year, maybe 50 or less. And we certainly think retirements will be accelerated this year. So that sets up a pretty good environment potentially. Now the caveat again has been the economy. But you're right, if things stabilize where we're at, we could be at the upper end of that range."

We're not sure where the retirements are, but they should have been more significant in 2015. Typically, we would expect 100 to 150. It may have been more. We're not sure. But Informa puts out a industry survey later this year. Kind of in April, I believe, is when it comes out. We'll get a better feel for how much had been retired. But clearly, going into '16, we would expect retirements to be more aggressive, and we certainly haven't heard of much building being planned for this year. As it relates to chemicals, we have in our IR presentation a list of over $100 billion, $150 billion worth of chemical plants, and we're tracking them.

And the good majority of those, or many of them, will start up in 2017, to your point. Now quantifying what that does to barge utilization, it's hard to put an absolute barge count on it. But certainly, it should be a backdrop, a tailwind, if you will, that will drive barge demand. We've talked about it in terms of GDP, plus something. And now what is that plus? I'm not sure we can quantify it, but in ethylene alone, I think, through 2017, the capacity will increase on the order of about 50%. Well, through 2022, yes. They've got it scheduled out through 2022. But it should be positive. It's very difficult to quantify the absolute number."

And the concern is that those levels aren't sustainable as you get additional capacity back from the crude oil service. And it is unusual. I mean, I would have told you that if you'd asked me this before it happened, that it wouldn't happen. But I think that there was some overenthusiasm in the business that was then crushed by equipment suddenly being returned and having to be placed in other service. As I look at this market, I think that we're a lot closer to balance than really any other period where you saw pricing declines occur in the past. And as things settle down, I think as people get a little more confident that utilization isn't going to continue to go down, I think that you'll -- you should get some stability. With respect to regaining some of that pricing, I think that's going to take a little time. But I don't see anything really out there, other than a -- the potential recession that David alluded to. That's more just a feeling that we're not generating the growth in this country that we'd like to see and that if you're in Houston, you're in a depression, which colors your outlook also. And a lot of our customers, of course, are in Houston. So there is some general concern out there that I think you pick up because of the environment that suggests that maybe the economy's going to get worse. But let's assume that doesn't happen.

Yesterday afternoon, we announced first quarter earnings of $0.71 per share, including severance charges of approximately $0.06 per share versus our guidance range of $0.75 to $0.85 per share. That compares with $1.0",519,"Thank you, Sterling, and good morning. Yesterday afternoon, we announced first quarter earnings of $0.71 per share, including severance charges of approximately $0.06 per share versus our guidance range of $0.75 to $0.85 per share. That compares with $1.09 per share reported first quarter last year. And the marine tank barge utilization during the first quarter remained in the 90% to 95% range. The supply overhang from barges cleaned out of crude oil service and put into other trades over the past 12 to 18 months continue to have some impact on pricing. However, we think the trend of barge cleaning out of crude oil service into clean service has slowed significantly and we believe that industry utilization levels have modestly improved. Additionally, we have not seen an increase in inland tank barge -- in the inland tank barge order book for 2016, which is now at low levels. Should the trend -- trends that we've seen in April continue for another couple of months, our outlook for this business will continue to improve. 
In the coastal sector of our business, utilization remained stable, with coastal tank barge utilization in high 80s to low 90% range. Market is in relative balance even with the additional spot exposure. Average pricing on contract renewals of the coastal equipment increased during the quarter. A part of this increase was the result of price adjustments of legacy contracts, which were below market rates. Also influencing our results in this business is the amount of equipment trading in the spot market, which has idle time exposure. In our land-based Diesel Engine Services business, market conditions deteriorated further than we envisioned when we provided guidance in January. There's not been many positive signals in the oil service market. There's been accelerating decline in U.S. oil production, which has led to cannibalization -- or at least cannibalization to existing U.S. pressure pumping capacity, which should create future demand. However, without more tangible improvement, the prudent thing to do is to aggressively reduce cost in this business. 
Market has simply been far worse for longer than I think anyone in the market anticipated, as evidenced by recent earnings and CapEx revision -- revisions by several large oil service companies. In the marine power generation business, our marine diesel engine business, the oil -- oil service market, which services the Gulf of Mexico remain depressed and we experienced customer deferrals of major maintenance projects throughout all of our marine engine service locations during the quarter. This is not unusual when you get in this kind of environment. This broad impact on our marine market speaks to the uncertainty of not only the oil service business, but also the dry cargo market that the inland side of the business services. And at some respects, the general economy. In summary, we find ourselves in the midst of a very challenging environment in both our marine and diesel engine businesses. At the same time, we have seen some encouraging trends in our Marine markets, particularly the inland market where pricing seems more stabilize. I'll now turn the call over to David."
283986,330362870,968117,"Kirby Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Kirby Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with a quick comment on our recent cost savings actions and then move to first quarter results across our businesses. Our cost-cutting efforts included a reduction in force that was implemented in F",872,"Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with a quick comment on our recent cost savings actions and then move to first quarter results across our businesses. Our cost-cutting efforts included a reduction in force that was implemented in February. We reduced headcount and corporate staff, marines shore-side staff and diesel engine personnel. These reductions led to severance cost of approximately $0.06 a share. While the staffing reduction was the most visible cost-cutting actions during the quarter, we have several teams dedicate to streamlining of our cost structure across the company and in improving customer service. It is our belief that as conditions across our markets improve, we will be positioned to improve market share in each of our businesses while simultaneously improving profitability. 
Turning now to a summary of first quarter results. In the marine transportation segment, our inland marine barge demand saw some modest sequential improvement as utilization stayed in the 90% to 95% range throughout the quarter. During the quarter, high wind and fog impacted operations along the Gulf Coast and high water on the Mississippi River system led to the delays and added horsepower requirements. The direct cost associated with these challenges were partially mitigated by contract losses that protect us from navigation delays, particularly as it relates to high water. On a fairly positive note, we think the number of barges transitioning from crude oil into other services slowed dramatically. We believe the industry fleet wide number of barges include services really just under 175, virtually unchanged from earlier in the year. The industry has absorbed a large number of barges from both new construction and from displaced crude movements during the past year to 18 months and is very close to tightly balanced. 
Nevertheless, pricing on our inland Marine transportation term contracts that renewed during the first quarter were down in the single-digit range. Average contract pricing was skewed lower by repricing of some longer-term contracts. Excluding these contracts, a more representative indication of pricing on inland contract renewals was down in the low-single-digit percent range on a year-over-year basis. 
Spot contract rates were roughly in line with contract rates during the quarter and were flat sequentially with the 2015 fourth quarter. However, in April, we did see some firming in the spot market from market close. In the inland marine market, we continued to see growth, modest growth and demand for petrochemicals and refined products transportation, with crude oil demand relatively flat with the 2015 fourth quarter. The black oil market, meaning heated products excluding crude oil was weak throughout the quarter, largely due to commodity price volatility, but utilization our Blackwell fleet recovered toward the end of the quarter and into April. 
In our coastal marine transportation segment, demand for the coast was transportation refine products, black oil and petrochemicals remain consistent with the 2015 fourth quarter and tank barge utilization continue to be relatively strong. With respect to pricing term contracts that renewed during the first quarter increased by double-digit percentage on average. However, this pricing was skewed by the renewal of a couple of small legacy contracts with rates that were significantly below market levels. 
Excluding those contract renewals, renewals on coastal equipment contracts were essentially flat. 
In our Diesel Engine Services segment them as Joe mentioned, our marine diesel and power generation markets experienced widespread deferrals of major maintenance projects across all of our marine diesel engine operating regions. While there is some possibility that these deferrals could lead to higher business levels later this year, our assumption is that, that will not happen, particularly if the inland dry cargo barge and Gulf of Mexico oil service markets do not improve. 
In our land-based Diesel Engine Services market, our ability to maintain break-even profit levels with our current staffing was dependent on maintaining a steady level of parts and components sales and a modest amount of remanufacturing activity, a view was regarded from close coordination with our major customers. However, as the first quarter progress, orders for parts and components declined precipitously. Projected spending levels from our major customers for the full year 2016 for parts and components sales were revised down by over 50%. 
On the service side of the business, the year began with some incrementally positive indicators as customers requested to remanufacture portions of their fleets with the opportunity to remanufacture the larger portions of their fleets as the year progressed. However, financial stress and uncertainty around consolidation opportunities among our customer base has resulted in almost all remanufacturing being placed on hold through the near term. As we work through these challenges, an await an inevitable improvement in the market, we want to strike a balance between maintaining the capability to respond to demand when the market turns and a cost structure that is appropriate for the current market. The volatility of the market and opaqueness of the outlook make this difficult. So we thought it prudent to assume these tough conditions persists through the remainder of this year and consequently, we reflected that in our forecast. I will now turn the call over to Andy to provide some detailed financial information before I finish up with a more detailed discussion of the outlook."

In the 2016 first quarter, marine transportation segment declined 10%, and operating income declined 28% as compared with the 2015 first quarter. This decline in revenue was primarily due to a 38% decline in the average cost of marine diesel fuel, lower inland marine contract pricing and an increase in available spot market days for some of our offshore marine equipment. The marine transportation segment's operating margin was 18.4% compared with 22.9% for the 2015 first quarter. The inland sector contributed approximately 2/3 of marine transportation revenue during the 2016 first quarter. 
Long-term inland marine transportation contracts, those contracts with a year with a term of 1 year or longer in duration, contributed approximately 80% of revenue, with 55% attributable to time charters and 45% from teh fragment contracts. As David mentioned from, our utilization was consistently above 90% throughout the quarter and the inland sector generated operating margin in the low 20% range for the quarter. 
In the coastal sector, utilization during the quarter was in the high 80% to low 90% range. The trend of our customers electing to source coastal equipment through the spot market versus renewing existing term contracts continued in the first quarter, as we saw the percentage of coastal revenue under term contracts dropped slightly from the 2015 fourth quarter to 78%. The first quarter operating margin for the coastal sector was in the low- to mid-teens. 
As mentioned in the press release last night, we incurred an approximate $5.6 million or $0.06 per share in severance expenses during the quarter. Of this amount, approximately $0.03 per share was in our inland marine business, approximately $0.01 per share is in our coastal marine business and approximately $0.01 in our marine and power generation diesel businesses, with the remainder split between the land-based diesel engine business and the Kirby Corporate Office. 
Turning now to our marine construction and retirement plans. During the 2016 first quarter, we took delivery of 3 new tank barges, and we're total of 16 barges. The net result was a reduction of 13 tank barges to our inland tank barge fleet while approximately 278,000 barrels of capacity. Also during the quarter, we committed to build an additional 4 of 30,000 barrels tank barges for delivery in 2016 to be our existing fleet needs and attractive pricing. For the remaining 9 months of the year, we expect to take delivery of these 4 inland tank barges and to retire or return an additional 18 barges with 235,000 barrels of capacity. 
On a net basis, before giving effect to the additions from the SQL fleet, we expect to end 2016 with approximately 17.5 million barrels of capacity, a reduction of approximately 400,000 barrels from the end of 2015. In mid-April, we closed on the acquisition of sea course fleet of 27 30,000-barrel inland tank barges. Additionally, 1 30,000-barrel tank barge and 1 in 1 [ph] tow boat are under construction and are expected to be delivered before the end of the quarter. Including these additions to our inland fleet, we expected to end 2016 with a total of 18.4 million barrels of capacity. 
In the coastal transportation sector, we expect delivery of our second new 185,000-barrel ATB in mid-2016. The first of 2 new 155,000-barrel ATB should also deliver in late 2016. Our second 155,000-barrel ATB and the coastal chemical barge are expected to be completed in 2017. Our 2016 coastal equipment capacity plan includes a single retirement of an 80,000-barrel tank barge in the second quarter. On a net basis, we expect to end the year with 6.3 million barrels of capacity and additional 260,000 barrels from the end of the 2016 first quarter. 
Moving onto our Diesel Engine Services segment. Revenue for the 2016 first quarter declined 52% from the 2015 first quarter and we had an $806,000 operating loss for the segment. This segment operating margin was a negative 1% compared with 5.3% for the 2015 first quarter. The Marine and power generation operations contributed approximately 60% of the Diesel Engine Services revenue in the first quarter, with an operating margin in the low double digits. Our land-based operations contributed roughly 40% of the Diesel Engine Services segment revenue in the first quarter, with a negative operating margin in the high-teens. 
On the corporate side of things, we raised our 2016 capital spending guidance range by $10 million to a range of $230 million to $250 million to account for the additional 4 inland tank barges that we expect to build this year. Our capital spending guidance for the year includes approximately $10 million for the construction of 7 inland tank barges to be delivered in 2016, approximately $100 million in progress payments on new coastal equipment, including 1 185,000-barrel coastal ATB, 2 150,000-barrel coastal ATBs, 2 4,900-horsepower coastal tugboats and a new coastal petrochemical tank barge. The balance of $120 million to $140 million is primarily for capital upgrades and improvements to existing inland and coastal marine equipment and facilities, as well as diesel engine services facilities. In addition to capital spending guidance for the year, we used $88 million in cash in April this year for the purchase of the sea course 30,000-barrel in 1 tank barge fleet. 
During the 2016 first quarter, we continued to execute on our share repurchase authorization, buying approximately 35,000 shares for $1.8 million or $52.53 per share. Stock price, in our estimation, continues to offer compelling long-term value. We will continue to evaluate share repurchases in concert with other capital allocation opportunities. Currently, our unused repurchase authorization is approximately 1.4 million shares. Total debt as of March 31, 2016 was $712 million, a $63 million decrease from December 31, 2015. Our debt-to-cap ratio at March 31 was 23.5% compared with the 25.4% at the end of last year. As of today, our debt stands at $783 million. I will now turn the call back over to David."

In our press release, we announced our 2016 second quarter guidance of $0.65 to $0.75 per share and for the 2016 full year guidance of $2.80 to $3.20 per share. Our guidance for the year reflects our 2016 first quarter GAAP earnings per share of $0.71, which includes $0.06 per share of severance charges. As we mentioned earlier, the significant change in our outlook is related to the land-based diesel engine business, which we now expect to incur quarterly operating losses for the remainder of the year. With that overview of our -- of the changes to our guidance, let me also briefly address the primary factors in the guidance range for each of our markets. 
In our inland marine transportation market, as mentioned in our press release last night, the inland market showed some tangible signs of improvement in April with utilization improving, particularly for 30,000-barrel tank barges, and competitors spot pricing in the spot market improving from previous month. Refined products and chemical volumes have been strong with the black haul market seeing some renewed strength in April following at the first quarter. While we're encouraged by these developments, we are cautious and extrapolating the impact for the rest of the year. At the low end of our guidance, our guidance factors and spots and contract renewal pricing include declines of low single-digits and tank barge utilization in the high 80s to low 90% range. At the high-end, we are assuming year-over-year pricing stability going forward and utilization in the 90% to 95% range. We are assuming normal seasonal weather patterns for the remainder of the year. 
In the coastal markets, on the high end of guidance, we are expecting flat to slightly higher pricing on contract renewals and utilization in the high 80% range. On the low end, our guidance range contemplates a deterioration in coastal rates with pricing declines on contract renewals in the low single-digit percentage range and utilization in the mid-80% range. For our Diesel Engine Services segment in our land-based sector, although oil prices have improved somewhat, it has not yet translated to an improved outlook. The improvement may come in the second half, but with lower spending levels seen in the first quarter, we felt it prudent to adjust this portion of our quarterly and full year guidance. We will continue to evaluate market conditions and adjust the cost structure as necessary to meet current and projected levels of demand. For the balance -- what must balance the lack of volume in today's market was the outlook for our market recovery as oil prices continue and increase. Where we fall within our guidance range of this year will partly probably hinge on whether we see an improvement in activity in the second half of the year. In our marine, diesel and power generation markets, we expect the weakness in the Gulf of Mexico oil service markets to persist for the entire year. There is some possibility that major maintenance projects deferred by customers in the first quarter could drive better performance later this year. But our business based case assumption is that those deferrals will not lead to firm orders until 2017. So in summary, our balance sheet and cash flow are in great shape, giving us the flexibility to do acquisitions and share repurchases. The Marine business is stable with the inland markets poised for improvement and with the bright outlook for petrochemical volumes. Diesel Engine Services is weak, but with a growing pent-up demand. And in the diesel engine business is, it is not a question of if the markets will come back, but a question of when. Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready to take questions."

And those we know, many of them were placed early in 2015 or in 2015. So kind of a carryover.

And so we've added --  we'll have added when we complete the new builds here, we'll have added 5 new barges on a basis of 70, right? So that's kind of proportionate to our size.

From our view, in terms of pricing, given through what we've been going through in the inland market, pricing gets more reasonable price expectations becomes more reasonable and that's a good thing. As you know, John, it's really tough to predict acquisitions. We're always talking to people. There are some people that may have a lot more stress in terms of leverage than others, but predicting that an predicting an acquisition out of that environment is difficult. I think our view is, as you know, just maintain our discipline.

Can I get that capital back. And so given what we've gone through here recently, those older barges get harder and harder to justify and that triggers kind of the retirement. We've seen this in past cycles where the retirements get pretty heavy. We kind of expect them to be on the heavier side than they have been for the last couple of years for sure. On the coastwise business, it's -- some of these assets are over 30 years old. I think that count -- last count was 45. We're over 30 years old and in the coastwise environment, that's getting pretty old. And we, Kirby, have retired some of our older assets recently in that space and I think our competitors are going through the same thought process that we are in terms of extending very old coastwise barges. As you know, those are much more expensive than inland barges. So extending their lives is that much more capital. I don't know if that helps with the answer there, Chris."

Yesterday afternoon, we announced first quarter earnings of $0.71 per share, including severance charges of approximately $0.06 per share versus our guidance range of $0.75 to $0.85 per share. That compares wit",524,"Okay. Thank you, Sterling, and good morning. Yesterday afternoon, we announced first quarter earnings of $0.71 per share, including severance charges of approximately $0.06 per share versus our guidance range of $0.75 to $0.85 per share. That compares with $1.09 per share reported first quarter last year. Inland marine tank barge utilization during the first quarter remained in the 90% to 95% range. The supply overhang from barges cleaned out of crude oil service and put into other trades over the past 12 to 18 months continue to have some impact on pricing. However, we think the trend of barge cleaning out of crude oil service into clean service has slowed significantly and we believe that industry utilization levels have modestly improved. Additionally, we have not seen an increase in inland tank barge -- in the inland tank barge order book for 2016, which is now at low levels. Should the trend -- trends that we've seen in April continue for another couple of months, our outlook for this business will continue to improve. 
In the coastal sector of our business, utilization remained stable, with coastal tank barge utilization in the high 80s to low 90% range. Market is in relative balance, even with the additional spot exposure. Average pricing on contract renewals of the coastal equipment increased during the quarter. A part of this increase was the result of price adjustments in legacy contracts, which were below market rates. Also influencing our results in this business is the amount of equipment trading in the spot market, which has idle time exposure. In our land-based Diesel Engine Services business, market conditions deteriorated further than we envisioned when we provided guidance in January. There have not been many positive signals in the oil service market. There's been an accelerating decline in U.S. oil production, which has led to cannibalization -- or at least some cannibalization to existing U.S. pressure pumping capacity, which should create future demand. However, without more tangible improvement, the prudent thing to do is to aggressively reduce cost in this business. 
Market has simply been far worse for longer than I think anyone in the market anticipated, as evidenced by recent earnings and CapEx revision -- revisions by several large oil service companies. In the marine power generation business, our marine diesel engine business, the oil -- oil service market, which services the Gulf of Mexico remain depressed and we experienced customer deferrals of major maintenance projects throughout all of our marine engine service locations during the quarter. This is not unusual when you get in this kind of environment. This broad impact on our marine market speaks to the uncertainty of not only the oil service business, but also the dry cargo market that the inland side of the business services. And in some respects, the general economy. In summary, we find ourselves in the midst of a very challenging environment in both our marine and diesel engine businesses. At the same time, we have seen some encouraging trends in our Marine markets, particularly the inland market where pricing seems to have stabilized. I'll now turn the call over to David."
283986,330362870,968364,"Kirby Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Kirby Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with a quick comment on our recent cost savings actions and then move to first quarter results across our businesses. Our cost-cutting efforts included a reduction in force that was implemented in F",876,"Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with a quick comment on our recent cost savings actions and then move to first quarter results across our businesses. Our cost-cutting efforts included a reduction in force that was implemented in February. We reduced headcount and corporate staff, marine shore-side staff and diesel engine personnel. These reductions led to severance costs of approximately $0.06 a share. While the staffing reduction was the most visible cost-cutting action during the quarter, we have several teams dedicated to the streamlining of our cost structure across the company and in improving customer service. It is our belief that as conditions across our markets improve, we will be positioned to improve market share in each of our businesses while simultaneously improving profitability. 
Turning now to a summary of first quarter results. In the marine transportation segment, our inland marine barge demand saw some modest sequential improvement as utilization stayed in the 90% to 95% range throughout the quarter. During the quarter, high wind and fog impacted operations along the Gulf Coast and high water on the Mississippi River system led to the delays and added horsepower requirements. The direct cost associated with these challenges were partially mitigated by contract clauses that protect us from navigation delays, particularly as it relates to high water. On a clearly positive note, we think the number of barges transitioning from crude oil into other services slowed dramatically. We believe the industry fleet-wide number of barges in crude services, currently just under 175, virtually unchanged from earlier in the year. The industry has absorbed a large number of barges from both new construction and from displaced crude movements during the past year to 18 months, and is very close to tightly balanced. 
Nevertheless, pricing on our inland Marine transportation term contracts that renewed during the first quarter were down in the single-digit range. Average contract pricing was skewed lower by repricing of some longer-term contracts. Excluding these contracts, a more representative indication of pricing on inland contract renewals was down in the low-single-digit percent range on a year-over-year basis. 
Spot contract rates were roughly in line with contract rates during the quarter and were flat sequentially with the 2015 fourth quarter. However, in April, we did see some firming in the spot market from market lows. In the inland marine market, we continued to see growth, modest growth and demand for petrochemicals and refined products transportation, with crude oil demand relatively flat with the 2015 fourth quarter. The black oil market, meaning heated products, excluding crude oil, was weak throughout the quarter, largely due to commodity price volatility, but utilization in our Blackwell fleet recovered toward the end of the quarter and into April. 
In our coastal marine transportation segment, demand for the coast was transportation of refined products, black oil and petrochemicals remain consistent with the 2015 fourth quarter and tank barge utilization continued to be relatively strong. With respect to pricing term contracts that renewed during the first quarter increased by a double-digit percentage on average. However, this pricing was skewed by the renewal of a couple of small legacy contracts with rates that were significantly below market levels. 
Excluding those contract renewals, renewals on coastal equipment contracts were essentially flat. 
In our Diesel Engine Services segment, as Joe mentioned, our marine diesel and power generation markets experienced widespread deferrals of major maintenance projects across all of our marine diesel engine operating regions. While there is some possibility that these deferrals could lead to higher business levels later this year, our assumption is that, that will not happen, particularly if the inland dry cargo barge and Gulf of Mexico oil service markets do not improve. 
In our land-based Diesel Engine Services market, our ability to maintain break-even profit levels with our current staffing was dependent on maintaining a steady level of parts and component sales and a modest amount of remanufacturing activity, a view which we garnered from close coordination with our major customers. However, as the first quarter progressed, orders for parts and components declined precipitously. Projected spending levels from our major customers for the full year 2016 for parts and component sales were revised down by over 50%. 
On the service side of the business, the year began with some incrementally positive indicators, as customers requested to remanufacture portions of their fleets with the opportunity to remanufacture the larger portions of their fleet as the year progressed. However, financial stress and uncertainty around consolidation opportunities among our customer base has resulted in almost all remanufacturing being placed on hold for the near term. As we work through these challenges, and await an inevitable improvement in the market, we want to strike a balance between maintaining the capability to respond to demand when the market turns and a cost structure that is appropriate for the current market. The volatility of the market and opaqueness of the outlook make this difficult. So we thought it prudent to assume these tough conditions persist through the remainder of this year and consequently, we reflected that in our forecast. I will now turn the call over to Andy to provide some detailed financial information before I finish up with a more detailed discussion of the outlook."

In the 2016 first quarter, marine transportation segment revenue declined 10%, and operating income declined 28% as compared with the 2015 first quarter. This decline in revenue was primarily due to a 38% decline in the average cost of marine diesel fuel, lower inland marine contract pricing and an increase in available spot market days for some of our offshore marine equipment. The marine transportation segment's operating margin was 18.4% compared with 22.9% for the 2015 first quarter. The inland sector contributed approximately 2/3 of marine transportation revenue during the 2016 first quarter. 
Long-term inland marine transportation contracts, those contracts with a year -- with a term of 1 year or longer in duration, contributed approximately 80% of revenue, with 55% attributable to time charters and 45% from affreightment contracts. As David mentioned, our utilization was consistently above 90% throughout the quarter and the inland sector generated an operating margin in the low 20% range for the quarter. 
In the coastal sector, utilization during the quarter was in the high 80% to low 90% range. The trend of our customers electing to source coastal equipment through the spot market versus renewing existing term contracts continued in the first quarter, as we saw the percentage of coastal revenue under term contracts drop slightly from the 2015 fourth quarter to 78%. The first quarter operating margin for the coastal sector was in the low- to mid-teens. 
As mentioned in the press release last night, we incurred an approximate $5.6 million or $0.06 per share in severance expenses during the quarter. Of this amount, approximately $0.03 per share was in our inland marine business, approximately $0.01 per share is in our coastal marine business and approximately $0.01 in our marine and power generation diesel businesses, with the remainder split between the land-based Diesel Engine business and the Kirby Corporate Office. 
Turning now to our marine construction and retirement plans. During the 2016 first quarter, we took delivery of 3 new tank barges, and we retired a total of 16 barges. The net result was a reduction of 13 tank barges to our inland tank barge fleet, or approximately 278,000 barrels of capacity. Also during the quarter, we committed to build an additional 4 30,000 barrels tank barges for delivery in 2016, to meet our existing fleet needs and attractive pricing. For the remaining 9 months of the year, we expect to take delivery of these 4 inland tank barges and to retire or return an additional 18 barges with 235,000 barrels of capacity. 
On a net basis, before giving effect to the additions from the Seacor fleet, we expect to end 2016 with approximately 17.5 million barrels of capacity, a reduction of approximately 400,000 barrels from the end of 2015. In mid-April, we closed on the acquisition of Seacor's fleet of 27 30,000-barrel inland tank barges. Additionally, 1 30,000-barrel tank barge and 1 inland tow boat are under construction and are expected to be delivered before the end of the quarter. Including these additions to our inland fleet, we expected to end 2016 with a total of 18.4 million barrels of capacity. 
In the coastwise transportation sector, we expect delivery of our second new 185,000-barrel ATB in mid-2016. The first of 2 new 155,000-barrel ATBs should also deliver in late 2016. Our second 155,000-barrel ATB and the coastal chemical barge are expected to be completed in 2017. Our 2016 coastal equipment capacity plan includes a single retirement of an 80,000-barrel tank barge in the second quarter. On a net basis, we expect to end the year with 6.3 million barrels of capacity, an additional 260,000 barrels from the end of the 2016 first quarter. 
Moving on to our Diesel Engine Services segment. Revenue for the 2016 first quarter declined 52% from the 2015 first quarter and we had an $806,000 operating loss for the segment. The segment's operating margin was a negative 1% compared with 5.3% for the 2015 first quarter. The Marine and power generation operations contributed approximately 60% of the Diesel Engine Services revenue in the first quarter, with an operating margin in the low double digits. Our land-based operations contributed roughly 40% of the Diesel Engine Services segment revenue in the first quarter, with a negative operating margin in the high-teens. 
On the corporate side of things, we raised our 2016 capital spending guidance range by $10 million to a range of $230 million to $250 million to account for the additional 4 inland tank barges that we expect to build this year. Our capital spending guidance for the year includes approximately $10 million for the construction of 7 inland tank barges to be delivered in 2016, approximately $100 million in progress payments on new coastal equipment, including 1 185,000-barrel coastal ATB, 2 150,000-barrel coastal ATBs, 2 4,900-horsepower coastal tugboats and a new coastal petrochemical tank barge. The balance of $120 million to $140 million is primarily for capital upgrades and improvements to existing inland and coastal marine equipment and facilities, as well as diesel engine services facilities. In addition to capital spending guidance for the year, we used $88 million in cash in April of this year for the purchase of Seacor's 30,000-barrel inland tank barge fleet. 
During the 2016 first quarter, we continued to execute on our share repurchase authorization, buying approximately 35,000 shares for $1.8 million or $52.53 per share. Stock price, in our estimation, continues to offer compelling long-term value. We will continue to evaluate share repurchases in concert with other capital allocation opportunities. Currently, our unused repurchase authorization is approximately 1.4 million shares. Total debt as of March 31, 2016 was $712 million, a $63 million decrease from December 31, 2015. Our debt-to-cap ratio at March 31 was 23.5% compared with the 25.4% at the end of last year. As of today, our debt stands at $783 million. I will now turn the call back over to David."

In our press release, we announced our 2016 second quarter guidance of $0.65 to $0.75 per share and for the 2016 full year guidance of $2.80 to $3.20 per share. Our guidance for the year reflects our 2016 first quarter GAAP earnings per share of $0.71, which includes $0.06 per share of severance charges. As we mentioned earlier, the significant change in our outlook is related to the land-based diesel engine business, which we now expect to incur quarterly operating losses for the remainder of the year. With that overview of our -- of the changes to our guidance, let me also briefly address the primary factors in the guidance range for each of our markets. 
In our inland marine transportation market, as mentioned in our press release last night, the inland market showed some tangible signs of improvement in April, with utilization improving, particularly for 30,000-barrel tank barges, and competitor spot pricing in the spot market improving from previous month. Refined products and chemical volumes have been strong, with the black oil market seeing some renewed strength in April following a tough first quarter. While we're encouraged by these developments, we are cautious in extrapolating the impact for the rest of the year. At the low end of our guidance, our guidance factors in spot and contract renewal pricing, includes declines of low single-digits and tank barge utilization in the high 80s to low 90% range. At the high-end, we are assuming year-over-year pricing stability going forward and utilization in the 90% to 95% range. We are assuming normal seasonal weather patterns for the remainder of the year. 
In the coastal market, on the high end of guidance, we are expecting flat to slightly higher pricing on contract renewals and utilization in the high 80% range. On the low end, our guidance range contemplates a deterioration in coastal rates, with pricing declines on contract renewals in the low single-digit percentage range and utilization in the mid-80% range. For our Diesel Engine Services segment, in our land-based sector, although oil prices have improved somewhat, it has not yet translated to an improved outlook. The improvement may come in the second half, but with lower spending levels seen in the first quarter, we felt it prudent to adjust this portion of our quarterly and full year guidance. We will continue to evaluate market conditions and adjust the cost structure as necessary to meet current and projected levels of demand. For the balance -- what must balance the lack of volume in today's market with the outlook for a market recovery, as oil prices continually increase. Where we fall within our guidance range of this year will partly hinge on whether we see an improvement in activity in the second half of the year. In our marine, diesel and power generation markets, we expect the weakness in the Gulf of Mexico oil service market to persist for the entire year. There is some possibility that major maintenance projects deferred by customers in the first quarter could drive better performance later this year. But our base case assumption is that those deferrals will not lead to firm orders until 2017. So in summary, our balance sheet and cash flow are in great shape, giving us the flexibility to do acquisitions and share repurchases. The Marine business is stable, with the inland markets poised for improvement and with a bright outlook for petrochemical volumes. Diesel Engine Services is weak, but with growing pent-up demand. In the diesel engine businesses, it is not a question of if the markets will come back, but a question of when. Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready to take questions."

I think they're very opportunistic in terms of deploying cash to beating down sectors. So that maybe something they're doing. But you should probably ask them that. From our view, in terms of pricing, given through, what we've been going through in the inland market, pricing gets more reasonable. Price expectations becomes more reasonable, and that's a good thing. We -- as you know, John, it's really tough to predict acquisitions. We're always talking to people. There are some people that may have a little more stress in terms of leverage than others, but predicting that and -- predicting an acquisition out of that environment's difficult. I think our view is, as you know, just maintain our discipline. People know we'll pay a fair price, and we're going to keep our discipline and keep talking to the players, and if something happens, that's great. But we're not going to chase things. I do think that given what we've gone through in the inland market, things are more reasonable in terms of price expectations."

It's just really difficult to predict. And so we want to be cautious in extrapolating it. What we do know that the chemical, petrochemical build out is continuing. Some -- there's a good number of these petrochemical plants that are well underway in terms of construction. Maybe some of the volatility has slowed some of them down, or maybe even 1 or 2 canceled, but we do see the petrochemical build-out coming in '17 and '18, which should add to demand.

Go inland, what happens is, in the inland side, in particular, when you're getting to the inspection cycle and the mandated inspections that have to happen, you bring a barge into the shipyard and you kind of get an estimate of what it takes to extend its life another 5 years, and you kind of do the math with the current prices and you say, well, does that make sense? Can I get that capital back? And so, given what we've gone through here recently, those older barges get harder and harder to justify and that triggers, kind of the retirement. We've seen this in past cycles where the retirements get pretty heavy. We kind of expect them to be on the heavier side than they have been for the last couple of years, for sure. On the coastwise business, it's -- some of these assets are over 30 years old. I think the count -- last count was 45. We're over 30 years old, and in the coastwise environment, that's getting pretty old. And we, Kirby, have retired some of our older assets recently in that space and I think our competitors are going through the same thought processes that we are in terms of extending very old coastwise barges. As you know, those are much more expensive than inland barges. So extending their lives is that much more capital. I don't know if that helps with an answer there, Chris."

Yes, I think just talking and listening to our customers, inventories are where they need to be, given what they're seeing. I think in the ethylene markets, what we're hearing is all positive, that's kind of sorted itself out. I think, clearly, the crude price kind of stabilizing a little bit, now it's still volatile, but it's kind of in a more reasonable range lately, has taken some uncertainty out of the system. So yes, that feel we had, that maybe something was going on in the economy that we were missing, and that unease that we had is, it never completely goes away, as you know, but it is certainly improved, and we feel better about it. And certainly, listening to our customers, it's been more positive in the near term."

Yesterday afternoon, we announced first quarter earnings of $0.71 per share, including severance charges of approximately $0.06 per share versus our guidance range of $0.75 to $0.85 per share. That compares wit",524,"Okay. Thank you, Sterling, and good morning. Yesterday afternoon, we announced first quarter earnings of $0.71 per share, including severance charges of approximately $0.06 per share versus our guidance range of $0.75 to $0.85 per share. That compares with $1.09 per share reported first quarter last year. Inland marine tank barge utilization during the first quarter remained in the 90% to 95% range. The supply overhang from barges cleaned out of crude oil service and put into other trades over the past 12 to 18 months continue to have some impact on pricing. However, we think the trend of barge cleaning out of crude oil service into clean service has slowed significantly and we believe that industry utilization levels have modestly improved. Additionally, we have not seen an increase in inland tank barge -- in the inland tank barge order book for 2016, which is now at low levels. Should the trend -- trends that we've seen in April continue for another couple of months, our outlook for this business will continue to improve. 
In the coastal sector of our business, utilization remained stable, with coastal tank barge utilization in the high 80s to low 90% range. Market is in relative balance, even with the additional spot exposure. Average pricing on contract renewals of the coastal equipment increased during the quarter. A part of this increase was the result of price adjustments in legacy contracts, which were below market rates. Also influencing our results in this business is the amount of equipment trading in the spot market, which has idle time exposure. In our land-based Diesel Engine Services business, market conditions deteriorated further than we envisioned when we provided guidance in January. There have not been many positive signals in the oil service market. There's been an accelerating decline in U.S. oil production, which has led to cannibalization -- or at least some cannibalization to existing U.S. pressure pumping capacity, which should create future demand. However, without more tangible improvement, the prudent thing to do is to aggressively reduce cost in this business. 
Market has simply been far worse for longer than I think anyone in the market anticipated, as evidenced by recent earnings and CapEx revision -- revisions by several large oil service companies. In the marine power generation business, our marine diesel engine business, the oil -- oil service market, which services the Gulf of Mexico remain depressed and we experienced customer deferrals of major maintenance projects throughout all of our marine engine service locations during the quarter. This is not unusual when you get in this kind of environment. This broad impact on our marine market speaks to the uncertainty of not only the oil service business, but also the dry cargo market that the inland side of the business services. And in some respects, the general economy. In summary, we find ourselves in the midst of a very challenging environment in both our marine and diesel engine businesses. At the same time, we have seen some encouraging trends in our Marine markets, particularly the inland market where pricing seems to have stabilized. I'll now turn the call over to David."
283986,330362870,968392,"Kirby Corporation, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 28, 2016",2016-04-28,"Earnings Calls","Kirby Corporation","Executives","Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with a quick comment on our recent cost savings actions and then move to first quarter results across our businesses. Our cost-cutting efforts included a reduction in force that was implemented in F",876,"Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with a quick comment on our recent cost savings actions and then move to first quarter results across our businesses. Our cost-cutting efforts included a reduction in force that was implemented in February. We reduced headcount and corporate staff, marine shore-side staff and diesel engine personnel. These reductions led to severance costs of approximately $0.06 a share. While the staffing reduction was the most visible cost-cutting action during the quarter, we have several teams dedicated to the streamlining of our cost structure across the company and in improving customer service. It is our belief that as conditions across our markets improve, we will be positioned to improve market share in each of our businesses while simultaneously improving profitability. 
Turning now to a summary of first quarter results. In the marine transportation segment, our inland marine barge demand saw some modest sequential improvement as utilization stayed in the 90% to 95% range throughout the quarter. During the quarter, high wind and fog impacted operations along the Gulf Coast and high water on the Mississippi River system led to the delays and added horsepower requirements. The direct cost associated with these challenges were partially mitigated by contract clauses that protect us from navigation delays, particularly as it relates to high water. On a clearly positive note, we think the number of barges transitioning from crude oil into other services slowed dramatically. We believe the industry fleet-wide number of barges in crude services, currently just under 175, virtually unchanged from earlier in the year. The industry has absorbed a large number of barges from both new construction and from displaced crude movements during the past year to 18 months, and is very close to tightly balanced. 
Nevertheless, pricing on our inland Marine transportation term contracts that renewed during the first quarter were down in the single-digit range. Average contract pricing was skewed lower by repricing of some longer-term contracts. Excluding these contracts, a more representative indication of pricing on inland contract renewals was down in the low-single-digit percent range on a year-over-year basis. 
Spot contract rates were roughly in line with contract rates during the quarter and were flat sequentially with the 2015 fourth quarter. However, in April, we did see some firming in the spot market from market lows. In the inland marine market, we continued to see growth, modest growth and demand for petrochemicals and refined products transportation, with crude oil demand relatively flat with the 2015 fourth quarter. The black oil market, meaning heated products, excluding crude oil, was weak throughout the quarter, largely due to commodity price volatility, but utilization in our Blackwell fleet recovered toward the end of the quarter and into April. 
In our coastal marine transportation segment, demand for the coast was transportation of refined products, black oil and petrochemicals remain consistent with the 2015 fourth quarter and tank barge utilization continued to be relatively strong. With respect to pricing term contracts that renewed during the first quarter increased by a double-digit percentage on average. However, this pricing was skewed by the renewal of a couple of small legacy contracts with rates that were significantly below market levels. 
Excluding those contract renewals, renewals on coastal equipment contracts were essentially flat. 
In our Diesel Engine Services segment, as Joe mentioned, our marine diesel and power generation markets experienced widespread deferrals of major maintenance projects across all of our marine diesel engine operating regions. While there is some possibility that these deferrals could lead to higher business levels later this year, our assumption is that, that will not happen, particularly if the inland dry cargo barge and Gulf of Mexico oil service markets do not improve. 
In our land-based Diesel Engine Services market, our ability to maintain break-even profit levels with our current staffing was dependent on maintaining a steady level of parts and component sales and a modest amount of remanufacturing activity, a view which we garnered from close coordination with our major customers. However, as the first quarter progressed, orders for parts and components declined precipitously. Projected spending levels from our major customers for the full year 2016 for parts and component sales were revised down by over 50%. 
On the service side of the business, the year began with some incrementally positive indicators, as customers requested to remanufacture portions of their fleets with the opportunity to remanufacture the larger portions of their fleet as the year progressed. However, financial stress and uncertainty around consolidation opportunities among our customer base has resulted in almost all remanufacturing being placed on hold for the near term. As we work through these challenges, and await an inevitable improvement in the market, we want to strike a balance between maintaining the capability to respond to demand when the market turns and a cost structure that is appropriate for the current market. The volatility of the market and opaqueness of the outlook make this difficult. So we thought it prudent to assume these tough conditions persist through the remainder of this year and consequently, we reflected that in our forecast. I will now turn the call over to Andy to provide some detailed financial information before I finish up with a more detailed discussion of the outlook."

In the 2016 first quarter, marine transportation segment revenue declined 10%, and operating income declined 28% as compared with the 2015 first quarter. This decline in revenue was primarily due to a 38% decline in the average cost of marine diesel fuel, lower inland marine contract pricing and an increase in available spot market days for some of our offshore marine equipment. The marine transportation segment's operating margin was 18.4% compared with 22.9% for the 2015 first quarter. The inland sector contributed approximately 2/3 of marine transportation revenue during the 2016 first quarter. 
Long-term inland marine transportation contracts, those contracts with a year -- with a term of 1 year or longer in duration, contributed approximately 80% of revenue, with 55% attributable to time charters and 45% from affreightment contracts. As David mentioned, our utilization was consistently above 90% throughout the quarter and the inland sector generated an operating margin in the low 20% range for the quarter. 
In the coastal sector, utilization during the quarter was in the high 80% to low 90% range. The trend of our customers electing to source coastal equipment through the spot market versus renewing existing term contracts continued in the first quarter, as we saw the percentage of coastal revenue under term contracts drop slightly from the 2015 fourth quarter to 78%. The first quarter operating margin for the coastal sector was in the low- to mid-teens. 
As mentioned in the press release last night, we incurred an approximate $5.6 million or $0.06 per share in severance expenses during the quarter. Of this amount, approximately $0.03 per share was in our inland marine business, approximately $0.01 per share is in our coastal marine business and approximately $0.01 in our marine and power generation diesel businesses, with the remainder split between the land-based Diesel Engine business and the Kirby Corporate Office. 
Turning now to our marine construction and retirement plans. During the 2016 first quarter, we took delivery of 3 new tank barges, and we retired a total of 16 barges. The net result was a reduction of 13 tank barges to our inland tank barge fleet, or approximately 278,000 barrels of capacity. Also during the quarter, we committed to build an additional 4 30,000 barrels tank barges for delivery in 2016, to meet our existing fleet needs and attractive pricing. For the remaining 9 months of the year, we expect to take delivery of these 4 inland tank barges and to retire or return an additional 18 barges with 235,000 barrels of capacity. 
On a net basis, before giving effect to the additions from the Seacor fleet, we expect to end 2016 with approximately 17.5 million barrels of capacity, a reduction of approximately 400,000 barrels from the end of 2015. In mid-April, we closed on the acquisition of Seacor's fleet of 27 30,000-barrel inland tank barges. Additionally, 1 30,000-barrel tank barge and 1 inland tow boat are under construction and are expected to be delivered before the end of the quarter. Including these additions to our inland fleet, we expected to end 2016 with a total of 18.4 million barrels of capacity. 
In the coastwise transportation sector, we expect delivery of our second new 185,000-barrel ATB in mid-2016. The first of 2 new 155,000-barrel ATBs should also deliver in late 2016. Our second 155,000-barrel ATB and the coastal chemical barge are expected to be completed in 2017. Our 2016 coastal equipment capacity plan includes a single retirement of an 80,000-barrel tank barge in the second quarter. On a net basis, we expect to end the year with 6.3 million barrels of capacity, an additional 260,000 barrels from the end of the 2016 first quarter. 
Moving on to our Diesel Engine Services segment. Revenue for the 2016 first quarter declined 52% from the 2015 first quarter and we had an $806,000 operating loss for the segment. The segment's operating margin was a negative 1% compared with 5.3% for the 2015 first quarter. The Marine and power generation operations contributed approximately 60% of the Diesel Engine Services revenue in the first quarter, with an operating margin in the low double digits. Our land-based operations contributed roughly 40% of the Diesel Engine Services segment revenue in the first quarter, with a negative operating margin in the high-teens. 
On the corporate side of things, we raised our 2016 capital spending guidance range by $10 million to a range of $230 million to $250 million to account for the additional 4 inland tank barges that we expect to build this year. Our capital spending guidance for the year includes approximately $10 million for the construction of 7 inland tank barges to be delivered in 2016, approximately $100 million in progress payments on new coastal equipment, including: 1 185,000-barrel coastal ATB; 2 150,000-barrel coastal ATBs; 2 4,900-horsepower coastal tugboats and a new coastal petrochemical tank barge. The balance of $120 million to $140 million is primarily for capital upgrades and improvements to existing inland and coastal marine equipment and facilities, as well as diesel engine services facilities. In addition to capital spending guidance for the year, we used $88 million in cash in April of this year for the purchase of Seacor's 30,000-barrel inland tank barge fleet. 
During the 2016 first quarter, we continued to execute on our share repurchase authorization, buying approximately 35,000 shares for $1.8 million or $52.53 per share. Stock price, in our estimation, continues to offer compelling long-term value. We will continue to evaluate share repurchases in concert with other capital allocation opportunities. Currently, our unused repurchase authorization is approximately 1.4 million shares. Total debt as of March 31, 2016 was $712 million, a $63 million decrease from December 31, 2015. Our debt-to-cap ratio at March 31 was 23.5% compared with the 25.4% at the end of last year. As of today, our debt stands at $783 million. I will now turn the call back over to David."

In our press release, we announced our 2016 second quarter guidance of $0.65 to $0.75 per share and for the 2016 full year guidance of $2.80 to $3.20 per share. Our guidance for the year reflects our 2016 first quarter GAAP earnings per share of $0.71, which includes $0.06 per share of severance charges. As we mentioned earlier, the significant change in our outlook is related to the land-based diesel engine business, which we now expect to incur quarterly operating losses for the remainder of the year. With that overview of our -- of the changes to our guidance, let me also briefly address the primary factors in the guidance range for each of our markets. 
In our inland marine transportation market, as mentioned in our press release last night, the inland market showed some tangible signs of improvement in April, with utilization improving, particularly for 30,000-barrel tank barges, and competitor spot pricing in the spot market improving from previous month. Refined products and chemical volumes have been strong, with the black oil market seeing some renewed strength in April following a tough first quarter. While we're encouraged by these developments, we are cautious in extrapolating the impact for the rest of the year. At the low end of our guidance, our guidance factors in spot and contract renewal pricing, includes declines of low single-digits and tank barge utilization in the high 80s to low 90% range. At the high-end, we are assuming year-over-year pricing stability going forward and utilization in the 90% to 95% range. We are assuming normal seasonal weather patterns for the remainder of the year. 
In the coastal market, on the high end of guidance, we are expecting flat to slightly higher pricing on contract renewals and utilization in the high 80% range. On the low end, our guidance range contemplates a deterioration in coastal rates, with pricing declines on contract renewals in the low single-digit percentage range and utilization in the mid-80% range. For our Diesel Engine Services segment, in our land-based sector, although oil prices have improved somewhat, it has not yet translated to an improved outlook. The improvement may come in the second half, but with lower spending levels seen in the first quarter, we felt it prudent to adjust this portion of our quarterly and full year guidance. We will continue to evaluate market conditions and adjust the cost structure as necessary to meet current and projected levels of demand. For the balance -- what must balance the lack of volume in today's market with the outlook for a market recovery, as oil prices continually increase. Where we fall within our guidance range of this year will partly hinge on whether we see an improvement in activity in the second half of the year. In our marine, diesel and power generation markets, we expect the weakness in the Gulf of Mexico oil service market to persist for the entire year. There is some possibility that major maintenance projects deferred by customers in the first quarter could drive better performance later this year. But our base case assumption is that those deferrals will not lead to firm orders until 2017. So in summary, our balance sheet and cash flow are in great shape, giving us the flexibility to do acquisitions and share repurchases. The Marine business is stable, with the inland markets poised for improvement and with a bright outlook for petrochemical volumes. Diesel Engine Services is weak, but with growing pent-up demand. In the diesel engine businesses, it is not a question of if the markets will come back, but a question of when. Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready to take questions."

We do believe that some others are going to retire older equipment as well. Also, in that number of new barge builds that we expect this year, the vast -- well, not the vast majority, but over half are probably 10,000 barrel.

Or is this kind of foreshadowing now that asset values are pulling back to the level where they're kind of in your sweet spot, and you can be a little bit more aggressive on the rolling up of the business?"

I think they're very opportunistic in terms of deploying cash to beating down sectors. So that maybe something they're doing. But you should probably ask them that. From our view, in terms of pricing, given through, what we've been going through in the inland market, pricing gets more reasonable. Price expectations becomes more reasonable, and that's a good thing. We -- as you know, John, it's really tough to predict acquisitions. We're always talking to people. There are some people that may have a little more stress in terms of leverage than others, but predicting that and -- predicting an acquisition out of that environment's difficult. I think our view is, as you know, just maintain our discipline. People know we'll pay a fair price, and we're going to keep our discipline and keep talking to the players, and if something happens, that's great. But we're not going to chase things. I do think that given what we've gone through in the inland market, things are more reasonable in terms of price expectations."

It's just really difficult to predict. And so we want to be cautious in extrapolating it. What we do know that the chemical, petrochemical build out is continuing. Some -- there's a good number of these petrochemical plants that are well underway in terms of construction. Maybe some of the volatility has slowed some of them down, or maybe even 1 or 2 canceled, but we do see the petrochemical build-out coming in '17 and '18, which should add to demand.

Go inland, what happens is, in the inland side, in particular, when you're getting to the inspection cycle and the mandated inspections that have to happen, you bring a barge into the shipyard and you kind of get an estimate of what it takes to extend its life another 5 years, and you kind of do the math with the current prices and you say: Well, does that make sense? Can I get that capital back? And so, given what we've gone through here recently, those older barges get harder and harder to justify and that triggers, kind of the retirement. We've seen this in past cycles where the retirements get pretty heavy. We kind of expect them to be on the heavier side than they have been for the last couple of years, for sure. On the coastwise business, it's -- some of these assets are over 30 years old. I think the count -- last count was 45. We're over 30 years old, and in the coastwise environment, that's getting pretty old. And we, Kirby, have retired some of our older assets recently in that space and I think our competitors are going through the same thought processes that we are in terms of extending very old coastwise barges. As you know, those are much more expensive than inland barges. So extending their lives is that much more capital. I don't know if that helps with an answer there, Chris."

Yesterday afternoon we announced a second quarter earnings of $0.72 per share versus our guidance range of $0.65 to $0.75 per share. That compares to a $1.04 per share reported for the 2015 second quarter. Inland Marine tank barge utilization during the second quarter was in the high 80% to low 90% range. Market continues to adjust in response to excess barge supply. That is influenced market over the past 12 to 18 months. Over a combination of retirements and volume will help bring the market back into balance, the transition has not been as smooth as we hoped it would be. 
As I'd mentioned -- as mentioned in our press release last night, in line utilization in July fell significantly and we have seen aggressive pricing from several carriers at levels -- at what we believe is at their full cost or in some cases, the cash cost. Such pricing in the market is historically unusual given the market fundamentals have not fundamentally changed that much since the start of the year and summer almost always sees a decline in utilization. Pricing at these levels, we believe is unsustainable, and if it persists, will lead to disruptive pressure on some last capitalize carriers. In the coastal market, tank barge utilization was in the mid 80% range. Utilization continues to be impacted by demand of equipment trading on the spot market, which adds vital time exposure. 
We continue to maintain a cautious outlook for this market as it absorbs the supply that is coming online through the first half of 2018. Remember that there is lot of over ship in the coastal market. In the land-based diesel engine service business, market conditions remain the best. Sales from the distribution of OEM engines, transmission and parts, which had been relatively stable in prior industry cycles are historically low levels. Additionally, orders for new pressure pumping units have not yet materialized. The remanufacturing and service side of the business is more positive and we have seen an increase in inquiries during the quarter as well as a number of firm orders. While limited activity does not lend itself to a materially better earnings outlook yet, hope it does represent the first in the market and the conditions will improve in the coming months. 
In the Marine and power generation Diesel Engine Services businesses, the oil field market along the Gulf Coast remains depressed while in the rest of the market service activities -- service activity is relatively stable. 
In summary, we continue to face an excess supply of equipment in Marine markets and a severe depression in the oilfield market. As we confront these challenges, we will continue to focus on safety, customer service, cost and capital discipline. In the inland market, we expect the market will be better later this year, and benefit from additional retirements of maintenance deferrals, consolidation as well as volumes from new chemical plants. For Kirby's parts, we will aggressively pursue our costs, aggressively service our customers and look for opportunities to prudently apply our balance sheet. I'll now turn the call over to David"

Then I'll turn the call over to Andy to walk through the financials in more detail. After he finishes, I'll conclude with an explanation of our outlook and our guidance. In the inland Marine Transportation market, after a strong start to the second quarter in April, we experienced a modest decline in tank barge utilization into the high 80% range. The modest decline in utilization was largely attributable to our shorter in the spring season for products and soft demand in trading and refinery volumes, which we believe was largely related to high inventory levels. Pricing on churn contracts that were made during the second quarter was down in the mid-to high single digits on average. Spot rates were at or below term contract rates during the quarter. Operating conditions during the quarter were seasonally normal, although high cost currents floodgates and river crossings on the Gulf intercoastal waterway led to congestion and added delay at certain points along the Gulf Coast. In our Coastal Marine Transportation sector, demand for the transportation at Black oil and petrochemicals remain consistent with 2016 first quarter. While refined products demand was weaker, due primarily to lower demand in the Northeast. Relative to the first quarter, tank barge utilization declined slightly to the mid 80% range, a result of the continued trend of more equipment moving off of term contracts and trading in the spot market. As a reminder, most coastal barge term contracts are time charters, which had a 100% utilization and when equipment lose from time charter spot, even when it is highly utilized, the average utilization drops. 
With respect to pricing, term contracts that renewed during the second quarter increased to by a low single-digit percentage on average as several older contracts renewed in the quarter. However, term contracts that a year ago, and renewed during the quarter were at modestly lower rates. In our Diesel Engine Services segment, in our Marine, and Power Generation market, we continue to see deferrals of major overhaul projects. As has been the case, the Gulf of Mexico oilfield service market remained at depressed levels. In our land-based Diesel Engine Services market, the sale of engines, transmissions and parts in our distribution business remained at very depressed levels and have yet to show signs of improvement. Likewise, we have not had orders to manufacture a new pressure pumping units. On a more positive note, we did see incremental improvement in closing order activity for pressure pumping unit service in remanufacturing. The number of units serviced during the quarter was small, but we did have an uptick in labor and facility utilization, particularly late in the quarter and it continues into the early part of this quarter, the third quarter. It remains too early to call this activity a trend, but it does seem that we have at least seen the market in this cycle. I will now turn the call over to Andy to provide some detailed financial information, before I come back and discuss our outlook."

In the 2016 second quarter, Marine Transportation segment revenue declined 11% and operating income declined 25% as compared with the 2015 second quarter. A decline in revenue in the second quarter as compared to the prior",837,"Thanks, David, and good morning. In the 2016 second quarter, Marine Transportation segment revenue declined 11% and operating income declined 25% as compared with the 2015 second quarter. A decline in revenue in the second quarter as compared to the prior year quarter was primarily due to a 33% decline in the average cost of Marine diesel fuel, lower in Marine contract pricing and an increase in available spot market days for our offshore Marine equipment. The Marine Transportation segments operating margin was 19.2%, compared with 22.8% for the 2015 second quarter. The inland sector contributed approximately 2/3 of Marine Transportation revenue during the 2016 second quarter. Long-term inland Marine Transportation contracts does contracts with the term of one year or longer in duration, contributed approximately 80% of revenue with 51% of those contracts attributable to time charters and 49% from contracts. The inland sector generated in operating margin of low 20% rate for the quarter. In the coastal sector, the trend of customers electing to sort coastal equipment from the spot market over renewing existing contracts continued. However,, the percentage of cost of revenue under term contracts was consistent with the first quarter at approximately 78% probably as a result of lower utilization in revenue for sport equipment. The second quarter operating margin for the coastal sector was in the low double digits. 
Turning now to our Marine construction and retirement plans. During the 2016 first-half, we received 27 barges from the acquisition of Secor inland tank barge fleet, term delivery of 3 barges, transferred 130,000 barrels barge from coastal to inland service and retired a total of 28 barges. The net result was an increase of 3 tank barges to our inland tank barges fleet, which totaled approximately 345,000 barrels of capacity. For the second half of the year, we expect tank delivery of 430,000 barrels inland tank barges and to retire our charters an additional 11 barges with 135,000 barrels of capacity. 
On a net basis, we expect to end 2016 with approximately 18.2 million-barrel of capacity or roughly the same level we finished the second quarter, an increase of approximately 325,000 barrels from the end of 2015. In the coast wise transportation sector, our second new 185,000-barrel ATB began operating under a long-term customer contract in the June. The first of 2 new 155,000-barrel ATB should deliver in late 2016 and our second 155,000-barrel ATB on a coastal chemical barge are both expected to be completed in early 2017. 
Also during the second quarter this year, we retired a 80,000-barrel barge, and transport a 30,000-barrel coastal barge to our inland fleet ending the quarter with approximately 6.1 million barrels of capacity. In our press release last night, we also announced that we purchased 4 coastal tugboats during the second quarter for $26.5 million. The tugs will transition into service with existing barges in our fleet. The addition of this tugs will lower the age of our tug fleet, better align the age of our boats and barges and improve our operating performance. The average age of the boats we purchase is 8 years and the average age of the boats that are replacing is close to 40 years. 
Moving on to our Diesel Engine Services segment, revenue for the 2016 second quarter declined 46% from the 2015 second quarter and we had an operating loss in the segment of approximately $2 million. The segments operating margin was negative 3.1% compared with 4.2% for the 2015 second quarter. The Marine and power generation operations contributed approximately's 65% of the Diesel Engine Services revenue in the second quarter with an operating margin in the low double digits. Our land-based operations contributed roughly 35% of the Diesel Engine Services segments revenue in the second quarter with a double-digit negative operating margin. On the corporate side of our 2016 capital spending guidance remains in a range of $230 million to $250 million, including approximately $10 million from construction of 7 inland tank barges to be delivered in 2016, approximately $100 million in progress payments on new coastal equipments including one,185,000-barrel coastal ATB, 2 155,000-barrel coastal ATB's, 2 4900-horsepower coastal tugboats and a new coastal petrochemical tank barge. The balance of $120 million to $140 million is primarily for capital upgrades and improvements to existing inland and coastal Marine equipment and facilities as well as Diesel Engine Services facilities. In addition to our capital spending guidance, we spent $81 million on the acquisition of the Secor inland tank barge fleet with an additional $4 million paid in July for a tugboat, which was under construction. We also spent $13.5 million to acquire our least coastal bars from a lessor and $26.5 million to purchase 4 coastal tugboats. Total debt as of June 30th, 2016 was $799 million, a $24-million increase from December 31, 2015. Our debt to capital ratio at June 30, 2016 was 25.4%, unchanged from December 31, 2015. As of today, our debt stands at $786 million. I'll now turn the call back over to David"

And we lowered our full year 2016 guidance to a range of $2.40 to $2.70 per share. Let me take a moment and provide a general overview of our approach to guidance this quarter. In the second quarter, we saw a strong utilization informing pricing in the inland market in April with the rest of the quarter lying out on our expectations as you saw with our second quarter result, which fell within our guidance range. However, in July, we've seen our inland utilization fall into the low 80% range. Given the lower inland Marine utilization, we are seeing a very competitive pricing environment. We are lowering guidance to reflect these conditions. And on the low end of our range, we are factoring in a continuation of this environment through the remainder of the year. 
In terms of inland marine utilization, tank barge utilization does typically falls slightly in the summer when good operating conditions reduce congestion and improve efficiency throughout the waterways. However, so far this quarter, utilization has remained in the low 80% range, lower than we would expect. We do think that weaker utilization levels are partly related factors that are temporary in nature including high refinery and turmoil inventory levels and reduced trading activity in the black oil markets. As it remains unclear how long these utilization levels will persist, we have lowered our guidance. In terms of pricing, we expect spot and contract renewal pricing to continue to be under pressure during the quarter. As Joe mentioned, we believe spot pricing and inland market has reached unsustainable levels and that sport rates now reflect pricing that is below cash be breakeven's for some carriers. If this pricing versus, we believe potential sellers will materialize either through choice or distress. We will deploy our capital appropriately should that occur. In the coastal market, on the low-end, our guidance range contemplates pricing declines on contract renewals in the low single-digit percent range and utilization in the low to mid 80% range. On the high-end of guidance, we're expecting flat pricing on contract renewals and utilization in the high 80% range. For our Diesel Engine Services and our land-based sector, we expect to incur quarterly operating losses of a similar magnitude as in the first half of the year. However, our results may improve at service activities, which picked up in late June continue to improve. In our diesel markets, we do -- diesel -- marine diesel markets, we do not expect an improvement in the Gulf of Mexico oil service market this year. In the power generation market and then our other marine diesel engine services market, we expect results to be lastly consistent with the 2016 second quarter. 
In closing, our financial position is strong. We have a strong balance sheet, a young, well-maintained fleet and healthy free cash flow. As both our Marine Transportation and Diesel Engine Services markets undergo difficult times, we will focus on safe operation, customer service and cost containment by looking to deploy cash flow where we can find high return projects in a discipline and accretive manner. As we look beyond this year, we are much more constructive on the outlook across our markets. In the past few days, many large oilfield operators have stated their belief that the worst of the energy market collapse is behind us. We believe that is the case as well. For the second half of next year, if not earlier, we expect to see volumes increase in our land-based diesel engine business. Similarly, in our Marine Transportation markets, the worst of the correction, which arose from overbuilding into the crude markets is likely behind us. While the aggressive pricing in the market this quarter is troubling, it likely yields opportunities that would not otherwise be there or at a minimum should force capacity discipline on some operators who have not shown much discipline lately. 
A rationalization of supply this year provides a better environment for growth next year, particularly in the chemical markets where we expect growth to accelerate through next year. 
Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks. And we are now ready to take questions."

Clearly, we are in an oversupplied market right now. will go to must equipment. And in this kind of market, with this kind of prices, as maintenance decisions come up, certainly nobody would want to built into this market right now. No rational player would want to add capacity in this environment, and I think, as you look at maintenance decisions that come up on say a 25-year-old or 30-year-old barge, you probably tie it up at best and maybe you just retire it and cut it up and sell for scrap because at this market, those kind of decisions become easier and this is why we see in these kind of environments, the number of retirements go up and the building go down. As we look at the 2017 order book, we are not hearing much at all being led in terms of contract. So in terms of the inland fleet growth, I don't think there will be much if any, at all, and with retirements, it should contract. On the coastwise side, it's a little more balanced in that you got some new capacity coming in including some of ours over the next to 18 months. I think in total, it's -- the ones that haven't delivered, maybe it's 14 units. And there are still over 40 units that are 30 years or older in the coastwise business. And they need to come out. The netting requirements from our customers are getting tougher and then the offshore environment, they are even tougher than the inland side, and age is a factor there. So I think you'll see more retirement on the coastwise side. The question is the balance between the new additions in the retirements and how that plays out. But I don't think you'll see overall capacity growth, volume growth on the coastwise side in the barges, there are 200,000 and less."

In terms of crude barges, I think last quarter we said we estimated there about 175 or so barges still moving crude. And that was down from 550. Our latest poll indicates it's probably around a 140 barges. So sure, that did have some impact, it went from 175 down to 140. It's interesting, you'll see, you read some of the snippets that deeper in the Utica, come and start drilling again. So who knows if we've hit on the could barges, but clearly the barges that have come out of crude have been cleaned up and put into clean service by and large, which has impacted utilization for sure. Now, to your broader question about demand, if you look across all of our product -- products that we carry, outside of crude, everything is pretty good. Crude's down for sure. But if you look at the chemicals, they are okay. And we do see continued building. I think one of our customers just announced a new joint venture that they're going to build a new facility on the Gulf Coast. There has been 1 or 2 delays, but by and large, most of the chemical facilities that have been announced and they have started construction are still going on. So that's a positive. 
Refined products outside of this product that were in are now that's impacting kind of some movements. If you look at vehicle miles driven, they are up in refine products demand, it's still going, I think the production has outpaced it recently. And that's caused this kind of disruption or product if you will. And then you look at some of the other products. Outside of crude, everything is okay and fairly healthy.

Cycles in the past have been -- been principally driven by recessions and where volumes have declined and you really needed to have a kind of a cleansing of the industry. You needed one of the economy to recover volumes to improve and some equipment to come out. This particular downturn is not economically driven. It's -- it really is affected by a couple of things. It's affected by building barges for a market, the crude oil market that then collapsed as crude oil collapsed. And it's affected by what I think is a -- an anomaly, which is high inventories and the market adjusting to those inventory. We saw something similar to that in 2008, in the beginning of 2009, where you did have an economic collapse, but you also had an anonymous adjustment in inventories. And that was relatively short. There are some other things that are going on, I think, during this particular period. You have the summer weather affect that David talked about. And that's something that we really haven't seen in last 3 or 4 years because the market's been so tight, hasn't been an of equipment. But if you go back to the last 30 years before that, you always had utilization drill down the summer as the system got more efficient and there was more equipment on the market to come fall, tighten up again. So I think what's happened here is that you have some operators that are already worried about crude oil equipment that builds -- that don't have -- doesn't have home for it. As any of had this summer doldrums that have been traditionally seen in the business. they panicked and they lowered prices just to both equipment, which has drugged the whole market down. As you get some adjustments of inventory, as you go into the fall where system isn't as efficient, it gets a little less efficient, you'll see utilization get better and I think pricing will follow it. How long it takes to absorb the crude oil overhand, will really be a driven by 2 things. One, equipment going out of the market and some of that is happening now. You're already getting maintenance referrals. So you're going to see less available equipment going forward in the year. And then the volumes that David talked about. You got strong refined products, markets, record miles driven in the U.S. and I think people are predicting that that's going to continue given that the low gasoline prices. And then you have this volumes that are coming from the chemical business. So it's going to correct itself.

Barging is -- has been the really the principal way of moving chemicals around, because of the flexibility and because of the volumes it typically see. Railroads are competitive depending on where you are moving the chemicals and how much your moving. You remember that -- the smallest barge that we operate is equal to, I think, 16 road parts. So if you got more -- you got less in the barge load than rail makes a lot of sense. If you are taking it to a place that barging doesn't rail makes a lot of sense. But typically, most moments, rail is a not a competitive factor. So I would think that we're going to add more than our share."

And I think we're starting to see that play out where we getting a lot of inquiries about the pairing equipment and remanufacturing equipment. Now, there is some interesting things going on. We heard some of the oil service commentary that you don't need 1800 rigs to absorb the pressure pumping fleet. I think it's closer to 900. So that service intensity plus the attrition in fleet, so I think on the pressure pumping side, you're going to see that market tighten up pretty quickly. And they need it. I mean our pressure pumping customers have been cash constrained. So I don't think there is a long way of saying we are not seeing new equipment orders.

Yesterday afternoon, we announced second quarter earnings of $0.72 per share versus our guidance range of $0.65 to $0.75 per share. That compares to a $1.04 per share reported for the 2015 second quarter. Inland marine tank barge utilization during the second quarter was in the high 80% to low 90% range. Market continues to adjust in response to excess barge supply. That has influenced market over the past 12 to 18 months. Although a combination of retirements and volume will help bring the market back into balance, the transition has not been as smooth as we hoped it would be. 
As I've -- as mentioned in our press release last night, inland utilization in July fell significantly, and we have seen aggressive pricing from several carriers at levels -- at what we believe is at their full cost or, in some cases, their cash costs. Such pricing in the market is historically unusual, given the market fundamentals have not fundamentally changed that much since the start of the year and summer almost always sees a decline in utilization. Pricing at these levels, we believe, is unsubstainable, and if it persists, will lead to destructive pressure on some less well-capitalized carriers. 
In the coastal market, tank barge utilization was in the mid-80% range. Utilization continues to be impacted by the amount of equipment trading on the spot market, which adds vital time exposure. We continue to maintain a cautious outlook for this market as it absorbs new supply that is coming online through the first half of 2018. Remember that there is a lot of older tonnage ship in the coastal market. 
In the land-based diesel engine service business, market conditions remained depressed. Sales from the distribution of OEM engines, transmissions and parts, which have been relatively stable in prior industry cycles, are historically low levels. Additionally, orders for new pressure pumping units have not yet materialized. 
The remanufacturing and service side of the business is more positive, and we have seen an increase in inquiries during the quarter as well as a number of firm orders. While such limited activity does not lend itself to a materially better earnings outlook yet, our hope it does represent the first green shoots in the market and the conditions will improve in the coming months. 
In the marine and power generation diesel engine service businesses, the oilfield market along the Gulf Coast remains depressed, while in the rest of our market, service activities -- service activity is relatively stable. 
In summary, we continue to face an excess supply of equipment in the marine markets and a severe cyclical depression in the oilfield market. As we confront these challenges, we will continue to focus on safety, customer service, cost and capital discipline. In the inland market, we expect the market will get better later this year and benefit from additional retirements of maintenance deferrals, consolidation as well as volumes from new chemical plants. For Kirby's part, we will aggressively pursue our costs, aggressively service our customers and look for opportunities to prudently apply our balance sheet. 
I'll now turn the call over to David."

Good morning to everyone on the call. I'll begin today with a summary of quarterly results in each of our markets, then I'll turn the call over to Andy to walk through the financials in more detail.

I'll begin today with a summary of quarterly results in each of our markets, then I'll turn the call over to Andy to walk through the financials in more detail. After he finishes, I'll conclude with an explanation of our outlook and our guidance. 
In the inland marine transportation market, after a strong start to the second quarter in April, we experienced a modest decline in tank barge utilization into the high 80% range. The modest decline in utilization was largely attributable to a shortened spring season for ag products and soft demand in trading and refinery volumes, which we believe was largely related to high inventory levels. 
Pricing on term contracts that renewed during the second quarter was down in the mid- to high single digits on average. Spot rates were at/or below term contract rates during the quarter. Operating conditions during the quarter were seasonally normal, although high cross currents at floodgates and river crossings on the Gulf Intercoastal Waterway led to congestion and added delays at certain points along the Gulf Coast. 
In our coastal marine transportation sector, demand for the coastwise transportation of black oil and petrochemicals remained consistent with the 2016 first quarter, while refined products demand was weaker, due primarily to lower demand in the Northeast. Relative to the first quarter, tank barge utilization declined slightly to the mid-80% range, a result of the continued trend of more equipment moving off of term contracts and trading in the spot market. As a reminder, most coastal barge term contracts are time charters, which have a 100% utilization. And when equipment lose from time-chartered spot, even when it is highly utilized, the average utilization drops. 
With respect to pricing, term contracts that renewed during the second quarter increased by a low single-digit percentage on average as several older contracts renewed in the quarter. However, term contracts that were signed a year ago and renewed during the quarter were at modestly lower rates. 
In our diesel engine services segment in our marine diesel and power generation markets, we continue to see deferrals of major overhaul projects. As has been the case, the Gulf of Mexico oilfield service market remained at depressed levels. 
In our land-based diesel engine services market, the sale of engines, transmissions and parts in our distribution business remained at very depressed levels and have yet to show signs of improvement. Likewise, we have not had orders to manufacture new pressure pumping units. 
On a more positive note, we did see incremental improvement in quote and order activity for pressure pumping unit service in remanufacturing. The number of units serviced during the quarter was small, but we did have an uptick in labor and facility utilization, particularly late in the quarter and it continues into the early part of this quarter, the third quarter. 
It remains too early to call this activity a trend, but it does seem that we have at least seen the worst of the market in this cycle. 
I'll now turn the call over to Andy to provide some detailed financial information before I come back and discuss our outlook."
283986,369623154,1018389,"Kirby Corporation, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 28, 2016",2016-07-28,"Earnings Calls","Kirby Corporation","Executives","Thanks, David, and good morning. In the 2016 second quarter, marine transportation segment revenue declined 11% and operating income declined 25% as compared with the 2015 second quarter.

In the 2016 second quarter, marine transportation segment revenue declined 11% and operating income declined 25% as compared with the 2015 second quarter. The decline in revenue in the second quarter as compared to the prior year quarter was primarily due to a 33% decline in the average cost of marine diesel fuel, lower inland marine contract pricing and an increase in available spot market days for our offshore marine equipment. The marine transportation segment's operating margin was 19.2% compared with 22.8% for the 2015 second quarter. 
The inland sector contributed approximately 2/3 of marine transportation revenue during the 2016 second quarter. Long-term inland marine transportation contracts, those contracts with the term of 1 year or longer in duration, contributed approximately 80% of revenue, with 51% of those contracts attributable to time charters and 49% affreightment contracts. 
The inland sector generated an operating margin in the low 20% range for the quarter. In the coastal sector, the trend of customers electing to source coastal equipment from the spot market over renewing existing contracts continued. However, the percentage of coastal revenue under term contracts was consistent with the first quarter at approximately 78%, probably as a result of lower utilization in revenue for spot equipment. The second quarter operating margin for the coastal sector was in the low double digits. 
Turning now to our marine construction and retirement plans. During the 2016 first half, we received 27 barges from the acquisition of Seacor's inland tank barge fleet, took delivery of 3 barges, transferred 1 30,000-barrel barge from coastal to inland service, and retired a total of 28 barges. The net result was an increase of 3 tank barges to our inland tank barge fleet, which totaled approximately 345,000 barrels of capacity. For the second half of the year, we expect to take delivery of 4 30,000-barrel inland tank barges and to retire or return to charters an additional 11 barges with 135,000 barrels of capacity. 
On a net basis, we expect to end 2016 with approximately 18.2 million barrels of capacity or roughly the same level we finished in second quarter, an increase of approximately 325,000 barrels from the end of 2015. 
In the coastwise transportation sector, our second new 185,000-barrel ATB began operating under a long-term customer contract in mid-June. The first of 2 new 155,000-barrel ATB should deliver in late 2016 and our second 155,000-barrel ATB on a coastal chemical barge are both expected to be completed in early 2017. 
Also, during the second quarter of this year, we retired an 80,000-barrel barge and transport a 30,000-barrel coastal barge to our inland fleet, ending the quarter with approximately 6.1 million barrels of capacity. 
In our press release last night, we also announced that we purchased 4 coastal tugboats during the second quarter for $26.5 million. The tugs will transition into service with existing barges in our fleet. The addition of these tugs will lower the age of our tug fleet, better align the age of our boats and barges, and improve our operating performance. The average age of the boats we purchased is 8 years and the average age of the boats they're replacing is close to 40 years. 
Moving on to our diesel engine services segment. Revenue for the 2016 second quarter declined 46% from the 2015 second quarter and we had an operating loss in the segment of approximately $2 million. The segment's operating margin was negative 3.1% compared with 4.2% for the 2015 second quarter. The marine and power generation operations contributed approximately 65% of the diesel engine services revenue in the second quarter, with an operating margin in the low double digits. Our land-based operations contributed roughly 35% of the diesel engine services segment's revenue in the second quarter, with a double-digit negative operating margin. 
On the corporate side of things. Our 2016 capital spending guidance remains in a range of $230 million to $250 million, including approximately $10 million from construction of 7 inland tank barges to be delivered in 2016; approximately $100 million in progress payments on new coastal equipment, including 1 185,000-barrel coastal ATB, 2 155,000-barrel coastal ATBs, 2 4,900-horsepower coastal tugboats and a new coastal petrochemical tank barge. The balance of $120 million to $140 million is primarily for capital upgrades and improvements to existing inland and coastal marine equipment and facilities as well as diesel engine services facilities. 
In addition to our capital spending guidance, we spent $81 million on the acquisition of the Seacor inland tank barge fleet, with an additional $45 million [ph] paid in July for a tugboat which was under construction. We also spent $13.5 million to acquire or lease coastal barge from a lessor and $26.5 million to purchase 4 coastal tugboats. 
Total debt as of June 30, 2016, was $799 million, a $24 million increase from December 31, 2015. Our debt to cap ratio at June 30, 2016, was 25.4%, unchanged from December 31, 2015. As of today, our debt stands at $786 million.

In our press release, we announced our 2016 third quarter guidance of $0.50 to $0.65 per share and we lowered our full year 2016 guidance to a range of $2.40 to $2.70 per share. Let me take a moment and provide a general overview of our appr",716,"Thanks, Andy. In our press release, we announced our 2016 third quarter guidance of $0.50 to $0.65 per share and we lowered our full year 2016 guidance to a range of $2.40 to $2.70 per share. Let me take a moment and provide a general overview of our approach to guidance this quarter. 
In the second quarter, we saw a strong utilization and firming pricing in the inland market in April, with the rest of the quarter playing out around our expectations, as you saw with our second quarter result, which fell within our guidance range. However, in July, we've seen our inland utilization fall into the low 80% range. Given the lower inland marine utilization, we are seeing a very competitive pricing environment. We are lowering guidance to reflect these conditions. And on the low end of the range, we are factoring in a continuation of this environment through the remainder of the year. 
In terms of inland marine utilization, tank barge utilization does typically fall slightly in the summer when good operating conditions reduce congestion and improve efficiency throughout the waterways. However, so far this quarter, utilization has remained in the low 80% range, lower than we would expect. We do think that weaker utilization levels are partly related to factors that are temporary in nature, including high refinery and thermal [ph] inventory levels and reduced trading activity in the black oil markets. 
As it remains unclear how long these utilization levels will persist, we have lowered our guidance. In terms of pricing, we expect spot and contract renewal pricing to continue to be under pressure during the quarter. As Joe mentioned, we believe spot pricing in the inland market has reached unsustainable levels and that spot rates now reflect pricing that is below cash breakevens for some carriers. If this pricing persists, we believe potential sellers will materialize either through choice or distress. We will deploy our capital appropriately should that occur. 
In the coastal market, on the low end, our guidance range contemplates pricing declines on contract renewals in the low single-digit percent range and utilization in the low to mid-80% range. On the high end of guidance, we are expecting flat pricing on contract renewals and utilization in the high 80% range. For our diesel engine service segment in our land-based sector, we expect to incur quarterly operating losses of a similar magnitude as in the first half of the year. However, our results may improve if service activities, which picked up in late June, continue to improve. 
In our diesel markets, we do -- diesel -- marine diesel markets, we do not expect any improvement in the Gulf of Mexico oil service market this year. In the power generation market and on our other marine diesel engine services market, we expect results to be largely consistent with the 2016 second quarter. 
In closing, our financial position is strong. We have a strong balance sheet, a young, well-maintained fleet and healthy free cash flow. As both our marine transportation and diesel engine services markets undergo difficult times, we will focus on safe operation, customer service and cost containment while looking to deploy cash flow where we can find high return projects in a disciplined and accretive manner. As we look beyond this year, we are much more constructive on the outlook across our markets. 
In the past few days, many large oilfield operators have stated their belief that the worst of the energy market collapse is behind us. We believe that is the case as well. By the second half of next year, if not earlier, we expect to see volumes increase in our land-based diesel engine business. 
Similarly, in our marine transportation markets, the worst of the correction which arose from overbuilding into the crude markets, is likely behind us. While the aggressive pricing in the market this quarter is troubling, it likely yields opportunities that would not otherwise be there or at a minimum should force capacity discipline on some operators who have not shown much discipline lately. 
A rationalization of supply this year provides a better environment for growth next year, particularly in the chemical markets where we expect growth to accelerate through next year. 
Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks. And we're now ready to take questions."

And that -- what I said was that was related to our low end of guidance.

We usually get some increased efficiencies, which drops utilization. But we've also -- in the black oil markets, if feedstock prices have moved around and we've seen -- sometimes the arbitrage closes and sometimes it opens back up, and so the black oil fleet utilization moves around a bit with that. So it's not just inventory levels, then also you've got the strong dollar what can affect imports and exports for that matter. And that can move things around there. So it's -- short answer, it's hard to quantify it and how much of it is related to inventories. But I would say, a good portion of it.

Clearly, we're in an oversupplied market right now. We've got too much equipment. And in this kind of market, with this kind of prices, as maintenance decisions come up, certainly, nobody would want to build into this market right now. No rational player would want to add capacity in this environment. And I think as you look at maintenance decisions that come up on, say, a 25-year-old or 30-year-old barge, you probably tie it up at best and maybe you just retire it and cut it up and sell it for scrap, because at this market, those kind of decisions become easier. And this is why we see, in these kind of environments, the number of retirements go up and the building go down. As we look at the 2017 order book, we're not hearing much at all being let in terms of contracts. So in terms of inland fleet growth, I don't think there will be much, if any, at all, and with retirements, it should contract. On the coastwise side, it's a little more balanced in that you've got some new capacity coming in, including some of ours, over the next to 18 months. I think, in total, it's -- the ones that haven't delivered, maybe it's 14 units. And -- but there are still over 40 units that are 30 years or older in the coastwise business. And they need to come out. And the betting requirements from our customers are getting tougher, and in the offshore environment, they are even tougher than they are in the  inland side. And age is a factor there. So I think you'll see more retirement on the coastwise side. The question is the balance between the new additions in the retirements and how that plays out. But I don't think you'll see overall capacity growth, volume growth on the coastwise side in the barges that are 200,000 and less."

Is there something that's coming on mind that you look out and you see it turn that can drive this?"

In '09, I think there was a quarter we dipped into the high '70s. But it was, I think, it is just one quarter. So it's not as bad as that, but low 80s is pretty difficult environment in terms of utilization. In terms of crude barges, I think last quarter we said we estimated there about 175 or so barges still moving crude. And that was down from 550. Our latest poll indicates it's probably around 140 barges. So sure, that did have some impact. It went from 175 down to 140. It's interesting, you'll see, you read some of the snippets that people in the Utica are going to start drilling again. So who knows if we've hit bottom on the crude barges. But clearly, the barges that have come out of crude have been cleaned up and put into clean service, by and large, which has impacted utilization for sure. Now to your broader question about demand. If we look across all of our products that we carry, outside of crude, everything is pretty good. Crude's down for sure. But if you look at the chemicals, they are okay. And we do see continued building. I think one of our customers just announced a new joint venture, they're going to build a new facility on the Gulf Coast. There has been 1 or 2 delays, but, by and large, most of the chemical facilities that have been announced and have started construction are still going on. So that's a positive. Refined products outside of this product let that we're in are now that's impacting kind of some movements. If you look at vehicle miles driven, they are up in refine products demand. It's still growing. I don't think that the production has outpaced it here recently. And that's caused this kind of disruption or product clot, if you will. And then you look at some of the other products. Outside of crude, everything is okay and fairly healthy. It's just we've got a little dislocation now where things have to come back into balance."

The -- well, I think that's it. Firstly, you need to separate what drove the -- some of the cycles in the past have been principally driven by recessions where volumes have declined and you really needed to have a kind of a cleansing of the industry. You needed, one, the economy to recover volumes to improve and some equipment to come out. This particular downturn is not economically driven. It's -- it really is affected by a couple of things. It's affected by building barges for a market, the crude oil market that then collapsed as crude oil collapsed. And it's affected by what I think is an anomaly, which is high inventories and the market adjusting to those inventories. We saw something similar to that in 2008 -- end of 2008 and the beginning of 2009 where you did have an economic collapse, but you also had an enormous adjustment in inventories. And that was relatively short. Now there's some other things that are going on, I think, in this particular -- during this particular period. You have the summer weather effect that David talked about. And that's something that we really haven't seen in the last 3 or 4 years because the market's been so tight. There hasn't been enough equipment. But if you go back to the last 30 years before that, you always had utilization drill down in the summer as the system got more efficient and there was more equipment on the market. Come fall, it tightens up again. I think what's happened here is that you have some operators that are already worried about crude oil equipment that don't have a home for it. As any who've had these summer doldrums that have been traditionally seen in the business, and they panicked and they lowered prices just to both equipment, which has dragged the whole market down. As you get some adjustments in inventory, as you go into the fall where the system isn't as efficient, it gets a little less efficient, you'll see utilization get better and I think pricing will follow it. How long it takes to absorb the crude oil overhang, will really be driven by 2 things. One, equipment going out of the market, and some of that is happening now. You're already getting maintenance referrals. So you're going to see less available equipment going forward in the year. And then the volumes that David talked about. You've got strong refined products, markets, record miles driven in the U.S. and I think people are predicting that that's going to continue given that the low gasoline prices. And then you have these volumes that are coming from the chemical business. So it's going to correct itself. I think you'll begin to see it at the end of -- towards the end of the year, and 2017, barring any economic issue, you should see continued correction, higher utilization and more normalcy in pricing."

Barging is much more flexible, because you can source it from different plants. You can move it into different markets. The pipeline is -- you put it in the pipeline, it comes out where the pipeline ends. And it also requires steady volumes of some significant nature. That's really not the chemical business. Barging has been the really the principal way of moving chemicals around, because of their flexibility and because of the volumes that you'd typically see. Railroads are competitive depending on where you're moving the chemicals and how much you're moving. You remember that -- the smallest barge that we operate is equal to, I think, 16 railcar. So if you've got more -- you've got less than a barge load than rail makes a lot of sense. If you're taking it to a place that barging doesn't service and rail makes a lot of sense. But typically, most movements, rail is a not a competitive factor. So I would think that we're going to get more than our share."

And we have said this in the past and I think it's worth saying it again, is that barging is going to be one of the ways that you're going to move crude oil to the market. And when the lions come back, you're going to move more volumes of crude oil. And that's also going to have a stabilizing effect on the fleet. I think that Halliburton said the other day in their earnings call that by 2021, the world needed close to 18 million more barrels of oil. That's an enormous amount of oil.

We heard some of the oil service commentary that you don't need 1,800 rigs to absorb the pressure pumping fleet. I think it's closer to 900. So that service intensity plus the attrition that's happened in the fleet, so I think on the pressure pumping side, you're going to see that market tighten up pretty quickly. And they need it.

Yesterday afternoon, we announced second quarter earnings of $0.72 per share versus our guidance range of $0.65 to $0.75 per share. That compares to a $1.04 per share reported for the 2015 second quarter. Inland marine tank barge utilization during the second quarter was in the high 80% to low 90% range. Market continues to adjust in response to excess barge supply. That has influenced market over the past 12 to 18 months. Although a combination of retirements and volume will help bring the market back into balance, the transition has not been as smooth as we hoped it would be. 
As I've -- as mentioned in our press release last night, inland utilization in July fell significantly, and we have seen aggressive pricing from several carriers at levels -- at what we believe is at their full cost or, in some cases, their cash costs. Such pricing in the market is historically unusual, given the market fundamentals have not fundamentally changed that much since the start of the year and summer almost always sees a decline in utilization. Pricing at these levels, we believe, is unsustainable, and if it persists, will lead to destructive pressure on some less well-capitalized carriers. 
In the coastal market, tank barge utilization was in the mid-80% range. Utilization continues to be impacted by the amount of equipment trading on the spot market, which adds vital time exposure. We continue to maintain a cautious outlook for this market as it absorbs new supply that is coming online through the first half of 2018. Remember that there is a lot of older tonnage ship in the coastal market. 
In the land-based diesel engine service business, market conditions remained depressed. Sales from the distribution of OEM engines, transmissions and parts, which have been relatively stable in prior industry cycles, are at historically low levels. Additionally, orders for new pressure pumping units have not yet materialized. 
The remanufacturing and service side of the business is more positive, and we have seen an increase in inquiries during the quarter as well as a number of firm orders. While such limited activity does not lend itself to a materially better earnings outlook yet, our hope it does represent the first green shoots in the market and the conditions will improve in the coming months. 
In the marine and power generation diesel engine service businesses, the oilfield market along the Gulf Coast remains depressed, while in the rest of our market, service activities -- service activity is relatively stable. 
In summary, we continue to face an excess supply of equipment in the marine markets and a severe cyclical depression in the oilfield market. As we confront these challenges, we will continue to focus on safety, customer service, cost and capital discipline. In the inland market, we expect the market will get better later this year and benefit from additional retirements of maintenance deferrals, consolidation as well as volumes from new chemical plants. For Kirby's part, we will aggressively pursue our costs, aggressively service our customers and look for opportunities to prudently apply our balance sheet.

I'll begin today with a summary of quarterly results in each of our markets, then I'll turn the call over to Andy to walk through the financials in more detail. After he finishes, I'll conclude with an explanation of our outlook and our guidance. 
In the inland marine transportation market, after a strong start to the second quarter in April, we experienced a modest decline in tank barge utilization into the high 80% range. The modest decline in utilization was largely attributable to a shortened spring season for ag products and soft demand in trading and refinery volumes, which we believe was largely related to high inventory levels. 
Pricing on term contracts that renewed during the second quarter was down in the mid- to high single digits on average. Spot rates were at/or below term contract rates during the quarter. Operating conditions during the quarter were seasonally normal, although high cross currents at floodgates and river crossings on the Gulf Intercoastal Waterway led to congestion and added delays at certain points along the Gulf Coast. 
In our coastal marine transportation sector, demand for the coastwise transportation of black oil and petrochemicals remained consistent with the 2016 first quarter, while refined products demand was weaker, due primarily to lower demand in the Northeast. Relative to the first quarter, tank barge utilization declined slightly to the mid-80% range, a result of the continued trend of more equipment moving off of term contracts and trading in the spot market. As a reminder, most coastal barge term contracts are time charters, which have a 100% utilization. And when equipment moves from time-chartered spot, even when it is highly utilized, the average utilization drops. 
With respect to pricing, term contracts that renewed during the second quarter increased by a low single-digit percentage on average as several older contracts renewed in the quarter. However, term contracts that were signed a year ago and renewed during the quarter were at modestly lower rates. 
In our diesel engine services segment in our marine diesel and power generation markets, we continue to see deferrals of major overhaul projects. As has been the case, the Gulf of Mexico oilfield service market remained at depressed levels. 
In our land-based diesel engine services market, the sale of engines, transmissions and parts in our distribution business remained at very depressed levels and have yet to show signs of improvement. Likewise, we have not had orders to manufacture new pressure pumping units. 
On a more positive note, we did see incremental improvement in quote and order activity for pressure pumping unit service in remanufacturing. The number of units serviced during the quarter was small, but we did have an uptick in labor and facility utilization, particularly late in the quarter and it continues into the early part of this quarter, the third quarter. 
It remains too early to call this activity a trend, but it does seem that we have at least seen the worst of the market in this cycle. 
I'll now turn the call over to Andy to provide some detailed financial information before I come back and discuss our outlook."

In the 2016 second quarter, marine transportation segment revenue declined 11% and operating income declined 25% as compared with the 2015 second quarter.

In the 2016 second quarter, marine transportation segment revenue declined 11% and operating income declined 25% as compared with the 2015 second quarter. The decline in revenue in the second quarter as compared to the prior year quarter was primarily due to a 33% decline in the average cost of marine diesel fuel, lower inland marine contract pricing and an increase in available spot market days for our offshore marine equipment. The marine transportation segment's operating margin was 19.2% compared with 22.8% for the 2015 second quarter. 
The inland sector contributed approximately 2/3 of marine transportation revenue during the 2016 second quarter. Long-term inland marine transportation contracts, those contracts with the term of 1 year or longer in duration, contributed approximately 80% of revenue, with 51% of those contracts attributable to time charters and 49% affreightment contracts. 
The inland sector generated an operating margin in the low 20% range for the quarter. In the coastal sector, the trend of customers electing to source coastal equipment from the spot market over renewing existing contracts continued. However, the percentage of coastal revenue under term contracts was consistent with the first quarter at approximately 78%, probably as a result of lower utilization in revenue for spot equipment. The second quarter operating margin for the coastal sector was in the low double digits. 
Turning now to our marine construction and retirement plans. During the 2016 first half, we received 27 barges from the acquisition of Seacor's inland tank barge fleet, took delivery of 3 barges, transferred 1 30,000-barrel barge from coastal to inland service, and retired a total of 28 barges. The net result was an increase of 3 tank barges to our inland tank barge fleet, which totaled approximately 345,000 barrels of capacity. For the second half of the year, we expect to take delivery of 4 30,000-barrel inland tank barges and to retire or return to charters an additional 11 barges with 135,000 barrels of capacity. 
On a net basis, we expect to end 2016 with approximately 18.2 million barrels of capacity or roughly the same level we finished in second quarter, an increase of approximately 325,000 barrels from the end of 2015. 
In the coastwise transportation sector, our second new 185,000-barrel ATB began operating under a long-term customer contract in mid-June. The first of 2 new 155,000-barrel ATB should deliver in late 2016 and our second 155,000-barrel ATB on a coastal chemical barge are both expected to be completed in early 2017. 
Also, during the second quarter of this year, we retired an 80,000-barrel barge and transferred a 30,000-barrel coastal barge to our inland fleet, ending the quarter with approximately 6.1 million barrels of capacity. 
In our press release last night, we also announced that we purchased 4 coastal tugboats during the second quarter for $26.5 million. The tugs will transition into service with existing barges in our fleet. The addition of these tugs will lower the age of our tug fleet, better align the age of our boats and barges, and improve our operating performance. The average age of the boats we purchased is 8 years and the average age of the boats they're replacing is close to 40 years. 
Moving on to our diesel engine services segment. Revenue for the 2016 second quarter declined 46% from the 2015 second quarter and we had an operating loss in the segment of approximately $2 million. The segment's operating margin was negative 3.1% compared with 4.2% for the 2015 second quarter. The marine and power generation operations contributed approximately 65% of the diesel engine services revenue in the second quarter, with an operating margin in the low double digits. Our land-based operations contributed roughly 35% of the diesel engine services segment's revenue in the second quarter, with a double-digit negative operating margin. 
On the corporate side of things. Our 2016 capital spending guidance remains in a range of $230 million to $250 million, including approximately $10 million from construction of 7 inland tank barges to be delivered in 2016; approximately $100 million in progress payments on new coastal equipment, including 1 185,000-barrel coastal ATB, 2 155,000-barrel coastal ATBs, 2 4,900-horsepower coastal tugboats and a new coastal petrochemical tank barge. The balance of $120 million to $140 million is primarily for capital upgrades and improvements to existing inland and coastal marine equipment and facilities as well as diesel engine services facilities. 
In addition to our capital spending guidance, we spent $81 million on the acquisition of the Seacor inland tank barge fleet, with an additional $4 million paid in July for a tugboat which was under construction. We also spent $13.5 million to acquire a lease coastal barge from the lessor and $26.5 million to purchase 4 coastal tugboats. 
Total debt as of June 30, 2016, was $799 million, a $24 million increase from December 31, 2015. Our debt to cap ratio at June 30, 2016, was 25.4%, unchanged from December 31, 2015. As of today, our debt stands at $786 million.

In our press release, we announced our 2016 third quarter guidance of $0.50 to $0.65 per share and we lowered our full year 2016 guidance to a range of $2.40 to $2.70 per share.

In our press release, we announced our 2016 third quarter guidance of $0.50 to $0.65 per share and we lowered our full year 2016 guidance to a range of $2.40 to $2.70 per share. Let me take a moment and provide a general overview of our approach to guidance this quarter. 
In the second quarter, we saw a strong utilization and firming pricing in the inland market in April, with the rest of the quarter playing out around our expectations, as you saw with our second quarter result, which fell within our guidance range. However, in July, we've seen our inland utilization fall into the low 80% range. Given the lower inland marine utilization, we are seeing a very competitive pricing environment. We are lowering guidance to reflect these conditions. And on the low end of the range, we are factoring in a continuation of this environment through the remainder of the year. 
In terms of inland marine utilization, tank barge utilization does typically fall slightly in the summer when good operating conditions reduce congestion and improve efficiency throughout the waterways. However, so far this quarter, utilization has remained in the low 80% range, lower than we would expect. We do think that weaker utilization levels are partly related to factors that are temporary in nature, including high refinery and terminal inventory levels and reduced trading activity in the black oil markets. 
As it remains unclear how long these utilization levels will persist, we have lowered our guidance. In terms of pricing, we expect spot and contract renewal pricing to continue to be under pressure during the quarter. As Joe mentioned, we believe spot pricing in the inland market has reached unsustainable levels and that spot rates now reflect pricing that is below cash breakevens for some carriers. If this pricing persists, we believe potential sellers will materialize either through choice or distress. We will deploy our capital appropriately should that occur. 
In the coastal market, on the low end, our guidance range contemplates pricing declines on contract renewals in the low single-digit percent range and utilization in the low to mid-80% range. On the high end of guidance, we are expecting flat pricing on contract renewals and utilization in the high 80% range. For our diesel engine service segment in our land-based sector, we expect to incur quarterly operating losses of a similar magnitude as in the first half of the year. However, our results may improve if service activities, which picked up in late June, continue to improve. 
In our diesel markets, we do -- diesel -- marine diesel markets, we do not expect any improvement in the Gulf of Mexico oil service market this year. In the power generation market and on our other marine diesel engine services market, we expect results to be largely consistent with the 2016 second quarter. 
In closing, our financial position is strong. We have a strong balance sheet, a young, well-maintained fleet and healthy free cash flow. As both our marine transportation and diesel engine services markets undergo difficult times, we will focus on safe operation, customer service and cost containment while looking to deploy cash flow where we can find high return projects in a disciplined and accretive manner. As we look beyond this year, we are much more constructive on the outlook across our markets. 
In the past few days, many large oilfield operators have stated their belief that the worst of the energy market collapse is behind us. We believe that is the case as well. By the second half of next year, if not earlier, we expect to see volumes increase in our land-based diesel engine business. 
Similarly, in our marine transportation markets, the worst of the correction which arose from overbuilding into the crude markets, is likely behind us. While the aggressive pricing in the market this quarter is troubling, it likely yields opportunities that would not otherwise be there or at a minimum should force capacity discipline on some operators who have not shown much discipline lately. 
A rationalization of supply this year provides a better environment for growth next year, particularly in the chemical markets where we expect growth to accelerate through next year. 
Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks. And we're now ready to take questions."

And that -- what I said was that was related to our low end of guidance.

We usually get some increased efficiencies, which drops utilization. But we've also -- in the black oil markets, as feedstock prices have moved around and we've seen -- sometimes the arbitrage closes and sometimes it opens back up, and so the black oil fleet utilization moves around a bit with that.

Clearly, we're in an oversupplied market right now. We've got too much equipment. And in this kind of market, with these kind of prices, as maintenance decisions come up, certainly, nobody would want to build into this market right now. No rational player would want to add capacity in this environment. And I think as you look at maintenance decisions that come up on, say, a 25-year-old or 30-year-old barge, you probably tie it up at best and maybe you just retire it and cut it up and sell it for scrap, because at this market, those kind of decisions become easier. And this is why we see, in these kind of environments, the number of retirements go up and the building go down. As we look at the 2017 order book, we're not hearing much at all being let in terms of contracts. So in terms of inland fleet growth, I don't think there will be much, if any, at all, and with retirements, it should contract. On the coastwise side, it's a little more balanced in that you've got some new capacity coming in, including some of ours, over the next to 18 months. I think, in total, it's -- the ones that haven't delivered, maybe it's 14 units. And -- but there are still over 40 units that are 30 years or older in the coastwise business. And they need to come out. And the betting requirements from our customers are getting tougher, and in the offshore environment, they are even tougher than they are in the inland side. And age is a factor there. So I think you'll see more retirements on the coastwise side. The question is the balance between the new additions in the retirements and how that plays out. But I don't think you'll see overall capacity growth, volume growth on the coastwise side in the barges that are 200,000 and less."

So it's not as bad as that, but low 80s is pretty difficult environment in terms of utilization. In terms of crude barges, I think last quarter we said we estimated there about 175 or so barges still moving crude. And that was down from 550. Our latest poll indicates it's probably around 140 barges. So sure, that did have some impact. It went from 175 down to 140. It's interesting, you'll see, you read some of the snippets that people in the Utica are going to start drilling again. So who knows if we've hit bottom on the crude barges. But clearly, the barges that have come out of crude have been cleaned up and put into clean service, by and large, which has impacted utilization for sure. Now to your broader question about demand. If we look across all of our products that we carry, outside of crude, everything is pretty good. Crude's down for sure. But if you look at the chemicals, they are okay. And we do see continued building. I think one of our customers just announced a new joint venture, they're going to build a new facility on the Gulf Coast. There has been 1 or 2 delays, but, by and large, most of the chemical facilities that have been announced and have started construction are still going on. So that's a positive. Refined products outside of this product glut that we're in are now that's impacting kind of some movements. If you look at vehicle miles driven, they're up. And refine products demand, it's still growing. I don't think that the production has outpaced it here recently. And that's caused this kind of disruption or product glut, if you will. And then you look at some of the other products. Outside of crude, everything is okay and fairly healthy. It's just we've got a little dislocation now where things have to come back into balance."

The -- well, I think that firstly, you need to separate what drove the -- some of the cycles in the past and what's driving this one. Cycles in the past have been principally driven by recessions where volumes have declined and you really needed to have a kind of a cleansing of the industry. You needed, one, the economy to recover volumes to improve and some equipment to come out. This particular downturn is not economically driven. It's -- it really is affected by a couple of things. It's affected by building barges for a market, the crude oil market that then collapsed as crude oil collapsed. And it's affected by what I think is an anomaly, which is high inventories and the market adjusting to those inventories. We saw something similar to that in 2008 -- end of 2008 and the beginning of 2009 where you did have an economic collapse, but you also had an enormous adjustment in inventories. And that was relatively short. Now there's some other things that are going on, I think, in this particular -- during this particular period. You have the summer weather effect that David talked about. And that's something that we really haven't seen in the last 3 or 4 years because the market's been so tight. There hasn't been enough equipment. But if you go back for the last 30 years before that, you always had utilization trail down the summer as the system got more efficient and there was more equipment on the market. Come fall, that tightens up again. I think what's happened here is that you have some operators that are already worried about crude oil equipment that they've built that doesn't have a home for it. As any who've had these summer doldrums that have been traditionally seen in the business, and they panicked and they lowered prices just to book equipment, which has drug the whole market down. As you get some adjustments in inventory, as you go into the fall where the system isn't as efficient, it gets a little less efficient, you'll see utilization get better and I think pricing will follow it. How long it takes to absorb the crude oil overhang, will really be driven by 2 things. One, equipment going out of the market, and some of that is happening now. You're already getting maintenance deferrals. So you're going to see less available equipment going forward in the year. And then the volumes that David talked about. You've got strong refined products, markets, record miles driven in the U.S. and I think people are predicting that that's going to continue given that the low gasoline prices. And then you have these volumes that are coming from the chemical business. So it's going to correct itself. I think you'll begin to see it at the end of -- towards the end of the year, and 2017, barring any economic issue, you should see continued correction, higher utilization and more normalcy in pricing."

Barging is much more flexible, because you can source it from different plants. You can move it into different markets. The pipeline is -- you put it in the pipeline, it comes out where the pipeline ends. And it also requires steady volumes of some significant nature. That's really not the chemical business. Barging has been the really the principal way of moving chemicals around, because of their flexibility and because of the volumes that you'd typically see. Railroads are competitive depending on where you're moving the chemicals and how much you're moving. You remember that -- the smallest barge that we operate is equal to, I think, 16 railcars. So if you've got more -- you've got less than a barge load than rail makes a lot of sense. If you're taking it to a place that barging doesn't service then rail makes a lot of sense. But typically, most movements, rail is a not a competitive factor. So I would think that we're going to get more than our share."

We're down on crude oil because crude oil prices are such that they are some significant restraints to drilling for oil in the U.S. And we tend to think that, that's going to go on forever, and it's not. I mean, the world's demand for crude oil and the U.S. position, barring some regulations, I don't think we're going to see, is very important to the world oil supply. And we have said this in the past and I think it's worth saying it again, is that barging is going to be one of the ways that you're going to move crude oil to the market. And when the volumes come back, you're going to move more volumes of crude oil. And that's also going to have a stabilizing effect on the fleet. I think that Halliburton said the other day in their earnings call that by 2021, the world needed close to 18 million more barrels of oil. That's an enormous amount of oil. And some of that is going to have to come from the U.S. shale effort. And we're going to get some of those volumes."

And I think we're starting to see that play out where we're getting a lot of inquiries about repairing equipment and remanufacturing equipment. Now there's some interesting things going on. We heard some of the oil service commentary that you don't need 1,800 rigs to absorb the pressure pumping fleet. They think it's closer to 900. So that service intensity plus the attrition that's happened in the fleet, so I think on the pressure pumping side, you're going to see that market tighten up pretty quickly. And they need it. I mean, our pressure pumping customers have been cash constrained. So I don't think -- that's a long way of saying we're not seeing new equipment orders. I don't think -- I mean, they will reemerge, but right now, the demand for reman is growing, and to us, it's very encouraging."

Yesterday afternoon, we announced second quarter earnings of $0.72 per share versus our guidance range of $0.65 to $0.75 per share. That compares to a $1.04 per share reported for the 2015 second quarter. Inland marine tank barge utilization during the second quarter was in the high 80% to low 90% range. Market continues to adjust in response to excess barge supply. That has influenced market over the past 12 to 18 months. Although a combination of retirements and volume will help bring the market back into balance, the transition has not been as smooth as we hoped it would be. 
As I've -- as mentioned in our press release last night, inland utilization in July fell significantly, and we have seen aggressive pricing from several carriers at levels -- at what we believe is at their full cost or, in some cases, their cash costs. Such pricing in the market is historically unusual, given the market fundamentals have not fundamentally changed that much since the start of the year and summer almost always sees a decline in utilization. Pricing at these levels, we believe, is unsustainable, and if it persists, will lead to destructive pressure on some less well-capitalized carriers. 
In the coastal market, tank barge utilization was in the mid-80% range. Utilization continues to be impacted by the amount of equipment trading on the spot market, which adds vital time exposure. We continue to maintain a cautious outlook for this market as it absorbs new supply that is coming online through the first half of 2018. Remember that there is a lot of older tonnage ship in the coastal market. 
In the land-based diesel engine service business, market conditions remained depressed. Sales from the distribution of OEM engines, transmissions and parts, which have been relatively stable in prior industry cycles, are at historically low levels. Additionally, orders for new pressure pumping units have not yet materialized. 
The remanufacturing and service side of the business is more positive, and we have seen an increase in inquiries during the quarter as well as a number of firm orders. While such limited activity does not lend itself to a materially better earnings outlook yet, our hope it does represent the first green shoots in the market and the conditions will improve in the coming months. 
In the marine and power generation diesel engine service businesses, the oilfield market along the Gulf Coast remains depressed, while in the rest of our market, service activities -- service activity is relatively stable. 
In summary, we continue to face an excess supply of equipment in the marine markets and a severe cyclical depression in the oilfield market. As we confront these challenges, we will continue to focus on safety, customer service, cost and capital discipline. In the inland market, we expect the market will get better later this year and benefit from additional retirements of maintenance deferrals, consolidation as well as volumes from new chemical plants. For Kirby's part, we will aggressively pursue our costs, aggressively service our customers and look for opportunities to prudently apply our balance sheet. 
I'll now turn the call over to David."

Good morning to everyone on the call. I'll begin today with a summary of quarterly results in each of our markets, then I'll turn the call over to Andy to walk through the financials in more detail.

I'll begin today with a summary of quarterly results in each of our markets, then I'll turn the call over to Andy to walk through the financials in more detail. After he finishes, I'll conclude with an explanation of our outlook and our guidance. 
In the inland marine transportation market, after a strong start to the second quarter in April, we experienced a modest decline in tank barge utilization into the high 80% range. The modest decline in utilization was largely attributable to a shortened spring season for ag products and soft demand in trading and refinery volumes, which we believe was largely related to high inventory levels. 
Pricing on term contracts that renewed during the second quarter was down in the mid- to high single digits on average. Spot rates were at/or below term contract rates during the quarter. Operating conditions during the quarter were seasonally normal, although high cross currents at floodgates and river crossings on the Gulf Intercoastal Waterway led to congestion and added delays at certain points along the Gulf Coast. 
In our coastal marine transportation sector, demand for the coastwise transportation of black oil and petrochemicals remained consistent with the 2016 first quarter, while refined products demand was weaker, due primarily to lower demand in the Northeast. Relative to the first quarter, tank barge utilization declined slightly to the mid-80% range, a result of the continued trend of more equipment moving off of term contracts and trading in the spot market. As a reminder, most coastal barge term contracts are time charters, which have a 100% utilization. And when equipment moves from time-chartered spot, even when it is highly utilized, the average utilization drops. 
With respect to pricing, term contracts that renewed during the second quarter increased by a low single-digit percentage on average as several older contracts renewed in the quarter. However, term contracts that were signed a year ago and renewed during the quarter were at modestly lower rates. 
In our diesel engine services segment in our marine diesel and power generation markets, we continue to see deferrals of major overhaul projects. As has been the case, the Gulf of Mexico oilfield service market remained at depressed levels. 
In our land-based diesel engine services market, the sale of engines, transmissions and parts in our distribution business remained at very depressed levels and have yet to show signs of improvement. Likewise, we have not had orders to manufacture new pressure pumping units. 
On a more positive note, we did see incremental improvement in quote and order activity for pressure pumping unit service in remanufacturing. The number of units serviced during the quarter was small, but we did have an uptick in labor and facility utilization, particularly late in the quarter and it continues into the early part of this quarter, the third quarter. 
It remains too early to call this activity a trend, but it does seem that we have at least seen the worst of the market in this cycle. 
I'll now turn the call over to Andy to provide some detailed financial information before I come back and discuss our outlook."

In the 2016 second quarter, marine transportation segment revenue declined 11% and operating income declined 25% as compared with the 2015 second quarter. The decline in revenue in the second quarter as compared to the prior year quarter was primarily due to a 33% decline in the average cost of marine diesel fuel, lower inland marine contract pricing and an increase in available spot market days for our offshore marine equipment. The marine transportation segment's operating margin was 19.2% compared with 22.8% for the 2015 second quarter. 
The inland sector contributed approximately 2/3 of marine transportation revenue during the 2016 second quarter. Long-term inland marine transportation contracts, those contracts with the term of 1 year or longer in duration, contributed approximately 80% of revenue, with 51% of those contracts attributable to time charters and 49% affreightment contracts. 
The inland sector generated an operating margin in the low 20% range for the quarter. In the coastal sector, the trend of customers electing to source coastal equipment from the spot market over renewing existing contracts continued. However, the percentage of coastal revenue under term contracts was consistent with the first quarter at approximately 78%, probably as a result of lower utilization in revenue for spot equipment. The second quarter operating margin for the coastal sector was in the low double digits. 
Turning now to our marine construction and retirement plans. During the 2016 first half, we received 27 barges from the acquisition of Seacor's inland tank barge fleet, took delivery of 3 barges, transferred 1 30,000-barrel barge from coastal to inland service, and retired a total of 28 barges. The net result was an increase of 3 tank barges to our inland tank barge fleet, which totaled approximately 345,000 barrels of capacity. For the second half of the year, we expect to take delivery of 4 30,000-barrel inland tank barges and to retire or return to charters an additional 11 barges with 135,000 barrels of capacity. 
On a net basis, we expect to end 2016 with approximately 18.2 million barrels of capacity or roughly the same level we finished in second quarter, an increase of approximately 325,000 barrels from the end of 2015. 
In the coastwise transportation sector, our second new 185,000-barrel ATB began operating under a long-term customer contract in mid-June. The first of 2 new 155,000-barrel ATB should deliver in late 2016 and our second 155,000-barrel ATB on a coastal chemical barge are both expected to be completed in early 2017. 
Also, during the second quarter of this year, we retired an 80,000-barrel barge and transferred a 30,000-barrel coastal barge to our inland fleet, ending the quarter with approximately 6.1 million barrels of capacity. 
In our press release last night, we also announced that we purchased 4 coastal tugboats during the second quarter for $26.5 million. The tugs will transition into service with existing barges in our fleet. The addition of these tugs will lower the age of our tug fleet, better align the age of our boats and barges, and improve our operating performance. The average age of the boats we purchased is 8 years and the average age of the boats they're replacing is close to 40 years. 
Moving on to our diesel engine services segment. Revenue for the 2016 second quarter declined 46% from the 2015 second quarter and we had an operating loss in the segment of approximately $2 million. The segment's operating margin was negative 3.1% compared with 4.2% for the 2015 second quarter. The marine and power generation operations contributed approximately 65% of the diesel engine services revenue in the second quarter, with an operating margin in the low double digits. Our land-based operations contributed roughly 35% of the diesel engine services segment's revenue in the second quarter, with a double-digit negative operating margin. 
On the corporate side of things. Our 2016 capital spending guidance remains in a range of $230 million to $250 million, including approximately $10 million from construction of 7 inland tank barges to be delivered in 2016; approximately $100 million in progress payments on new coastal equipment, including 1 185,000-barrel coastal ATB, 2 155,000-barrel coastal ATBs, 2 4,900-horsepower coastal tugboats and a new coastal petrochemical tank barge. The balance of $120 million to $140 million is primarily for capital upgrades and improvements to existing inland and coastal marine equipment and facilities as well as diesel engine services facilities. 
In addition to our capital spending guidance, we spent $81 million on the acquisition of the Seacor inland tank barge fleet, with an additional $4 million paid in July for a tugboat which was under construction. We also spent $13.5 million to acquire a lease coastal barge from the lessor and $26.5 million to purchase 4 coastal tugboats. 
Total debt as of June 30, 2016, was $799 million, a $24 million increase from December 31, 2015. Our debt to cap ratio at June 30, 2016, was 25.4%, unchanged from December 31, 2015. As of today, our debt stands at $786 million.

In our press release, we announced our 2016 third quarter guidance of $0.50 to $0.65 per share and we lowered our full year 2016 guidance to a range of $2.40 to $2.70 per share.

In our press release, we announced our 2016 third quarter guidance of $0.50 to $0.65 per share and we lowered our full year 2016 guidance to a range of $2.40 to $2.70 per share. Let me take a moment and provide a general overview of our approach to guidance this quarter. 
In the second quarter, we saw a strong utilization and firming pricing in the inland market in April, with the rest of the quarter playing out around our expectations, as you saw with our second quarter result, which fell within our guidance range. However, in July, we've seen our inland utilization fall into the low 80% range. Given the lower inland marine utilization, we are seeing a very competitive pricing environment. We are lowering guidance to reflect these conditions. And on the low end of the range, we are factoring in a continuation of this environment through the remainder of the year. 
In terms of inland marine utilization, tank barge utilization does typically fall slightly in the summer when good operating conditions reduce congestion and improve efficiency throughout the waterways. However, so far this quarter, utilization has remained in the low 80% range, lower than we would expect. We do think that weaker utilization levels are partly related to factors that are temporary in nature, including high refinery and terminal inventory levels and reduced trading activity in the black oil markets. 
As it remains unclear how long these utilization levels will persist, we have lowered our guidance. In terms of pricing, we expect spot and contract renewal pricing to continue to be under pressure during the quarter. As Joe mentioned, we believe spot pricing in the inland market has reached unsustainable levels and that spot rates now reflect pricing that is below cash breakevens for some carriers. If this pricing persists, we believe potential sellers will materialize either through choice or distress. We will deploy our capital appropriately should that occur. 
In the coastal market, on the low end, our guidance range contemplates pricing declines on contract renewals in the low single-digit percent range and utilization in the low to mid-80% range. On the high end of guidance, we are expecting flat pricing on contract renewals and utilization in the high 80% range. For our diesel engine service segment in our land-based sector, we expect to incur quarterly operating losses of a similar magnitude as in the first half of the year. However, our results may improve if service activities, which picked up in late June, continue to improve. 
In our diesel markets, we do -- diesel -- marine diesel markets, we do not expect any improvement in the Gulf of Mexico oil service market this year. In the power generation market and on our other marine diesel engine services market, we expect results to be largely consistent with the 2016 second quarter. 
In closing, our financial position is strong. We have a strong balance sheet, a young, well-maintained fleet and healthy free cash flow. As both our marine transportation and diesel engine services markets undergo difficult times, we will focus on safe operation, customer service and cost containment while looking to deploy cash flow where we can find high return projects in a disciplined and accretive manner. As we look beyond this year, we are much more constructive on the outlook across our markets. 
In the past few days, many large oilfield operators have stated their belief that the worst of the energy market collapse is behind us. We believe that is the case as well. By the second half of next year, if not earlier, we expect to see volumes increase in our land-based diesel engine business. 
Similarly, in our marine transportation markets, the worst of the correction which arose from overbuilding into the crude markets, is likely behind us. While the aggressive pricing in the market this quarter is troubling, it likely yields opportunities that would not otherwise be there or at a minimum should force capacity discipline on some operators who have not shown much discipline lately. 
A rationalization of supply this year provides a better environment for growth next year, particularly in the chemical markets where we expect growth to accelerate through next year. 
Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks. And we're now ready to take questions."

We usually get some increased efficiencies, which drops utilization. But we've also -- in the black oil markets, as feedstock prices have moved around and we've seen -- sometimes the arbitrage closes and sometimes it opens back up, and so the black oil fleet utilization moves around a bit with that. So it's not just inventory levels, then also you've got the strong dollar which can affect imports and exports for that matter. And that can move things around there. So it's -- short answer, it's hard to quantify it and how much of it is related to inventories. But I would say, a good portion of it. Yes, I couldn't put a percentage on it, but it is a decent percentage of it."

Clearly, we're in an oversupplied market right now. We've got too much equipment. And in this kind of market, with these kind of prices, as maintenance decisions come up, certainly, nobody would want to build into this market right now. No rational player would want to add capacity in this environment. And I think as you look at maintenance decisions that come up on, say, a 25-year-old or 30-year-old barge, you probably tie it up at best and maybe you just retire it and cut it up and sell it for scrap, because at this market, those kind of decisions become easier. And this is why we see, in these kind of environments, the number of retirements go up and the building go down. As we look at the 2017 order book, we're not hearing much at all being let in terms of contracts. So in terms of inland fleet growth, I don't think there will be much, if any, at all, and with retirements, it should contract. On the coastwise side, it's a little more balanced in that you've got some new capacity coming in, including some of ours, over the next to 18 months. I think, in total, it's -- the ones that haven't delivered, maybe it's 14 units. And -- but there are still over 40 units that are 30 years or older in the coastwise business. And they need to come out. And the betting requirements from our customers are getting tougher, and in the offshore environment, they are even tougher than they are in the inland side. And age is a factor there. So I think you'll see more retirements on the coastwise side. The question is the balance between the new additions in the retirements and how that plays out. But I don't think you'll see overall capacity growth, volume growth on the coastwise side in the barges that are 200,000 and less."

In terms of crude barges, I think last quarter we said we estimated there about 175 or so barges still moving crude. And that was down from 550. Our latest poll indicates it's probably around 140 barges. So sure, that did have some impact. It went from 175 down to 140. It's interesting, you'll see, you read some of the snippets that people in the Utica are going to start drilling again. So who knows if we've hit bottom on the crude barges. But clearly, the barges that have come out of crude have been cleaned up and put into clean service, by and large, which has impacted utilization for sure. Now to your broader question about demand. If we look across all of our products that we carry, outside of crude, everything is pretty good. Crude's down for sure. But if you look at the chemicals, they are okay. And we do see continued building. I think one of our customers just announced a new joint venture, they're going to build a new facility on the Gulf Coast. There has been 1 or 2 delays, but, by and large, most of the chemical facilities that have been announced and have started construction are still going on. So that's a positive. Refined products outside of this product glut that we're in are now that's impacting kind of some movements. If you look at vehicle miles driven, they're up. And refine products demand, it's still growing. I don't think that the production has outpaced it here recently. And that's caused this kind of disruption or product glut, if you will. And then you look at some of the other products. Outside of crude, everything is okay and fairly healthy. It's just we've got a little dislocation now where things have to come back into balance."

The -- well, I think that firstly, you need to separate what drove the -- some of the cycles in the past and what's driving this one. Cycles in the past have been principally driven by recessions where volumes have declined and you really needed to have a kind of a cleansing of the industry. You needed, one, the economy to recover volumes to improve and some equipment to come out. This particular downturn is not economically driven. It's -- it really is affected by a couple of things. It's affected by building barges for a market, the crude oil market that then collapsed as crude oil collapsed. And it's affected by what I think is an anomaly, which is high inventories and the market adjusting to those inventories. We saw something similar to that in 2008 -- end of 2008 and the beginning of 2009 where you did have an economic collapse, but you also had an enormous adjustment in inventories. And that was relatively short. Now there's some other things that are going on, I think, in this particular -- during this particular period. You have the summer weather effect that David talked about. And that's something that we really haven't seen in the last 3 or 4 years because the market's been so tight. There hasn't been enough equipment. But if you go back for the last 30 years before that, you always had utilization trail down the summer as the system got more efficient and there was more equipment on the market. Come fall, that tightens up again. I think what's happened here is that you have some operators that are already worried about crude oil equipment that they've built that doesn't have a home for it. As any who've had these summer doldrums that have been traditionally seen in the business, and they panicked and they lowered prices just to book equipment, which has drug the whole market down. As you get some adjustments in inventory, as you go into the fall where the system isn't as efficient, it gets a little less efficient, you'll see utilization get better and I think pricing will follow it. How long it takes to absorb the crude oil overhang, will really be driven by 2 things. One, equipment going out of the market, and some of that is happening now. You're already getting maintenance deferrals. So you're going to see less available equipment going forward in the year. And then the volumes that David talked about. You've got strong refined products, markets, record miles driven in the U.S. and I think people are predicting that that's going to continue given that the low gasoline prices. And then you have these volumes that are coming from the chemical business. So it's going to correct itself. I think you'll begin to see it at the end of -- towards the end of the year, and 2017, barring any economic issue, you should see continued correction, higher utilization and more normalcy in pricing."

Barging is much more flexible, because you can source it from different plants. You can move it into different markets. The pipeline is -- you put it in the pipeline, it comes out where the pipeline ends. And it also requires steady volumes of some significant nature. That's really not the chemical business. Barging has been the really the principal way of moving chemicals around, because of their flexibility and because of the volumes that you'd typically see. Railroads are competitive depending on where you're moving the chemicals and how much you're moving. You remember that -- the smallest barge that we operate is equal to, I think, 16 railcars. So if you've got more -- you've got less than a barge load than rail makes a lot of sense. If you're taking it to a place that barging doesn't service then rail makes a lot of sense. But typically, most movements, rail is a not a competitive factor. So I would think that we're going to get more than our share."

And we have said this in the past and I think it's worth saying it again, is that barging is going to be one of the ways that you're going to move crude oil to the market. And when the volumes come back, you're going to move more volumes of crude oil. And that's also going to have a stabilizing effect on the fleet. I think that Halliburton said the other day in their earnings call that by 2021, the world needed close to 18 million more barrels of oil. That's an enormous amount of oil.

And I think we're starting to see that play out where we're getting a lot of inquiries about repairing equipment and remanufacturing equipment. Now there's some interesting things going on. We heard some of the oil service commentary that you don't need 1,800 rigs to absorb the pressure pumping fleet. They think it's closer to 900. So that service intensity plus the attrition that's happened in the fleet, so I think on the pressure pumping side, you're going to see that market tighten up pretty quickly. And they need it. I mean, our pressure pumping customers have been cash constrained. So I don't think -- that's a long way of saying we're not seeing new equipment orders.

Yesterday afternoon, we announced third quarter earnings of $0.59 per share versus our guidance range of $0.50 to $0.65 per share. That compares to $1.04 per share reported for the 2015 third quarter. 
Inland marine tank barge utilization during this quarter was in the low to mid-80% range. The weaker levels of utilization, at first, materialized in July, which we discussed on last quarter's call, persisted throughout the third quarter, with some incremental improvement due to weather and some modest volume increases, driven by series of customer supply change disruptions occurred. Pricing remains at depressed levels. 
In the coastal market, barge utilization was also in the low to mid-80% range. Utilization continues to be impacted by the amount of equipment trading in the stock market, which adds some idle time exposure. 
Our outlook for this market remains cautious as the industry fleet contends with additional supply that's coming online over the next year. And as it rationalizes older, less commercially viable equipment. 
In our land-based diesel engine service business, our service activity levels have improved in the remanufacturing area and we think this new level of activity is providing a signal for market improvement next year. However, currently demand for parts and components remains depressed. With low port volumes and we're not yet able to cover our fixed costs, that we have reduced the loss run rate from earlier this year. 
We have also not received any orders for new pressure pumping equipment, although we are beginning to have inquiries. The market recovery is still in its infancy but we believe that it has begun. 
In our marine and power generation diesel engine business, the oil service market along the Gulf of Mexico remains depressed as customers continue to defer maintenance. We did see business improvements in the Midwest and in our power generation market. 
In summary, as our guidance implies, the fourth quarter will be another challenging quarter for Kirby. It is, however, encouraging that there are some signs of stability in the marine transportation market and across our diesel engine service markets. And frankly, it's hard to see how pricing in the inland market could get much worse. 
In the case of our land-based diesel engine business and upturn in service activity has cost us to begin to add employees to meet the demand for remanufacturing frac spreads. Our marine diesel engine market, the markets we service may not get much better soon but they're also not going to get much worse. 
And finally, in our coastal marine transportation business, we continued to look for opportunities to take out cost and improve operating efficiencies, as the market adjust to the additional tonnage and lower crude oil volumes. 
I'll now turn the call over to David."

I'll begin today with a summary of quarterly results in each of our markets and then turn the call over to Andy to walk through the financials. Following Andy's remarks, I'll address our guidance range before turning the call over to question-and-answers. 
In the inland transportation market, our utilization was in the low to mid-80% range during the quarter. The relatively sharp drop in utilization that we first experienced in July continued through most of the third quarter, with some periods of better idealization when weather conditions were less favorable and for a brief period during product supply disruptions, including the brief outage that occurred on a portion of the pipeline. 
In response to the lower utilization, we reduced our average towboat count by approximately 6% in the third quarter. 
For the industry overall, weak utilization increases the likelihood that we will see a more rapid number of retirements and a decline in new equipment construction across the industry. This will facilitate an overall rebalancing in the market. Additionally, many of the temporary factors contributing to weak utilization are likely to subside over the next few months. 
Moving on to pricing. Pricing on term contracts that renewed during the third quarter was down on the mid- to high single digits. Spot rates fell sequentially and we're at or below term contract rates during the quarter. However, spot rates have flattened out particularly towards at the end of the quarter and has remained flat into the first part of the fourth quarter. 
Operating conditions during the quarter were seasonally normal, however, it's worth noting that historical levels of flooding in Louisiana drove a brief period of operating disruptions along with the Gulf Coast. The impact from the flooding to operations was minimal. 
In our coastal marine transportation sector, demand for the coast-wide transportation of black oil and petrochemicals was relatively stable, however, refine products demand were weaker due primary to weak demand in the Northeast despite a very brief improvement during the colonial pipeline outage. 
Coastal tank barge utilization continue to decline, primarily due to the ongoing trend of equipment moving off of term contracts to trade in the spot market. Utilization was in the low to mid-80% range during the quarter. 
Coastal market operations were briefly interrupted along the Gulf Coast and East Coast due to disruptions from Hurricane Herman. With respect to coastal market pricing, term contracts that renewed during the third quarter increased very slightly low single digits. However, it was only a very few older contracts that renewed in the quarter. 
Spot pricing did fall below contract pricing during the quarter. In our diesel engine services segment, as has been the case all year, in our marine diesel engine business, the Gulf of Mexico oil services market remained at historically depressed levels. We also continued to experience major maintenance deferrals to our customers in many regions of the country. 
The Midwest marine market was an exception as maintenance demand improved there. Additionally, demand in the power generation market was strong during the quarter. 
In our land-based diesel engine services market, the sale of engines, transmissions and parts in our distribution business remained at very low levels, likewise, we have not had orders to manufacture new pressure pumping units. However, we did see a material increase in order activity for pressure pumping service and remanufacturing. 
Before I turn the call over to Andy, let me briefly address an incident involving a Kirby vessel that occurred earlier this month. On October 13, the tugboat Nathan E. Stewart was pushing the DBL 55, an empty 55,000-barrel ATB, and it went aground on the inside passage on the West Coast of Canada. The towboat is submerged and some of her fuel tanks were compromised. We have responded to the fuel spill. The cleanup is essentially complete. And we are commencing the salvage operation on the tug now. This incident is very unfortunate but it is insured and we expect only to incur the incident deductible. 
I'll now turn the call over to Andy to provide some detailed financial information before I finish with a discussion on the outlook."

In the 2016 third quarter, marine transportation segment revenue declined $59 million or 14% and operating income declined $38 million or 41% as compared with the 2015 third quarter. The decline in the revenues in the third quarter as compared to the prior year quarter was primarily due to lower inland marine pricing in utilization, lower coastal marine utilization and a 17% decline in diesel fuel prices. 
The decline and operating income was driven by the same factors, partially offset by a reduction in inland towboats and savings from reduction in force earlier in the year. The marine transportation segments operating margin was 15.4% compared with 22.4% for the 2015 third quarter. 
The inland sector contributed approximately 2/3 of marine transportation revenue during the 2016 third quarter. Long-term inland marine transportation contracts, those contracts with term of 1 year or longer in duration, contributed approximately 80% of revenue with 52% attributable to time charters and 48% from affreightment contracts. 
The inland sector generated an operating margin in the high teens for the quarter. In the coastal sector, the trend of customers electing to source coastal equipment from the spot market over renewing existing contracts continued. However, the percentage of coastal revenue under term contracts was consistent with the first 9 months of the year at approximately 78% as a result of lower utilization in revenue for spot equipment. 
The third quarter operating margin for the coastal sector was in the high single digits. Turning now to our marine construction and retirement plans. During the 2016 first 9 months, we received 27 barges from the acquisition of [ph] inland tank barge fleet, took delivery of 3 newbuild barges, transferred 130,000-barrel barge from coastal service to inland service and retired or return the charter versus a total of 48 barges. 
The net result was a decrease of 17 tank barges in our inland tank barge fleet for a total reduction of approximately 21,000 barrels of capacity. 
In the fourth quarter, we expect to take delivery of 2 30,000-barrel inland tank barges, with 2 additional 30,000-barrel tank barges deliveries shifting into 2017. 
Also on the fourth quarter, we expect to retire or return to charters an additional 6 barges with 77,000 barrels of capacity. On a net basis, we expected to end 2016 with 877 barges with approximately 17.9 million barrels of capacity or roughly the same level we finished the third quarter and down slightly from our barrel capacity at the end of 2015. 
In the coastal transportation sector, during the third quarter, we retired a small 9,000 barrel harbor barge and ended the quarter with approximately 6 million barrels of capacity. In the fourth quarter, we expect to take delivery of the first of 2 new 155,000-barrel ATBs with the second 155,000-barrel ATB and the coastal chemical barge are both expected to be completed in early to mid-2017. 
Moving on to our diesel engine services segment. Revenue for the 2016 third quarter declined 34% from the 2015 third quarter and operating income declined 17%. The segment's operating margin was 6.1% compared with 4.9% for the 2015 third quarter. 
The marine and power generation operations contributed approximately 46% of the diesel engine services revenue in the third quarter, with an operating in the mid-teens. Our land-based operations contributed approximately 54% of the diesel engine services segment revenue in the third quarter, with a modest operating loss. 
On the corporate side of things, our 2016 capital spending guidance remains at a range of $230 million to $250 million, including approximately $10 million for the construction of 7 tank inland tank barges, 5 of which are to be delivered in 2016. Approximately $100 million in progress payments on new coastal equipment under construction, including our new coastal ATBs, 2 4,900-horsepower tugboats and a new coastal petrochemical tank barge. The balance of $120 million to $140 million is primarily for capital upgrades and improvements to existing facilities and equipment. 
In addition to our capital spending guidance, during the first half of 2016, we spend $85.5 million on the acquisition of the Seacor inland tank barge fleet, $13.6 million to acquire a lease coastal barge from the lessor and $26.5 million to purchase 4 coastal tugboats. Total debt as of September 30, 2016 was $726 million, a $49 million decrease from December 31, 2015. Our debt-to-cap ratio at September 30 was 23.3%, a 2.1 point decline from December 31, 2015. And as of today, our debt stands at $740 million. 
I'll now turn the call back over to David."

In our press release, we announced our 2016 fourth quarter guidance of $0.45 to $0.60 per share, which translates to a narrower full year 2016 guidance range of $2.47 a share to $2.62 a share. In the inland marine transportation business",523,"Thank you, Andy,. In our press release, we announced our 2016 fourth quarter guidance of $0.45 to $0.60 per share, which translates to a narrower full year 2016 guidance range of $2.47 a share to $2.62 a share. In the inland marine transportation business, we expect utilization in the low to mid-80% range at the low end of our guidance range and mid to high-80% range at the high end. 
During the quarter, we saw very few delays throughout the system. And also a delay in refinery -- a decline in refinery operating rates. However, we did experience some short periods of tank barge utilization improvements from weather events and customer supply disruptions. 
We think that provides some support for our view that some of the utilization decline since July is temporary, however, we have yet to see any consistent digitization strengths. Although we are seeing spot market pricing that has flattened out, spot return are no longer declining, and we believe they are up levels that are at or below cash breakeven for much of the market. 
Frankly, these rates are unsustainable and will go up. In the coastal market, on the low end, our guidance range contemplates utilization in the low 80% range. On the high end of guidance, we are expecting flat pricing on contract renewals and utilization in the mid-80% range. Additionally, Hurricane Matthew impacted our operations for 2 weeks in October and caused us to shut down operations for a short period of time along the Eastern Seaboard. This hurricane is expected to have only a modest fourth quarter earnings impact on our coastal results. 
For our diesel engine services segment in our land-based sector, we expect to incur a small operating loss for the fourth quarter at the midpoint of our guidance range and to break even in the land-based market at the high end of our guidance range. This market continues to improve and service volumes continue to grow with some new inquiries for equipment. 
In our marine diesel markets, we inducted expect any improvement in the Gulf of Mexico oil service. In the power generation market and in our other marine diesel engine services market, we expect fourth quarter results to reflect a normal quarter-over-quarter seasonal decline, which generally leads to an operating margin in the low double digits. 
In closing, we entered the last quarter of the year with a strong financial position. Despite the market challenges that we are dealing with and the investments we have made in upgrading and expanding both our inland and coastal fleet. Kirby's debt-to-capital ratio is the lowest that it has been in 2 years. 
While the exact timing of recoveries in our markets is still unclear, we do believe the inland market will come into supply and demand balance sometime in 2017 and pricing will inflect. Also, we believe the land-based diesel business has bottomed and will begin to recover in 2017. 
Finally, we have the financial strength to not only weather the cycles but to grow and improve our market position throughout them. 
Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take questions."

As you know, when spot rates are at or close to break the cash flow breakeven, it's really painful. And what you see in that environment is companies start to accelerate their retirement. They look at some of their old",640,"Yes, sure. Let me start with supply. As you know, when spot rates are at or close to break the cash flow breakeven, it's really painful. And what you see in that environment is companies start to accelerate their retirement. They look at some of their older equipment and it's coming up for a shipyard and they say goodness, there is no we were going to spend the cash to extent that life for another 5-year during. So they begin to retire it, and we're starting to see some aggressive retirement. So I think the last time we talked, we were talking about Kirby's retirements around 39 barges this year. I think will probably end up with about 54 retire this year. So we're retiring more barges, the industry is regarding more barges and it's just a matter of good economic discipline and stewardship. Some of our competitors don't have the economic wherewithal to actually make the investment to extend the lives, so they are almost forced to retire. So we think we'll see a good number of retirements this year and that's happening now and it should carry into next year. I think, the order of magnitude I think, in past histories, we've seen up to 150 to 2200 barges retired in 1 year. If you think about our digitization being somewhere right now between 80% and 85%, maybe closer to 85%. Your 5% from kind of the high 80s where you need price increases. So 5% of the industry is probably around a little less than 300 barges and maybe 250. And if you get some retirements that, that will get the utilization up without any demand growth. Now we do have demand growth, which I'll come back to in a minute. On the shipyard side, the new construction basically it's nonexistent. There may be a handful of barges, as you heard Andy's prepared comments, we shifted some barges that we're going to deliver this year into next year. So I think it's probably a handful of barges to get built next year, maybe 2 handfuls. But so from a surprise standpoint, it looks pretty good. On the demand standpoint, we still have pretty good market outside of crude oil. If you look at chemicals, everybody knows that chemicals continue to increase, albeit, at the construction of all the new plant is probably a bigger impact in 2018 because those projects tend to flip to the right, as you know. But in refined products, black oil, all those, the macroeconomic trends are fairly positive. YOu can look at vehicle miles driven. They continue to grow albeit at a slower pace your of fleet. But the general demand picture is pretty good. So I think demand will also require some more barges. I think utilization in the industry is maybe a little low because we've had some inventory disruptions and some bloated inventories and frankly, we've had really good weather. You can look at the delayed days and see that. They're very, very much lower than normal. So from a soup why demand standpoint, I think, things should come into balance in 2017. And that will drive pricing. These spot contracts are pretty brutal right now. And frankly, they aren't sustainably low. Now with respect to earnings, I mean, you've heard us say this before. We have contracts that rollover kind of ratably through the year. And as they roll over at lower prices, that has a full year effect after -- in the next year. So that will be an impact as all -- as the contracts essentially renewed lower this year. There will be a full year effect next year. I think that's not a surprise to anybody but it's just a matter of math. I don't know if that answered your question but [indiscernible] this one."

I think there's about 14 new units that will be delivered in the next 18 months-or-so. Brand-new ADB barge units coming into the market. And there are probably around 40 older barges that are at retirement age or be actually probably been extended longer than they should that didn't to come out of the market. But as you know, you work older tonnage as long as you can until you can't. So there has to be a little pain to drive that older tonnage out. I think, it's starting to happen. I think it will happen and may take a couple of years to play out as that access -- access the do you equipments absorbed in the older tonnage comes out. We have seen because of the axis come been that customers are not too worried about having of the in a bit the. So there's been a drift towards taking chance in the spot market. Clearly, the spot market is more difficult for us. You get periods of lower utilization because of it repositioning barges, it's on our nickel in that case. So it's a bit painful. You see that you saw our brand is comes in our margins there work but I think, the longer term, it will come back into balance because of that old tonnage has to come out and will come out as you come into the shipyard. And, as you know, the shipyards for these coastal units are very much more expensive than the inland one. So there's a natural tension that should encourage retirement."

So my question is trying to get visibility about impact of utilization levels next year of that which clearly that habit of always out what I would imagine you guys are having conversations at this point with some of your petrochemical customers about some of the other barge needs are for next year. So based on those conversation and obviously without getting specific can you help us frame we should expect a decision level evolve next year if you're heading into 2017 in the mid-80% range, how we should expect utilization levels to evolve and what type of levels we could possibly hit next year?"

I think a big part of the utilization drop off we've seen in the third quarter has been temporary in nature. One, as we said, the delayed days are very low with good weather, dock delays have been down considerably. The number of locks and dams that were under repair and slowing things down was minimal. So that temporary type utilization will come back, and we're going to have that whether in the fourth quarter. We always do. We've had some refinery inventory issues. I think that's self-correcting now. We're in the refinery maintenance season. So inventory are kind the right size and things will get back into a more normal flow of things. So some of those temporary utilization things will come back. It's maybe into the fourth quarter and to early part of '17. I think, the longer-term utilization will come, as we talked about earlier, the supply coming out and no new supply coming in the retirement. And then I think, you get towards the end of '17 and early '18 before you start to see the chemical buildout and start out of plans having an impact. We are in discussions with many of our customers about their needs there it's still that way us out but it's going to start probably towards the end of '17. I wouldn't hazard a guess to the actual number of the barges as a percent utilization. We do know -- look, if it's in the ethylene plant, as a nascent driven activated time to go into port after that, we'll there's not a lot of barge moves. But if it goes from ethane to ethylene and then to some downstream derivatives, whether it's glycol or BBC or whatnot, there can be a significant number of barges. A lot of that still being held closely to the best day of our customers, for trade secret reasons. We're getting a field for it, some are very abundant and orders are pretty quiet about it. But again, I think, that's late '17 and the bulk of the ethylene startups will be in '18."

I would think that, that wouldn't happen in a vacuum. I would think that some of that equipment is coming back to work. Rig count is picking back up then at some point one would expect the transmittal additional volumes like the barge. The exact am I thinking Greg? It seems like it's kind of fun saying that if the equipment comp sort it to me the rental barge so how should we think about what has not obviously a negative downdraft on Bullets over the last couple of years maybe starting to actually not hurt anymore but maybe starting to help at some point in '17 or '18."

If it helps that, that it up, that would be great. I mean we saw what you they did in 2012 to 2014. But then that overhang is what we're dealing with now. I would say this, the number of barges moving crude right now is roughly the same as it was last quarter, right around 140 barges so it seems to have stabilized. But long-term trend is crude should be moved in a pipeline I think, part of the problem with fuel pipelines coming on is they're going want to 20-year offtake agreements. So there is that an area where you could see some of barge volume comeback. It's not something that we're betting on now."

I think you mentioned 2017 being potential inflection point and saying some of the older capacity come out to the market and helping you define balance in terms of pricing. I guess my question is to what degree of confidence do you have in 2017 being that period. If we look across most of the marine spaces and even host code we still see 45-year-old ATBs are trading in the market that have gone 2 or 3 cycles.

It's really easy to take out 10,000-barrel barge. It's lower capital account. It's easier to find support or to cut them up and sell them for scrap. Your point is taking on the ATBs, these are bigger units, there's a higher capital base and if you can keep them working in their long in the tooth, they're fully depreciated. It's a pretty good deal terms of that has to be paid for them in order to take them out. And that's why I said in the coastal side, it could take a couple of years for that to layout us of those 14 new ones come in and the 40 come out. Now on the inland side, as you have seen, we often just in the last since our last call from plant retirants and inland of 39 to 54 this year alone. So yes, it's a pretty direct economic question took to the operator and you can rationalize pretty quick. So I think you'll see pretty hefty retirements in the inland side."

Yesterday afternoon, we announced third quarter earnings of $0.59 per share versus our guidance range of $0.50 to $0.65 per share. That compares to $1.04 per share reported for the 2015 third quarter. 
Inland marine tank barge utilization during this quarter was in the low to mid-80% range. The weaker levels of utilization, at first, materialized in July, which we discussed on last quarter's call, persisted throughout the third quarter, with some incremental improvement due to weather and some modest volume increases driven by a series of customer supply change disruptions occurred. Pricing remains at depressed levels. 
In the coastal market, barge utilization was also in the low to mid-80% range. Utilization continues to be impacted by the amount of equipment trading in the stock market, which adds some idle time exposure. Our outlook for this market remains cautious as the industry fleet contends with additional supply that's coming online over the next year and as it rationalizes older, less commercially viable equipment. 
In our land-based diesel engine service business, service activity levels have improved in the remanufacturing area, and we think this new level of activity is providing a signal for market improvement next year. However, currently, demand for parts and components remains depressed. With low port volumes, we were not yet able to cover all our fixed costs, that we have reduced the loss run rate from earlier this year. 
We have also not received any orders for new pressure pumping equipment, although we are beginning to have inquiries. The market recovery is still in its infancy, but we believe that it has begun. 
In our marine and power generation diesel engine business, the oil service market along the Gulf of Mexico remains depressed as customers continue to defer maintenance. We did see business improvements in the Midwest and in our power generation market. 
In summary, as our guidance implies, the fourth quarter will be another challenging quarter for Kirby. It is, however, encouraging that there are some signs of stability in the marine transportation market and across our diesel engine service markets. Frankly, it's hard to see how pricing in the inland market could get much worse. 
In the case of our land-based diesel engine business, an upturn in service activity has caused us to begin to add employees to meet the demand for remanufacturing frac spreads. 
In our marine diesel engine market, the markets we service may not get much better soon, but they're also not going to get much worse. 
And finally, in our coastal marine transportation business, we continue to look for opportunities to take out costs and improve operating efficiencies as the market adjusts to the additional tonnage and lower crude oil volumes. 
I'll now turn the call over to David."

I'll begin today with a summary of quarterly results in each of our markets, then turn the call over to Andy to walk through the financials. Following Andy's remarks, I'll address our guidance range before turning the call over to question-and-answers. 
In the inland transportation market, our utilization was in the low to mid-80% range during the quarter. The relatively sharp drop in utilization that we first experienced in July continued through most of the third quarter, with some periods of better utilization when weather conditions were less favorable and for a brief period during product supply disruptions, including the brief outage that occurred on a portion of the Colonial Pipeline. In response to the lower utilization, we reduced our average towboat count by approximately 6% in the third quarter. 
For the industry overall, weak utilization increases the likelihood that we will see a more rapid number of retirements and a decline in new equipment construction across the industry. This will facilitate an overall rebalancing in the market. Additionally, many of the temporary factors contributing to weak utilization are likely to subside over the next few months. 
Moving on to pricing. Pricing on term contracts that renewed during the third quarter was down on a mid- to high single digits. Spot rates fell sequentially, and we're at or below term contract rates during the quarter. However, spot rates have flattened out particularly towards the end of the quarter and has remained flat into the first part of the fourth quarter. 
Operating conditions during the quarter were seasonally normal. However, it's worth noting that historical levels of flooding in Louisiana drove a brief period of operating disruptions along the Gulf Coast. The impact from the flooding to our operations was minimal. 
In our coastal marine transportation sector, demand for the coastwise transportation of black oil and petrochemicals was relatively stable, while refine products demand was weaker due primarily to weak demand in the Northeast despite a very brief improvement during the Colonial Pipeline outage. 
Coastal tank barge utilization continued to decline, primarily due to the ongoing trend of equipment moving off of term contracts to trade in the spot market. Utilization was in the low to mid-80% range during the quarter. 
Coastal market operations were briefly interrupted along the Gulf Coast and East Coast due to disruptions from Hurricane Hermine. With respect to coastal market pricing, term contracts that renewed during the third quarter increased very slightly low single digits. However, it was only a very few older contracts that renewed in the quarter. Spot pricing did fall below contract pricing during the quarter. 
In our diesel engine services segment, as has been the case all year, in our marine diesel engine business, the Gulf of Mexico oil services market remained at historically depressed levels. We also continued to experience major maintenance deferrals by our customers in many regions of the country. The Midwest marine market was an exception as maintenance demand improved there. Additionally, demand in the power generation market was strong during the quarter. 
In our land-based diesel engine services market, the sale of engines, transmissions and parts in our distribution business remained at very low levels. Likewise, we have not had orders to manufacture new pressure pumping units. However, we did see a material increase in order activity for pressure pumping service and remanufacturing. 
Before I turn the call over to Andy, let me briefly address an incident involving a Kirby vessel that occurred earlier this month. On October 13, the tugboat Nathan E. Stewart was pushing the DBL 55, an empty 55,000-barrel ATB, and it went aground on the inside passage on the West Coast of Canada. The towboat is submerged, and some of her fuel tanks were compromised. We have responded to the fuel spill. The cleanup is essentially complete. And we are commencing the salvage operation on the tug now. This incident is very unfortunate, but it is insured and we expect only to incur the incident deductible. 
I'll now turn the call over to Andy to provide some detailed financial information before I finish with a discussion on the outlook."

In the 2016 third quarter, marine transportation segment revenue declined $59 million or 14%, and operating income declined $38 million or 41% as compared with the 2015 third quarter. Decline in revenue in the third quarter as compared to the prior year quarter was primarily due to lower inland marine pricing and utilization, lower coastal marine utilization and a 17% decline in diesel fuel prices. The decline in operating income was driven by the same factors, partially offset by a reduction in inland towboats and savings from a reduction in force earlier in the year. The marine transportation segment's operating margin was 15.4% compared with 22.4% for the 2015 third quarter. 
The inland sector contributed approximately 2/3 of marine transportation revenue during the 2016 third quarter. Long-term inland marine transportation contracts, those contracts with a term of 1 year or longer in duration, contributed approximately 80% of revenue, with 52% attributable to time charters and 48% from affreightment contracts. The inland sector generated an operating margin in the high teens for the quarter. 
In the coastal sector, the trend of customers electing to source coastal equipment from the spot market over renewing existing contracts continued. However, the percentage of coastal revenue under term contracts was consistent with the first 9 months of the year at approximately 78% as a result of lower utilization in revenue for spot equipment. The third quarter operating margin for the coastal sector was in the high single digits. 
Turning now to our marine construction and retirement plans. During the 2016 first 9 months, we received 27 barges from the acquisition of SEACOR inland tank barge fleet, took delivery of 3 newbuild barges, transferred 130,000-barrel barge from coastal service to inland service and retired or returned to charterers a total of 48 barges. The net result was a decrease of 17 tank barges in our inland tank barge fleet for a total reduction of approximately 21,000 barrels of capacity. In the fourth quarter, we expect to take delivery of 2 30,000-barrel inland tank barges, with 2 additional 30,000-barrel tank barge deliveries shifting into 2017. Also in the fourth quarter, we expect to retire or return to charterers an additional 6 barges with 77,000 barrels of capacity. On a net basis, we expect to end 2016 with 877 barges with approximately 17.9 million barrels of capacity or roughly the same level we finished the third quarter and down slightly from our barrel capacity at the end of 2015. 
In the coastwise transportation sector, during the third quarter, we retired a small 9,000-barrel harbor barge and ended the quarter with approximately 6 million barrels of capacity. In the fourth quarter, we expect to take delivery of the first of 2 new 155,000-barrel ATBs, with the second 155,000-barrel ATB and the coastal chemical barge both expected to be completed in early to mid-2017. 
Moving on to our diesel engine services segment. Revenue for the 2016 third quarter declined 34% from the 2015 third quarter, and operating income declined 17%. The segment's operating margin was 6.1% compared with 4.9% for the 2015 third quarter. The marine and power generation operations contributed approximately 46% of the diesel engine services revenue in the third quarter, with an operating margin in the mid-teens. Our land-based operations contributed approximately 54% of the diesel engine services segment's revenue in the third quarter, with a modest operating loss. 
On the corporate side of things, our 2016 capital spending guidance remains in a range of $230 million to $250 million, including approximately $10 million for the construction of 7 inland tank barges, 5 of which are to be delivered in 2016; approximately $100 million in progress payments on new coastal equipment under construction, including our new coastal ATBs, 2 4,900-horsepower coastal tugboats and a new coastal petrochemical tank barge. The balance of $120 million to $140 million is primarily for capital upgrades and improvements to existing facilities and equipment. 
In addition to our capital spending guidance, during the first half of 2016, we spent $85.5 million on the acquisition of the SEACOR inland tank barge fleet, $13.6 million to acquire a leased coastal barge from the lessor and $26.5 million to purchase 4 coastal tugboats. Total debt as of September 30, 2016, was $726 million, a $49 million decrease from December 31, 2015. Our debt-to-cap ratio at September 30 was 23.3%, a 2.1-point decline from December 31, 2015. And as of today, our debt stands at $740 million. 
I'll now turn the call back over to David."

In our press release, we announced our 2016 fourth quarter guidance of $0.45 to $0.60 per share, which translates to a narrower full year 2016 guidance range of $2.47 a share to $2.62 a share. In the inland marine transportation business,",526,"Thank you, Andy. In our press release, we announced our 2016 fourth quarter guidance of $0.45 to $0.60 per share, which translates to a narrower full year 2016 guidance range of $2.47 a share to $2.62 a share. In the inland marine transportation business, we expect utilization in the low to mid-80% range at the low end of our guidance range and mid to high-80% range at the high end. 
During the quarter, we saw very few delays throughout the system and also a delay in refinery -- a decline in refinery operating rates. However, we did experience some short periods of tank barge utilization improvement from weather events and customer supply disruptions. We think that provides some support for our view that some of the utilization decline since July is temporary. However, we have yet to see any consistent utilization strengths. Although we are seeing spot market pricing that has flattened out, spot rates are no longer declining, and we believe they are at levels that are at or below cash breakeven for much of the market. Frankly, these rates are unsustainable and will go up. 
In the coastal market, on the low end, our guidance range contemplates utilization in the low 80% range. On the high end of guidance, we are expecting flat pricing on contract renewals and utilization in the mid-80% range. Additionally, Hurricane Matthew impacted our operations for 2 weeks in October and caused us to shut down operations for a short period of time along the Eastern Seaboard. This hurricane is expected to have only a modest fourth quarter earnings impact on our coastal results. 
For our diesel engine services segment in our land-based sector, we expect to incur a small operating loss for the fourth quarter at the midpoint of our guidance range and to breakeven in the land-based market at the high end of our guidance range. This market continues to improve, and service volumes continue to grow with some new inquiries for new equipment. 
In our marine diesel markets, we do not expect any improvement in the Gulf of Mexico oil service market this year. In the power generation market and in our other marine diesel engine services market, we expect fourth quarter results to reflect a normal quarter-over-quarter seasonal decline, which generally leads to an operating margin in the low double digits. 
In closing, we entered the last quarter of the year with a strong financial position. Despite the market challenges that we are dealing with and the investments we have made in upgrading and expanding both our inland and coastal fleet, Kirby's debt-to-capital ratio is the lowest it has been in 2 years. While the exact timing of recoveries in our markets is still unclear, we do believe the inland market will come into supply and demand balance sometime in 2017 and pricing will inflect. Also, we believe the land-based diesel business has bottomed and will begin to recover in 2017. Finally, we have the financial strength to not only weather the cycles but to grow and improve our market position throughout them. 
Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take questions."

To the extent that you can, can you just lay out a little bit how you're looking at the supply-demand balance for next year? Like how many barges are on order relative to typical years?

And what you see in that environment is companies start to accelerate their retirement. They look at some of their older equipment and it's coming up for a shipyard and they say, ""Goodness, there's no way we're going to spend the cash to extend that life for another 5-year period."" So they begin to retire it. And we're starting to see some aggressive retirement. I think the last time we talked, we were talking about Kirby's retirements around 39 barges this year. I think we'll probably end up with about 54 retired this year. So we're retiring more barges. The industry is retiring more barges. And it's just a matter of good economic discipline and stewardship. Some of our competitors don't have the economic wherewithal to actually make the investment to extend the lives, so they're almost forced to retire. So we think we'll see a good number of retirements this year, and that's happening now and it should carry into next year. I think the order of magnitude, I think, in past histories, we've seen up to 150 to 200 barges retired in any 1 year. If you think about our utilization being somewhere right now between 80% and 85%, maybe closer to 85%. You're 5% from kind of the high 80s where you need price increases. So 5% of the industry is probably around a little less than 300 barges and maybe 250. And if you get some retirements, that will get the utilization up without any demand growth. Now we do have demand growth, which I'll come back to in a minute. On the shipyard side, the new construction, basically, it's nonexistent. There may be a handful of barges. As you heard Andy's prepared comments, we shifted some barges that we're going to deliver this year into next year. So I think it's probably a handful of barges that get built next year, maybe 2 handfuls. But -- so from a supply standpoint, it looks pretty good. On a demand standpoint, we still have pretty good market outside of crude oil. If you look at chemicals, everybody knows, the chemicals continue to increase, albeit the construction of all the new plant is probably a bigger impact in 2018 because those projects tend to flip to the right, as you know. But then in refined products, black oil, all those, the macroeconomic trends are fairly positive. You can look at vehicle miles driven. They continue to grow, albeit at a slower pace of late. But the general demand picture is pretty good. So I think demand will also require some more barges. I think utilization in the industry is maybe a little low because we've had some inventory disruptions and some bloated inventories. And frankly, we've had really good weather. You can look at our delayed days and see that. They're very, very much lower than normal. So from a supply-demand standpoint, I think things should come into balance in 2017, and that will drive pricing. These spot contracts are pretty brutal right now, and frankly, they run sustainably low. Now with respect to earnings, I mean, you've heard us say this before. We have contracts that roll over kind of ratably through the year. And as they roll over in -- at lower prices, that has a full year effect in the next year. So that will be an impact as all -- as the contracts have essentially renewed lower this year, that there will be a full year effect next year. I don't think that's a surprise to anybody but it's just a matter of math. I don't know if that answered your question but -- on this one."

I think there's about 14 new units that will be delivered in the next 18 months or so, brand-new ATB barge units coming into the market. And there are probably around 40 older barges that are at retirement age or be -- actually probably have been extended longer than they should that need to come out of the market. But as you know, you'll work older tonnage as long as you can until you can't. So there has to be a little pain to drive that older tonnage out. I think that's starting to happen. I think it will happen and may take a couple of years to play out as that excess is -- the excess or the new equipment is absorbed and the older tonnage comes out. We've seen, because of the excess coming in, that customers are not too worried about having availability. So there's been a drift towards taking a chance in the spot market. Clearly, the spot market is more difficult for us. You get periods of lower utilization because of it repositioning barges is on our nickel in that case. And so it's a bit painful. You see that. You saw our -- Andy's comments on our margins there. But I think longer term, it will come back into balance because that old tonnage has to come out and will come out as you come into a shipyard. As you know, the shipyards for these coastal units are very much more expensive than the inland one. So there's a natural tension that should encourage retirement."

Our customers and the number of remands that we have in the shop for service are growing every day. It's a bigger number.

And they say, ""Okay, bring it in."" And let's say, ""Let's just get it running."" And by the way, if you have any major components that need to be replaced or some parts that need to be replaced, please use our inventory first or they demand that we use their inventory first. They have extra spares and stuff. So even though we're getting an increasing amount of remands, the parts and rebuild componentry that goes with normal remands is still developing as our customers work off their own inventories first. But every day, we're getting closer to working that off, and I think you'll start to see us get parts and major component flow through, which will add to our ability to absorb fixed cost and be above breakeven. We're getting closer every day, and the signs are very encouraging from what we're seeing. Our customers are coming to us with very large fleets, trying to get them back into service. They are, of course, still coming out of the bottom, so they're trying to minimize their spend at this point. We're working with our customers to help them do that, get their service going and build a long-term supply chain maintenance partnership. And that's happening very, very well.

So as you saw margins fall in the inland side, they don't fall necessarily sort of dollar for dollar with the fall in utility -- the revenue impact of the fall in utility. On the coastwise side, as you see pieces of equipment move from term contract to spot business, where they are less well utilized, that utility -- because, generally, you're talking about 1 piece of horsepower to 1 barge, that utility kind of falls pretty dramatically to the bottom line.

But I would imagine you guys are having conversations at this point with some of your petrochemical customers about what some of their barge needs are for next year. So based on those conversations, and, obviously, without getting too specific, can you help us frame how we should expect utilization levels to evolve next year? If you're heading into 2017 in the mid-80% range, how we should expect utilization levels to evolve and what maybe type of levels we could possibly hit next year."

One, as we said, the delay days are very low with good weather. Dock delays have been down considerably. The number of locks and dams that were under repair and slowing things down was minimal. So that temporary-type utilization will come back, and we're going to have bad weather in the fourth quarter. We always do. We've had some refinery inventory issues. I think that's self-correcting now. We're in the refinery maintenance season. So inventories are going to kind of rightsize, and things will get back into a more normal flow of things. So some of those temporary utilization things will come back. It's maybe into the fourth quarter and into the early part of '17. I think the longer-term utilization growth will come as, as we talked about earlier, the supply coming out and no new supply coming in the retirement. And then I think you get towards the end of '17 and early '18 before you start to see the chemical build-out and start-up of plants having an impact. We're in discussions with many of our customers about their needs. It's still a ways out, but it's going to start probably towards the end of '17. I wouldn't hazard a guess to the actual number of barges as a percent utilization. We do know -- look, if it's an ethane plant -- ethane-driven -- ethylene plant going to polyethylene, we know there's not a lot of barge moves. But if it goes from ethane to ethylene and then to some downstream derivatives, whether it's glycols or EDC or whatnot, there can be a significant number of barges. A lot of that still being held closely to the best by our customers for trade secret reasons. We're getting a feel for it. Some of them are talking to us. Others are pretty quiet about it. But again, I think that's late '17. And the bulk of the new ethylene start-ups will be in '18."

In one of the earlier questions when you were talking about your engine diesel services and even in your commentary when you talked about seeing the material increase in pressure pumping remanufacturing and service, I would think that, that wouldn't happen in a vacuum. I would think that some of that equipment is coming back to work. Rig count is picking back up. Then at some point, one would expect that the translate into additional volumes making the round [ph] to a barge. Is that thinking correct? I mean, it seems like it's kind of a thing that if some of the equipment comes back to work, it should make its way into a barge. So how should we think about what has been obviously a negative downdraft on barge volumes over the last couple of years maybe starting to actually not hurt anymore but maybe starting to help at some point in '17 or '18?"

I do think what we are seeing now portends that you'll see more crude volumes coming out of the shale plays. We know that's going to happen. But ultimately, it'll end up in a pipeline. We could get some demand from the shale plays if things continue to improve, but it's not something that we think is -- should be bet -- we wouldn't bet a bunch of equipment on. If it helps tighten it up, that would be great. I mean, we saw what it did 2012 to 2014, but then that overhang is what we're dealing with now. I would say this, the number of barges moving crude right now is roughly the same as it was last quarter, right around 140 barges. So it seems to have stabilized. But the long-term trend is crude should be moved in a pipeline. I think part of the problem with new pipelines coming on is they're going to want 20-year offtake agreements. So there is a scenario where you could see some barge volume come back. It's not something that we're betting on now."

I guess my question is, what degree of confidence do you have in 2017 being that period? If we look across most of the marine spaces and even maybe kind of even coastal as a comp, we still see 45-year-old ATBs that are trading in a market that have gone through 2 or 3 cycles. So it tends to -- it seems like it tends to take a bit longer than kind of a 12-month rationalization period.

It's pretty easy to take out a 10,000-barrel barge. It's a lower capital amount. It's easier to tie them up or to cut them up and sell them for scrap. Your point is taking on the ATBs. These are bigger units. There's a high capital base. And if you can keep them working and they're long in the tooth, they're fully depreciated, it's a pretty good deal. So it has to be painful in order to take them out. And that's why I said on the coastal side, they could take a couple of years for that to play out as those 14 new ones come in and the 40 come out. Now on the inland side, as you've seen, we upped just in the last -- since our last call from planned retirements in inland of 39 to 54 this year alone. So yes, it's a pretty direct economic question to any operator, and they -- it can rationalize pretty quick. So I think you'll see pretty hefty retirements in the inland side."

Yesterday afternoon, we announced third quarter earnings of $0.59 per share versus our guidance range of $0.50 to $0.65 per share. That compares to $1.04 per share reported for the 2015 third quarter. 
Inland marine tank barge utilization during this quarter was in the low to mid-80% range. The weaker levels of utilization, at first, materialized in July, which we discussed on last quarter's call, persisted throughout the third quarter, with some incremental improvement due to weather and some modest volume increases driven by a series of customer supply change disruptions occurred. Pricing remains at depressed levels. 
In the coastal market, barge utilization was also in the low to mid-80% range. Utilization continues to be impacted by the amount of equipment trading in the stock market, which adds some idle time exposure. Our outlook for this market remains cautious as the industry fleet contends with additional supply that's coming online over the next year and as it rationalizes older, less commercially viable equipment. 
In our land-based diesel engine service business, service activity levels have improved in the remanufacturing area, and we think this new level of activity is providing a signal for market improvement next year. However, currently, demand for parts and components remains depressed. With low port volumes, we were not yet able to cover all our fixed costs, that we have reduced the loss run rate from earlier this year. 
We have also not received any orders for new pressure pumping equipment, although we are beginning to have inquiries. The market recovery is still in its infancy, but we believe that it has begun. 
In our marine and power generation diesel engine business, the oil service market along the Gulf of Mexico remains depressed as customers continue to defer maintenance. We did see business improvements in the Midwest and in our power generation market. 
In summary, as our guidance implies, the fourth quarter will be another challenging quarter for Kirby. It is, however, encouraging that there are some signs of stability in the marine transportation market and across our diesel engine service markets. Frankly, it's hard to see how pricing in the inland market could get much worse. 
In the case of our land-based diesel engine business, an upturn in service activity has caused us to begin to add employees to meet the demand for remanufacturing frac spreads. 
In our marine diesel engine market, the markets we service may not get much better soon, but they're also not going to get much worse. 
And finally, in our coastal marine transportation business, we continue to look for opportunities to take out costs and improve operating efficiencies as the market adjusts to the additional tonnage and lower crude oil volumes. 
I'll now turn the call over to David."

I'll begin today with a summary of quarterly results in each of our markets, then turn the call over to Andy to walk through the financials. Following Andy's remarks, I'll address our guidance range before turning the call over to question-and-answers. 
In the inland transportation market, our utilization was in the low to mid-80% range during the quarter. The relatively sharp drop in utilization that we first experienced in July continued through most of the third quarter, with some periods of better utilization when weather conditions were less favorable and for a brief period during product supply disruptions, including the brief outage that occurred on a portion of the Colonial Pipeline. In response to the lower utilization, we reduced our average towboat count by approximately 6% in the third quarter. 
For the industry overall, weak utilization increases the likelihood that we will see a more rapid number of retirements and a decline in new equipment construction across the industry. This will facilitate an overall rebalancing in the market. Additionally, many of the temporary factors contributing to weak utilization are likely to subside over the next few months. 
Moving on to pricing. Pricing on term contracts that renewed during the third quarter was down on a mid- to high single digits. Spot rates fell sequentially, and were at or below term contract rates during the quarter. However, spot rates have flattened out particularly towards the end of the quarter and has remained flat into the first part of the fourth quarter. 
Operating conditions during the quarter were seasonally normal. However, it's worth noting that historical levels of flooding in Louisiana drove a brief period of operating disruptions along the Gulf Coast. The impact from the flooding to our operations was minimal. 
In our coastal marine transportation sector, demand for the coastwise transportation of black oil and petrochemicals was relatively stable, while refine products demand was weaker due primarily to weak demand in the Northeast despite a very brief improvement during the Colonial Pipeline outage. 
Coastal tank barge utilization continued to decline, primarily due to the ongoing trend of equipment moving off of term contracts to trade in the spot market. Utilization was in the low to mid-80% range during the quarter. 
Coastal market operations were briefly interrupted along the Gulf Coast and East Coast due to disruptions from Hurricane Hermine. With respect to coastal market pricing, term contracts that renewed during the third quarter increased very slightly low single digits. However, it was only a very few older contracts that renewed in the quarter. Spot pricing did fall below contract pricing during the quarter. 
In our diesel engine services segment, as has been the case all year, in our marine diesel engine business, the Gulf of Mexico oil services market remained at historically depressed levels. We also continued to experience major maintenance deferrals by our customers in many regions of the country. The Midwest marine market was an exception as maintenance demand improved there. Additionally, demand in the power generation market was strong during the quarter. 
In our land-based diesel engine services market, the sale of engines, transmissions and parts in our distribution business remained at very low levels. Likewise, we have not had orders to manufacture new pressure pumping units. However, we did see a material increase in order activity for pressure pumping service and remanufacturing. 
Before I turn the call over to Andy, let me briefly address an incident involving a Kirby vessel that occurred earlier this month. On October 13, the tugboat Nathan E. Stewart was pushing the DBL 55, an empty 55,000-barrel ATB, and it went aground on the inside passage on the West Coast of Canada. The tugboat is submerged, and some of her fuel tanks were compromised. We have responded to the fuel spill. The cleanup is essentially complete. And we are commencing the salvage operation on the tug now. This incident is very unfortunate, but it is insured and we expect only to incur the incident deductible. 
I'll now turn the call over to Andy to provide some detailed financial information before I finish with a discussion on the outlook."

Decline in revenue in the third qua",757,"Thank you, David, and good morning. In the 2016 third quarter, marine transportation segment revenue declined $59 million or 14%, and operating income declined $38 million or 41% as compared with the 2015 third quarter. Decline in revenue in the third quarter as compared to the prior year quarter was primarily due to lower inland marine pricing and utilization, lower coastal marine utilization and a 17% decline in diesel fuel prices. The decline in operating income was driven by the same factors, partially offset by a reduction in inland towboats and savings from a reduction in force earlier in the year. The marine transportation segment's operating margin was 15.4% compared with 22.4% for the 2015 third quarter. 
The inland sector contributed approximately 2/3 of marine transportation revenue during the 2016 third quarter. Long-term inland marine transportation contracts, those contracts with a term of 1 year or longer in duration, contributed approximately 80% of revenue, with 52% attributable to time charters and 48% from affreightment contracts. The inland sector generated an operating margin in the high teens for the quarter. 
In the coastal sector, the trend of customers electing to source coastal equipment from the spot market over renewing existing contracts continued. However, the percentage of coastal revenue under term contracts was consistent with the first 9 months of the year at approximately 78% as a result of lower utilization in revenue for spot equipment. The third quarter operating margin for the coastal sector was in the high single digits. 
Turning now to our marine construction and retirement plans. During the 2016 first 9 months, we received 27 barges from the acquisition of SEACOR's inland tank barge fleet, took delivery of 3 newbuild barges, transferred 1 30,000-barrel barge from coastal service to inland service and retired or returned to charterers a total of 48 barges. The net result was a decrease of 17 tank barges in our inland tank barge fleet for a total reduction of approximately 21,000 barrels of capacity. In the fourth quarter, we expect to take delivery of 2 30,000-barrel inland tank barges, with 2 additional 30,000-barrel tank barge deliveries shifting into 2017. Also in the fourth quarter, we expect to retire or return to charterers an additional 6 barges with 77,000 barrels of capacity. On a net basis, we expect to end 2016 with 877 barges with approximately 17.9 million barrels of capacity or roughly the same level we finished the third quarter and down slightly from our barrel capacity at the end of 2015. 
In the coastwise transportation sector, during the third quarter, we retired a small 9,000-barrel harbor barge and ended the quarter with approximately 6 million barrels of capacity. In the fourth quarter, we expect to take delivery of the first of 2 new 155,000-barrel ATBs, with the second 155,000-barrel ATB and the coastal chemical barge both expected to be completed in early to mid-2017. 
Moving on to our diesel engine services segment. Revenue for the 2016 third quarter declined 34% from the 2015 third quarter, and operating income declined 17%. The segment's operating margin was 6.1% compared with 4.9% for the 2015 third quarter. The marine and power generation operations contributed approximately 46% of the diesel engine services revenue in the third quarter, with an operating margin in the mid-teens. Our land-based operations contributed approximately 54% of the diesel engine services segment's revenue in the third quarter, with a modest operating loss. 
On the corporate side of things, our 2016 capital spending guidance remains in a range of $230 million to $250 million, including approximately $10 million for the construction of 7 inland tank barges, 5 of which are to be delivered in 2016; approximately $100 million in progress payments on new coastal equipment under construction, including our new coastal ATBs, 2 4,900-horsepower coastal tugboats and a new coastal petrochemical tank barge. The balance of $120 million to $140 million is primarily for capital upgrades and improvements to existing facilities and equipment. 
In addition to our capital spending guidance, during the first half of 2016, we spent $85.5 million on the acquisition of the SEACOR inland tank barge fleet, $13.6 million to acquire a leased coastal barge from the lessor and $26.5 million to purchase 4 coastal tugboats.

In our press release, we announced our 2016 fourth quarter guidance of $0.45 to $0.60 per share, which translates to a narrower full year 2016 guidance range of $2.47 a share to $2.62 a share. In the inland marine transportation business,",526,"Thank you, Andy. In our press release, we announced our 2016 fourth quarter guidance of $0.45 to $0.60 per share, which translates to a narrower full year 2016 guidance range of $2.47 a share to $2.62 a share. In the inland marine transportation business, we expect utilization in the low to mid-80% range at the low end of our guidance range and mid to high-80% range at the high end. 
During the quarter, we saw very few delays throughout the system and also a delay in refinery -- a decline in refinery operating rates. However, we did experience some short periods of tank barge utilization improvement from weather events and customer supply disruptions. We think that provides some support for our view that some of the utilization decline since July is temporary. However, we have yet to see any consistent utilization strengths. Although we are seeing spot market pricing that has flattened out, spot rates are no longer declining, and we believe they are at levels that are at or below cash breakeven for much of the market. Frankly, these rates are unsustainable and will go up. 
In the coastal market, on the low end, our guidance range contemplates utilization in the low 80% range. On the high end of guidance, we are expecting flat pricing on contract renewals and utilization in the mid-80% range. Additionally, Hurricane Matthew impacted our operations for 2 weeks in October and caused us to shut down operations for a short period of time along the Eastern Seaboard. This hurricane is expected to have only a modest fourth quarter earnings impact on our coastal results. 
For our diesel engine services segment in our land-based sector, we expect to incur a small operating loss for the fourth quarter at the midpoint of our guidance range and to breakeven in the land-based market at the high end of our guidance range. This market continues to improve, and service volumes continue to grow with some new inquiries for new equipment. 
In our marine diesel markets, we do not expect any improvement in the Gulf of Mexico oil service market this year. In the power generation market and in our other marine diesel engine services market, we expect fourth quarter results to reflect a normal quarter-over-quarter seasonal decline, which generally leads to an operating margin in the low double digits. 
In closing, we entered the last quarter of the year with a strong financial position. Despite the market challenges that we are dealing with and the investments we have made in upgrading and expanding both our inland and coastal fleet, Kirby's debt-to-capital ratio is the lowest it has been in 2 years. While the exact timing of recoveries in our markets is still unclear, we do believe the inland market will come into supply and demand balance sometime in 2017 and pricing will inflect. Also, we believe the land-based diesel business has bottomed and will begin to recover in 2017. Finally, we have the financial strength to not only weather the cycles but to grow and improve our market position throughout them. 
Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks. We are now ready to take questions."

To the extent that you can, can you just lay out a little bit how you're looking at the supply-demand balance for next year? Like how many barges are on order relative to typical years? What the outlook is for scrapping? Is demand GDP or GDP plus or minus for any reason? And then also as part of that, can you just explain a little bit how the pricing kind of filters through the P&L? If pricing were to bottom in 1Q, how long does it take to actually filter through all your term contracts and have the final impact on the P&L statement?"

As you know, when spot rates are at or close to break -- cash flow breakeven, it's pretty painful. And what you see in that environment is companies start to accelerate their retirement. They look at some of their olde",640,"Yes, sure. Let me start with supply. As you know, when spot rates are at or close to break -- cash flow breakeven, it's pretty painful. And what you see in that environment is companies start to accelerate their retirement. They look at some of their older equipment and it's coming up for a shipyard and they say, ""Goodness, there's no way we're going to spend the cash to extend that life for another 5-year period."" So they begin to retire it. And we're starting to see some aggressive retirement. I think the last time we talked, we were talking about Kirby's retirements around 39 barges this year. I think we'll probably end up with about 54 retired this year. So we're retiring more barges. The industry is retiring more barges. And it's just a matter of good economic discipline and stewardship. Some of our competitors don't have the economic wherewithal to actually make the investment to extend the lives, so they're almost forced to retire. So we think we'll see a good number of retirements this year, and that's happening now and it should carry into next year. I think the order of magnitude, I think, in past histories, we've seen up to 150 to 200 barges retired in any 1 year. If you think about our utilization being somewhere right now between 80% and 85%, maybe closer to 85%. You're 5% from kind of the high 80s where you need price increases. So 5% of the industry is probably around a little less than 300 barges and maybe 250. And if you get some retirements, that will get the utilization up without any demand growth. Now we do have demand growth, which I'll come back to in a minute. On the shipyard side, the new construction, basically, it's nonexistent. There may be a handful of barges. As you heard Andy's prepared comments, we shifted some barges that we're going to deliver this year into next year. So I think it's probably a handful of barges that get built next year, maybe 2 handfuls. But -- so from a supply standpoint, it looks pretty good. On a demand standpoint, we still have  pretty good market outside of crude oil. If you look at chemicals, everybody knows, the chemicals continue to increase, albeit the construction of all the new plant is probably a bigger impact in 2018 because those projects tend to flip to the right, as you know. But then in refined products, black oil, all those, the macroeconomic trends are fairly positive. You can look at vehicle miles driven. They continue to grow, albeit at a slower pace here of late. But the general demand picture is pretty good. So I think demand will also require some more barges. I think utilization in the industry is maybe a little low because we've had some inventory disruptions and some bloated inventories. And frankly, we've had really good weather. You can look at our delayed days and see that. They're very, very much lower than normal. So from a supply-demand standpoint, I think things should come into balance in 2017, and that will drive pricing. These spot contracts are pretty brutal right now, and frankly, they are unsustainably low. Now with respect to earnings, I mean, you've heard us say this before. We have contracts that roll over kind of ratably through the year. And as they roll over in -- at lower prices, that has a full year effect in the next year. So that will be an impact as all -- as the contracts have essentially renewed lower this year, that there will be a full year effect next year. I don't think that's a surprise to anybody but it's just a matter of math. I don't know if that answered your question but -- on this one."

Well, in the coastal market, as we've been saying, we've got a situation where you've got new tonnage coming in.

Well, in the coastal market, as we've been saying, we've got a situation where you've got new tonnage coming in. I think there's about 14 new units that will be delivered in the next 18 months or so, brand-new ATB barge units coming into the market. And there are probably around 40 older barges that are at retirement age or be -- actually probably have been extended longer than they should that need to come out of the market. But as you know, you'll work older tonnage as long as you can until you can't. So there has to be a little pain to drive that older tonnage out. I think that's starting to happen. I think it will happen and that may take a couple of years to play out as that excess is -- the excess or the new equipment is absorbed and the older tonnage comes out. We've seen, because of the excess coming in, that customers are not too worried about having availability. So there's been a drift towards taking a chance in the spot market. Clearly, the spot market is more difficult for us. You get periods of lower utilization because of it repositioning barges is on our nickel in that case. And so it's a bit painful. You see that. You saw our -- Andy's comments on our margins there. But I think longer term, it will come back into balance because that old tonnage has to come out and will come out as you come into a shipyard. As you know, the shipyards for these coastal units are very much more expensive than the inland one. So there's a natural tension that should encourage retirement."

Our customers and the number of remands that we have in the shop for service are growing every day. It's a bigger number.

And by the way, if you have any major components that need to be replaced or some parts that need to be replaced, please use our inventory first or they demand that we use their inventory first. They have extra spares and stuff. So even though we're getting an increasing amount of remands, the parts and rebuild componentry that goes with normal remands is still developing as our customers work off their own inventories first. But every day, we're getting closer to working that off, and I think you'll start to see us get parts and major component flow through, which will add to our ability to absorb fixed cost and be above breakeven. We're getting closer every day, and the signs are very encouraging from what we're seeing. Our customers are coming to us with very large fleets, trying to get them back into service.

So as you saw margins fall in the inland side, they don't fall necessarily sort of dollar for dollar with the fall in utility -- the revenue impact of the fall in utility. On the coastwise side, as you see pieces of equipment move from term contract to spot business, where they are less well utilized, that utility -- because, generally, you're talking about 1 piece of horsepower to 1 barge, that utility kind of falls pretty dramatically to the bottom line.

And, David, on your commentary, you gave very good guidance and visibility as far as where current utilization levels are and why you expect them to increase into the mid-80% range heading into next year. And clearly, there's a lot of debate about the timing of the petchem ramp-up next year, the order of magnitude of how much of that stuff makes its way into barge. So my question is trying to get visibility about the impact on utilization levels next year. Of that, which clearly that's a bit of a ways out, but I would imagine you guys are having conversations at this point with some of your petrochemical customers about what some of their barge needs are for next year. So based on those conversations, and, obviously, without getting too specific, can you help us frame how we should expect utilization levels to evolve next year? If you're heading into 2017 in the mid-80% range, how we should expect utilization levels to evolve and what maybe type of levels we could possibly hit next year."

One, as we said, the delay days are very low with good weather. Dock delays have been down considerably. The number of locks and dams that were under repair and slowing things down was minimal. So that temporary-type utilization will come back, and we're going to have bad weather in the fourth quarter. We always do. We've had some refinery inventory issues. I think that's self-correcting now. We're in the refinery maintenance season. So inventories are going to kind of rightsize, and things will get back into a more normal flow of things. So some of those temporary utilization things will come back. It's maybe into the fourth quarter and into the early part of '17. I think the longer-term utilization growth will come as, as we talked about earlier, the supply coming out and no new supply coming in the retirement. And then I think you get towards the end of '17 and early '18 before you start to see the chemical build-out and start-up of plants having an impact. We're in discussions with many of our customers about their needs. It's still a ways out, but it's going to start probably towards the end of '17. I wouldn't hazard a guess to the actual number of barges as a percent utilization. We do know -- look, if it's an ethane plant -- ethane-driven -- ethylene plant going to polyethylene, we know there's not a lot of barge moves. But if it goes from ethane to ethylene and then to some downstream derivatives, whether it's glycols or EDC or whatnot, there can be a significant number of barges. A lot of that's still being held closely to the best by our customers for trade secret reasons. We're getting a feel for it. Some of them are talking to us. Others are pretty quiet about it. But again, I think that's late '17. And the bulk of the new ethylene start-ups will be in '18."

That's very helpful, David. And then my follow-up question. In one of the earlier questions when you were talking about your engine diesel services and even in your commentary when you talked about seeing the material increase in pressure pumping remanufacturing and service, I would think that, that wouldn't happen in a vacuum. I would think that some of that equipment is coming back to work. Rig count is picking back up. Then at some point, one would expect that the translate into additional volumes making their way on to a barge. Is that thinking correct? I mean, it seems like it's kind of a thing that if some of the equipment comes back to work, it should make its way on to a barge. So how should we think about what has been obviously a negative downdraft on barge volumes over the last couple of years maybe starting to actually not hurt anymore but maybe starting to help at some point in '17 or '18?"

I do think what we are seeing now portends that you'll see more crude volumes coming out of the shale plays. We know that's going to happen. But ultimately, it'll end up in a pipeline. We could get some demand from the shale plays if things continue to improve, but it's not something that we think is -- should be bet -- we wouldn't bet a bunch of equipment on. If it helps tighten it up, that would be great. I mean, we saw what it did 2012 to 2014, but then that overhang is what we're dealing with now. I would say this, the number of barges moving crude right now is roughly the same as it was last quarter, right around 140 barges. So it seems to have stabilized. But the long-term trend is crude should be moved in a pipeline. I think part of the problem with new pipelines coming on is they're going to want 20-year offtake agreements. So there is a scenario where you could see some barge volume come back. It's not something that we're betting on now."

But I think you mentioned 2017 being potential inflection point and seeing some of the older capacity come out of the market and helping you define balance in terms of pricing. I guess my question is, what degree of confidence do you have in 2017 being that period? If we look across most of the marine spaces and even maybe kind of even coastal as a comp, we still see 45-year-old ATBs that are trading in a market that have gone through 2 or 3 cycles. So it tends to -- it seems like it tends to take a bit longer than kind of a 12-month rationalization period. So I'm curious how you think about that on the inland side and then what the great confidence you have in it being 2017 versus '18 or '19."

It's pretty easy to take out a 10,000-barrel barge. It's a lower capital amount. It's easier to tie them up or to cut them up and sell them for scrap. Your point is taking on the ATBs. These are bigger units. There's a high capital base. And if you can keep them working and they're long in the tooth, they're fully depreciated, it's a pretty good deal. So it has to be painful in order to take them out. And that's why I said on the coastal side, they could take a couple of years for that to play out as those 14 new ones come in and the 40 come out. Now on the inland side, as you've seen, we upped just in the last -- since our last call from planned retirements in inland of 39 to 54 this year alone. So yes, it's a pretty direct economic question to any operator, and they -- it can rationalize pretty quick. So I think you'll see pretty hefty retirements in the inland side."

And if we bought it at higher levels, you can imagine we like them at these lower levels. I would say this though, our -- one of our first priorities in terms of capital deployment is a consolidating acquisition in our core businesses. And clearly, we like to do that.

That's a good position to be in, in a market like this. We're -- this is where our capital discipline and our financial strength become a pretty good strategic tool."
