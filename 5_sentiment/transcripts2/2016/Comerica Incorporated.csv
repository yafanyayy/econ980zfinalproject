Today, we reported fourth quarter 2015 net income of $130 million or $0.71 per share and full year of 2015 net income of $535 million or $2.92 per share. We remain focused on the long term and executing on our relationship banking strategy a",996,"Good morning. Today, we reported fourth quarter 2015 net income of $130 million or $0.71 per share and full year of 2015 net income of $535 million or $2.92 per share. We remain focused on the long term and executing on our relationship banking strategy as we navigate our way through a modestly growing U.S. economy and increasing regulatory and technology demands.
Turning to Slide 4 and highlights from fiscal year 2015. We had good broad-based loan and deposit growth in 2015. Average loans increased $2 billion or 4% to $48.6 billion. Most notable were increases in Technology and Life Sciences, Mortgage Banker Finance, National Dealer Services and Commercial Real Estate. Our average total deposits grew $3.5 billion or 6% to a record $58.3 billion. This included a $3.1 billion or 12% increase in noninterest-bearing deposits as well as a $474 million increase in interest-bearing deposits. 
We saw growth in all business lines in all 3 of our major markets as our customers have a lot of liquidity and choose to hold it in Comerica. We generated close to $1.7 billion of net interest income in 2015, an increase of $34 million or 2% primarily the result of our solid loan growth.
Overall, credit quality continued to be strong with net charge-offs of $75 million or 15 basis points of average loans for the full year, which remains well below the normal historical levels. The allowance for loan losses increased $40 million compared to 2014 primarily due to increases in reserves related to Energy and Technology and Life Sciences partially offset by improvements in credit quality in the remainder of the portfolio. This resulted in a provision for credit losses increasing from the 2014 cyclical low of $27 million to $122 million for 2015. 
Year-over-year, noninterest income was stable excluding the change to the accounting presentation for our card program. We had increases in card fees, deposits service charges and fiduciary income. This was offset by lower investment banking income primarily due to less activity in the energy market as well as decreases in certain categories impacted by regulatory changes such as letters of credit.  excluding the impact of a change the accounting presentation for our card program, noninterest expenses increased $38 million primarily due to increases in technology, regulatory and pension expenses as well as outside processing fees tied to revenue generating activities. This was partially offset by the release of litigation reserves in cost savings realized in 2015 from certain actions taken in second half of 2014. 
We repurchased 5.1 million shares and 500,000 warrants in 2015 under our equity repurchase program. Through the buyback and dividends, we returned $389 million or 73% of 2015 net income to shareholders. This reflects our strong capital position and solid financial performance. Our tangible book value per share increased 4% over the past year to $39.41 as we continue to focus on creating long-term shareholder value.
Turning to Slide 5 and an overview of the fourth quarter. Average loans were relatively stable at $48.5 billion compared to the third quarter, and average deposits increased $596 million driven by a $1 billion increase in noninterest-bearing deposits.
Revenue increased more than 2% compared to the third quarter. This was a result of growth in net interest income, which benefited from higher nonaccrual interest recoveries and the rising rates late in the quarter as well as an increase in fee generation, particularly commercial lending and card fees. Technology and regulatory costs drove noninterest expenses higher as anticipated.
Negative credit migration in our energy exposure continued as expected while overall, our customers have been acting prudently as evidenced by declining loan balances. The remainder of the loan book continues to perform well. 
Finally, we benefited from lower taxes as a result of the early termination of certain leverage lease transactions.
Turning to Slide 6. Most of U.S. data at year-end showed ongoing momentum, which we expect to continue through 2016. Looking at economic conditions within our primary footprint of Texas, California and Michigan, we continue to see the advantages of our geographic diversity. While Texas is facing headwinds from the energy cycle, California and Michigan provide an important counterbalance. Average loans in California were up 8% compared to 2014 while deposits were up 10%. California continues to be a leader in bringing new technology to market. Housing markets should remain strong. Lower regional unemployment rates will contribute to wage growth supporting the state's large consumer sector. We expect the California economy to grow at a moderate pace in 2016.
Average loans in Michigan were relatively stable compared to 2014 while deposits were up 4%. Michigan's economy has benefited from the recovery of the U.S. auto industry. We expect ongoing job growth to keep labor markets tight and wages improving.
Average growth slowed in Texas with loans up 2% and deposits relatively stable compared to 2014. The overall Texas economy should feel the weight of reduced oil and natural gas drilling activity through 2016. However, the state's economic diversity and business friendly environment aided by a healthy U.S. economy should support economic growth through 2016 albeit at a slower pace. 
As we look forward to the year ahead, we remain keenly focused on growing loans and deposits along with managing expenses as we make necessary investments. With the Federal Reserve increasing its benchmark rate 25 basis points in December, our revenue picture looks better as our balance sheet remains well positioned to benefit from potential rising rates. With the oil prices at a cyclical low, we've been closely monitoring our energy consumers and have increased our reserves in each quarter of 2015. Well into the cycle, we continue to feel comfortable with our energy portfolio and believe charge-offs will remain manageable.
In summary, we're committed to providing high-quality financial services and building lasting customer relationships, which combined with our diverse geographic footprint, will continue to assist us in building long-term shareholder value. And now I will turn the call over to Karen."

Turning to Slide 7. Fourth quarter average loans were relatively stable at $48.5 billion compared to the third quarter. We had strong loan growth in our Commercial Real Estate business as well as our National Deal",2308,"Thank you, Ralph. Good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 7. Fourth quarter average loans were relatively stable at $48.5 billion compared to the third quarter. We had strong loan growth in our Commercial Real Estate business as well as our National Dealer Business, which typically rebounds in the fourth quarter. This was more than offset by a seasonal decline in mortgage banker loans along with declines in general Middle Market and Corporate Banking as we remain disciplined in this highly competitive environment. In addition, Energy continues to decline as expected.
Positive growth trends through November and December resulted in loans above the average for the quarter. As you can see, the quarter ended with loans at $49.1 billion. Total loan commitments were relatively stable and utilization was unchanged at 50%. Importantly, our pipeline remains strong. 
Our fourth quarter loan yields increased 7 basis points as shown in the diamond. We had higher interest collected on nonaccrual loans and benefited from a 25 basis point increase in short-term interest rates late in the quarter as the Fed raised its benchmark rates on December 16.
Turning to deposits on Slide 8. Average deposits increased $596 million in the fourth quarter from a $1 billion increase in noninterest-bearing deposits. The primary driver was a large increase in corporate banking, which was partly offset by declines in Technology and Life Sciences along with general Middle Market as we adjust pricing on municipal deposits to reflect the impact of the liquidity coverage ratio. 
Period-end deposits also increased $1.1 billion to $59.9 billion. We continue to prudently manage deposit pricing and have not instituted any standard pricing adjustments in response to the increase in short-term rates. We are closely monitoring our deposit base as well as the market and we believe we are well positioned with predominately operational relationship oriented deposits.
As we discussed with the recent investor conference during the fourth quarter, we deployed a portion of our excess reserves into securities as shown on Slide 9. Given our continued deposit growth and the likelihood of rate increases occurring in small increments over a longer period of time, in the fourth quarter, we added almost $2 billion, primarily in treasury securities. This strategy generates some additional income while maintaining our asset sensitive position. At this time, we expect to potentially and modestly add to our securities portfolio based on the movement of our balance sheet and interest rate along with market opportunity.
By carefully managing the overall portfolio, we have maintained an estimated duration of under 4 years. As you can see in the diamonds on this slide, our portfolio yields was stable resulting from a small decrease in the NBS premium amortization offsetting the mixed impact from adding lower yield in treasury securities. Going forward, assuming no change in the rate environment, we expect continued minor pressure on the average securities yield primarily due to the mixed shift. As of quarter end, our estimated LCR ratio continues to meet the fully phased-in 2017 requirement plus the buffer.
Turning to Slide 10. Net interest income grew $11 million or 3% in the fourth quarter. The biggest driver came from the loan portfolio, which contributed $5 million. Higher interest received on nonaccrual loans and an interest in loan yields due to the rise in rates was only partially offset by the decline in lower loans and lower accretion.
A larger securities portfolio, lower funding costs and higher interest earned on short-term investments including higher Federal Reserve deposit balances each added $2 million. The decline in our wholesale funding costs was driven by a debt maturity late in the third quarter along with lower interest paid due to the decline in interest-bearing deposits.
Our net interest margin increased 4 basis points with higher loan yields offset by higher balances at the Fed. 
Turning to slide 11. Our overall credit picture remains solid. Net charge-offs were 21 basis points or $26 million derived mainly from loans related to Energy and to a lesser extent, Technology and Life Sciences, with strong recoveries in a number of our business lines. Our criticized loans were $295 million to $3.2 billion, which is less than 7% of total loans and continues to be below our average historical level. The increase was driven by a $372 million increase in criticized loans related to Energy.
Total nonaccrual loans were relatively stable at $367 [ph] million or 75 basis points of total loans, with Energy comprising $151 million, up from $126 million in the third quarter. The fall redetermination process is essentially complete for our E&P customers, which comprise 69% of our Energy business line. Borrowing bases have come down about 10% on average as a result of lower energy prices.  About 45% of our customers have improved or stable loan-to-value ratios and there's a few new collateral deficiencies since the prior redetermination. 
Overall, our borrowers continue to act prudently in this environment. They are aggressively reducing costs, cutting back on capital expenditures, reworkings their hedging contracts to provide more runway and preserving liquidity. In addition, they have down bank debt through the sale of assets. As a result, our loans in the Energy line of business declined by $173 million this quarter and are down approximately $700 million from the peak at the end of February, and utilization remained essentially unchanged at 49% as of the end of the third quarter. 
Importantly, we have virtually no second lien exposure and our energy services portfolio is a relatively small amount of our total loans. However, given persistently low oil and gas prices, we continue to see negative migration in the energy book, which has resulted in an increase in criticized loans, nonaccrual loans and charge-offs.
As of quarter end, 38% of the loans related to Energy were considered criticized, including 4% on nonaccrual. We had $27 million in charge-offs in our Energy business line and $6 million in energy-related loans. The $35 million provision for our total portfolio reflected charge-offs as well as an increase in our energy reserves in conjunction with the negative migration and preserving a healthy qualitative reserve. As of quarter end, our reserve allocation for Energy loans increased and is now greater than 4% of our total Energy and Energy-related loans. Overall, our allowance for credit losses increased $9 million to total $679 million and our allowance to loan ratio increased to 1.29%.
Slide 12 outlines noninterest income, which increased $6 million or 2%. The biggest driver was an $8 million increase in commercial lending fees due to robust year-end closing activity regarding particularly in our area. We also had increases in card fees due to higher revenue from merchant processing along with letter of credit and foreign exchange income as we continue to focus on cross-sell opportunities.
We did see declines in service charges on deposits due to 5 fewer business days in the quarter as well as fiduciary and brokerage income, which were impacted by core market environment. 
In addition, we had several items that are difficult to predict. Specifically, a $6 million increase in deferred compensation, which is offset in noninterest expense, a $4 million decrease in customer related warrant income and a $3 million benefit in the third quarter from hedges in our doubts that wasn't repeated in the fourth quarter.
As a reminder, the year-over-year view of those noninterest income and noninterest expense is not directly comparable. Each quarter, this year reflects an accounting presentation that reports gross revenues and expenses rather than net revenue for our card program.
Turning to Slide 13. Noninterest expenses increased $28 million. Included in the increase were $6 million in benefit in the third quarter that were not repeated from later reserve releases and forfeiture of executive stock awards. In addition, deferred compensation expense increased $6 million and is offsetting revenue as mentioned.
Staff insurance and consulting expenses were seasonally higher and salaries expenses increased with higher technology and regulatory related staffing including contract labor. Also of note outside processing fees decline was vendor credit and an usually large collection of customer reimbursement.
Moving to Slide 14 and capital management. As the chart indicates, we continue to return excess capital to our shareholders in a meaningful way with a payout of 79% of fourth quarter earnings. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1.5 million shares for $65 million under the equity repurchase program reflecting a moderate increase from the $59 million repurchased in each of the past 6 quarters.
Turning to Slide 15. As typical, we provide our outlook for the full year based on a continuation of the current economic and interest rate environment. 
Overall, we expect our average loan growth to be in line with GDP growth. We expect loan growth in most businesses led by Commercial Real Estate, Auto Dealer and Technology and Life Sciences. If oil and gas prices remain at low levels, we believe Energy loans should continue to decline. Also keep in mind competition remains stiff, particularly in Corporate Banking and we fully intend to maintain our loan pricing and credit discipline.
We expect our net interest income to increase. Assuming current rates do not change, our model indicates that the full year benefit of the recent increase in short-term rates should increase our net interest income by more than $60 million. And while not included in this outlook, we are well positioned to benefit from any further rate increases, which I'll discuss on the next slide. 
We also expect the growth in loans and securities net of funding costs to have a positive effect. We expect continued solid credit quality with net charge-offs remaining below historical norms. 
As far as provision, we expect an increase in reserves in conjunction with loan growth and potential further deterioration in overall credit quality, including an increase in net charge-offs in cyclically low levels. If energy prices remain at very low levels, we would expect to see further reserve growth and ultimately higher charge-offs. But remember, our Energy business strategy is underwritten to withstand typical volatility in the sector, so we continue to expect the credit impact from Energy to be manageable.
Overall, we expect noninterest income to grow modestly primarily due to growth in merchant processing services, government card and commercial card fees as we continue to focus on cross-sell opportunities. And assuming that the market conditions improve, we expect an increase in Wealth Management related income, such as brokerage service fees and fiduciary income where we continue to see a strong pipeline from our cross alliance program.
Noncustomer categories such as warrant income, hedging effectiveness and deferred comp are difficult to predict but are expected to have a small negative impact. 
As far as noninterest expenses, we have been and will continue to manage through some near-term expense headwinds. 2015 benefited from a $33 million legal reserve reversal that will be essentially offset by an equal decline in our pension expense primarily due to a rise in long-term rate. As we have indicated, we expect technology projects and regulatory expenses will continue to rise and together, increase by about $25 million to $30 million in 2016 as we continue to invest in the increasing industry compliance and regulatory demand as well as enhancements in our cybersecurity.
Outside processing expense is expected to increase in line with growing revenue, particularly card fees. Also, a recent regulatory proposal for an FDIC surcharge may drive that expense up and a forfeiture of restricted stock and termination that benefited 2016 are not expected to be repeated.
Finally, we expect to see typical inflationary pressures on several line items, including annual merit, staff insurance and occupancy. Rest assured that as we continue to navigate through this low rate environment and even as rates rise, we are focused on maintaining our expense discipline, carefully managing our workforce and driving efficiency for the long term through continued review of processes, judiciously negotiating contracts and leveraging technology when possible. We expect these efforts will be apparent in several line items, such as consulting, telecom, travel and entertainment and legal fees. 
Lastly, while not on this slide, I would point out that we estimate our tax rate will be approximately 32% of pretax income.
Turning to Slide 16. As I mentioned, our outlook assumes the current rate environment and no rise in rates. For illustrative purposes, we ran a simulation using the implied forward curve for 30-day LIBOR, the rate to which we are most sensitive. On the left side, we showed the forward curve that assumes 30-day LIBOR reaches about a 100 basis points at year-end or 90 basis points on average in the fourth quarter. In this case, which incorporates a dynamic balance sheet assuming historical relationships, our net interest income could increase a further $55 million to $60 million for the full year. The right side of this type provides our standard asset liability case and shows that a 200 basis point increase in rates over a one-year period, equivalent to 100 basis points on average, would result in a benefit to net interest income of about $210 million.
There are also several alternative assumptions to our standard case including the pace of deposit, loan and rate changes, and in all cases, we remain well positioned for rising rates.
In closing, we are pleased with the increase in our revenue and continued deposit growth. And our overall credit quality has remained strong as we've been navigating the energy cycle. While it remains a challenging environment for us and the industry given the persistently low rates and energy price environment, combined with increased regulatory requirements and technology demand, we will continue to be keenly focused on the long term and the things we can control. And with the first rate increase behind us, our revenue picture looks better. 
Now operator, we would like to open up the call for questions."

So for instance, Scott, when you take a look at our portfolio, as Karen mentioned, we don't have any second lien debt in our portfolio. For the most part, it's well secured e&P credits. We don't have much in the way of energy services and the portfolio continues to contract and throw a fair amount of reserves. The other thing I would mention that's important is that when we're calculating that allocation, including the denominator, it is all of our Energy-related exposure, which includes investment-grade credit. It includes middle market credits that may or may not be impacted at all by energy prices. And then I guess the last thing that we look at is, we have $680 million of reserves in total. And because we don't have other issues going on in the portfolio, we look at that entire reserve as available to address any issues that come up in Energy."

And we recognize that prices have dropped a decent amount since year-end. It is really difficult to say with any degree of certainty what that impact could be because prices are only one component on our reserve. There are lots of other components that impact our customer's performance. They would include continued reduction in cash cost and ability to sell assets, extension of hedges and access to capital markets. But know that because sizes have dropped precipitously, particularly since year-end, we have done an analysis with oil prices remaining at $30 for the entire year. And based on that analysis and conservatively assuming a static portfolio, we would estimate that the impact for our Energy reserve could be $75 million to $125 million, which we still believe, remains manageable. And I would also want you to keep in mind that ultimate losses could be much less than that amount. Our Energy business line is very granular and we do expect Energy loans to continue to decline, which does free up reserve. Plus our allowance is also impacted by the performance of the remainder of the portfolio, which does continue to improve."

And if you take a look at it, Jeffrey, like last spring, when prices were dropping, the access to capital markets proactively to make sure were not in violation of boring bases. In the fall, when the capital markets were largely closed, they sold assets to reduce their loans out to make sure they are in compliance with the borrowing basis. So it's a two-way street.

So on expenses, we talked about the fact that 2015 did benefit from the legal reserve release and we will have lower pension expense that is pretty much equal to that legal reserve release. We talked about the fact that we've got increases in technology and regulatory expense of about $25 million to $30 million and outside processing in line with growing revenue along with typical inflationary pressures and the potential for the FDIC increase. Relative to the fourth quarter, I would say the fourth quarter is a decent guide, but keep in mind there's lots of moving pieces particularly on a quarterly basis. Number of days impact the quarter. The first half specifically has higher stock and incentive comp and higher seasonal payroll taxes. The second half is impacted by merit raises and increasing staff insurance cost. Plus the fourth quarter had items that are not expected to repeat like deferred comp and we continue to manage expenses everywhere that we can. On the FDIC expense in particular, as you know, the FDIC did put a proposal out there to increase their deposit insurance fund per Dodd Frank mandated standard by increasing the rates to the larger banks. While that proposal has the coming period just ended on that, so it's uncertain what the timing or ultimate impact could be. Good rule of thumb would be approximately maybe $10 million to us in the year."

Today, we reported fourth quarter 2015 net income of $130 million or $0.71 per share and full year 2015 net income of $535 million or $2.92 per share. We remain focused on the long term and executing on our relationship banking strategy as w",995,"Good morning. Today, we reported fourth quarter 2015 net income of $130 million or $0.71 per share and full year 2015 net income of $535 million or $2.92 per share. We remain focused on the long term and executing on our relationship banking strategy as we navigate our way through a modestly growing U.S. economy and increasing regulatory and technology demands.
Turning to Slide 4 and highlights from fiscal year 2015. We had good broad-based loan and deposit growth in 2015. Average loans increased $2 billion or 4% to $48.6 billion. Most notable were increases in Technology and Life Sciences, Mortgage Banker Finance, National Dealer Services and Commercial Real Estate. Our average total deposits grew $3.5 billion or 6% to a record $58.3 billion. This included a $3.1 billion or 12% increase in noninterest-bearing deposits as well as a $474 million increase in interest-bearing deposits. 
We saw growth in all business lines in all 3 of our major markets as our customers have a lot of liquidity and choose to hold it in Comerica. We generated close to $1.7 billion of net interest income in 2015, an increase of $34 million or 2%, primarily the result of our solid loan growth. Overall, credit quality continued to be strong with net charge-offs of $75 million or 15 basis points of average loans for the full year, which remains well below normal historical levels. 
The allowance for loan losses increased $40 million compared to 2014 primarily due to increases in reserves related to Energy and Technology and Life Sciences, partially offset by improvements in credit quality in the remainder of the portfolio. This resulted in a provision for credit losses increasing from the 2014 cyclical low of $27 million to $122 million for 2015. 
Year-over-year, noninterest income was stable, excluding the change to the accounting presentation for a card program. We had increases in card fees, deposit service charges and fiduciary income. This was offset by lower investment banking income primarily due to less activity in the energy market as well as decreases in certain categories impacted by regulatory changes, such as letters of credit. Excluding the impact of a change to the accounting presentation for a card program, noninterest expenses increased $38 million primarily due to increases in technology, regulatory and pension expenses as well as outside processing fees tied to revenue-generating activities. This was partially offset by the release of litigation reserves and cost savings realized in 2015 from certain actions taken in the second half of 2014. 
We repurchased 5.1 million shares and 500,000 warrants in 2015 under our equity repurchase program. Through the buyback and dividends, we returned $389 million or 73% of 2015 net income to shareholders. This reflects our strong capital position and solid financial performance. Our tangible book value per share increased 4% over the past year to $39.41 as we continue to focus on creating long-term shareholder value.
Turning to Slide 5 and an overview of the fourth quarter. Average loans were relatively stable at $48.5 billion compared to the third quarter, and average deposits increased $596 million driven by a $1 billion increase in noninterest-bearing deposits. Revenue increased more than 2% compared to the third quarter. This was a result of growth in net interest income, which benefited from higher nonaccrual interest recoveries and the rising rates late in the quarter as well as an increase in fee generation, particularly commercial lending and card fees. Technology and regulatory costs drove noninterest expenses higher as anticipated. Negative credit migration in our energy exposure continued as expected while, overall, our customers have been acting prudently as evidenced by declining loan balances. The remainder of the loan book continues to perform well. Finally, we benefited from lower taxes as a result of the early termination of certain leverage lease transactions.
Turning to Slide 6. Most U.S. economic data at year-end showed ongoing momentum, which we expect to continue through 2016. Looking at economic conditions within our primary footprint of Texas, California and Michigan, we continue to see the advantages of our geographic diversity. While Texas is facing headwinds from the energy cycle, California and Michigan provide an important counterbalance. 
Average loans in California were up 8% compared to 2014 while deposits were up 10%. California continues to be a leader in bringing new technology to market. Housing market should remain strong. Lower regional unemployment rates will contribute to wage growth, supporting the state's large consumer sector. We expect the California economy to grow at a moderate pace in 2016.
Average loans in Michigan were relatively stable compared to 2014 while deposits were up 4%. Michigan's economy has benefited from the recovery of the U.S. auto industry. We expect ongoing job growth to keep labor markets tight and wages improving.
Average growth slowed in Texas with loans up 2% and deposits relatively stable compared to 2014. The overall Texas economy should feel the weight of reduced oil and natural gas drilling activity through 2016. However, the state's economic diversity and business-friendly environment, aided by a healthy U.S. economy, should support economic growth through 2016, albeit at a slower pace. 
As we look forward to the year ahead, we remain keenly focused on growing loans and deposits, along with managing expenses, as we make necessary investments. With the Federal Reserve increasing its benchmark rate 25 basis points in December, our revenue picture looks better as our balance sheet remains well positioned to benefit from potential rising rates. 
With the oil prices at a cyclical low, we've been closely monitoring our energy customers and have increased our reserves in each quarter of 2015. Well into the cycle, we continue to feel comfortable with our Energy portfolio and believe charge-offs will remain manageable.
In summary, we are committed to providing high-quality financial services and building lasting customer relationships, which, combined with our diverse geographic footprint, will continue to assist us in building long-term shareholder value. 
And now I will turn the call over to Karen."
318670,318230993,919286,"Comerica Incorporated, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 19, 2016",2016-01-19,"Earnings Calls","Comerica Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Ralph. Good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 7. Fourth quarter average loans were relatively stable at $48.5 billion compared to the third quarter. We had strong loan growth in our Commercial Real Estate business as well as our National Deal",2305,"Thank you, Ralph. Good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 7. Fourth quarter average loans were relatively stable at $48.5 billion compared to the third quarter. We had strong loan growth in our Commercial Real Estate business as well as our National Dealer business, which typically rebounds in the fourth quarter. This was more than offset by a seasonal decline in mortgage banker loans, along with declines in general Middle Market and Corporate Banking, as we remain disciplined in this highly competitive environment. In addition, Energy continues to decline as expected.
Positive growth trends through November and December resulted in period-end loans above the average for the quarter. As you can see, the quarter ended with loans at $49.1 billion. Total loan commitments were relatively stable, and utilization was unchanged at 50%. Importantly, our pipeline remained strong. Our fourth quarter loan yield increased 7 basis points as shown in the diamonds. We had higher interest collected on nonaccrual loans and benefited from a 25 basis point increase in short-term interest rates late in the quarter as the fed raised its benchmark rate on December 16.
Turning to deposits on Slide 8. Average deposits increased $596 million in the fourth quarter from a $1 billion increase in noninterest-bearing deposits. The primary driver was a large increase in Corporate Banking, which was partly offset by declines in Technology and Life Sciences, along with general Middle Market, as we adjust pricing on municipal deposits to reflect the impact of the liquidity coverage ratio. Period-end deposits also increased $1.1 billion to $59.9 billion. 
We continue to prudently manage deposit pricing and have not instituted any standard pricing adjustments in response to the increase in short-term rates. We are closely monitoring our deposit base as well as the market, and we believe we are well positioned with predominately operational relationship-oriented deposits.
As we discussed at a recent Investor Conference during the fourth quarter, we deployed a portion of our excess reserves into securities as shown on Slide 9. Given our continued deposit growth and the likelihood of rate increases occurring in small increments over a longer period of time, in the fourth quarter, we added almost $2 billion, primarily in treasury securities. This strategy generates some additional income while maintaining our asset-sensitive position. At this time, we expect to potentially and modestly add to our securities portfolio based on the movement of our balance sheet and interest rate along with market opportunity. By carefully managing the overall portfolio, we have maintained an estimated duration of under 4 years. 
As you can see in the diamonds on this slide, our portfolio yield was stable resulting from a small decrease in the MBS premium amortization offsetting the mixed impact from adding lower yield in treasury securities. Going forward, assuming no change in the rate environment, we expect continued minor pressure on the average securities yield primarily due to the mixed shift. As of quarter-end, our estimated LCR ratio continues to meet the fully phased-in 2017 requirement plus the buffer.
Turning to Slide 10. Net interest income grew $11 million or 3% in the fourth quarter. The biggest driver came from the loan portfolio, which contributed $5 million. Higher interest received on nonaccrual loans and an interest in loan yields due to the rise in rates was only partially offset by the decline in lower loans and lower accretion. A larger securities portfolio, lower funding costs and higher interest earned on short-term investments, including higher Federal Reserve deposit balances, each added $2 million. The decline in our wholesale funding costs was driven by a debt maturity late in the third quarter , along with lower interest paid due to the decline in interest-bearing deposits. Our net interest margin increased 4 basis points with higher loan yield offset by higher balances at the fed. 
Turning to Slide 11. Our overall credit picture remains solid. Net charge-offs were 21 basis points or $26 million, derived mainly from loans related to Energy and, to a lesser extent, Technology and Life Sciences with strong recoveries in a number of our business lines. Our criticized loans were $295 million to $3.2 billion, which is less than 7% of total loans and continues to be below our average historical level. The increase was driven by a $372 million increase in criticized loans related to Energy.
Total nonaccrual loans were relatively stable at $367 million or 75 basis points of total loans with Energy comprising $161 million, up from $126 million in the third quarter. The fall redetermination process is essentially complete for our E&P customers, which comprise 69% of our Energy business line. Borrowing bases have come down about 10% on average as a result of lower energy prices. About 45% of our customers have improved or stable loan-to-value ratios, and there are some few new collateral deficiencies since the prior redetermination. 
Overall, our borrowers continue to act prudently in this environment. They are aggressively reducing costs, cutting back on capital expenditures, reworking their hedging contracts to provide more runway and preserving liquidity. In addition, they are paying down bank debt through the sale of assets. As a result, our loans in the Energy line of business declined by $173 million this quarter and are down approximately $700 million from the peak at the end of February and utilization remained essentially unchanged at 49% as of the end of the third quarter. 
Importantly, we have virtually no second lien exposure and our Energy services portfolio is a relatively small amount of our total loans. However, given persistently low oil and gas prices, we continue to see negative migration in the Energy book, which has resulted in an increase in criticized loans, nonaccrual loans and charge-offs. As of quarter end, 38% of the loans related to Energy were considered criticized, including 4% on nonaccrual. We had $27 million in charge-offs in our Energy business line and $6 million in Energy-related loans. 
The $35 million provision for our total portfolio reflected charge-offs as well as an increase in our Energy reserves in conjunction with the negative migration and preserving a healthy qualitative reserve. As of quarter-end, our reserve allocation for Energy loans increased and is now greater than 4% of our total Energy and Energy-related loans. Overall, our allowance for credit losses increased $9 million to total $679 million and our allowance-to-loan ratio increased to 1.29%.
Slide 12 outlines noninterest income, which increased $6 million or 2%. The biggest driver was an $8 million increase in commercial lending fees due to robust year-end closing activity, particularly in our syndication area. We also had increases in card fees due to higher revenue from merchant processing, along with letter of credit and foreign exchange income, as we continue to focus on cross-sell opportunity. We did see declines in service charges on deposits due to 5 fewer business days in the quarter as well as fiduciary and brokerage income, which were impacted by core market environment. 
In addition, we had several items that are difficult to predict, specifically: a $6 million increase in deferred compensation, which is offset in noninterest expense; a $4 million decrease in customer-related warrant income; and a $3 million benefit in the third quarter from hedges on our debt that wasn't repeated in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, the year-over-year view of those noninterest income and noninterest expense is not directly comparable. Each quarter this year reflects an accounting presentation that reports the gross revenues and expenses rather than net revenue for a card program.
Turning to Slide 13. Noninterest expenses increased $28 million. Included in the increase were $6 million in benefit in the third quarter that were not repeated from legal reserve releases and forfeiture of executive stock awards. In addition, deferred compensation expense increased $6 million and is offsetting revenue as mentioned. Staff insurance and consulting expenses were seasonally higher, and salaries expenses increased with higher technology and regulatory-related staffing, including contract labor. Also of note, outside processing fees declined with vendor credit and usually large collection of customer reimbursement.
Moving to Slide 14 and capital management. As the chart indicates, we continue to return excess capital to our shareholders in a meaningful way with a payout of 79% of fourth quarter earnings. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1.5 million shares for $65 million under the equity repurchase program, reflecting a moderate increase from the $59 million repurchased in each of the past 6 quarters.
Turning to Slide 15. As typical, we provide our outlook for the full year based on a continuation of the current economic and interest rate environment. Overall, we expect our average loan growth to be in line with GDP growth. We expect loan growth in most businesses, led by Commercial Real Estate, Auto Dealer and Technology and Life Sciences. If oil and gas prices remain at low levels, we believe Energy loans should continue to decline. Also keep in mind, competition remains stiff, particularly in Corporate Banking, and we fully intend to maintain our loan pricing and credit discipline.
We expect our net interest income to increase. Assuming current rates do not change, our model indicates that the full year benefit of the recent increase in short-term rates should increase our net interest income by more than $60 million. And while not included in this outlook, we are well positioned to benefit from any further rate increases, which I'll discuss on the next slide. We also expect a growth in loans and securities, net of funding costs, to have a positive effect. 
We expect continued solid credit quality with net charge-offs remaining below historical norms. As far as provision, we expect an increase in reserves in conjunction with loan growth and potential further deterioration in overall credit quality, including an increase in net charge-offs in cyclically low level. If energy prices remain at these very low levels, we would expect to see further reserve build and, ultimately, higher charge-offs. But remember, our Energy business strategy is underwritten to withstand typical volatility in the sector so we continue to expect the credit impact from Energy to be manageable.
Overall, we expect noninterest income to grow modestly primarily due to growth in merchant processing services, government card and commercial card fees as we continue to focus on cross-sell opportunities. And assuming that the market conditions improve, we expect an increase in Wealth Management-related income, such as brokerage service fees and fiduciary income where we continue to see a strong pipeline from our Trust Alliance program. Noncustomer categories, such as warrant income, hedging effectiveness and deferred comp, are difficult to predict but are expected to have a small negative impact. 
As far as noninterest expenses, we have been and will continue to manage through some near-term expense headwinds. 2015 benefited from a $33 million legal reserve reversal that will be essentially offset by an equal decline in our pension expense, primarily due to a rise in long-term rates. As we have indicated, we expect technology projects and regulatory expenses will continue to rise and, together, increase by about $25 million to $30 million in 2016 as we continue to invest in the increasing industry compliance and regulatory demand as well as enhancements in our cybersecurity. Outside processing expense is expected to increase in line with growing revenue, particularly card fees. Also, a recent regulatory proposal for an FDIC surcharge may drive that expense up and a forfeiture of restricted stock and leverage lease terminations that benefited 2015 are not expected to be repeated. Finally, we expect to see typical inflationary pressures on several line items, including annual merit, staff insurance and occupancy. 
Rest assured that as we continue to navigate through this low rate environment and even as rates rise, we are focused on maintaining our expense discipline, carefully managing our workforce and driving efficiency for the long term through continued review of processes, judiciously negotiating contracts and leveraging technology, when possible. We expect these efforts will be apparent in several line items, such as consulting, telecom, travel and entertainment and legal fees. Lastly, while not on this slide, I would point out that we estimate our tax rate will be approximately 32% of pretax income.
Turning to Slide 16. As I mentioned, our outlook assumes the current rate environment and no rising rates. For illustrative purposes, we ran a simulation using the implied forward curve for 30-day LIBOR, the rate to which we are most sensitive. On the left side of the slide, we show the forward curve that assumes 30-day LIBOR reaches about 100 basis points at year-end or 90 basis points on average in the fourth quarter. In this case, which incorporates a dynamic balance sheet assuming historical relationships, our net interest income could increase a further $55 million to $60 million for the full year. The right side of the slide provides our standard asset liability case and shows that a 200 basis point increase in rates over a 1-year period, equivalent to 100 basis points on average, would result a benefit to net interest income of about $210 million. There are also several alternative assumptions to our standard case, including the pace of deposit, loan and rate changes, and in all cases, we remain well positioned for rising rates.
In closing, we are pleased with the increase in our revenue and continued deposit growth and our overall credit quality has remained strong as we've been navigating the energy cycle. While it remains a challenging environment for us and the industry, given the persistently low rates and energy price environment, combined with increased regulatory requirements and technology demand, we will continue to be keenly focused on the long term and the things we can control. And with the first rate increase behind us, our revenue picture looks better.

We don't have much in the way of Energy Services, and the portfolio continues to contract and throwing out a fair amount of reserves. The other thing I would mention that's important is that when we're calculating that allocation, including the denominator, is all of our Energy-related exposure, which includes investment-grade credits. It includes middle market credits that may or may not be impacted at all by energy prices. And then I guess the last thing that we look at is we have $680 million of reserves in total. And because we don't have other issues going on in the portfolio, we look at that entire reserve as available to address any issues that come up in Energy."

It is really difficult to say with any degree of certainty what that impact could be because prices are only one component on our reserve. There are lots of other components that impact our customer's performance. They would include continued reduction in cash cost and ability to sell assets, extension of hedges and access to capital market. But know that because prices have dropped precipitously, particularly since year-end, we have done an analysis with oil prices remaining at $30 for the entire year. And based on that analysis and conservatively assuming a static portfolio, we would estimate that the impact to our Energy reserves could be $75 million to $125 million, which, we still believe, remains manageable. And I would also want you to keep in mind that ultimate losses could be much less than that amount. Our Energy business line is very granular, and we do expect Energy loans to continue to decline, which does free up reserves, plus our allowance is also impacted by the performance of the remainder of the portfolio, which does continue to improve."

The first half typically has higher stock and incentive comp and higher seasonal payroll taxes. The second half is impacted by merit raises and increasing staff insurance cost. Plus the fourth quarter had items that are not expected to repeat like deferred comp, and we continue to manage expenses everywhere that we can.

Today, we reported fourth quarter 2015 net income of $130 million or $0.71 per share and full year 2015 net income of $535 million or $2.92 per share. We remain focused on the long term and executing on our relationship banking strategy as w",998,"Good morning. Today, we reported fourth quarter 2015 net income of $130 million or $0.71 per share and full year 2015 net income of $535 million or $2.92 per share. We remain focused on the long term and executing on our relationship banking strategy as we navigate our way through a modestly growing U.S. economy and increasing regulatory and technology demands.
Turning to Slide 4 and highlights from fiscal year 2015. We had good broad-based loan and deposit growth in 2015. Average loans increased $2 billion or 4% to $48.6 billion. Most notable were increases in Technology and Life Sciences, Mortgage Banker Finance, National Dealer Services and Commercial Real Estate. Our average total deposits grew $3.5 billion or 6% to a record $58.3 billion. This included a $3.1 billion or 12% increase in noninterest-bearing deposits as well as a $474 million increase in interest-bearing deposits. 
We saw growth in all business lines in all 3 of our major markets as our customers have a lot of liquidity and choose to hold it in Comerica. We generated close to $1.7 billion of net interest income in 2015, an increase of $34 million or 2%, primarily the result of our solid loan growth. Overall, credit quality continued to be strong with net charge-offs of $75 million or 15 basis points of average loans for the full year, which remains well below the normal historical levels. 
The allowance for loan losses increased $40 million compared to 2014 primarily due to increases in reserves related to Energy and Technology and Life Sciences, partially offset by improvements in credit quality in the remainder of the portfolio. This resulted in a provision for credit losses increasing from the 2014 cyclical low of $27 million to $122 million for 2015. 
Year-over-year, noninterest income was stable, excluding the change to the accounting presentation for a card program. We had increases in card fees, deposit service charges and fiduciary income. This was offset by lower investment banking income primarily due to less activity in the energy market as well as decreases in certain categories impacted by regulatory changes, such as letters of credit. Excluding the impact of a change to the accounting presentation for a card program, noninterest expenses increased $38 million primarily due to increases in technology, regulatory and pension expenses as well as outside processing fees tied to revenue-generating activities. This was partially offset by the release of litigation reserves and cost savings realized in 2015 from certain actions taken in the second half of 2014. 
We repurchased 5.1 million shares and 500,000 warrants in 2015 under our equity repurchase program. Through the buyback and dividends, we returned $389 million or 73% of 2015 net income to shareholders. This reflects our strong capital position and solid financial performance. Our tangible book value per share increased 4% over the past year to $39.41 as we continue to focus on creating long-term shareholder value.
Turning to Slide 5 and an overview of the fourth quarter. Average loans were relatively stable at $48.5 billion compared to the third quarter, and average deposits increased $596 million driven by a $1 billion increase in noninterest-bearing deposits. Revenue increased more than 2% compared to the third quarter. This was a result of growth in net interest income, which benefited from higher nonaccrual interest recoveries and the rise in rates late in the quarter as well as an increase in fee generation, particularly commercial lending and card fees. Technology and regulatory costs drove noninterest expenses higher as anticipated. Negative credit migration in our energy exposure continued as expected while, overall, our customers have been acting prudently as evidenced by declining loan balances. The remainder of the loan book continues to perform well. Finally, we benefited from lower taxes as a result of the early termination of certain leverage lease transactions.
Turning to Slide 6. Most U.S. economic data at year-end showed ongoing momentum, which we expect to continue through 2016. Looking at economic conditions within our primary footprint of Texas, California and Michigan, we continue to see the advantages of our geographic diversity. While Texas is facing headwinds from the energy cycle, California and Michigan provide an important counterbalance. 
Average loans in California were up 8% compared to 2014, while deposits were up 10%. California continues to be a leader in bringing new technology to market. Housing markets should remain strong. Lower regional unemployment rates will contribute to wage growth, supporting the state's large consumer sector. We expect the California economy to grow at a moderate pace in 2016.
Average loans in Michigan were relatively stable compared to 2014, while deposits were up 4%. Michigan's economy has benefited from the recovery of the U.S. auto industry. We expect ongoing job growth to keep labor markets tight and wages improving.
Average growth slowed in Texas with loans up 2% and deposits relatively stable compared to 2014. The overall Texas economy should feel the weight of reduced oil and natural gas drilling activity through 2016. However, the state's economic diversity and business-friendly environment, aided by a healthy U.S. economy, should support economic growth through 2016, albeit at a slower pace. 
As we look forward to the year ahead, we remain keenly focused on growing loans and deposits, along with managing expenses, as we make necessary investments. With the Federal Reserve increasing its benchmark rate 25 basis points in December, our revenue picture looks better as our balance sheet remains well positioned to benefit from potential rising rates. 
With the oil prices at a cyclical low, we have been closely monitoring our energy customers and have increased our reserves in each quarter of 2015. Well into the cycle, we continue to feel comfortable with our Energy portfolio and believe charge-offs will remain manageable.
In summary, we are committed to providing high-quality financial services and building lasting customer relationships, which, combined with our diverse geographic footprint, will continue to assist us in building long-term shareholder value. 
And now I will turn the call over to Karen."
318670,318230993,919298,"Comerica Incorporated, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Jan 19, 2016",2016-01-19,"Earnings Calls","Comerica Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Ralph. Good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 7. Fourth quarter average loans were relatively stable at $48.5 billion compared to the third quarter. We had strong loan growth in our Commercial Real Estate business as well as our National Deal",2304,"Thank you, Ralph. Good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 7. Fourth quarter average loans were relatively stable at $48.5 billion compared to the third quarter. We had strong loan growth in our Commercial Real Estate business as well as our National Dealer business, which typically rebounds in the fourth quarter. This was more than offset by a seasonal decline in mortgage banker loans, along with declines in general Middle Market and Corporate Banking, as we remain disciplined in this highly competitive environment. In addition, Energy continued to decline as expected.
Positive growth trends through November and December resulted in period-end loans above the average for the quarter. As you can see, the quarter ended with loans at $49.1 billion. Total loan commitments were relatively stable, and utilization was unchanged at 50%. Importantly, our pipeline remained strong. Our fourth quarter loan yield increased 7 basis points as shown in the diamonds. We had higher interest collected on nonaccrual loans and benefited from a 25 basis point increase in short-term interest rates late in the quarter, as the Fed raised its benchmark rate on December 16.
Turning to deposits on Slide 8. Average deposits increased $596 million in the fourth quarter from a $1 billion increase in noninterest-bearing deposits. The primary driver was a large increase in Corporate Banking, which was partly offset by declines in Technology and Life Sciences, along with general Middle Market, as we adjust pricing on municipal deposits to reflect the impact of the liquidity coverage ratio. Period-end deposits also increased $1.1 billion to $59.9 billion. 
We continue to prudently manage deposit pricing and have not instituted any standard pricing adjustments in response to the increase in short-term rates. We are closely monitoring our deposit base as well as the market, and we believe we are well positioned with predominately operational relationship-oriented deposits.
As we discussed at a recent Investor Conference during the fourth quarter, we deployed a portion of our excess reserves into securities as shown on Slide 9. Given our continued deposit growth and the likelihood of rate increases occurring in small increments over a longer period of time, in the fourth quarter, we added almost $2 billion, primarily in treasury securities. This strategy generates some additional income while maintaining our asset-sensitive position. At this time, we expect to potentially and modestly add to our securities portfolio based on the movement of our balance sheet and interest rate along with market opportunity. By carefully managing the overall portfolio, we have maintained an estimated duration of under 4 years. 
As you can see in the diamonds on this slide, our portfolio yield was stable resulting from a small decrease in the MBS premium amortization offsetting the mix impact from adding lower yield in treasury securities. Going forward, assuming no change in the rate environment, we expect continued minor pressure on the average securities yield primarily due to the mix shift. As of quarter-end, our estimated LCR ratio continues to meet the fully phased-in 2017 requirement plus the buffer.
Turning to Slide 10. Net interest income grew $11 million or 3% in the fourth quarter. The biggest driver came from the loan portfolio, which contributed $5 million. Higher interest received on nonaccrual loans and an interest in loan yields due to the rise in rates was only partially offset by the decline in lower loans and lower accretion. A larger securities portfolio, lower funding costs and higher interest earned on short-term investments, including higher Federal Reserve deposit balances, each added $2 million. The decline in our wholesale funding costs was driven by a debt maturity late in the third quarter, along with lower interest paid due to the decline in interest-bearing deposits. Our net interest margin increased 4 basis points with higher loan yield offset by higher balances at the Fed. 
Turning to Slide 11. Our overall credit picture remains solid. Net charge-offs were 21 basis points or $26 million, derived mainly from loans related to Energy and, to a lesser extent, Technology and Life Sciences with strong recoveries in a number of our business lines. Our criticized loans grew $295 million to $3.2 billion, which is less than 7% of total loans and continues to be below our average historical level. The increase was driven by a $372 million increase in criticized loans related to Energy.
Total nonaccrual loans were relatively stable at $367 million or 75 basis points of total loans with Energy comprising $161 million, up from $126 million in the third quarter. The fall redetermination process is essentially complete for our E&P customers, which comprise 69% of our Energy business line. Borrowing bases have come down about 10% on average as a result of lower energy prices. About 45% of our customers have improved or stable loan-to-value ratios, and there have been few new collateral deficiencies since the prior redetermination. 
Overall, our borrowers continue to act prudently in this environment. They are aggressively reducing costs, cutting back on capital expenditures, reworking their hedging contracts to provide more runway and preserving liquidity. In addition, they are paying down bank debt through the sale of assets. As a result, our loans in the Energy line of business declined by $173 million this quarter and are down approximately $700 million from the peak at the end of February and utilization remained essentially unchanged at 49% as of the end of the third quarter. 
Importantly, we have virtually no second lien exposure and our Energy services portfolio is a relatively small amount of our total loans. However, given persistently low oil and gas prices, we continue to see negative migration in the Energy book, which has resulted in an increase in criticized loans, nonaccrual loans and charge-offs. As of quarter end, 38% of the loans related to Energy were considered criticized, including 4% on nonaccrual. We had $27 million in charge-offs in our Energy business line and $6 million in Energy-related loans. 
The $35 million provision for our total portfolio reflected charge-offs as well as an increase in our Energy reserves in conjunction with the negative migration and preserving a healthy qualitative reserve. As of quarter-end, our reserve allocation for Energy loans increased and is now greater than 4% of our total Energy and Energy-related loans. Overall, our allowance for credit losses increased $9 million to total $679 million and our allowance-to-loan ratio increased to 1.29%.
Slide 12 outlines noninterest income, which increased $6 million or 2%. The biggest driver was an $8 million increase in commercial lending fees due to robust year-end closing activity, particularly in our syndication area. We also had increases in card fees due to higher revenue from merchant processing, along with letter of credit and foreign exchange income, as we continue to focus on cross-sell opportunity. We did see declines in service charges on deposits due to 5 fewer business days in the quarter as well as fiduciary and brokerage income, which were impacted by core market environment. 
In addition, we had several items that are difficult to predict, specifically: a $6 million increase in deferred compensation, which is offset in noninterest expense; a $4 million decrease in customer-related warrant income; and a $3 million benefit in the third quarter from hedges on our debt that wasn't repeated in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, the year-over-year view of those noninterest income and noninterest expense is not directly comparable. Each quarter this year reflects an accounting presentation that reports the gross revenues and expenses rather than net revenue for a card program.
Turning to Slide 13. Noninterest expenses increased $28 million. Included in the increase were $6 million in benefit in the third quarter that were not repeated from legal reserve releases and forfeiture of executive stock awards. In addition, deferred compensation expense increased $6 million and is offsetting revenue as mentioned. Staff insurance and consulting expenses were seasonally higher, and salaries' expenses increased with higher technology and regulatory-related staffing, including contract labor. Also of note, outside processing fees declined with vendor credit and unusually large collection of customer reimbursement.
Moving to Slide 14 and capital management. As the chart indicates, we continue to return excess capital to our shareholders in a meaningful way with a payout of 79% of fourth quarter earnings. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1.5 million shares for $65 million under the equity repurchase program, reflecting a moderate increase from the $59 million repurchased in each of the past 6 quarters.
Turning to Slide 15. As typical, we provide our outlook for the full year based on a continuation of the current economic and interest rate environment. Overall, we expect our average loan growth to be in line with GDP growth. We expect loan growth in most businesses, led by Commercial Real Estate, Auto Dealer and Technology and Life Sciences. If oil and gas prices remain at low levels, we believe Energy loans should continue to decline. Also keep in mind, competition remains stiff, particularly in Corporate Banking, and we fully intend to maintain our loan pricing and credit discipline.
We expect our net interest income to increase. Assuming current rates do not change, our model indicates that the full year benefit of the recent increase in short-term rates should increase our net interest income by more than $60 million. And while not included in this outlook, we are well positioned to benefit from any further rate increases, which I'll discuss on the next slide. We also expect a growth in loans and securities, net of funding costs, to have a positive effect. 
We expect continued solid credit quality with net charge-offs remaining below historical norms. As far as provision, we expect an increase in reserves in conjunction with loan growth and potential further deterioration in overall credit quality, including an increase in net charge-offs and cyclically low level. If energy prices remain at these very low levels, we would expect to see further reserve build and, ultimately, higher charge-offs. But remember, our Energy business strategy is underwritten to withstand typical volatility in the sector so we continue to expect the credit impact from Energy to be manageable.
Overall, we expect noninterest income to grow modestly primarily due to growth in merchant processing services, government card and commercial card fees as we continue to focus on cross-sell opportunities. And assuming that the market conditions improve, we expect an increase in Wealth Management-related income, such as brokerage service fees and fiduciary income where we continue to see a strong pipeline from our Trust Alliance program. Noncustomer categories, such as warrant income, hedging effectiveness and deferred comp, are difficult to predict but are expected to have a small negative impact. 
As far as noninterest expenses, we have been and will continue to manage through some near-term expense headwinds. 2015 benefited from a $33 million legal reserve reversal that will be essentially offset by an equal decline in our pension expense, primarily due to a rise in long-term rates. As we have indicated, we expect technology projects and regulatory expenses will continue to rise and, together, increase by about $25 million to $30 million in 2016 as we continue to invest in the increasing industry compliance and regulatory demand as well as enhancements in our cybersecurity. Outside processing expense is expected to increase in line with growing revenue, particularly card fees. Also, a recent regulatory proposal for an FDIC surcharge may drive that expense up and a forfeiture of restricted stock and leverage lease terminations that benefited 2015 are not expected to be repeated. Finally, we expect to see typical inflationary pressures on several line items, including annual merit, staff insurance and occupancy. 
Rest assured that as we continue to navigate through this low rate environment and even as rates rise, we are focused on maintaining our expense discipline, carefully managing our workforce and driving efficiency for the long term through continued review of processes, judiciously negotiating contracts and leveraging technology, when possible. We expect these efforts will be apparent in several line items, such as consulting, telecom, travel and entertainment and legal fees. Lastly, while not on this slide, I would point out that we estimate our tax rate will be approximately 32% of pretax income.
Turning to Slide 16. As I mentioned, our outlook assumes the current rate environment and no rising rates. For illustrative purposes, we ran a simulation using the implied forward curve for 30-day LIBOR, the rate to which we are most sensitive. On the left side of the slide, we show the forward curve that assumes 30-day LIBOR reaches about 100 basis points at year-end or 90 basis points on average in the fourth quarter. In this case, which incorporates a dynamic balance sheet assuming historical relationships, our net interest income could increase a further $55 million to $60 million for the full year. The right side of the slide provides our standard asset liability case and shows that a 200 basis point increase in rates over a 1-year period, equivalent to 100 basis points on average, would result a benefit to net interest income of about $210 million. There are also several alternative assumptions to our standard case, including the pace of deposit, loan and rate changes, and in all cases, we remain well positioned for rising rates.
In closing, we are pleased with the increase in our revenue and continued deposit growth and our overall credit quality has remained strong as we've been navigating the energy cycle. While it remains a challenging environment for us and the industry, given the persistently low rates and energy price environment, combined with increased regulatory requirements and technology demand, we will continue to be keenly focused on the long term and the things we can control. And with the first rate increase behind us, our revenue picture looks better.

So for instance, Scott, when you take a look at our portfolio, as Karen mentioned, we don't have any second lien debt in our portfolio. For the most part, it's well-secured E&P credits. We don't have much in the way of Energy Services, and the portfolio continues to contract and throwing out a fair amount of reserves. The other thing I would mention that's important is, is that when we're calculating that allocation, included in the denominator, is all of our Energy-related exposure, which includes investment-grade credits. It includes middle market credits that may or may not be impacted at all by energy prices. And then, I guess, the last thing that we look at is we have $680 million of reserves in total. And because we don't have other issues going on in the portfolio, we look at that entire reserve as available to address any issues that come up in Energy."

And we recognize that prices have dropped a decent amount since year-end. It is really difficult to say with any degree of certainty what that impact could be, because prices are only one component on our reserve. There are lots of other components that impact our customer's performance. They would include continued reduction in cash cost and ability to sell assets, extension of hedges and access to capital market. But know that because prices have dropped precipitously, particularly since year-end, we have done an analysis with oil prices remaining at $30 for the entire year. And based on that analysis and conservatively assuming a static portfolio, we would estimate that the impact to our Energy reserves could be $75 million to $125 million, which, we still believe, remains manageable. And I would also want you to keep in mind that ultimate losses could be much less than that amount. Our Energy business line is very granular, and we do expect Energy loans to continue to decline, which does free up reserves, plus our allowance is also impacted by the performance of the remainder of the portfolio, which does continue to improve."

So $60 million from 25 basis points, but then a $100 million annualized from 90 basis points in LIBOR. Is that just because you expect deposit costs to go up?

Relative to the fourth quarter, I would say the fourth quarter is a decent guide, but keep in mind there's lots of moving pieces particularly on a quarterly basis. Number of days impact the quarter. The first half typically has higher stock and incentive comp and higher seasonal payroll taxes. The second half is impacted by merit raises and increasing staff insurance cost. Plus the fourth quarter had items that are not expected to repeat like deferred comp, and we continue to manage expenses everywhere that we can. On the FDIC expense in particular, as you know, the FDIC did put a proposal out there to increase their deposit insurance fund per Dodd-Frank mandated standard by increasing the rates to the larger banks. While that proposal has the -- the comment period has just ended on that, so it's uncertain what the timing or ultimate impact could be.

And some of those, we might be fairly comfortable with because of there's other mitigating factors, but I won't call them second-lien piece at all. They are just higher loan-to-value for a variety of reasons."

Today, we reported fourth quarter 2015 net income of $130 million or $0.71 per share and full year 2015 net income of $535 million or $2.92 per share. We remain focused on the long term and executing on our relationship banking strategy as w",998,"Good morning. Today, we reported fourth quarter 2015 net income of $130 million or $0.71 per share and full year 2015 net income of $535 million or $2.92 per share. We remain focused on the long term and executing on our relationship banking strategy as we navigate our way through a modestly growing U.S. economy and increasing regulatory and technology demands.
Turning to Slide 4 and highlights from fiscal year 2015. We had good broad-based loan and deposit growth in 2015. Average loans increased $2 billion or 4% to $48.6 billion. Most notable were increases in Technology and Life Sciences, Mortgage Banker Finance, National Dealer Services and Commercial Real Estate. Our average total deposits grew $3.5 billion or 6% to a record $58.3 billion. This included a $3.1 billion or 12% increase in noninterest-bearing deposits as well as a $474 million increase in interest-bearing deposits. 
We saw growth in all business lines in all 3 of our major markets as our customers have a lot of liquidity and choose to hold it in Comerica. We generated close to $1.7 billion of net interest income in 2015, an increase of $34 million or 2%, primarily the result of our solid loan growth. Overall, credit quality continued to be strong with net charge-offs of $75 million or 15 basis points of average loans for the full year, which remains well below the normal historical levels. 
The allowance for loan losses increased $40 million compared to 2014 primarily due to increases in reserves related to Energy and Technology and Life Sciences, partially offset by improvements in credit quality in the remainder of the portfolio. This resulted in a provision for credit losses increasing from the 2014 cyclical low of $27 million to $122 million for 2015. 
Year-over-year, noninterest income was stable, excluding the change to the accounting presentation for a card program. We had increases in card fees, deposit service charges and fiduciary income. This was offset by lower investment banking income primarily due to less activity in the energy market as well as decreases in certain categories impacted by regulatory changes, such as letters of credit. Excluding the impact of a change to the accounting presentation for a card program, noninterest expenses increased $38 million primarily due to increases in technology, regulatory and pension expenses as well as outside processing fees tied to revenue-generating activities. This was partially offset by the release of litigation reserves and cost savings realized in 2015 from certain actions taken in the second half of 2014. 
We repurchased 5.1 million shares and 500,000 warrants in 2015 under our equity repurchase program. Through the buyback and dividends, we returned $389 million or 73% of 2015 net income to shareholders. This reflects our strong capital position and solid financial performance. Our tangible book value per share increased 4% over the past year to $39.41 as we continue to focus on creating long-term shareholder value.
Turning to Slide 5 and an overview of the fourth quarter. Average loans were relatively stable at $48.5 billion compared to the third quarter, and average deposits increased $596 million driven by a $1 billion increase in noninterest-bearing deposits. Revenue increased more than 2% compared to the third quarter. This was a result of growth in net interest income, which benefited from higher nonaccrual interest recoveries and the rise in rates late in the quarter as well as an increase in fee generation, particularly commercial lending and card fees. Technology and regulatory costs drove noninterest expenses higher as anticipated. Negative credit migration in our energy exposure continued as expected while, overall, our customers have been acting prudently as evidenced by declining loan balances. The remainder of the loan book continues to perform well. Finally, we benefited from lower taxes as a result of the early termination of certain leverage lease transactions.
Turning to Slide 6. Most U.S. economic data at year-end showed ongoing momentum, which we expect to continue through 2016. Looking at economic conditions within our primary footprint of Texas, California and Michigan, we continue to see the advantages of our geographic diversity. While Texas is facing headwinds from the energy cycle, California and Michigan provide an important counterbalance. 
Average loans in California were up 8% compared to 2014, while deposits were up 10%. California continues to be a leader in bringing new technology to market. Housing markets should remain strong. Lower regional unemployment rates will contribute to wage growth, supporting the state's large consumer sector. We expect the California economy to grow at a moderate pace in 2016.
Average loans in Michigan were relatively stable compared to 2014, while deposits were up 4%. Michigan's economy has benefited from the recovery of the U.S. auto industry. We expect ongoing job growth to keep labor markets tight and wages improving.
Average growth slowed in Texas with loans up 2% and deposits relatively stable compared to 2014. The overall Texas economy should feel the weight of reduced oil and natural gas drilling activity through 2016. However, the state's economic diversity and business-friendly environment, aided by a healthy U.S. economy, should support economic growth through 2016, albeit at a slower pace. 
As we look forward to the year ahead, we remain keenly focused on growing loans and deposits, along with managing expenses, as we make necessary investments. With the Federal Reserve increasing its benchmark rate 25 basis points in December, our revenue picture looks better as our balance sheet remains well positioned to benefit from potential rising rates. 
With the oil prices at a cyclical low, we have been closely monitoring our energy customers and have increased our reserves in each quarter of 2015. Well into the cycle, we continue to feel comfortable with our Energy portfolio and believe charge-offs will remain manageable.
In summary, we are committed to providing high-quality financial services and building lasting customer relationships, which, combined with our diverse geographic footprint, will continue to assist us in building long-term shareholder value. 
And now I will turn the call over to Karen."

Fourth quarter average loans were relatively stable at $48.5 billion compared to the third quarter. We had strong loan growth in our Commercial Real Estate business as well as our National Dealer business, which typically rebounds in the fourth quarter. This was more than offset by a seasonal decline in mortgage banker loans, along with declines in general Middle Market and Corporate Banking, as we remain disciplined in this highly competitive environment. In addition, Energy continued to decline as expected.
Positive growth trends through November and December resulted in period-end loans above the average for the quarter. As you can see, the quarter ended with loans at $49.1 billion. Total loan commitments were relatively stable, and utilization was unchanged at 50%. Importantly, our pipeline remained strong. Our fourth quarter loan yield increased 7 basis points as shown in the diamonds. We had higher interest collected on nonaccrual loans and benefited from a 25 basis point increase in short-term interest rates late in the quarter, as the Fed raised its benchmark rate on December 16.
Turning to deposits on Slide 8. Average deposits increased $596 million in the fourth quarter from a $1 billion increase in noninterest-bearing deposits. The primary driver was a large increase in Corporate Banking, which was partly offset by declines in Technology and Life Sciences, along with general Middle Market, as we adjust pricing on municipal deposits to reflect the impact of the liquidity coverage ratio. Period-end deposits also increased $1.1 billion to $59.9 billion. 
We continue to prudently manage deposit pricing and have not instituted any standard pricing adjustments in response to the increase in short-term rates. We are closely monitoring our deposit base as well as the market, and we believe we are well positioned with predominately operational relationship-oriented deposits.
As we discussed at a recent Investor Conference during the fourth quarter, we deployed a portion of our excess reserves into securities as shown on Slide 9. Given our continued deposit growth and the likelihood of rate increases occurring in small increments over a longer period of time, in the fourth quarter, we added almost $2 billion, primarily in treasury securities. This strategy generates some additional income while maintaining our asset-sensitive position. At this time, we expect to potentially and modestly add to our securities portfolio based on the movement of our balance sheet and interest rate along with market opportunity. By carefully managing the overall portfolio, we have maintained an estimated duration of under 4 years. 
As you can see in the diamonds on this slide, our portfolio yield was stable resulting from a small decrease in the MBS premium amortization offsetting the mix impact from adding lower yield in treasury securities. Going forward, assuming no change in the rate environment, we expect continued minor pressure on the average securities yield primarily due to the mix shift. As of quarter-end, our estimated LCR ratio continues to meet the fully phased-in 2017 requirement plus the buffer.
Turning to Slide 10. Net interest income grew $11 million or 3% in the fourth quarter. The biggest driver came from the loan portfolio, which contributed $5 million. Higher interest received on nonaccrual loans and an interest in loan yields due to the rise in rates was only partially offset by the decline in lower loans and lower accretion. A larger securities portfolio, lower funding costs and higher interest earned on short-term investments, including higher Federal Reserve deposit balances, each added $2 million. The decline in our wholesale funding costs was driven by a debt maturity late in the third quarter, along with lower interest paid due to the decline in interest-bearing deposits. Our net interest margin increased 4 basis points with higher loan yield offset by higher balances at the Fed. 
Turning to Slide 11. Our overall credit picture remains solid. Net charge-offs were 21 basis points or $26 million, derived mainly from loans related to Energy and, to a lesser extent, Technology and Life Sciences with strong recoveries in a number of our business lines. Our criticized loans grew $295 million to $3.2 billion, which is less than 7% of total loans and continues to be below our average historical level. The increase was driven by a $372 million increase in criticized loans related to Energy.
Total nonaccrual loans were relatively stable at $367 million or 75 basis points of total loans with Energy comprising $161 million, up from $126 million in the third quarter. The fall redetermination process is essentially complete for our E&P customers, which comprise 69% of our Energy business line. Borrowing bases have come down about 10% on average as a result of lower energy prices. About 45% of our customers have improved or stable loan-to-value ratios, and there have been few new collateral deficiencies since the prior redetermination. 
Overall, our borrowers continue to act prudently in this environment. They are aggressively reducing costs, cutting back on capital expenditures, reworking their hedging contracts to provide more runway and preserving liquidity. In addition, they are paying down bank debt through the sale of assets. As a result, our loans in the Energy line of business declined by $173 million this quarter and are down approximately $700 million from the peak at the end of February and utilization remained essentially unchanged at 49% as of the end of the third quarter. 
Importantly, we have virtually no second lien exposure and our Energy services portfolio is a relatively small amount of our total loans. However, given persistently low oil and gas prices, we continue to see negative migration in the Energy book, which has resulted in an increase in criticized loans, nonaccrual loans and charge-offs. As of quarter end, 38% of the loans related to Energy were considered criticized, including 4% on nonaccrual. We had $27 million in charge-offs in our Energy business line and $6 million in Energy-related loans. 
The $35 million provision for our total portfolio reflected charge-offs as well as an increase in our Energy reserves in conjunction with the negative migration and preserving a healthy qualitative reserve. As of quarter-end, our reserve allocation for Energy loans increased and is now greater than 4% of our total Energy and Energy-related loans. Overall, our allowance for credit losses increased $9 million to total $679 million and our allowance-to-loan ratio increased to 1.29%.
Slide 12 outlines noninterest income, which increased $6 million or 2%. The biggest driver was an $8 million increase in commercial lending fees due to robust year-end closing activity, particularly in our syndication area. We also had increases in card fees due to higher revenue from merchant processing, along with letter of credit and foreign exchange income, as we continue to focus on cross-sell opportunity. We did see declines in service charges on deposits due to 5 fewer business days in the quarter as well as fiduciary and brokerage income, which were impacted by core market environment. 
In addition, we had several items that are difficult to predict, specifically: a $6 million increase in deferred compensation, which is offset in noninterest expense; a $4 million decrease in customer-related warrant income; and a $3 million benefit in the third quarter from hedges on our debt that wasn't repeated in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, the year-over-year view of those noninterest income and noninterest expense is not directly comparable. Each quarter this year reflects an accounting presentation that reports the gross revenues and expenses rather than net revenue for a card program.
Turning to Slide 13. Noninterest expenses increased $28 million. Included in the increase were $6 million in benefit in the third quarter that were not repeated from legal reserve releases and forfeiture of executive stock awards. In addition, deferred compensation expense increased $6 million and is offsetting revenue as mentioned. Staff insurance and consulting expenses were seasonally higher, and salaries' expenses increased with higher technology and regulatory-related staffing, including contract labor. Also of note, outside processing fees declined with vendor credit and unusually large collection of customer reimbursement.
Moving to Slide 14 and capital management. As the chart indicates, we continue to return excess capital to our shareholders in a meaningful way with a payout of 79% of fourth quarter earnings. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1.5 million shares for $65 million under the equity repurchase program, reflecting a moderate increase from the $59 million repurchased in each of the past 6 quarters.
Turning to Slide 15. As typical, we provide our outlook for the full year based on a continuation of the current economic and interest rate environment. Overall, we expect our average loan growth to be in line with GDP growth. We expect loan growth in most businesses, led by Commercial Real Estate, Auto Dealer and Technology and Life Sciences. If oil and gas prices remain at low levels, we believe Energy loans should continue to decline. Also keep in mind, competition remains stiff, particularly in Corporate Banking, and we fully intend to maintain our loan pricing and credit discipline.
We expect our net interest income to increase. Assuming current rates do not change, our model indicates that the full year benefit of the recent increase in short-term rates should increase our net interest income by more than $60 million. And while not included in this outlook, we are well positioned to benefit from any further rate increases, which I'll discuss on the next slide. We also expect a growth in loans and securities, net of funding costs, to have a positive effect. 
We expect continued solid credit quality with net charge-offs remaining below historical norms. As far as provision, we expect an increase in reserves in conjunction with loan growth and potential further deterioration in overall credit quality, including an increase in net charge-offs and cyclically low level. If energy prices remain at these very low levels, we would expect to see further reserve build and, ultimately, higher charge-offs. But remember, our Energy business strategy is underwritten to withstand typical volatility in the sector so we continue to expect the credit impact from Energy to be manageable.
Overall, we expect noninterest income to grow modestly primarily due to growth in merchant processing services, government card and commercial card fees as we continue to focus on cross-sell opportunities. And assuming that the market conditions improve, we expect an increase in Wealth Management-related income, such as brokerage service fees and fiduciary income where we continue to see a strong pipeline from our Trust Alliance program. Noncustomer categories, such as warrant income, hedging effectiveness and deferred comp, are difficult to predict but are expected to have a small negative impact. 
As far as noninterest expenses, we have been and will continue to manage through some near-term expense headwinds. 2015 benefited from a $33 million legal reserve reversal that will be essentially offset by an equal decline in our pension expense, primarily due to a rise in long-term rates. As we have indicated, we expect technology projects and regulatory expenses will continue to rise and, together, increase by about $25 million to $30 million in 2016 as we continue to invest in the increasing industry compliance and regulatory demand as well as enhancements in our cybersecurity. Outside processing expense is expected to increase in line with growing revenue, particularly card fees. Also, a recent regulatory proposal for an FDIC surcharge may drive that expense up and a forfeiture of restricted stock and leverage lease terminations that benefited 2015 are not expected to be repeated. Finally, we expect to see typical inflationary pressures on several line items, including annual merit, staff insurance and occupancy. 
Rest assured that as we continue to navigate through this low rate environment and even as rates rise, we are focused on maintaining our expense discipline, carefully managing our workforce and driving efficiency for the long term through continued review of processes, judiciously negotiating contracts and leveraging technology, when possible. We expect these efforts will be apparent in several line items, such as consulting, telecom, travel and entertainment and legal fees. Lastly, while not on this slide, I would point out that we estimate our tax rate will be approximately 32% of pretax income.
Turning to Slide 16. As I mentioned, our outlook assumes the current rate environment and no rising rates. For illustrative purposes, we ran a simulation using the implied forward curve for 30-day LIBOR, the rate to which we are most sensitive. On the left side of the slide, we show the forward curve that assumes 30-day LIBOR reaches about 100 basis points at year-end or 90 basis points on average in the fourth quarter. In this case, which incorporates a dynamic balance sheet assuming historical relationships, our net interest income could increase a further $55 million to $60 million for the full year. The right side of the slide provides our standard asset liability case and shows that a 200 basis point increase in rates over a 1-year period, equivalent to 100 basis points on average, would result a benefit to net interest income of about $210 million. There are also several alternative assumptions to our standard case, including the pace of deposit, loan and rate changes, and in all cases, we remain well positioned for rising rates.
In closing, we are pleased with the increase in our revenue and continued deposit growth and our overall credit quality has remained strong as we've been navigating the energy cycle. While it remains a challenging environment for us and the industry, given the persistently low rates and energy price environment, combined with increased regulatory requirements and technology demand, we will continue to be keenly focused on the long term and the things we can control. And with the first rate increase behind us, our revenue picture looks better.

We don't have much in the way of Energy Services, and the portfolio continues to contract and throwing out a fair amount of reserves. The other thing I would mention that's important is, is that when we're calculating that allocation, included in the denominator, is all of our Energy-related exposure, which includes investment-grade credits. It includes middle market credits that may or may not be impacted at all by energy prices. And then, I guess, the last thing that we look at is we have $680 million of reserves in total. And because we don't have other issues going on in the portfolio, we look at that entire reserve as available to address any issues that come up in Energy."

It is really difficult to say with any degree of certainty what that impact could be, because prices are only one component on our reserve. There are lots of other components that impact our customer's performance. They would include continued reduction in cash cost and ability to sell assets, extension of hedges and access to capital market. But know that because prices have dropped precipitously, particularly since year-end, we have done an analysis with oil prices remaining at $30 for the entire year. And based on that analysis and conservatively assuming a static portfolio, we would estimate that the impact to our Energy reserves could be $75 million to $125 million, which, we still believe, remains manageable. And I would also want you to keep in mind that ultimate losses could be much less than that amount. Our Energy business line is very granular, and we do expect Energy loans to continue to decline, which does free up reserves, plus our allowance is also impacted by the performance of the remainder of the portfolio, which does continue to improve."

In the fall, when the capital markets were largely closed, they sold assets to reduce their loans outstanding to make sure they are in compliance with the borrowing bases. So it's a two-way street.

We talked about the fact that we've got increases in technology and regulatory expense of about $25 million to $30 million and outside processing in line with growing revenue, along with typical inflationary pressures and the potential for the FDIC increase. Relative to the fourth quarter, I would say the fourth quarter is a decent guide, but keep in mind there's lots of moving pieces particularly on a quarterly basis. Number of days impact the quarter. The first half typically has higher stock and incentive comp and higher seasonal payroll taxes. The second half is impacted by merit raises and increasing staff insurance cost.

Before getting into our quarterly results, I'd like to directly address the recent discussions of our fundamental performance. I've talked to many of our shareholders over the past several months and have listened closely to their feedback a",1622,"Good morning. Before getting into our quarterly results, I'd like to directly address the recent discussions of our fundamental performance. I've talked to many of our shareholders over the past several months and have listened closely to their feedback and suggestions. 
I want to make sure everyone recognizes that I, along with the rest of the Comerica board, hear and understand the desire for improved returns. Rest assured, we share the same goals as all of our shareholders for enhancing value. 
I know that we must earn our right to remain independent every day, and our management team and Board are committed to doing what is in the best interest of our shareholders. We are a Business Bank at our core, dedicated to providing high-quality financial services and building lasting client relationships. We operate Comerica for the ultimate benefit of our shareholders, and all of our actions are directed to maximize value while not compromising our commitment to our clients, our culture, regulatory standing, responsible underwriting and strong risk management. 
We have also always been a conservative commercial bank, which results in lower lending yields compared to many industry peers. But our discipline has also meant less loss damage during economic contractions, which was proven through the last cycle. 
Also as a Business Bank, our model, by its nature, is more interest rate-sensitive, which clearly has hurt us. Historically, we actively hedged our rate sensitivity but sees these rates fell. In hindsight, we left too much yield on the table during a weak recovery with prolonged price competition. 
However, our yield GAAP to peers has been slowly closing without any shift in our conservative culture and without relying on rising rates. This is in no part small -- reflecting our greater emphasis and success in both sector specialization and middle market lending, which comprise over 50% of our portfolio and provide some of the highest return. 
Our growth opportunities align with our commercial bank model, where client relationships are stickier. Our Business Bank is national class, and we are a trusted adviser with long-tenured employees, who have deep expertise in the businesses they serve. Many of our high-caliber clients have banked with us for generations, and beyond serving their business needs, we have integrated our strong retail and wealth management capabilities to further cement these relationships. 
We also have a strong treasury management platform with an improved merchant offering and are one of the top commercial card issuers, and through the cycle, we posted superior credit metrics. At the same time, as you know, we have been managing for years at an extremely low rate environment along with a slow-growing economy, a host of increasing regulatory and technology demands and more recently, the energy cycle headwinds. 
In light of the mounting challenges we have faced, we took actions to reduce costs, including judiciously renegotiating vendor contracts, reducing real estate and rationalizing some operation. 
In addition, last year, our key senior leaders did not receive the normal merit increase as well as our 3-year incentive payment. Our pay-for-performance comp structure reflects our strong alignment to shareholders. 
As a result of these efforts, our 2015 expense to earning assets ratio was better than all but one of our peers. However, we, along with nearly half of our peers, have not achieved double-digit return on equity. As a result, we have been undertaking a more intense review of our expense and revenue base. 
To help us in these efforts, we have engaged Boston Consulting Group, a globally recognized management consulting firm that is very familiar with a range of challenges the U.S. banking industry is facing. While this process is in its early days, we fully expect to identify meaningful opportunities to operate more efficiently and lower expenses as well as drive increased revenue even in the current environment. 
We are taking an expeditious yet comprehensive and thoughtful approach to executing this type of program with the goal of building a stronger, more competitive and more profitable organization. And given the breadth of the review, we plan to provide more information around the opportunities identified by the next quarterly earnings call, and we intend to deliver to our shareholders, as soon as practical, a broad, enterprise-wide plan designed to help reach tangible targets. 
We are going to pursue this cost and revenue initiative with the urgency it deserves and continue to utilize our strengths and competitive position to improve our results. And if other strategic alternatives present themselves that are realistic, achievable and will maximize shareholder value, we will not hesitate to consider them. 
That said, it's important to realize that when considering any strategic alternative, timing, economic developments and industry condition, like what's occurring in the energy space, must all be taken into account. 
Over the last 5 quarters, we have been impacted by the current oil and gas cycle. We have been appropriately increasing our reserve allocation for energy loans over that time, and we have significantly increased them in the first quarter to nearly 8% of total energy loans. 
A year ago, our total energy commitments were $6.9 billion. Today, they are $5.6 billion, a decline of $1.3 billion. Outstandings have declined also during that time by $500 million to $3.1 billion. 
Overall, our borrowers are aggressively reducing cost, cutting back on capital expenditures and preserving liquidity. In addition, they are paying down bank debt through the sale of assets, which are generally sold at prices significantly higher than reflected in the borrowing base. 
Utilization has increased slightly to 54%, driven by the decline in total commitments. While you are all very understandably following reserve to loan ratios across multiple energy portfolios in the banking system, it is important to understand the risk differences. 
Our energy portfolio consists of 70% E&P, 16% midstream and 14% services. Within E&P, the well or field diversity of our customer base is spread broadly across the major producing basins in the country. We have very little deepwater exposure and only 2 second-lien loans totaling $18 million. 
Typically, we do not make high-yield, unsecured or second-lien loans and less than half of our E&P relationships have high-yield debt behind our senior position. Our risk ratings and current reserve allocation for energy reflects a rigorous review of every relationship. We've been prudently downgrading loans, taking into consideration our customers' expected operating cash flows in continuing depressed price environment and the resulting total leverage. We believe we are being realistic in our assessment of the probability of default, given our expectation that prices may remain lower for longer. 
The provision increase in the first quarter reflected the high end of the range in our 2016 guidance where the incremental impact of energy loans adjusted upward for revised regulatory guidance and includes of the results of the Shared National Credit exam. However, it is important to note that our fundamental view on the energy sector has not changed significantly. 
While the current oil and gas cycle presents a challenge, we believe we are adequately reserved. Keep in mind, those reserves may not turn into ultimate losses. We also look beyond direct energy risk, and we remain comfortable with our Texas commercial real estate exposure. We have not seen any noteworthy deterioration in our Texas portfolio outside of our energy book. 
I believe that we have a framework for delivering enhanced shareholder value and are moving with urgency to execute against our strategic priority to drive meaningful, improved returns for our shareholders. 
Now I will move on to our first quarter results, turning to Slide 4. Absent the impact of energy, our overall results were solid. 
In particular, we saw a significant benefit from the December rate increase. Average loans were stable at $48.4 billion. Increases in Commercial Real Estate and National Dealer Services were offset by decreases in general Middle Market as well as a cyclical decline in Energy and seasonality in Mortgage Banker Finance. 
Average total deposits decreased $3 billion to $56.7 billion, reflecting our relationship banking strategy as well as purposeful pricing and strategic actions taken in light of the LCR rules. Typical seasonality was also a factor as deposits declined in January and February followed by growth in March. The majority of the deposit decline on a period-end basis was relative to our -- to an elevated deposit level associated with our government card product at year-end. 
Net interest income increased $14 million or 3% quarter-over-quarter. The Fed's December rate hike is expected to add about $90 million for the year as the bulk of our loan portfolio is floating rate. The benefit of the rate rise in the first quarter was partially offset by lower nonaccrual interest, fewer days in the quarter and several other smaller items. Aside from the provision for energy loans that I already discussed, overall credit quality continue to be solid. 
Total net credit related charge-offs were $58 million or 49 basis points of average loans. Excluding energy, net charge-offs for the remainder of the portfolio remain low at $16 million or 15 basis points. 
Noninterest income declined $22 million following strong commercial lending fees in the fourth quarter, particularly for syndication fees. Noninterest expenses decreased $24 million or 5%, primarily reflecting a $14 million decrease in salary and benefits as well as decreases in many other categories such as consulting fees, advertising, occupancy expenses. 
Our capital position is solid. In light of the earnings impact from the deterioration of the energy book, we remain disciplined and repurchased 1.2 million shares under our equity repurchase program. We continue to return excess capital to our shareholders in a meaningful way as we have for many years. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Karen, who will go over the quarter in more detail."
318670,327147619,959301,"Comerica Incorporated, Q1 2016 Earnings Call, Apr 19, 2016",2016-04-19,"Earnings Calls","Comerica Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Ralph, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 5. First quarter average loans were basically stable at $48.4 billion compared to the fourth quarter. We had good loan growth in our Commercial Real Estate business, driven primarily from cons",1721,"Thank you, Ralph, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 5. First quarter average loans were basically stable at $48.4 billion compared to the fourth quarter. We had good loan growth in our Commercial Real Estate business, driven primarily from construction draws on attractive projects with proven developers and continued conservative credit parameters such as high equity content. 
Also, our National Dealer business was seasonally higher. This growth was offset by a decline in general Middle Market as we remain disciplined in this highly competitive environment as well as seasonal decreases in Mortgage Banker loans and the continued cyclical decline in Energy. 
Importantly, positive growth trends for February and March reflected in period-end loans $1 billion above the average for the quarter, and our stronger pipeline increased further. 
Total loan commitments declined, led by Energy, resulting in utilization increasing to 51%. Our first quarter loan yields increased 14 basis points, reflecting the increase in short-term interest rates in December, continuing loan price discipline and wider spreads on energy loans, partially offset by lower fees in the margin and a decline in interest collected on nonaccrual loans following an extraordinarily high fourth quarter. 
Turning to deposits on Slide 6. Our deposit cost remained low and stable at 14 basis points as we continue to prudently manage pricing. We have not instituted any standard pricing adjustments in response to the December increase in short-term rates. We are closely monitoring our deposit base as well as the market, and we believe we are well positioned with predominantly operational relationship-oriented deposit. Of note, our loan to deposit ratio remained low at 87%. 
Turning to Slide 7. As you know, during the fourth quarter, we deployed a portion of our excess reserves into securities, given the likelihood of rate increases occurring in small increments over a longer period of time. As you can see in the diamonds on the slide, our portfolio yield declined modestly, resulting from the mix impact of adding lower-yielding treasury securities along with continued depressed yields on replacement security. 
Going forward, assuming no change in the rate environment, we expect continued minor pressure on the average securities yield, primarily due to reinvestment of prepaids at slightly lower rates. As of quarter end, our estimated LCR ratio continues to meet the fully phased-in 2017 requirement plus a buffer. 
Turning to Slide 8. The December rise in short-term rates positively impacted us in the quarter. As Ralph mentioned, net interest income grew $14 million or 3%, and the net interest margin expanded by 23 basis points. The largest factor was a benefit from higher LIBOR and prime-based rates on our loan portfolio, which added $20 million as well as slightly wider loan spreads. This was partially offset by lower interest received on nonaccrual loans and lower fees. 
Other loan impacts included 1 fewer day and slightly lower balances. A larger securities portfolio added $6 million. The higher interest rate earned on Federal Reserve deposits was more than offset by lower balances, resulting in a $2 million negative impact. Higher interest rates also resulted in a modest increase in our floating rate wholesale funding costs. 
In total, higher rates contributed about $22 million to the increase in net interest income. As we've indicated, we expect that if deposit rates hold at their current level, the upside from the first rate hike will be about $90 million for the full year over the 2015 level. 
Turning to Slide 9. As you can see in the bottom-right table, aside from Energy, our overall credit picture remain strong. Criticized loans were $3.9 billion at quarter end with close to half attributed to Energy loans. While the level of criticized Energy loans continues to increase as we prudently downgrade, we are not seeing any meaningful negative migration in the remainder of the portfolio, where less than 5% of the loans are considered criticized. Close to 2/3 of our non-accruals are Energy loans, and the quarter-over-quarter increase is almost entirely from Energy. 
Net credit-related charge-offs were 49 basis points or $58 million, also derived mainly from Energy. Our other business lines had low charge-offs and strong recoveries. The $148 million provision for our total portfolio reflected an increase in our Energy reserves as a result of the negative migration, along with charge-offs and the preservation of a qualitative reserve. 
Overall, our allowance for credit losses increased $91 million to total $770 million, and our allowance to loan ratio increased to 1.47%. 
Slide 10 provides further detail on our Energy portfolio, which at quarter end totaled $3.1 billion outstanding, equivalent to 6% of our total loan. E&P loans comprised 70% of our Energy portfolio, and we are 26% through the spring redetermination process. So far, borrowing bases have come down about 22% on average as a result of lower Energy prices. We had a handful of customers drawdown lines as they prepare to restructure their high-yield debt, which resulted in period-end loans remaining relatively stable in the first quarter. However, those balances have come down since quarter end, and we expect that trend to continue. 
Energy Services loans totaled $426 million or 14% of Energy loans and less than 1% of our total loan portfolio. These loans have declined 11% over the past quarter. Energy Services has been hit the hardest, and 65% are rated criticized. However, average balance sheet leverage for the bulk of the portfolio is under 2:1, which speaks to the financial wherewithal of these customers. 
Although approximately 14% of our Energy loans are nonaccrual, 89% of these nonaccrual loans are fully current on interest payments, including the 3 loans we have in bankruptcy. The reserve for Energy loans is close to 8%, and as Ralph mentioned, those reserves may not turn into ultimate losses. 
Aside from our Energy business line, we identified early in the cycle about 100 customers and other businesses that have a sizable portion of their revenue related to Energy or could otherwise be disproportionately negatively impacted by prolonged low oil and gas prices. Those loans now total $534 million and have declined 14% since year-end and 28% from a year ago. 
Losses this quarter were $3 million, and we continue to monitor these loans closely. However, we have not seen any significant credit migration over the last quarter, and balances are declining nicely. 
Slide 11 outlines noninterest income, which decreased $22 million. The biggest driver was a $10 million decrease in commercial lending fees following robust fourth quarter activity, particularly in our syndication area as well as a decline in unutilized fees due to the decrease in line of credit commitments. 
In addition, we had several items that are difficult to predict. Specifically, a $7 million decrease in deferred compensation, which is offset in noninterest expense; a $2 million securities loss; and a $2 million decline in BOLI income. As you can see in the shaded area, excluding deferred comp, first quarter noninterest income was in line with the same period last year, reflecting seasonally softer fee income. 
Turning to slide 12. Noninterest expenses decreased 5% or $24 million, reflecting our tight ongoing control of expenses. Salaries and benefits expense was $14 million lower due to the $8 million decline in pension expense and $7 million decrease in deferred compensation expense, which is offset in revenue, as I've mentioned. Lower technology and regulatory-related staffing as well as 1 fewer day were offset essentially by annual stock compensation. 
Moving to Slide 13 and capital management. We continue to return excess capital to our shareholders in a meaningful way with the repurchase of 1.2 million shares under the equity repurchase program. While we prudently scaled back the dollar amount of our repurchases, we were able to repurchase a similar number of shares to the prior quarters and continued to decrease our total shares outstanding. 
We submitted our CCAR plan for the 2016-2017 cycle earlier this month and expect to receive the results in mid-June. As you would expect, we remain focused on returning excess capital to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. 
Turning to Slide 14. You heard both Ralph and me mention already that we expect the year-over-year benefit in net interest income from the rate rise that has already occurred to be about $90 million, assuming deposit prices continue to remain stable. The table on this slide gives some estimated additional upside to net interest income over the annual period following a rate rise. 
For example, if the Federal Reserve raises its rates 25 basis points and our deposit prices begin to move with that rise at a 25% beta, we believe we would gain about $70 million more in annualized net interest income. Of course, our interest rate sensitivities are based on many assumptions, not just upon the pricing assumptions. Our standard modeling and the list of assumptions we used are included in the appendix. 
Turning to Slide 15 and our outlook. Excluding the first quarter Energy impact to provision, our expectations for the full year have not changed significantly. However, as Ralph mentioned, with the continuation of the low rate environment and slow-growing economy, we are embarking on initiative to reduce expenses and drive revenue. Because it is still early in that process, we are not able to provide better insight into its impact on our 2016 outlook, particularly relating to revenues and expenses. 
As far as credit, given the larger provision this quarter, we do want to provide color around our expectations for the rest of the year. At this point, we believe we are adequately reserved. Any movement from here will be driven by developments in the Energy sector, which are inherently difficult to predict. 
We expect continued solid credit quality for the remainder of the portfolio with metrics, absent energy, to remain better than historical norms. With the significant reserve build we established in the first quarter, if the energy outlook remains stable, we would expect the provision for the rest of the year to reflect net charge-offs between 45 and 55 basis points, similar to the last couple of quarters. Additional reserve changes would depend on a variety of factors, the biggest being oil and gas prices as well as our energy customers ability to cut cost, raise equity, sell assets and reduce debt, among other things. 
Now, I'll turn the call back to Ralph."

I don't think people are expecting rig counts to go up at this -- these price levels. The good news there again is, is that our Energy Services portfolio is small, and it's probably about 1/2 or 1/3 of it that's performing just fine even at these low prices.

You'll see in our standard model for asset sensitivity in the appendix that in that standard, 100 basis point rise on average in an annual period, it's still about $200 million. That is something that we continue to assess all the time. We may end up purchasing more securities over time, but it will clearly be dependent on our balance sheet movement and any opportunities that are out there. Since December, when we purchased additional securities, rates -- longer rates have been near their 3-year lows. So it's not necessarily an opportune time right now, but we will continue to assess.

Before getting into our quarterly results, I'd like to directly address the recent discussions of our fundamental performance.

Before getting into our quarterly results, I'd like to directly address the recent discussions of our fundamental performance. I've talked to many of our shareholders over the past several months and have listened closely to their feedback and suggestions.
I want to make sure everyone recognizes that I, along with the rest of the Comerica board, hear and understand the desire for improved returns. Rest assured, we share the same goals as all of our shareholders for enhancing value.
I know that we must earn our right to remain independent every day, and our management team and Board are committed to doing what is in the best interest of our shareholders. We are a Business Bank at our core, dedicated to providing high-quality financial services and building lasting client relationships. We operate Comerica for the ultimate benefit of our shareholders, and all of our actions are directed to maximize value while not compromising our commitment to our clients, our culture, regulatory standing, responsible underwriting and strong risk management.
We have also always been a conservative commercial bank, which results in lower lending yields compared to many industry peers. But our discipline has also meant less loss damage during economic contractions, which was proven through the last cycle.
Also, as a Business Bank, our model, by its nature, is more interest rate-sensitive, which clearly has hurt us. Historically, we actively hedged our rate sensitivity but sees these rates fell. In hindsight, we left too much yield on the table during a weak recovery with prolonged price competition.
However, our yield GAAP to peers has been slowly closing without any shift in our conservative culture and without relying on rising rates. This is in no part small -- reflecting our greater emphasis and success in both sector specialization and middle market lending, which comprise over 50% of our portfolio and provide some of the highest returns.
Our growth opportunities align with our commercial bank model, where client relationships are stickier. Our Business Bank is national class, and we are a trusted adviser with long-tenured employees, who have deep expertise in the businesses they serve. Many of our high-caliber clients have banked with us for generations, and beyond serving their business needs, we have integrated our strong retail and wealth management capabilities to further cement these relationships.
We also have a strong treasury management platform with an improved merchant offering and are one of the top commercial card issuers. And through the cycle, we posted superior credit metrics. At the same time, as you know, we have been managing for years at an extremely low rate environment along with a slow-growing economy, a host of increasing regulatory and technology demands and, more recently, the energy cycle headwinds.
In light of the mounting challenges we have faced, we took actions to reduce costs, including judiciously renegotiating vendor contracts, reducing real estate and rationalizing some operations.
In addition, last year, our key senior leaders did not receive the normal merit increase as well as our 3-year incentive payment. Our pay-for-performance comp structure reflects our strong alignment with shareholders.
As a result of these efforts, our 2015 expense to earning assets ratio was better than all but one of our peers. However, we, along with nearly half of our peers, have not achieved double-digit return on equity. As a result, we have been undertaking a more intense review of our expense and revenue base.
To help us in these efforts, we have engaged Boston Consulting Group, a globally recognized management consulting firm, that is very familiar with a range of challenges the U.S. banking industry is facing. While this process is in its early days, we fully expect to identify meaningful opportunities to operate more efficiently and lower expenses as well as drive increased revenue even in the current environment.
We are taking an expeditious yet comprehensive and thoughtful approach to executing this type of program with the goal of building a stronger, more competitive and more profitable organization. Given the breadth of the review, we plan to provide more information around the opportunities identified by the next quarterly earnings call. And we intend to deliver to our shareholders, as soon as practical, a broad, enterprise-wide plan designed to help reach tangible targets.
We are going to pursue this cost and revenue initiative with the urgency it deserves and continue to utilize our strengths and competitive position to improve our results. And if other strategic alternatives present themselves that are realistic, achievable and will maximize shareholder value, we will not hesitate to consider them.
That said, it's important to realize that when considering any strategic alternative, timing, economic developments and industry condition, like what's occurring in the energy space, must all be taken into account.
Over the last 5 quarters, we have been impacted by the current oil and gas cycle. We have been appropriately increasing our reserve allocation for energy loans over that time, and we have significantly increased them in the first quarter to nearly 8% of total energy loans.
A year ago, our total energy commitments were $6.9 billion. Today, they are $5.6 billion, a decline of $1.3 billion. Outstandings have declined also during that time by $500 million to $3.1 billion.
Overall, our borrowers are aggressively reducing cost, cutting back on capital expenditures and preserving liquidity. In addition, they are paying down bank debt through the sale of assets, which are generally sold at prices significantly higher than reflected in the borrowing base.
Utilization has increased slightly to 54%, driven by the decline in total commitments. While you are all very understandably following reserve-to-loan ratios across multiple energy portfolios in the banking system, it is important to understand the risk differences.
Our energy portfolio consists of 70% E&P, 16% midstream and 14% services. Within E&P, the well or field diversity of our customer base is spread broadly across the major producing basins in the country. We have very little deepwater exposure and only 2 second-lien loans totaling $18 million.
Typically, we do not make high-yield, unsecured or second-lien loans and less than half of our E&P relationships have high-yield debt behind our senior position. Our risk ratings and current reserve allocation for energy, reflects our rigorous review of every relationship. We've been prudently downgrading loans, taking into consideration our customers' expected operating cash flows in continuing depressed price environment and the resulting total leverage. We believe we are being realistic in our assessment of the probability of default, given our expectation that prices may remain lower for longer.
The provision increase in the first quarter reflected the high end of the range in our 2016 guidance, where the incremental impact of energy loans adjusted upward for revised regulatory guidance and includes the results of the Shared National Credit exam. However, it is important to note that our fundamental view on the energy sector has not changed significantly.
While the current oil and gas cycle presents a challenge, we believe we are adequately reserved. Keep in mind, those reserves may not turn into ultimate losses. We also look beyond direct energy risk, and we remain comfortable with our Texas commercial real estate exposure. We have not seen any noteworthy deterioration in our Texas portfolio outside of our energy book.
I believe that we have a framework for delivering enhanced shareholder value and are moving with urgency to execute against our strategic priority to drive meaningful, improved returns for our shareholders.
Now I will move on to our first quarter results, turning to Slide 4. Absent the impact of energy, our overall results were solid.
In particular, we saw a significant benefit from the December rate increase. Average loans were stable at $48.4 billion. Increases in Commercial Real Estate and National Dealer Services were offset by decreases in general Middle Market as well as a cyclical decline in Energy and seasonality in Mortgage Banker Finance. 
Average total deposits decreased $3 billion to $56.7 billion, reflecting our relationship banking strategy as well as purposeful pricing and strategic actions taken in light of the LCR rules. Typical seasonality was also a factor as deposits declined in January and February, followed by growth in March. The majority of the deposit decline on a period-end basis was relative to our -- to an elevated deposit level associated with our government card product at year-end.
Net interest income increased $14 million or 3% quarter-over-quarter. The Fed's December rate hike is expected to add about $90 million for the year as the bulk of our loan portfolio is floating rate. The benefit of the rate rise in the first quarter was partially offset by lower nonaccrual interest, fewer days in the quarter and several other smaller items. Aside from the provision for energy loans that I already discussed, overall credit quality continued to be solid.
Total net credit related charge-offs were $58 million or 49 basis points of average loans. Excluding energy, net charge-offs for the remainder of the portfolio remained low at $16 million or 15 basis points.
Noninterest income declined $22 million following strong commercial lending fees in the fourth quarter, particularly for syndication fees. Noninterest expenses decreased $24 million or 5%, primarily reflecting a $14 million decrease in salary and benefits as well as decreases in many other categories such as consulting fees, advertising, occupancy expenses.
Our capital position is solid. In light of the earnings impact from the deterioration of the energy book, we remain disciplined and repurchased 1.2 million shares under our equity repurchase program. We continue to return excess capital to our shareholders in a meaningful way, as we have for many years.
Now I will turn the call over to Karen, who will go over the quarter in more detail."

First quarter average loans were basically stable at $48.4 billion compared to the fourth quarter. We had good loan growth in our Commercial Real Estate business, driven primarily from construction draws on attractive projects with proven developers and continued conservative credit parameters such as high equity content.
Also, our National Dealer business was seasonally higher. This growth was offset by a decline in general Middle Market, as we remain disciplined in this highly competitive environment, as well as seasonal decreases in Mortgage Banker loans and the continued cyclical decline in Energy.
Importantly, positive growth trends for February and March resulted in period-end loans $1 billion above the average for the quarter, and our stronger pipeline increased further.
Total loan commitments declined, led by Energy, resulting in utilization increasing to 51%. Our first quarter loan yields increased 14 basis points, reflecting the increase in short-term interest rates in December, continuing loan price discipline and wider spreads on energy loans, partially offset by lower fees in the margin and a decline in interest collected on nonaccrual loans, following an extraordinarily high fourth quarter.
Turning to deposits on Slide 6. Our deposit cost remained low and stable at 14 basis points as we continue to prudently manage pricing. We have not instituted any standard pricing adjustments in response to the December increase in short-term rates. We are closely monitoring our deposit base as well as the market. And we believe we are well positioned with predominantly operational relationship-oriented deposit. Of note, our loan-to-deposit ratio remained low at 87%.
Turning to Slide 7. As you know, during the fourth quarter, we deployed a portion of our excess reserves into securities, given the likelihood of rate increases occurring in small increments over a longer period of time. As you can see in the diamonds on the slide, our portfolio yield declined modestly, resulting from the mix impact of adding lower-yielding treasury securities along with continued depressed yields on replacement securities.
Going forward, assuming no change in the rate environment, we expect continued minor pressure on the average securities yield, primarily due to reinvestment of prepaids at slightly lower rates. As of quarter end, our estimated LCR ratio continues to meet the fully phased-in 2017 requirement plus a buffer.
Turning to Slide 8. The December rise in short-term rates positively impacted us in the quarter. As Ralph mentioned, net interest income grew $14 million or 3%, and the net interest margin expanded by 23 basis points. The largest factor was a benefit from higher LIBOR and prime-based rates on our loan portfolio, which added $20 million, as well as slightly wider loan spreads. This was partially offset by lower interest received on nonaccrual loans and lower fees.
Other loan impacts included 1 fewer day and slightly lower balances. A larger securities portfolio added $6 million. The higher interest rate earned on Federal Reserve deposits was more than offset by lower balances, resulting in a $2 million negative impact. Higher interest rates also resulted in a modest increase in our floating rate wholesale funding costs.
In total, higher rates contributed about $22 million to the increase in net interest income. As we've indicated, we expect that if deposit rates hold at their current level, the upside from the first rate hike will be about $90 million for the full year over the 2015 level.
Turning to Slide 9. As you can see in the bottom-right table, aside from Energy, our overall credit picture remained strong. Criticized loans were $3.9 billion at quarter end with close to half attributed to Energy loans. While the level of criticized Energy loans continues to increase as we prudently downgrade. We are not seeing any meaningful negative migration in the remainder of the portfolio, where less than 5% of the loans are considered criticized. Close to 2/3 of our non-accruals are Energy loans, and the quarter-over-quarter increase is almost entirely from Energy.
Net credit-related charge-offs were 49 basis points or $58 million, also derived mainly from Energy. Our other business lines had low charge-offs and strong recoveries. The $148 million provision for our total portfolio reflected an increase in our Energy reserves as a result of the negative migration, along with charge-offs and the preservation of a qualitative reserve.
Overall, our allowance for credit losses increased $91 million to total $770 million, and our allowance to loan ratio increased to 1.47%.
Slide 10 provides further detail on our Energy portfolio, which at quarter-end totaled $3.1 billion outstanding, equivalent to 6% of our total loan. E&P loans comprised 70% of our Energy portfolio, and we are 26% through the spring redetermination process. So far, borrowing bases have come down about 22% on average as a result of lower Energy prices. We had a handful of customers' drawdown lines as they prepare to restructure their high-yield debt, which resulted in period-end loans remaining relatively stable in the first quarter. However, those balances have come down since quarter end, and we expect that trend to continue.
Energy Services loans totaled $426 million or 14% of Energy loans and less than 1% of our total loan portfolio. These loans have declined 11% over the past quarter. Energy Services has been hit the hardest, and 65% are rated criticized. However, average balance sheet leverage for the bulk of the portfolio is under 2:1, which speaks to the financial wherewithal of these customers.
Although approximately 14% of our Energy loans are nonaccrual, 89% of these nonaccrual loans are fully current on interest payments, including the 3 loans we have in bankruptcy. The reserve for Energy loans is close to 8%, and as Ralph mentioned, those reserves may not turn into ultimate losses.
Aside from our Energy business line, we identified early in the cycle about 100 customers and other businesses that have a sizable portion of their revenue related to Energy or could otherwise be disproportionately negatively impacted by prolonged low oil and gas prices. Those loans now total $534 million and have declined 14% since year-end and 28% from a year ago.
Losses this quarter were $3 million, and we continue to monitor these loans closely. However, we have not seen significant negative credit migration over the last quarter, and balances are declining nicely.
Slide 11 outlines noninterest income, which decreased $22 million. The biggest driver was a $10 million decrease in commercial lending fees following robust fourth quarter activity, particularly in our syndication area as well as a decline in unutilized fees due to the decrease in line of credit commitments.
In addition, we had several items that are difficult to predict. Specifically, a $7 million decrease in deferred compensation, which is offset in noninterest expense; a $2 million securities loss; and a $2 million decline in BOLI income. As you can see in the shaded area, excluding deferred comp, first quarter noninterest income was in line with the same period last year, reflecting seasonally softer fee income.
Turning to slide 12. Noninterest expenses decreased 5% or $24 million, reflecting our tight ongoing control of expenses. Salaries and benefits expense was $14 million lower due to the $8 million decline in pension expense and $7 million decrease in deferred compensation expense, which is offset in revenue, as I've mentioned. Lower technology and regulatory-related staffing as well as 1 fewer day were offset essentially by annual stock compensation.
Moving to Slide 13 and capital management. We continue to return excess capital to our shareholders in a meaningful way with the repurchase of 1.2 million shares under the equity repurchase program. While we prudently scaled back the dollar amount of our repurchases, we were able to repurchase a similar number of shares to the prior quarters and continued to decrease our total shares outstanding.
We submitted our CCAR plan for the 2016-2017 cycle earlier this month and expect to receive the results in mid-June. As you would expect, we remain focused on returning excess capital to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases.
Turning to Slide 14. You heard both Ralph and me mention already that we expect the year-over-year benefit to net interest income from the rate rise that has already occurred to be about $90 million, assuming deposit prices continue to remain stable. The table on this slide gives some estimated additional upside to net interest income over the annual period following a rate rise.
For example, if the Federal Reserve raises its rates 25 basis points and our deposit prices begin to move with that rise at a 25% beta, we believe we would gain about $70 million more in annualized net interest income. Of course, our interest rate sensitivities are based on many assumptions, not just upon the pricing assumptions. Our standard modeling and the list of assumptions we used are included in the appendix.
Turning to Slide 15 and our outlook. Excluding the first quarter Energy impact to provision, our expectations for the full year have not changed significantly. However, as Ralph mentioned, with the continuation of the low-rate environment and slow-growing economy, we are embarking on an initiative to reduce expenses and drive revenue. Because it is still early in that process, we are not able to provide better insight into its impact on our 2016 outlook, particularly relating to revenues and expenses.
As far as credit, given the larger provision this quarter, we do want to provide color around our expectations for the rest of the year. At this point, we believe we are adequately reserved. Any movement from here will be driven by developments in the Energy sector, which are inherently difficult to predict.
We expect continued solid credit quality for the remainder of the portfolio with metrics, absent energy, to remain better than historical norms. With the significant reserve build we established in the first quarter, if the energy outlook remains stable, we would expect the provision for the rest of the year to reflect net charge-offs between 45 and 55 basis points, similar to the last couple of quarters. Additional reserve changes would depend on a variety of factors, the biggest being oil and gas prices as well as our energy customers' ability to cut cost, raise equity, sell assets and reduce debt, among other things.
Now, I'll turn the call back to Ralph."

And I can tell you that list today is much smaller than it was a month or 2 ago. First, a lot of those credits, their borrowing basis had been reduced as a result of redeterminations. Others have agreed not to draw, which is a good thing. And the vast majority of our borrowers are doing the opposite. They're selling assets. They're raising capital to make sure that they are staying within the confines of what they expect the new borrowing base to be. So yes, we're really pleased to see that, and as Ralph mentioned, we really didn't have much in the way of defensive draws this quarter. And that's why our loans were flat. They didn't grow. And I can also tell you that they've come down a fair amount since then. We're down about $125 million this month over the peak of March.

We have, obviously, been focused on having some upside in this prolonged low rate environment. At the end of December, you'll remember that we purchased -- took about $2 billion of our excess reserves at the Fed and purchased treasury and Ginnie Mae securities, put those out longer term. That added about $6 million this quarter alone from that move. That did take a little bit of asset sensitivity off the table, not a lot. You'll see in our standard model for asset sensitivity in the Appendix that in that standard, 100 basis point rise on average in an annual period, it's still about $200 million. That is something that we continue to assess all the time. We may end up purchasing more securities over time, but it will clearly be dependent on our balance sheet movement and any opportunities that are out there. Since December, when we purchased additional securities, rates -- longer rates have been near their 3-year lows. So it's not necessarily an opportune time right now, but we will continue to assess. And as Ralph mentioned, in our history, we have used basic floating -- fixed to floating hedges on our portfolio, and at some point, we'll introduce that again."

Before getting into our quarterly results, I'd like to directly address the recent discussions of our fundamental performance.

Before getting into our quarterly results, I'd like to directly address the recent discussions of our fundamental performance. I've talked to many of our shareholders over the past several months and have listened closely to their feedback and suggestions.
I want to make sure everyone recognizes that I, along with the rest of the Comerica board, hear and understand the desire for improved returns. Rest assured, we share the same goals as all of our shareholders for enhancing value.
I know that we must earn our right to remain independent every day, and our management team and Board are committed to doing what is in the best interest of our shareholders. We are a Business Bank at our core, dedicated to providing high-quality financial services and building lasting client relationships. We operate Comerica for the ultimate benefit of our shareholders, and all of our actions are directed to maximize value while not compromising our commitment to our clients, our culture, regulatory standing, responsible underwriting and strong risk management.
We have also always been a conservative commercial bank, which results in lower lending yields compared to many industry peers. But our discipline has also meant less loss damage during economic contractions, which was proven through the last cycle.
Also, as a Business Bank, our model, by its nature, is more interest rate-sensitive, which clearly has hurt us. Historically, we actively hedged our rate sensitivity but ceased as rates fell. In hindsight, we left too much yield on the table during a weak recovery with prolonged price competition.
However, our yield gap to peers has been slowly closing without any shift in our conservative culture and without relying on rising rates. This is in no part small -- reflecting our greater emphasis and success in both sector specialization and middle market lending, which comprise over 50% of our portfolio and provide some of the highest returns.
Our growth opportunities align with our commercial bank model, where client relationships are stickier. Our Business Bank is national class, and we are a trusted adviser with long-tenured employees, who have deep expertise in the businesses they serve. Many of our high-caliber clients have banked with us for generations, and beyond serving their business needs, we have integrated our strong retail and wealth management capabilities to further cement these relationships.
We also have a strong treasury management platform with an improved merchant offering and are one of the top commercial card issuers. And through the cycle, we posted superior credit metrics. At the same time, as you know, we have been managing for years in an extremely low rate environment along with a slow-growing economy, a host of increasing regulatory and technology demands and, more recently, the energy cycle headwinds.
In light of the mounting challenges we have faced, we took actions to reduce costs, including judiciously renegotiating vendor contracts, reducing real estate and rationalizing some operations.
In addition, last year, our key senior leaders did not receive the normal merit increase as well as our 3-year incentive payment. Our pay-for-performance comp structure reflects our strong alignment with shareholders.
As a result of these efforts, our 2015 expense to earning assets ratio was better than all but one of our peers. However, we, along with nearly half of our peers, have not achieved double-digit return on equity. As a result, we have been undertaking a more intense review of our expense and revenue base.
To help us in these efforts, we have engaged Boston Consulting Group, a globally-recognized management consulting firm, that is very familiar with the range of challenges the U.S. banking industry is facing. While this process is in its early days, we fully expect to identify meaningful opportunities to operate more efficiently and lower expenses as well as drive increased revenue even in the current environment.
We are taking an expeditious yet comprehensive and thoughtful approach to executing this type of program with the goal of building a stronger, more competitive and more profitable organization. Given the breadth of the review, we plan to provide more information around the opportunities identified by the next quarterly earnings call. And we intend to deliver to our shareholders, as soon as practical, a broad, enterprise-wide plan designed to help reach tangible targets.
We are going to pursue this cost and revenue initiative with the urgency it deserves and continue to utilize our strengths and competitive position to improve our results. And if other strategic alternatives present themselves that are realistic, achievable and will maximize shareholder value, we will not hesitate to consider them.
That said, it's important to realize that when considering any strategic alternative, timing, economic developments and industry condition, like what's occurring in the energy space, must all be taken into account.
Over the last 5 quarters, we have been impacted by the current oil and gas cycle. We have been appropriately increasing our reserve allocation for energy loans over that time, and we have significantly increased them in the first quarter to nearly 8% of total energy loans.
A year ago, our total energy commitments were $6.9 billion. Today, they are $5.6 billion, a decline of $1.3 billion. Outstandings have declined also during that time by $500 million to $3.1 billion.
Overall, our borrowers are aggressively reducing costs, cutting back on capital expenditures and preserving liquidity. In addition, they are paying down bank debt through the sale of assets, which are generally sold at prices significantly higher than reflected in the borrowing base.
Utilization has increased slightly to 54%, driven by the decline in total commitments. While you are all very understandably following reserve-to-loan ratios across multiple energy portfolios in the banking system, it is important to understand the risk differences.
Our energy portfolio consists of 70% E&P, 16% midstream and 14% services. Within E&P, the well or field diversity of our customer base is spread broadly across the major producing basins in the country. We have very little deepwater exposure and only 2 second-lien loans totaling $18 million.
Typically, we do not make high-yield, unsecured or second-lien loans and less than half of our E&P relationships have high-yield debt behind our senior position. Our risk ratings and current reserve allocation for energy reflects our rigorous review of every relationship. We've been prudently downgrading loans, taking into consideration our customers' expected operating cash flows in continuing depressed price environment and the resulting total leverage. We believe we are being realistic in our assessment of the probability of default, given our expectation that prices may remain lower for longer.
The provision increase in the first quarter reflected the high end of the range in our 2016 guidance for the incremental impact of energy loans adjusted upward for revised regulatory guidance and includes the results of the Shared National Credit exam. However, it is important to note that our fundamental view on the energy sector has not changed significantly.
While the current oil and gas cycle presents a challenge, we believe we are adequately reserved. Keep in mind, those reserves may not turn into ultimate losses. We also look beyond direct energy risk and we remain comfortable with our Texas commercial real estate exposure. We have not seen any noteworthy deterioration in our Texas portfolio outside of our energy book.
I believe that we have a framework for delivering enhanced shareholder value and are moving with urgency to execute against our strategic priority to drive meaningful, improved returns for our shareholders.
Now I will move on to our first quarter results, turning to Slide 4. Absent the impact of energy, our overall results were solid. In particular, we saw a significant benefit from the December rate increase. Average loans were stable at $48.4 billion. Increases in Commercial Real Estate and National Dealer Services were offset by decreases in general Middle Market as well as a cyclical decline in Energy and seasonality in Mortgage Banker Finance. 
Average total deposits decreased $3 billion to $56.7 billion, reflecting our relationship banking strategy as well as purposeful pricing and strategic actions taken in light of the LCR rules. Typical seasonality was also a factor as deposits declined in January and February, followed by growth in March. The majority of the deposit decline on a period-end basis was relative to our -- to an elevated deposit level associated with our government card product at year-end.
Net interest income increased $14 million or 3% quarter-over-quarter. The Fed's December rate hike is expected to add about $90 million for the year as the bulk of our loan portfolio is floating rate. The benefit of the rate rise in the first quarter was partially offset by lower nonaccrual interest, fewer days in the quarter and several other smaller items. Aside from the provision for energy loans that I already discussed, overall credit quality continued to be solid.
Total net credit related charge-offs were $58 million or 49 basis points of average loans. Excluding energy, net charge-offs for the remainder of the portfolio remained low at $16 million or 15 basis points.
Noninterest income declined $22 million following strong commercial lending fees in the fourth quarter, particularly for syndication fees. Noninterest expenses decreased $24 million or 5%, primarily reflecting a $14 million decrease in salary and benefits as well as decreases in many other categories such as consulting fees, advertising, occupancy expenses.
Our capital position is solid. In light of the earnings impact from the deterioration of the energy book, we remain disciplined and repurchased 1.2 million shares under our equity repurchase program. We continue to return excess capital to our shareholders in a meaningful way, as we have for many years.
Now I will turn the call over to Karen, who will go over the quarter in more detail."

First quarter average loans were basically stable at $48.4 billion compared to the fourth quarter. We had good loan growth in our Commercial Real Estate business, driven primarily from construction draws on attractive projects with proven developers and continued conservative credit parameters such as high equity content.
Also, our National Dealer business was seasonally higher. This growth was offset by a decline in general Middle Market, as we remain disciplined in this highly competitive environment, as well as seasonal decreases in Mortgage Banker loans and the continued cyclical decline in Energy.
Importantly, positive growth trends through February and March resulted in period-end loans $1 billion above the average for the quarter, and our stronger pipeline increased further.
Total loan commitments declined, led by Energy, resulting in utilization increasing to 51%. Our first quarter loan yields increased 14 basis points, reflecting the increase in short-term interest rates in December, continuing loan price discipline and wider spreads on energy loans, partially offset by lower fees in the margin and a decline in interest collected on nonaccrual loans, following an extraordinarily-high fourth quarter.
Turning to deposits on Slide 6. Our deposit cost remained low and stable at 14 basis points as we continue to prudently manage pricing. We have not instituted any standard pricing adjustments in response to the December increase in short-term rates. We are closely monitoring our deposit base as well as the market. And we believe we are well positioned with predominantly operational relationship-oriented deposits. Of note, our loan-to-deposit ratio remained low at 87%.
Turning to Slide 7. As you know, during the fourth quarter, we deployed a portion of our excess reserves into securities, given the likelihood of rate increases occurring in small increments over a longer period of time. As you can see in the diamonds on the slide, our portfolio yield declined modestly, resulting from the mix impact of adding lower-yielding treasury securities along with continued depressed yields on replacement securities.
Going forward, assuming no change in the rate environment, we expect continued minor pressure on the average securities yield, primarily due to reinvestment of prepaids at slightly lower rates. As of quarter end, our estimated LCR ratio continues to meet the fully phased-in 2017 requirement plus a buffer.
Turning to Slide 8. The December rise in short-term rates positively impacted us in the quarter. As Ralph mentioned, net interest income grew $14 million or 3%, and the net interest margin expanded by 23 basis points. The largest factor was a benefit from higher LIBOR and prime-based rate on our loan portfolio, which added $20 million, as well as slightly wider loan spreads. This was partially offset by lower interest received on nonaccrual loans and lower fees.
Other loan impacts included 1 fewer day and slightly lower balances. A larger securities portfolio added $6 million. The higher interest rate earned on Federal Reserve deposits was more than offset by lower balances, resulting in a $2 million negative impact. Higher interest rates also resulted in a modest increase in our floating rate wholesale funding costs.
In total, higher rates contributed about $22 million to the increase in net interest income. As we've indicated, we expect that if deposit rates hold at their current level, the upside from the first rate hike will be about $90 million for the full year over the 2015 level.
Turning to Slide 9. As you can see in the bottom-right table, aside from Energy, our overall credit picture remained strong. Criticized loans were $3.9 billion at quarter end with close to half attributed to Energy loans. While the level of criticized Energy loans continues to increase as we prudently downgrade, we are not seeing any meaningful negative migration in the remainder of the portfolio, where less than 5% of the loans are considered criticized. Close to 2/3 of our non-accruals are Energy loans, and the quarter-over-quarter increase is almost entirely from Energy.
Net credit-related charge-offs were 49 basis points or $58 million, also derived mainly from Energy. Our other business lines had low charge-offs and strong recoveries. The $148 million provision for our total portfolio reflected an increase in our Energy reserves as a result of the negative migration, along with charge-offs and the preservation of a qualitative reserve.
Overall, our allowance for credit losses increased $91 million to total $770 million, and our allowance to loan ratio increased to 1.47%.
Slide 10 provides further detail on our Energy portfolio, which at quarter-end totaled $3.1 billion outstanding, equivalent to 6% of our total loans. E&P loans comprise 70% of our Energy portfolio, and we are 26% through the spring redetermination process. So far, borrowing bases have come down about 22% on average as a result of lower Energy prices. We had a handful of customers draw down lines as they prepare to restructure their high-yield debt, which resulted in period-end loans remaining relatively stable in the first quarter. However, those balances have come down since quarter end, and we expect that trend to continue.
Energy Services loans totaled $426 million or 14% of Energy loans and less than 1% of our total loan portfolio. These loans have declined 11% over the past quarter. Energy Services has been hit the hardest, and 65% are rated criticized. However, average balance sheet leverage for the bulk of the portfolio is under 2:1, which speaks to the financial wherewithal of these customers.
Although approximately 14% of our Energy loans are nonaccrual, 89% of these nonaccrual loans are fully current on interest payments, including the 3 loans we have in bankruptcy. The reserve for Energy loans is close to 8%, and as Ralph mentioned, those reserves may not turn into ultimate losses.
Aside from our Energy business line, we identified early in the cycle about 100 customers and other businesses that have a sizable portion of their revenue related to Energy or could otherwise be disproportionately negatively impacted by prolonged low oil and gas prices. Those loans now total $534 million and have declined 14% since year-end and 28% from a year ago.
Losses this quarter were $3 million, and we continue to monitor these loans closely. However, we have not seen significant negative credit migration over the last quarter, and balances are declining nicely.
Slide 11 outlines noninterest income, which decreased $22 million. The biggest driver was a $10 million decrease in commercial lending fees following robust fourth quarter activity, particularly in our syndication area, as well as a decline in unutilized fees due to the decrease in line of credit commitments.
In addition, we had several items that are difficult to predict. Specifically, a $7 million decrease in deferred compensation, which is offset in noninterest expense; a $2 million securities loss; and a $2 million decline in BOLI income. As you can see in the shaded area, excluding deferred comp, first quarter noninterest income was in line with the same period last year, reflecting seasonally-softer fee income.
Turning to slide 12. Noninterest expenses decreased 5% or $24 million, reflecting our tight ongoing control of expenses. Salaries and benefits expense was $14 million lower due to the $8 million decline in pension expense and $7 million decrease in deferred compensation expense, which is offset in revenue, as I've mentioned. Lower technology and regulatory-related staffing as well as 1 fewer day were offset essentially by annual stock compensation.
Moving to Slide 13 and capital management. We continue to return excess capital to our shareholders in a meaningful way with the repurchase of 1.2 million shares under the equity repurchase program. While we prudently scaled back the dollar amount of our repurchases, we were able to repurchase a similar number of shares to the prior quarters and continued to decrease our total shares outstanding.
We submitted our CCAR plan for the 2016-2017 cycle earlier this month and expect to receive the results in mid-June. As you would expect, we remain focused on returning excess capital to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases.
Turning to Slide 14. You heard both Ralph and me mention already that we expect the year-over-year benefit to net interest income from the rate rise that has already occurred to be about $90 million, assuming deposit prices continue to remain stable. The table on this slide gives some estimated additional upside to net interest income over the annual period following a rate rise.
For example, if the Federal Reserve raises its rates 25 basis points and our deposit prices begin to move with that rise at a 25% beta, we believe we would gain about $70 million more in annualized net interest income. Of course, our interest rate sensitivities are based on many assumptions, not just upon the pricing assumptions. Our standard modeling and the list of assumptions we use are included in the appendix.
Turning to Slide 15 and our outlook. Excluding the first quarter Energy impact to provision, our expectations for the full year have not changed significantly. However, as Ralph mentioned, with the continuation of the low-rate environment and slow-growing economy, we are embarking on an initiative to reduce expenses and drive revenue. Because it is still early in that process, we are not able to provide better insight into its impact on our 2016 outlook, particularly relating to revenues and expenses.
As far as credit, given the larger provision this quarter, we do want to provide color around our expectations for the rest of the year. At this point, we believe we are adequately reserved. Any movement from here will be driven by developments in the Energy sector, which are inherently difficult to predict.
We expect continued solid credit quality for the remainder of the portfolio with metrics, absent energy, to remain better than historical norms. With the significant reserve build we established in the first quarter, if the energy outlook remains stable, we would expect the provision for the rest of the year to reflect net charge-offs between 45 and 55 basis points, similar to the last couple of quarters. Additional reserve changes would depend on a variety of factors, the biggest being oil and gas prices as well as our energy customers' ability to cut cost, raise equity, sell assets and reduce debt, among other things.
Now, I'll turn the call back to Ralph."

But bear in mind that the prices today are still -- oil is down about 25% from our price decks in the fall. Gas might be 30% down. So prices are still lower than they were in the fall. And then the other thing, on the Energy Services side, I don't think there's going to be a big recovery in Energy Services until we see rig count go back up again. And I don't think people are expecting rig counts to go up at this -- these price levels. The good news there, again, is that our Energy Services portfolio is small, and it's probably about 1/2 or 1/3 of it that is performing just fine, even at these low prices. So while we've had some -- certainly some severe migration in the Energy Services portfolio, and we're going to have some more -- and we'll have some more charge-offs -- I think, long term, we don't expect to see the charge-offs there to be excessive.

We have, obviously, been focused on having some upside in this prolonged low rate environment. At the end of December, you'll remember that we purchased -- took about $2 billion of our excess reserves at the Fed and purchased treasury and Ginnie Mae securities, put those out longer term. That added about $6 million this quarter alone from that move. That did take a little bit of asset sensitivity off the table, not a lot. You'll see in our standard model for asset sensitivity in the Appendix that in that standard, 100 basis point rise on average in an annual period, it's still about $200 million. That is something that we continue to assess all the time. We may end up purchasing more securities over time, but it will clearly be dependent on our balance sheet movement and any opportunities that are out there. Since December, when we purchased additional securities, rates -- longer rates have been near their 3-year lows. So it's not necessarily an opportune time right now, but we will continue to assess. And as Ralph mentioned, in our history, we have used basic floating -- fixed to floating hedges on our portfolio, and at some point, we'll introduce that again."

To strengthen our competitive position and ensure that we remain a strong partner and trusted adviser to our customers for the ultimate benefit of our shareholders, we are fundamentally changing the way we opera",2199,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us. To strengthen our competitive position and ensure that we remain a strong partner and trusted adviser to our customers for the ultimate benefit of our shareholders, we are fundamentally changing the way we operate in many areas of our business. Today, we are announcing actions we are undertaking through our transformational enterprise-wide initiative that we refer to as GEAR Up. To date, we have already identified efficiency and revenue opportunities that are expected to drive at least $230 million in additional pretax income. Moreover, we are pursuing additional opportunities that will further enhance our profitability. 
This slide highlights some of the key components of the initiative so far. Through our comprehensive review and analysis over the past several months, we have identified more than 20 work streams focused on enhancing revenue and reducing expenses. We are moving expeditiously and have already begun the implementation process. We will measure our progress through tangible financial targets. We expect to increase profitability, with the end result being a meaningful improvement in our efficiency ratio and return on equity. I will provide further details in a moment. 
We currently estimate that through 2018, total pretax restructuring charges of $140 million to $160 million will be incurred. In the second quarter of 2016, we recorded about 1/3 of these charges, totaling $53 million, primarily related to severance. A significant portion of restructuring charges over the next 2 quarters is expected to be related to real estate consolidation. 
Our review demonstrated that our strategy of being a relationship-based commercial bank with a unique geographic footprint, strong industry expertise and superior risk culture positions Comerica for short- and long-term success. Specifically, our footprint is well situated as it provides diversity and significant growth opportunities with interdependencies that make each market valuable to our entire portfolio. 
Finally, I, along with our executive team, own this initiative, and we are committed to providing quarterly updates on our progress. We will hold ourselves accountable to achieving our goal of improved profitability. And as you know, our compensation is well-aligned with our shareholders as it is tied to the bank's financial results and the stock's performance. 
Comerica, along with the industry, has been managing through a difficult environment with prolonged low interest rates, slow economic growth as well as rising technology and regulatory costs. Over the last several years, we have been diligently working to reduce costs by judiciously renegotiating vendor contracts, reducing our real estate exposure and rationalizing operations. While these efforts were effective and meaningful in their own right, we recognize that we need to do more to meet the mounting challenges, which is why we launched this transformation initiative. 
As I have indicated previously, our board and management team are committed to evaluating all opportunities to enhance shareholder value and doing what is in the best long-term interest of our shareholders. If there are strategic alternatives that are realistic, achievable and will maximize shareholder value, they will be fully considered. We know we must earn our right to remain independent. That said, we are doing what is within our control to proactively position ourselves as a stronger, more competitive and profitable organization. 
Turning to Slide 4 and a closer look at the financial targets. Our initial analysis has identified that we can drive approximately $140 million in additional annual pretax income by the end of 2017 and $230 million in the run rate by the end of 2018. Approximately 30% or $70 million is associated with revenue enhancements. The expense savings of $160 million represents nearly 9% of fiscal year 2015 expenses. 
Looking at our efficiency ratio, you may recall that our 2015 efficiency ratio of 67% was impacted by a change in accounting presentation for a card program that added over 2 percentage points but had no impact to our bottom line. Without any increasing rates, we believe the actions we are taking will drive our efficiency ratio to the low 60s by the end of 2017 and at or below 60% by year-end 2018. 
By adding an expected 200 basis points to our ROE, these revenue and expense actions take us a long way towards achieving a double-digit return on equity. While we are focused on implementing these actions, management continues to identify further opportunities which will assist us in reaching a double-digit return on equity. On a pro forma basis, the initial actions are expected to drive our ROE well above the 2015 peer average. I firmly believe that as we deliver on this plan, we will increase shareholder value and achieve the level of returns that our shareholders deserve. 
Turning to Slide 5. We have outlined some of the key actions identified to date that we are undertaking. Of note, this does not include business growth in the normal course, and we expect the initiative to drive further run-rate benefits beyond 2018. 
Our planned revenue enhancements, which equal approximately $30 million through 2017 and $70 million by year-end 2018, include increasing the customer penetration of our products and services and accelerating growth in Middle Market Banking. 
To this end, on customer penetration, we are expanding product offerings, enhancing sales tools and training as well as realigning employee incentives. In addition, we recently began using improved customer analytics to identify opportunities which should increase cross-sold products per customer relationship. We also have simplified leadership in both Wealth Management and treasury management to support speed, simplicity and agility in taking action as well as bring renewed vigor and focus to both areas. 
On the next slide, I will discuss the treasury management initiatives in more detail. As you know, Middle Market Banking is our largest business line, but it has been slow growing in this economic cycle. In order to help drive growth in this segment, we have formed a team to create a national standardized process for sales, training and performance management. We expect this will leverage best practices across our geographies. Of course, our well-regarded approach to local relationship management will not change. 
Turning to the expense reductions. We currently expect $110 million in annual run-rate cost savings by year-end 2017 and $160 million in total by year-end 2018. Over the next year, we plan to reduce our total workforce by approximately 9%. We are eliminating management layers in order to get closer to our customers and accelerate decision-making. This includes consolidating functions and responsibilities while taking care to ensure we maintain our high standards for customer service and deep expertise and experience. While many of these actions are difficult, particularly for our employees, we must be proactive to overcome the challenges of the continuing low-rate environment. This is not an easy process, and we're being thoughtful and deliberate in our approach. 
In addition, we will increase capacity by obtaining better productivity and core operations through automation. Streamlining our credit process is a great example. Through further centralization and digitalization of our credit process from application to approval to documentation, we will enhance data collection and analysis, shorten the duration of the process, allowing for us -- for an improved customer experience. 
That said, as we execute this process, we will not compromise our strong credit culture. We will enhance our technology capabilities while reducing our overall spend by optimizing our infrastructure and substantially reducing the number of IT applications across the bank. In doing so, we will continue to make technology advances such as enhancing our fraud protection capabilities, expanding online and mobile capabilities for customers, elevating the quality of data and information management and further modernizing our suite of customer-focused technology. 
Regarding our footprint, with the advancement of technology and broader application of alternative work arrangements, we need less real estate to operate our business. Therefore, we expect to reduce office and operation space as well as consolidate approximately 40 banking centers or about 8% of our total network over the next year or so. These actions are in line with industry trends as an increasing number of customers prefer to utilize alternative delivery channels such as mobile banking. 
Turning to Slide 6 and additional detail on our opportunities in treasury management, which is a meaningful contributor to our revenue initiative. While our treasury management product offering is robust and part of our high-caliber commercial banking franchise, we believe we can increase revenue through 3 opportunities. First, within our existing customer base, we intend to increase our share of wallet. Naturally, this has always been a goal for us, but through a focus on selling new products at higher margins and a new data-driven assessment tool, we are aiming to make significant progress in identifying new opportunities. We have already had success with the pilot program using this analytical tool in our California market, and we began rolling it out to all of our markets in June.
Secondly, we are realigning sales channels to increase efficiency and productivity. This includes further utilizing mobile applications to deliver and document services even faster than we do today. In addition, recalibrating our customer service coverage, we are ensuring our most valuable clients receive dedicated resources. 
Finally, another major contributor is expected to be our merchant services offering. Through our recent partnership with an industry leader, we have expanded our product suite and have increased our client penetration by 5%. This has resulted in tremendous growth, with revenue more than doubling since second quarter of 2015. We are gaining momentum, and the prospects are vast, with more than 20,000 of our clients currently processing with other vendors. 
In summary, we are implementing meaningful changes that we expect will allow us to operate more efficiency -- efficiently and lower expenses as well as increase revenue. And while rising rates can be a significant benefit to us, we are neither waiting nor relying on that to drive improved returns. We believe this initiative will drive enhanced value for our shareholders through increased profitability. 
Now turning to our second quarter results on Slide 7. Our overall results were solid and reflect the underlying resilience of our business model. Second quarter 2016 net income of $104 million or $0.58 per share included after-tax restructuring charges of $34 million or $0.19 per share. 
Slide 8 provides further detail on our results. Average loans increased $1.1 billion or 2% to $49.5 billion. We saw growth in Commercial Real Estate, Mortgage Banker Finance and National Dealer Services, partially offset by the expected decrease in Energy. The increase in Commercial Real Estate is driven by well-structured, attractive opportunities with existing customers. This includes a mix of drawdowns on construction commitments and term loans on stabilized properties. 
Our average total deposits declined slightly to $56.5 billion. Noninterest-bearing deposits grew over 1% but were offset by a decline in interest-bearing deposits as we continued to maintain our pricing discipline. 
Net interest income declined $2 million to $445 million. The benefit from loan growth was offset by nonaccrual loan activity and an adjustment to the residual value of the lease. We had slightly higher funding costs due to an increase in wholesale debt to opportunistically prefund an upcoming debt maturity and support loan growth. Overall, credit quality was solid and reflects declines in criticized and nonaccrual loans as well as net charge-offs. This was a result of the improved credit performance of our Energy portfolio. 
Energy loans have declined $356 million or 11%, and commitments have declined over $600 million or nearly 11% since the end of the first quarter as our customers continue to take the necessary actions to reduce their bank debt. We have completed 88% of the spring redeterminations of our E&P customers, and borrowing bases have come down about 22% on average. 
Criticized Energy loans have declined $281 million as of the end of second quarter. Energy charge-offs remain manageable and declined from the first quarter. While the performance of this portfolio has improved and oil and gas prices have increased since the first quarter, we remain cautious and believe we are adequately reserved with our reserve allocation at over 8% of Energy loans as of June 30. 
Noninterest income increased $23 million, with growth in nearly all customer-driven categories. The largest increases were in card fees, fiduciary income, customer derivative income and commercial lending fees. In addition, results benefited from a $10 million swing in deferred comp, which is offset in expenses. 
We continue to tightly manage expenses. Noninterest expenses include the $53 million restructuring charge that I just discussed. Excluding this, expenses increased $6 million. 
Our capital position remains solid. As far as our second quarter results compared to the same period a year ago, revenue is up over 5%. This reflects the benefit from the increase in short-term rates as well as growth in fee income as we continue to drive for deeper customer relationships. 
Expenses were impacted by the $53 million in restructuring charges we incurred this year as well as the net release of litigation reserves of $30 million in the second quarter of 2015. Putting these 2 items aside, you can see that expenses have been very well managed. 
And now I will turn the call over to Dave, who will go over the quarter in more detail."

Turning to Slide 9. As Ralph mentioned, second quarter average loans increased $1.1 billion compared to the first quarter, including a $356 million decline in Energy loans. We continue to see solid growth in our C",1426,"Thanks, Ralph. Good morning, everyone.  
Turning to Slide 9. As Ralph mentioned, second quarter average loans increased $1.1 billion compared to the first quarter, including a $356 million decline in Energy loans. We continue to see solid growth in our Commercial Real Estate business with construction draws and term loans primarily with existing customers. The projects, predominantly multifamily in primary markets within California and Texas with proven developers, have favorable credit profiles that include significant equity content as we continue to be cautious and selective. 
Also, auto inventories are seasonally high, resulting in increased line utilization in our National Dealer business. Finally, summer home sales, combined with the decline in mortgage rates, made June a record month in our 50-year history in the mortgage banking business. Likewise, quarter-end loans were up $1 billion over the first quarter with all the same drivers. 
As of June 30, increased commitments in mortgage banker, Commercial Real Estate and National Dealer were offset by the large decline in Energy. Line utilization increased 1.5 percentage points to 53%, mostly driven by the seasonal increases in mortgage banker and National Dealer, and our strong pipeline increased further. Although interest earned on loans was unchanged quarter-over-quarter, our second quarter loan yield decreased 7 basis points. The benefit from loan growth was offset by a decline in interest recoveries on nonaccrual loans, a full quarter impact from the increase in nonaccrual loans in the first quarter and a lease residual valuation adjustment. 
Turning to Slide 10. Average deposits were basically stable quarter-over-quarter. We had typical seasonal growth in both interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing Retail Banking deposits. This was offset by a decline in commercial deposits, primarily due to seasonal weakness in municipalities and our relationship banking strategy and purposeful pricing in large corporate. Our deposit cost remained stable at 14 basis points as we continue to prudently manage pricing. We are closely monitoring our deposit base as well as the market, and we believe we are well positioned with predominantly operational relationship-oriented deposits. 
Turning to Slide 11. We maintained our securities book at about $12.5 billion. The estimated duration of our portfolio sits at about 3 years, and the expected duration under a 200 basis point rate shock extends it modestly to 3.9 years. In the current environment, we expect to see prepays increase moderately from $490 million in the second quarter to this $550 million to $650 million range in the third quarter. The minor pressure we saw in our security portfolio yield may increase slightly due to reinvestment of larger monthly prepays at a lower rate. 
To help combat this, we are selectively purchasing securities with modestly longer duration. For example, a couple of weeks ago, we were able to place a $100 million Ginnie Mae purchase at 1.68%, which had a duration of about 18 months longer than the current portfolio average but had similar extension risk. As of quarter end, our estimated LCR ratio continues to meet the fully phased-in 2017 requirement plus a buffer. 
Turning to Slide 12. Net interest income declined $2 million while the net interest margin decreased 7 basis points. As I discussed earlier, all loan-related impacts netted to 0 but had a 4 basis point negative effect on the margin. The benefit from loan growth was offset by the previously mentioned nonaccrual activity, a lease residual valuation adjustment well as slightly lower accretion. 
Wholesale funding costs increased $3 million as we added $2.8 billion in FHLB loans at very attractive terms to prefund a $650 million November debt maturity as well as support loan growth. This was partly offset by income earned on higher balances at the Fed. 
Turning to Slide 13. Our overall credit picture remains strong, and performance of our Energy portfolio improved in the second quarter. Our allowance for credit losses increased $2 million to $772 million, and our allowance-to-loan ratio was 1.45%. Total criticized loans declined $377 million to $3.6 billion or only 7% of total loans at quarter end. Nonaccrual loans decreased $76 million, and net charge-offs declined to 38 basis points or $47 million. Energy accounted for over 2/3 of the net charge-offs, and total net charge-offs for all other business lines combined was only 13 basis points. 
As far as our Energy portfolio, outstandings declined 11% to $2.7 billion at quarter end and now comprises 5.4% of our total loans. E&P loans make up 70% of our Energy portfolio, and as Ralph mentioned, the spring redetermination process is nearly complete. So far, borrowing bases have come down about 22% on average, and the number of deficiencies has been relatively stable since last quarter. Energy Services has been significantly impacted this cycle, yet loan outstandings declined 15% to $363 million and now comprise less than 1% of our total loan portfolio. 
Total criticized Energy loans decreased $281 million due to the decline in outstandings and a small number of risk rating upgrades as our customers have reduced expenses, sold assets and tapped the capital markets. Also noteworthy is that 100% of these nonaccrual loans are fully current on interest payments, including the 9 loans we have in bankruptcy. The reserve for Energy loans is over 8%, and remember, those reserves may not turn into ultimate losses. Further detail on our Energy portfolio can be found in the appendix. 
Slide 14 outlines noninterest income. We had broad-based growth, with total customer-driven fees increasing 5% over the first quarter. Our cross-sell efforts have helped drive increases in card fees and fiduciary income. Customer derivative income saw robust activity in conjunction with the Brexit vote, and commercial lending fees grew with a pickup in syndication activity following a first quarter lull. 
Foreign exchange and brokerage fees were also low. In addition, we had a $10 million increase in deferred compensation, which is included in other noninterest income and is offset in noninterest expense. 
Turning to Slide 15. Aside from the $53 million restructuring charge Ralph discussed, noninterest expenses increased $6 million. This included the $10 million increase in deferred compensation, which was partly offset by an $8 million gain on the sale of leased assets. The remaining increase was due to higher outside processing and advertising expense, which is connected to our revenue growth, along with higher FDIC insurance premiums. 
Salaries and benefits was down $1 million. The increase in deferred compensation as well as annual merit seasonal 401(k) contributions as well as slightly higher incentive comp, which is related to revenue growth, were offset by decreases in share-based comp and payroll taxes following seasonally high expense in the first quarter. 
Moving to Slide 16 and capital management. We continue to return excess capital to our shareholders in a meaningful way. We completed our 2015 capital plan, which included equity purchases -- repurchases of $290 million under our equity repurchase program over the 5 quarters. In the second quarter, we repurchased 1.5 million shares and increased the dividend 5% to $0.22 per share. Our 2016 capital plan includes share repurchases up to $440 million. 
The pace of our buyback will be dependent on balance sheet movements and our financial performance, which can be impacted by market factors, particularly interest rates. The plan also includes a further increase on our quarterly dividend to $0.23 per share, which will be considered by the board at the end of this month. Our tangible book value per share increased to $40.52 and has been steadily increasing over the past several years as we continue to focus on creating long-term shareholder value. 
Turning to Slide 17. While the outlook for a rate increase continues to fluctuate daily, I'll remind you that our balance sheet is well positioned to benefit from an increase in rates. The benefits of full year 2016 net interest income from the rate rise that occurred in December is expected to be about $90 million, assuming deposit pricing continues to remain stable. 
The table on this slide gives some estimated additional upside to net interest income over the annual period following a rate rise. For example, if the Federal Reserve raises its rates 25 basis points and our deposit prices begin to move at that rate rise at a 25% beta, we believe we would gain about $70 million more in annualized net interest income. Of course, deposit pricing is only one assumption on our interest rate sensitivity modeling. Other key variables include loan and deposit behavior in a rising rate environment. Our standard modeling and the list of assumptions we use are included in the appendix. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Ralph."

Turning to Slide 18 and our outlook for the full year 2016 relative to 2015. We have not changed our outlook for loans. We expect our average loan growth to be in line with U.S. GDP growth. We expect to see the typical third quarter seaso",476,"Thank you, Dave. Turning to Slide 18 and our outlook for the full year 2016 relative to 2015. We have not changed our outlook for loans. We expect our average loan growth to be in line with U.S. GDP growth. We expect to see the typical third quarter seasonal declines in dealer, mortgage banker and general Middle Market to be followed by a rebound in the fourth quarter. In addition, we anticipate the decline in Energy outstandings to continue but perhaps at a more moderate pace than we saw in the second quarter. 
Our expectations for net interest income also have not changed. As far as credit, we expect continued solid credit quality with metrics, absent Energy, to remain better than historical norms. With the significant reserve build we established in the first quarter, if the Energy outlook remains stable, we would expect the provision for the rest of the year to reflect net charge-offs between 35 and 45 basis points. This is a modest reduction from the outlook we provided last quarter as a result of better-than-anticipated performance of our Energy portfolio, including the spring redeterminations and decline in loan balances. 
Movements in the Energy reserve from here will depend on many factors, the biggest being oil and gas prices as well as Energy customers' continuing ability to cut costs, raise equity, sell assets and reduce debt. Our expectations for noninterest income have not changed. Of note, as I mentioned earlier, we have begun to implement initiatives to drive more fee income, and we expect we will start to see results early next year. 
We have also updated our noninterest expense outlook, which now includes total restructuring expenses of approximately $90 million to $110 million for the year. Partially offsetting this will be savings derived from GEAR Up of about $20 million to be achieved primarily in the fourth quarter. Expenses in the second half of the year relative to the first half are impacted by 2 more days, the full impact of merit increases and an expected increase in the FDIC expense as a result of the surcharge. Finally, outside processing expenses are expected to continue to grow with increased card revenue. Our tax rate for full year 2016 is now about 30%, which is a reduction from our prior guidance as a result of the impact from the restructuring charges. 
In closing, Comerica is dedicated to providing high-quality financial services and building lasting client relationships. We operate Comerica for the ultimate benefit of our shareholders, and all of our actions are directed to maximize value while not compromising our commitment to our clients, the communities we serve, regulatory standing and strong risk management. As I previously stated, through GEAR Up, I am confident that we can enhance shareholder returns through improved financial performance. 
And now we would be happy to take your questions."

And we're seeing still good opportunities, really across all of our lines of business, middle market, Small Business, Commercial Real Estate, et cetera. When you look at the Houston market, certainly more impact from Energy overall and Energy-related exposure. We continue to be a little bit more cautious there in terms of new originations but really have not seen a lot of deterioration outside of Energy in that portfolio, and we continue to watch CRE but have not seen a lot of deterioration there either. And so in balance, the Texas economy, much more diverse than it was during the last Energy cycle. About 15% of the economy overall is Energy dependent right now, and I would say that we continue to see opportunities in Northern Texas, a little bit less so in Southern Texas."

To strengthen our competitive position and ensure that we remain a strong partner and trusted adviser to our customers for the ultimate benefit of our shareholders, we are fundamentally changing the way we opera",2199,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us. To strengthen our competitive position and ensure that we remain a strong partner and trusted adviser to our customers for the ultimate benefit of our shareholders, we are fundamentally changing the way we operate in many areas of our business. Today, we are announcing actions we are undertaking through our transformational enterprise-wide initiative that we refer to as GEAR Up. To date, we have already identified efficiency and revenue opportunities that are expected to drive at least $230 million in additional pretax income. Moreover, we are pursuing additional opportunities that will further enhance our profitability. 
This slide highlights some of the key components of the initiative so far. Through our comprehensive review and analysis over the past several months, we have identified more than 20 work streams focused on enhancing revenue and reducing expenses. We are moving expeditiously and have already begun the implementation process. We will measure our progress through tangible financial targets. We expect to increase profitability, with the end result being a meaningful improvement in our efficiency ratio and return on equity. I will provide further details in a moment. 
We currently estimate that through 2018, total pretax restructuring charges of $140 million to $160 million will be incurred. In the second quarter of 2016, we recorded about 1/3 of these charges, totaling $53 million, primarily related to severance. A significant portion of restructuring charges over the next 2 quarters is expected to be related to real estate consolidation. 
Our review demonstrated that our strategy of being a relationship-based commercial bank with a unique geographic footprint, strong industry expertise and superior risk culture positions Comerica for short- and long-term success. Specifically, our footprint is well situated as it provides diversity and significant growth opportunities with interdependencies that make each market valuable to our entire portfolio. 
Finally, I, along with our executive team, own this initiative, and we are committed to providing quarterly updates on our progress. We will hold ourselves accountable to achieving our goal of improved profitability. And as you know, our compensation is well-aligned with our shareholders as it is tied to the bank's financial results and the stock's performance. 
Comerica, along with the industry, has been managing through a difficult environment with prolonged low interest rates, slow economic growth as well as rising technology and regulatory costs. Over the last several years, we have been diligently working to reduce costs by judiciously renegotiating vendor contracts, reducing our real estate exposure and rationalizing operations. While these efforts were effective and meaningful in their own right, we recognize that we need to do more to meet the mounting challenges, which is why we launched this transformation initiative. 
As I have indicated previously, our board and management team are committed to evaluating all opportunities to enhance shareholder value and doing what is in the best long-term interest of our shareholders. If there are strategic alternatives that are realistic, achievable and will maximize shareholder value, they will be fully considered. We know we must earn our right to remain independent. That said, we are doing what is within our control to proactively position ourselves as a stronger, more competitive and profitable organization. 
Turning to Slide 4 and a closer look at the financial targets. Our initial analysis has identified that we can drive approximately $140 million in additional annual pretax income by the end of 2017 and $230 million in the run rate by the end of 2018. Approximately 30% or $70 million is associated with revenue enhancements. The expense savings of $160 million represents nearly 9% of fiscal year 2015 expenses. 
Looking at our efficiency ratio, you may recall that our 2015 efficiency ratio of 67% was impacted by a change in accounting presentation for a card program that added over 2 percentage points but had no impact to our bottom line. Without any increasing rates, we believe the actions we are taking will drive our efficiency ratio to the low 60s by the end of 2017 and at or below 60% by year-end 2018. 
By adding an expected 200 basis points to our ROE, these revenue and expense actions take us a long way towards achieving a double-digit return on equity. While we are focused on implementing these actions, management continues to identify further opportunities which will assist us in reaching a double-digit return on equity. On a pro forma basis, the initial actions are expected to drive our ROE well above the 2015 peer average. I firmly believe that as we deliver on this plan, we will increase shareholder value and achieve the level of returns that our shareholders deserve. 
Turning to Slide 5. We have outlined some of the key actions identified to date that we are undertaking. Of note, this does not include business growth in the normal course, and we expect the initiative to drive further run-rate benefits beyond 2018. 
Our planned revenue enhancements, which equal approximately $30 million through 2017 and $70 million by year-end 2018, include increasing the customer penetration of our products and services and accelerating growth in Middle Market Banking. 
To this end, on customer penetration, we are expanding product offerings, enhancing sales tools and training as well as realigning employee incentives. In addition, we recently began using improved customer analytics to identify opportunities which should increase cross-sold products per customer relationship. We also have simplified leadership in both Wealth Management and treasury management to support speed, simplicity and agility in taking action as well as bring renewed vigor and focus to both areas. 
On the next slide, I will discuss the treasury management initiatives in more detail. As you know, Middle Market Banking is our largest business line, but it has been slow growing in this economic cycle. In order to help drive growth in this segment, we have formed a team to create a national standardized process for sales, training and performance management. We expect this will leverage best practices across our geographies. Of course, our well-regarded approach to local relationship management will not change. 
Turning to the expense reductions. We currently expect $110 million in annual run-rate cost savings by year-end 2017 and $160 million in total by year-end 2018. Over the next year, we plan to reduce our total workforce by approximately 9%. We are eliminating management layers in order to get closer to our customers and accelerate decision-making. This includes consolidating functions and responsibilities while taking care to ensure we maintain our high standards for customer service and deep expertise and experience. While many of these actions are difficult, particularly for our employees, we must be proactive to overcome the challenges of the continuing low-rate environment. This is not an easy process, and we're being thoughtful and deliberate in our approach. 
In addition, we will increase capacity by obtaining better productivity and core operations through automation. Streamlining our credit process is a great example. Through further centralization and digitalization of our credit process from application to approval to documentation, we will enhance data collection and analysis, shorten the duration of the process, allowing for us -- for an improved customer experience. 
That said, as we execute this process, we will not compromise our strong credit culture. We will enhance our technology capabilities while reducing our overall spend by optimizing our infrastructure and substantially reducing the number of IT applications across the bank. In doing so, we will continue to make technology advances such as enhancing our fraud protection capabilities, expanding online and mobile capabilities for customers, elevating the quality of data and information management and further modernizing our suite of customer-focused technology. 
Regarding our footprint, with the advancement of technology and broader application of alternative work arrangements, we need less real estate to operate our business. Therefore, we expect to reduce office and operation space as well as consolidate approximately 40 banking centers or about 8% of our total network over the next year or so. These actions are in line with industry trends as an increasing number of customers prefer to utilize alternative delivery channels such as mobile banking. 
Turning to Slide 6 and additional detail on our opportunities in treasury management, which is a meaningful contributor to our revenue initiative. While our treasury management product offering is robust and part of our high-caliber commercial banking franchise, we believe we can increase revenue through 3 opportunities. First, within our existing customer base, we intend to increase our share of wallet. Naturally, this has always been a goal for us, but through a focus on selling new products at higher margins and a new data-driven assessment tool, we are aiming to make significant progress in identifying new opportunities. We have already had success with the pilot program using this analytical tool in our California market, and we began rolling it out to all of our markets in June.
Secondly, we are realigning sales channels to increase efficiency and productivity. This includes further utilizing mobile applications to deliver and document services even faster than we do today. In addition, recalibrating our customer service coverage, we are ensuring our most valuable clients receive dedicated resources. 
Finally, another major contributor is expected to be our merchant services offering. Through our recent partnership with an industry leader, we have expanded our product suite and have increased our client penetration by 5%. This has resulted in tremendous growth, with revenue more than doubling since second quarter of 2015. We are gaining momentum, and the prospects are vast, with more than 20,000 of our clients currently processing with other vendors. 
In summary, we are implementing meaningful changes that we expect will allow us to operate more efficiency -- efficiently and lower expenses as well as increase revenue. And while rising rates can be a significant benefit to us, we are neither waiting nor relying on that to drive improved returns. We believe this initiative will drive enhanced value for our shareholders through increased profitability. 
Now turning to our second quarter results on Slide 7. Our overall results were solid and reflect the underlying resilience of our business model. Second quarter 2016 net income of $104 million or $0.58 per share included after-tax restructuring charges of $34 million or $0.19 per share. 
Slide 8 provides further detail on our results. Average loans increased $1.1 billion or 2% to $49.5 billion. We saw growth in Commercial Real Estate, Mortgage Banker Finance and National Dealer Services, partially offset by the expected decrease in Energy. The increase in Commercial Real Estate is driven by well-structured, attractive opportunities with existing customers. This includes a mix of drawdowns on construction commitments and term loans on stabilized properties. 
Our average total deposits declined slightly to $56.5 billion. Noninterest-bearing deposits grew over 1% but were offset by a decline in interest-bearing deposits as we continued to maintain our pricing discipline. 
Net interest income declined $2 million to $445 million. The benefit from loan growth was offset by nonaccrual loan activity and an adjustment to the residual value of the lease. We had slightly higher funding costs due to an increase in wholesale debt to opportunistically prefund an upcoming debt maturity and support loan growth. Overall, credit quality was solid and reflects declines in criticized and nonaccrual loans as well as net charge-offs. This was a result of the improved credit performance of our Energy portfolio. 
Energy loans have declined $356 million or 11%, and commitments have declined over $600 million or nearly 11% since the end of the first quarter as our customers continue to take the necessary actions to reduce their bank debt. We have completed 88% of the spring redeterminations of our E&P customers, and borrowing bases have come down about 22% on average. 
Criticized Energy loans have declined $281 million as of the end of second quarter. Energy charge-offs remain manageable and declined from the first quarter. While the performance of this portfolio has improved and oil and gas prices have increased since the first quarter, we remain cautious and believe we are adequately reserved with our reserve allocation at over 8% of Energy loans as of June 30. 
Noninterest income increased $23 million, with growth in nearly all customer-driven categories. The largest increases were in card fees, fiduciary income, customer derivative income and commercial lending fees. In addition, results benefited from a $10 million swing in deferred comp, which is offset in expenses. 
We continue to tightly manage expenses. Noninterest expenses include the $53 million restructuring charge that I just discussed. Excluding this, expenses increased $6 million. 
Our capital position remains solid. As far as our second quarter results compared to the same period a year ago, revenue is up over 5%. This reflects the benefit from the increase in short-term rates as well as growth in fee income as we continue to drive for deeper customer relationships. 
Expenses were impacted by the $53 million in restructuring charges we incurred this year as well as the net release of litigation reserves of $30 million in the second quarter of 2015. Putting these 2 items aside, you can see that expenses have been very well managed. 
And now I will turn the call over to Dave, who will go over the quarter in more detail."

Turning to Slide 9. As Ralph mentioned, second quarter average loans increased $1.1 billion compared to the first quarter, including a $356 million decline in Energy loans. We continue to see solid growth in our C",1426,"Thanks, Ralph. Good morning, everyone.  
Turning to Slide 9. As Ralph mentioned, second quarter average loans increased $1.1 billion compared to the first quarter, including a $356 million decline in Energy loans. We continue to see solid growth in our Commercial Real Estate business with construction draws and term loans primarily with existing customers. The projects, predominantly multifamily in primary markets within California and Texas with proven developers, have favorable credit profiles that include significant equity content as we continue to be cautious and selective. 
Also, auto inventories are seasonally high, resulting in increased line utilization in our National Dealer business. Finally, summer home sales, combined with the decline in mortgage rates, made June a record month in our 50-year history in the mortgage banking business. Likewise, quarter-end loans were up $1 billion over the first quarter with all the same drivers. 
As of June 30, increased commitments in mortgage banker, Commercial Real Estate and National Dealer were offset by the large decline in Energy. Line utilization increased 1.5 percentage points to 53%, mostly driven by the seasonal increases in mortgage banker and National Dealer, and our strong pipeline increased further. Although interest earned on loans was unchanged quarter-over-quarter, our second quarter loan yield decreased 7 basis points. The benefit from loan growth was offset by a decline in interest recoveries on nonaccrual loans, a full quarter impact from the increase in nonaccrual loans in the first quarter and a lease residual valuation adjustment. 
Turning to Slide 10. Average deposits were basically stable quarter-over-quarter. We had typical seasonal growth in both interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing Retail Banking deposits. This was offset by a decline in commercial deposits, primarily due to seasonal weakness in municipalities and our relationship banking strategy and purposeful pricing in large corporate. Our deposit cost remained stable at 14 basis points as we continue to prudently manage pricing. We are closely monitoring our deposit base as well as the market, and we believe we are well positioned with predominantly operational relationship-oriented deposits. 
Turning to Slide 11. We maintained our securities book at about $12.5 billion. The estimated duration of our portfolio sits at about 3 years, and the expected duration under a 200 basis point rate shock extends it modestly to 3.9 years. In the current environment, we expect to see prepays increase moderately from $490 million in the second quarter to this $550 million to $650 million range in the third quarter. The minor pressure we saw in our security portfolio yield may increase slightly due to reinvestment of larger monthly prepays at a lower rate. 
To help combat this, we are selectively purchasing securities with modestly longer duration. For example, a couple of weeks ago, we were able to place a $100 million Ginnie Mae purchase at 1.68%, which had a duration of about 18 months longer than the current portfolio average but had similar extension risk. As of quarter end, our estimated LCR ratio continues to meet the fully phased-in 2017 requirement plus a buffer. 
Turning to Slide 12. Net interest income declined $2 million while the net interest margin decreased 7 basis points. As I discussed earlier, all loan-related impacts netted to 0 but had a 4 basis point negative effect on the margin. The benefit from loan growth was offset by the previously mentioned nonaccrual activity, a lease residual valuation adjustment well as slightly lower accretion. 
Wholesale funding costs increased $3 million as we added $2.8 billion in FHLB loans at very attractive terms to prefund a $650 million November debt maturity as well as support loan growth. This was partly offset by income earned on higher balances at the Fed. 
Turning to Slide 13. Our overall credit picture remains strong, and performance of our Energy portfolio improved in the second quarter. Our allowance for credit losses increased $2 million to $772 million, and our allowance-to-loan ratio was 1.45%. Total criticized loans declined $377 million to $3.6 billion or only 7% of total loans at quarter end. Nonaccrual loans decreased $76 million, and net charge-offs declined to 38 basis points or $47 million. Energy accounted for over 2/3 of the net charge-offs, and total net charge-offs for all other business lines combined was only 13 basis points. 
As far as our Energy portfolio, outstandings declined 11% to $2.7 billion at quarter end and now comprises 5.4% of our total loans. E&P loans make up 70% of our Energy portfolio, and as Ralph mentioned, the spring redetermination process is nearly complete. So far, borrowing bases have come down about 22% on average, and the number of deficiencies has been relatively stable since last quarter. Energy Services has been significantly impacted this cycle, yet loan outstandings declined 15% to $363 million and now comprise less than 1% of our total loan portfolio. 
Total criticized Energy loans decreased $281 million due to the decline in outstandings and a small number of risk rating upgrades as our customers have reduced expenses, sold assets and tapped the capital markets. Also noteworthy is that 100% of these nonaccrual loans are fully current on interest payments, including the 9 loans we have in bankruptcy. The reserve for Energy loans is over 8%, and remember, those reserves may not turn into ultimate losses. Further detail on our Energy portfolio can be found in the appendix. 
Slide 14 outlines noninterest income. We had broad-based growth, with total customer-driven fees increasing 5% over the first quarter. Our cross-sell efforts have helped drive increases in card fees and fiduciary income. Customer derivative income saw robust activity in conjunction with the Brexit vote, and commercial lending fees grew with a pickup in syndication activity following a first quarter lull. 
Foreign exchange and brokerage fees were also low. In addition, we had a $10 million increase in deferred compensation, which is included in other noninterest income and is offset in noninterest expense. 
Turning to Slide 15. Aside from the $53 million restructuring charge Ralph discussed, noninterest expenses increased $6 million. This included the $10 million increase in deferred compensation, which was partly offset by an $8 million gain on the sale of leased assets. The remaining increase was due to higher outside processing and advertising expense, which is connected to our revenue growth, along with higher FDIC insurance premiums. 
Salaries and benefits was down $1 million. The increase in deferred compensation as well as annual merit seasonal 401(k) contributions as well as slightly higher incentive comp, which is related to revenue growth, were offset by decreases in share-based comp and payroll taxes following seasonally high expense in the first quarter. 
Moving to Slide 16 and capital management. We continue to return excess capital to our shareholders in a meaningful way. We completed our 2015 capital plan, which included equity purchases -- repurchases of $290 million under our equity repurchase program over the 5 quarters. In the second quarter, we repurchased 1.5 million shares and increased the dividend 5% to $0.22 per share. Our 2016 capital plan includes share repurchases up to $440 million. 
The pace of our buyback will be dependent on balance sheet movements and our financial performance, which can be impacted by market factors, particularly interest rates. The plan also includes a further increase on our quarterly dividend to $0.23 per share, which will be considered by the board at the end of this month. Our tangible book value per share increased to $40.52 and has been steadily increasing over the past several years as we continue to focus on creating long-term shareholder value. 
Turning to Slide 17. While the outlook for a rate increase continues to fluctuate daily, I'll remind you that our balance sheet is well positioned to benefit from an increase in rates. The benefits of full year 2016 net interest income from the rate rise that occurred in December is expected to be about $90 million, assuming deposit pricing continues to remain stable. 
The table on this slide gives some estimated additional upside to net interest income over the annual period following a rate rise. For example, if the Federal Reserve raises its rates 25 basis points and our deposit prices begin to move at that rate rise at a 25% beta, we believe we would gain about $70 million more in annualized net interest income. Of course, deposit pricing is only one assumption on our interest rate sensitivity modeling. Other key variables include loan and deposit behavior in a rising rate environment. Our standard modeling and the list of assumptions we use are included in the appendix. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Ralph."

Turning to Slide 18 and our outlook for the full year 2016 relative to 2015. We have not changed our outlook for loans. We expect our average loan growth to be in line with U.S. GDP growth. We expect to see the typical third quarter seaso",476,"Thank you, Dave. Turning to Slide 18 and our outlook for the full year 2016 relative to 2015. We have not changed our outlook for loans. We expect our average loan growth to be in line with U.S. GDP growth. We expect to see the typical third quarter seasonal declines in dealer, mortgage banker and general Middle Market to be followed by a rebound in the fourth quarter. In addition, we anticipate the decline in Energy outstandings to continue but perhaps at a more moderate pace than we saw in the second quarter. 
Our expectations for net interest income also have not changed. As far as credit, we expect continued solid credit quality with metrics, absent Energy, to remain better than historical norms. With the significant reserve build we established in the first quarter, if the Energy outlook remains stable, we would expect the provision for the rest of the year to reflect net charge-offs between 35 and 45 basis points. This is a modest reduction from the outlook we provided last quarter as a result of better-than-anticipated performance of our Energy portfolio, including the spring redeterminations and decline in loan balances. 
Movements in the Energy reserve from here will depend on many factors, the biggest being oil and gas prices as well as Energy customers' continuing ability to cut costs, raise equity, sell assets and reduce debt. Our expectations for noninterest income have not changed. Of note, as I mentioned earlier, we have begun to implement initiatives to drive more fee income, and we expect we will start to see results early next year. 
We have also updated our noninterest expense outlook, which now includes total restructuring expenses of approximately $90 million to $110 million for the year. Partially offsetting this will be savings derived from GEAR Up of about $20 million to be achieved primarily in the fourth quarter. Expenses in the second half of the year relative to the first half are impacted by 2 more days, the full impact of merit increases and an expected increase in the FDIC expense as a result of the surcharge. Finally, outside processing expenses are expected to continue to grow with increased card revenue. Our tax rate for full year 2016 is now about 30%, which is a reduction from our prior guidance as a result of the impact from the restructuring charges. 
In closing, Comerica is dedicated to providing high-quality financial services and building lasting client relationships. We operate Comerica for the ultimate benefit of our shareholders, and all of our actions are directed to maximize value while not compromising our commitment to our clients, the communities we serve, regulatory standing and strong risk management.

We're looking at that benefit to help drive the efficiency in credit, help drive efficiency in other operational areas, as Ralph spoke to, the whole digitalization effort. But what we haven't built in is any real significant amount of savings. We do think they're there. We need more time to study. I think we'll have a clearer line of sight on a number of those as we get to the end of the third quarter and report out with Q3."

And we are seeing still good opportunities really across all of our lines of business, Middle Market, Small Business, Commercial Real Estate, et cetera. When you look at the Houston market, certainly more impact from energy overall and energy-related exposure. We continue to be a little bit more cautious there in terms of new originations, but really have not seen a lot of deterioration outside of energy in that portfolio. And we continue to watch CRE but have not seen a lot of deterioration there either. And so in balance, the Texas economy, much more diverse than it was during the last energy cycle. About 15% of that economy overall is energy dependent right now, and I would say that we continue to see opportunities in Northern Texas, a little bit less so in Southern Texas."

To strengthen our competitive position and ensure that we remain a strong partner and trusted adviser to our customers for the ultimate benefit of our shareholders, we are fundamentally changing the way we opera",2199,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us. To strengthen our competitive position and ensure that we remain a strong partner and trusted adviser to our customers for the ultimate benefit of our shareholders, we are fundamentally changing the way we operate in many areas of our business. Today, we are announcing actions we are undertaking through our transformational enterprise-wide initiative that we refer to as GEAR Up. To date, we have already identified efficiency and revenue opportunities that are expected to drive at least $230 million in additional pretax income. Moreover, we are pursuing additional opportunities that will further enhance our profitability. 
This slide highlights some of the key components of the initiative so far. Through our comprehensive review and analysis over the past several months, we have identified more than 20 work streams focused on enhancing revenue and reducing expenses. We are moving expeditiously and have already begun the implementation process. We will measure our progress through tangible financial targets. We expect to increase profitability, with the end result being a meaningful improvement in our efficiency ratio and return on equity. I will provide further details in a moment. 
We currently estimate that through 2018, total pretax restructuring charges of $140 million to $160 million will be incurred. In the second quarter of 2016, we recorded about 1/3 of these charges, totaling $53 million, primarily related to severance. A significant portion of restructuring charges over the next 2 quarters is expected to be related to real estate consolidation. 
Our review demonstrated that our strategy of being a relationship-based commercial bank with a unique geographic footprint, strong industry expertise and superior risk culture positions Comerica for short- and long-term success. Specifically, our footprint is well situated as it provides diversity and significant growth opportunities with interdependencies that make each market valuable to our entire portfolio. 
Finally, I, along with our executive team, own this initiative, and we are committed to providing quarterly updates on our progress. We will hold ourselves accountable to achieving our goal of improved profitability. And as you know, our compensation is well-aligned with our shareholders as it is tied to the bank's financial results and the stock's performance. 
Comerica, along with the industry, has been managing through a difficult environment with prolonged low interest rates, slow economic growth as well as rising technology and regulatory costs. Over the last several years, we have been diligently working to reduce costs by judiciously renegotiating vendor contracts, reducing our real estate exposure and rationalizing operations. While these efforts were effective and meaningful in their own right, we recognize that we need to do more to meet the mounting challenges, which is why we launched this transformation initiative. 
As I have indicated previously, our board and management team are committed to evaluating all opportunities to enhance shareholder value and doing what is in the best long-term interest of our shareholders. If there are strategic alternatives that are realistic, achievable and will maximize shareholder value, they will be fully considered. We know we must earn our right to remain independent. That said, we are doing what is within our control to proactively position ourselves as a stronger, more competitive and profitable organization. 
Turning to Slide 4 and a closer look at the financial targets. Our initial analysis is identified that we can drive approximately $140 million in additional annual pretax income by the end of 2017 and $230 million in the run rate by the end of 2018. Approximately 30% or $70 million is associated with revenue enhancements. The expense savings of $160 million represents nearly 9% of fiscal year 2015 expenses. 
Looking at our efficiency ratio, you may recall that our 2015 efficiency ratio of 67% was impacted by a change in accounting presentation for a card program that added over 2 percentage points but had no impact to our bottom line. Without any increasing rates, we believe the actions we are taking will drive our efficiency ratio to the low 60s by the end of 2017 and at or below 60% by year-end 2018. 
By adding an unexpected 200 basis points to our ROE, these revenue and expense actions take us a long way towards achieving a double-digit return on equity. While we are focused on implementing these actions, management continues to identify further opportunities, which will assist us in reaching a double-digit return on equity. On a pro forma basis, the initial actions are expected to drive our ROE well above the 2015 peer average. I firmly believe that as we deliver on this plan, we will increase shareholder value and achieve the level of returns that our shareholders deserve. 
Turning to Slide 5. We have outlined some of the key actions identified to date that we are undertaking. Of note, this does not include business growth in the normal course, and we expect the initiative to drive further run-rate benefits beyond 2018. 
Our planned revenue enhancements, which equal approximately $30 million through 2017 and $70 million by year-end 2018, include increasing the customer penetration of our products and services and accelerating growth in Middle Market banking. 
To this end, on customer penetration, we are expanding product offerings, enhancing sales tools and training as well as realigning employee incentives. In addition, we recently began using improved customer analytics to identify opportunities, which should increase cross-sold products per customer relationship. We also have simplified leadership in both Wealth Management and Treasury Management to support speed, simplicity and agility in taking action as well as bring renewed vigor and focus to both areas. 
On the next slide, I will discuss the Treasury Management initiatives in more detail. As you know, Middle Market banking is our largest business line, but it has been slow growing in this economic cycle. In order to help drive growth in this segment, we have formed a team to create a national standardized process for sales, training and performance management. We expect this will leverage best practices across our geographies. Of course, our well-regarded approach to local relationship management will not change. 
Turning to the expense reductions. We currently expect $110 million in annual run-rate cost savings by year-end 2017 and $160 million in total by year-end 2018. Over the next year, we plan to reduce our total workforce by approximately 9%. We are eliminating management layers in order to get closer to our customers and accelerate decision-making. This includes consolidating functions and responsibilities while taking care to ensure we maintain our high standards for customer service and deep expertise and experience. While many of these actions are difficult, particularly for our employees, we must be proactive to overcome the challenges of the continuing low-rate environment. This is not an easy process, and we're being thoughtful and deliberate in our approach. 
In addition, we will increase capacity by obtaining better productivity and core operations through automation. Streamlining our credit process is a great example. Through further centralization and digitalization of our credit process from application to approval to documentation, we will enhance data collection and analysis, shorten the duration of the process, allowing for us -- for an improved customer experience. 
That said, as we execute this process, we will not compromise our strong credit culture. We will enhance our technology capabilities while reducing our overall spend by optimizing our infrastructure and substantially reducing the number of IT applications across the bank. In doing so, we will continue to make technology advances such as enhancing our fraud protection capabilities, expanding online and mobile capabilities for customers, elevating the quality of data and information management and further modernizing our suite of customer-focused technology. 
Regarding our footprint, with the advancement of technology and broader application of alternative work arrangements, we need less real estate to operate our business. Therefore, we expect to reduce office and operation space as well as consolidate approximately 40 banking centers or about 8% of our total network over the next year or so. These actions are in line with industry trends as an increasing number of customers prefer to utilize alternative delivery channels such as mobile banking. 
Turning to Slide 6 and additional detail on our opportunities in Treasury Management, which is a meaningful contributor to our revenue initiative. While our Treasury Management product offering is robust and part of our high-caliber commercial banking franchise, we believe we can increase revenue through 3 opportunities. First, within our existing customer base, we intend to increase our share of wallet. Naturally, this has always been a goal for us, but through a focus on selling new products at higher margins and a new data-driven assessment tool, we are aiming to make significant progress in identifying new opportunities. We have already had success with the pilot program using this analytical tool in our California market, and we began rolling it out to all of our markets in June.
Secondly, we are realigning sales channels to increase efficiency and productivity. This includes further utilizing mobile applications to deliver and document services even faster than we do today. In addition, recalibrating our customer service coverage, we are ensuring our most valuable clients receive dedicated resources. 
Finally, another major contributor is expected to be our merchant services offering. Through our recent partnership with an industry leader, we have expanded our product suite and have increased our client penetration by 5%. This has resulted in tremendous growth, with revenue more than doubling since second quarter of 2015. We are gaining momentum, and the prospects are vast, with more than 20,000 of our clients currently processing with other vendors. 
In summary, we are implementing meaningful changes that we expect will allow us to operate more efficiency -- efficiently and lower expenses as well as increase revenue. And while rising rates can be a significant benefit to us, we are neither waiting nor relying on that to drive improved returns. We believe this initiative will drive enhanced value for our shareholders through increased profitability. 
Now turning to our second quarter results on Slide 7. Our overall results were solid and reflect the underlying resilience of our business model. Second quarter 2016 net income of $104 million or $0.58 per share included after-tax restructuring charges of $34 million or $0.19 per share. 
Slide 8 provides further detail on our results. Average loans increased $1.1 billion or 2% to $49.5 billion. We saw growth in Commercial Real Estate, Mortgage Banker Finance and National Dealer Services, partially offset by the expected decrease in Energy. The increase in Commercial Real Estate is driven by well-structured, attractive opportunities with existing customers. This includes a mix of drawdowns on construction commitments and term loans on stabilized properties. 
Our average total deposits declined slightly to $56.5 billion. Noninterest-bearing deposits grew over 1%, but were offset by a decline in interest-bearing deposits as we continued to maintain our pricing discipline. 
Net interest income declined $2 million to $445 million. The benefit from loan growth was offset by nonaccrual loan activity and an adjustment to the residual value of the lease. We had slightly higher funding costs due to an increase in wholesale debt to opportunistically prefund an upcoming debt maturity and support loan growth. Overall, credit quality was solid and reflects declines in criticized and nonaccrual loans as well as net charge-offs. This was a result of the improved credit performance of our energy portfolio. 
Energy loans have declined $356 million or 11%, and commitments have declined over $600 million or nearly 11% since the end of the first quarter as our customers continue to take the necessary actions to reduce their bank debt. We have completed 88% of the spring redeterminations of our E&P customers, and borrowing bases have come down about 22% on average. 
Criticized Energy loans have declined $281 million as of the end of second quarter. Energy charge-offs remain manageable and declined from the first quarter. While the performance of this portfolio has improved and oil and gas prices have increased since the first quarter, we remain cautious and believe we are adequately reserved with our reserve allocation at over 8% of Energy loans as of June 30. 
Noninterest income increased $23 million, with growth in nearly all customer-driven categories. The largest increases were in card fees, fiduciary income, customer derivative income and commercial lending fees. In addition, results benefited from a $10 million swing in deferred comp, which is offset in expenses. 
We continue to tightly manage expenses. Noninterest expenses include the $53 million restructuring charge that I just discussed. Excluding this, expenses increased $6 million. 
Our capital position remains solid. As far as our second quarter results compared to the same period a year ago, revenue is up over 5%. This reflects the benefit from the increase in short-term rates as well as growth in fee income as we continue to drive for deeper customer relationships. 
Expenses were impacted by the $53 million in restructuring charges we incurred this year as well as the net release of litigation reserves of $30 million in the second quarter of 2015. Putting these 2 items aside, you can see that expenses have been very well managed. 
And now I will turn the call over to Dave, who will go over the quarter in more detail."

Turning to Slide 9. As Ralph mentioned, second quarter average loans increased $1.1 billion compared to the first quarter, including a $356 million decline in Energy loans.

Turning to Slide 9. As Ralph mentioned, second quarter average loans increased $1.1 billion compared to the first quarter, including a $356 million decline in Energy loans. We continue to see solid growth in our Commercial Real Estate business with construction draws and term loans primarily with existing customers. The projects, predominantly multifamily in primary markets within California and Texas with proven developers, have favorable credit profiles that include significant equity content as we continue to be cautious and selective. 
Also, auto inventories are seasonally high, resulting an increased line utilization in our National Dealer business. Finally, summer home sales, combined with the decline in mortgage rates, made June a record month in our 50-year history in the mortgage banking business. Likewise, quarter-end loans were up $1 billion over the first quarter with all the same drivers. 
As of June 30, increased commitments in mortgage banker, Commercial Real Estate and National Dealer were offset by the large decline in Energy. Line utilization increased 1.5 percentage points to 53%, mostly driven by the seasonal increases in mortgage banker and National Dealer, and our strong pipeline increased further. Although interest earned on loans was unchanged quarter-over-quarter, our second quarter loan yield decreased 7 basis points. The benefit from loan growth was offset by a decline in interest recoveries on nonaccrual loans, a full quarter impact from the increase in nonaccrual loans in the first quarter and a lease residual valuation adjustment. 
Turning to Slide 10. Average deposits were basically stable quarter-over-quarter. We had typical seasonal growth in both interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing Retail Banking deposits. This was offset by a decline in commercial deposits, primarily due to seasonal weakness in municipalities and our relationship banking strategy and purposeful pricing in large corporate. Our deposit cost remained stable at 14 basis points as we continue to prudently manage pricing. We are closely monitoring our deposit base as well as the market, and we believe we are well positioned with predominantly operational relationship-oriented deposits. 
Turning to Slide 11. We maintained our securities book at about $12.5 billion. The estimated duration of our portfolio sits at about 3 years; in the expected duration under a 200 basis point rate shock extends it modestly to 3.9 years. In the current environment, we expect to see prepays increase moderately from $490 million in the second quarter to this $550 million to $650 million range in the third quarter. The minor pressure we saw in our security portfolio yield may increase slightly due to reinvestment of larger monthly prepays at a lower rate. 
To help combat this, we are selectively purchasing securities with modestly longer duration. For example, a couple of weeks ago, we were able to place a $100 million Ginnie Mae purchase at 1.68%, which had a duration of about 18 months longer than the current portfolio average but had similar extension risk. As of quarter end, our estimated LCR ratio continues to meet the fully phased-in 2017 requirement plus a buffer. 
Turning to Slide 12. Net interest income declined $2 million while the net interest margin decreased 7 basis points. As I discussed earlier, all loan-related impacts netted to 0 but had a 4 basis point negative effect on the margin. The benefit from loan growth was offset by the previously mentioned nonaccrual activity, a lease residual valuation adjustment as well as slightly lower accretion. 
Wholesale funding costs increased $3 million as we added $2.8 billion in FHLB loans at very attractive terms to prefund a $650 million November debt maturity as well as support loan growth. This was partly offset by income earned on higher balances at the Fed. 
Turning to Slide 13. Our overall credit picture remains strong, and performance of our Energy portfolio improved in the second quarter. Our allowance for credit losses increased $2 million to $772 million, and our allowance-to-loan ratio was 1.45%. Total criticized loans declined $377 million to $3.6 billion or only 7% of total loans at quarter end. Nonaccrual loans decreased $76 million, and net charge-offs declined to 38 basis points or $47 million. Energy accounted for over 2/3 of the net charge-offs, and total net charge-offs for all other business lines combined was only 13 basis points. 
As far as our Energy portfolio, outstandings declined 11% to $2.7 billion at quarter end and now comprises 5.4% of our total loans. E&P loans make up 70% of our Energy portfolio, and as Ralph mentioned, the spring redetermination process is nearly complete. So far, borrowing bases have come down about 22% on average, and the number of deficiencies has been relatively stable since last quarter. energy services has been significantly impacted this cycle, yet loan outstandings declined 15% to $363 million and now comprise less than 1% of our total loan portfolio. 
Total criticized Energy loans decreased $281 million due to the decline in outstandings and a small number of risk rating upgrades as our customers have reduced expenses, sold assets and tapped the capital markets. Also noteworthy is that 100% of these nonaccrual loans are fully current on interest payments, including the 9 loans we have in bankruptcy. The reserve for Energy loans is over 8%, and remember, those reserves may not turn into ultimate losses. Further detail on our Energy portfolio can be found in the appendix. 
Slide 14 outlines noninterest income. We had broad-based growth, with total customer-driven fees increasing 5% over the first quarter. Our cross-sell efforts have helped drive increases in card fees and fiduciary income. Customer derivative income saw robust activity in conjunction with the Brexit vote, and commercial lending fees grew with a pickup in syndication activity following a first quarter lull. 
Foreign exchange and brokerage fees were also low. In addition, we had a $10 million increase in deferred compensation, which is included in other noninterest income and is offset in noninterest expense. 
Turning to Slide 15. Aside from the $53 million restructuring charge Ralph discussed, noninterest expenses increased $6 million. This included the $10 million increase in deferred compensation, which was partly offset by an $8 million gain on the sale of leased assets. The remaining increase was due to higher outside processing and advertising expense, which is connected to our revenue growth, along with higher FDIC insurance premiums. 
Salaries and benefits was down $1 million. The increase in deferred compensation as well as annual merit seasonal 401(k) contributions as well as slightly higher incentive comp, which is related to revenue growth, were offset by decreases in share-based comp and payroll taxes following seasonally high expense in the first quarter. 
Moving to Slide 16 and capital management. We continue to return excess capital to our shareholders in a meaningful way. We completed our 2015 capital plan, which included equity purchases -- repurchases of $290 million under our equity repurchase program over the 5 quarters. In the second quarter, we repurchased 1.5 million shares and increased the dividend 5% to $0.22 per share. Our 2016 capital plan includes share repurchases up to $440 million. 
The pace of our buyback will be dependent on balance sheet movements and our financial performance, which can be impacted by market factors, particularly interest rates. The plan also includes a further increase on our quarterly dividend to $0.23 per share, which will be considered by the board at the end of this month. Our tangible book value per share increased to $40.52 and has been steadily increasing over the past several years as we continue to focus on creating long-term shareholder value. 
Turning to Slide 17. While the outlook for a rate increase continues to fluctuate daily, I'll remind you that our balance sheet is well positioned to benefit from an increase in rates. The benefits of full year 2016 net interest income from the rate rise that occurred in December is expected to be about $90 million, assuming deposit pricing continues to remain stable. 
The table on this slide gives some estimated additional upside to net interest income over the annual period following a rate rise. For example, if the Federal Reserve raises its rates 25 basis points and our deposit prices begin to move at that rate rise at a 25% beta, we believe we would gain about $70 million more in annualized net interest income. Of course, deposit pricing is only one assumption on our interest rate sensitivity modeling. Other key variables include loan and deposit behavior in a rising rate environment. Our standard modeling and the list of assumptions we use are included in the appendix. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Ralph."

We expect our average loan growth to be in line with U.S. GDP growth. We expect to see the typical third quarter seasonal declines in dealer, mortgage banker and general Middle Market to be followed by a rebound in the fourth quarter. In addition, we anticipate the decline in Energy outstandings to continue but perhaps at a more moderate pace than we saw in the second quarter. 
Our expectations for net interest income also have not changed. As far as credit, we expect continued solid credit quality with metrics, absent Energy, to remain better than historical norms. With the significant reserve build we established in the first quarter, if the Energy outlook remains stable, we would expect the provision for the rest of the year to reflect net charge-offs between 35 and 45 basis points. This is a modest reduction from the outlook we provided last quarter as a result of better-than-anticipated performance of our Energy portfolio, including the spring redeterminations and decline in loan balances. 
Movements in the Energy reserve from here will depend on many factors, the biggest being oil and gas prices as well as Energy customers' continuing ability to cut costs, raise equity, sell assets and reduce debt. Our expectations for noninterest income have not changed. Of note, as I mentioned earlier, we have begun to implement initiatives to drive more fee income, and we expect we will start to see results early next year. 
We have also updated our noninterest expense outlook, which now includes total restructuring expenses of approximately $90 million to $110 million for the year. Partially offsetting this will be savings derived from GEAR Up of about $20 million to be achieved primarily in the fourth quarter. Expenses in the second half of the year relative to the first half are impacted by 2 more days, the full impact of merit increases and an expected increase in the FDIC expense as a result of the surcharge. Finally, outside processing expenses are expected to continue to grow with increased card revenue. Our tax rate for full year 2016 is now about 30%, which is a reduction from our prior guidance as a result of the impact from the restructuring charges. 
In closing, Comerica is dedicated to providing high-quality financial services and building lasting client relationships. We operate Comerica for the ultimate benefit of our shareholders, and all of our actions are directed to maximize value while not compromising our commitment to our clients, the communities we serve, regulatory standing and strong risk management. As I previously stated, through GEAR Up, I am confident that we can enhance shareholder returns through improved financial performance.

I would say that overall from a Texas perspective, as we've said in some prior calls, it really is a scenario where you sort of draw a line down the middle of the state. There are really 2 economic factors at play -- or 2 economies at play, that the Northern Texas market continues to be more diverse, more robust from a growth perspective, with still net new jobs being added, much more diverse economy overall, less energy dependency. And we are seeing still good opportunities really across all of our lines of business, Middle Market, Small Business, Commercial Real Estate, et cetera. When you look at the Houston market, certainly more impact from energy overall and energy-related exposure. We continue to be a little bit more cautious there in terms of new originations, but really have not seen a lot of deterioration outside of energy in that portfolio. And we continue to watch CRE but have not seen a lot of deterioration there either. And so in balance, the Texas economy, much more diverse than it was during the last energy cycle. About 15% of that economy overall is energy dependent right now, and I would say that we continue to see opportunities in Northern Texas, a little bit less so in Southern Texas."

To strengthen our competitive position and ensure that we remain a strong partner and trusted adviser to our customers for the ultimate benefit of our shareholders, we are fundamentally changing the way we opera",2199,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us. To strengthen our competitive position and ensure that we remain a strong partner and trusted adviser to our customers for the ultimate benefit of our shareholders, we are fundamentally changing the way we operate in many areas of our business. Today, we are announcing actions we are undertaking through our transformational enterprise-wide initiative that we refer to as GEAR Up. To date, we have already identified efficiency and revenue opportunities that are expected to drive at least $230 million in additional pretax income. Moreover, we are pursuing additional opportunities that will further enhance our profitability. 
This slide highlights some of the key components of the initiative so far. Through our comprehensive review and analysis over the past several months, we have identified more than 20 work streams focused on enhancing revenue and reducing expenses. We are moving expeditiously and have already begun the implementation process. We will measure our progress through tangible financial targets. We expect to increase profitability, with the end result being a meaningful improvement in our efficiency ratio and return on equity. I will provide further details in a moment. 
We currently estimate that through 2018, total pretax restructuring charges of $140 million to $160 million will be incurred. In the second quarter of 2016, we recorded about 1/3 of these charges, totaling $53 million, primarily related to severance. A significant portion of restructuring charges over the next 2 quarters is expected to be related to real estate consolidation. 
Our review demonstrated that our strategy of being a relationship-based commercial bank with a unique geographic footprint, strong industry expertise and superior risk culture positions Comerica for short- and long-term success. Specifically, our footprint is well situated as it provides diversity and significant growth opportunities with interdependencies that make each market valuable to our entire portfolio. 
Finally, I, along with our executive team, own this initiative, and we are committed to providing quarterly updates on our progress. We will hold ourselves accountable to achieving our goal of improved profitability. And as you know, our compensation is well-aligned with our shareholders as it is tied to the bank's financial results and the stock's performance. 
Comerica, along with the industry, has been managing through a difficult environment with prolonged low interest rates, slow economic growth as well as rising technology and regulatory costs. Over the last several years, we have been diligently working to reduce costs by judiciously renegotiating vendor contracts, reducing our real estate exposure and rationalizing operations. While these efforts were effective and meaningful in their own right, we recognize that we need to do more to meet the mounting challenges, which is why we launched this transformation initiative. 
As I have indicated previously, our board and management team are committed to evaluating all opportunities to enhance shareholder value and doing what is in the best long-term interest of our shareholders. If there are strategic alternatives that are realistic, achievable and will maximize shareholder value, they will be fully considered. We know we must earn our right to remain independent. That said, we are doing what is within our control to proactively position ourselves as a stronger, more competitive and profitable organization. 
Turning to Slide 4 and a closer look at the financial targets. Our initial analysis is identified that we can drive approximately $140 million in additional annual pretax income by the end of 2017 and $230 million in the run rate by the end of 2018. Approximately 30% or $70 million is associated with revenue enhancements. The expense savings of $160 million represents nearly 9% of fiscal year 2015 expenses. 
Looking at our efficiency ratio, you may recall that our 2015 efficiency ratio of 67% was impacted by a change in accounting presentation for a card program that added over 2 percentage points but had no impact to our bottom line. Without any increasing rates, we believe the actions we are taking will drive our efficiency ratio to the low 60s by the end of 2017 and at or below 60% by year-end 2018. 
By adding an unexpected 200 basis points to our ROE, these revenue and expense actions take us a long way towards achieving a double-digit return on equity. While we are focused on implementing these actions, management continues to identify further opportunities, which will assist us in reaching a double-digit return on equity. On a pro forma basis, the initial actions are expected to drive our ROE well above the 2015 peer average. I firmly believe that as we deliver on this plan, we will increase shareholder value and achieve the level of returns that our shareholders deserve. 
Turning to Slide 5. We have outlined some of the key actions identified to date that we are undertaking. Of note, this does not include business growth in the normal course, and we expect the initiative to drive further run-rate benefits beyond 2018. 
Our planned revenue enhancements, which equal approximately $30 million through 2017 and $70 million by year-end 2018, include increasing the customer penetration of our products and services and accelerating growth in Middle Market banking. 
To this end, on customer penetration, we are expanding product offerings, enhancing sales tools and training as well as realigning employee incentives. In addition, we recently began using improved customer analytics to identify opportunities, which should increase cross-sold products per customer relationship. We also have simplified leadership in both Wealth Management and Treasury Management to support speed, simplicity and agility in taking action as well as bring renewed vigor and focus to both areas. 
On the next slide, I will discuss the Treasury Management initiatives in more detail. As you know, Middle Market banking is our largest business line, but it has been slow growing in this economic cycle. In order to help drive growth in this segment, we have formed a team to create a national standardized process for sales, training and performance management. We expect this will leverage best practices across our geographies. Of course, our well-regarded approach to local relationship management will not change. 
Turning to the expense reductions. We currently expect $110 million in annual run-rate cost savings by year-end 2017 and $160 million in total by year-end 2018. Over the next year, we plan to reduce our total workforce by approximately 9%. We are eliminating management layers in order to get closer to our customers and accelerate decision-making. This includes consolidating functions and responsibilities while taking care to ensure we maintain our high standards for customer service and deep expertise and experience. While many of these actions are difficult, particularly for our employees, we must be proactive to overcome the challenges of the continuing low-rate environment. This is not an easy process, and we're being thoughtful and deliberate in our approach. 
In addition, we will increase capacity by obtaining better productivity and core operations through automation. Streamlining our credit process is a great example. Through further centralization and digitalization of our credit process from application to approval to documentation, we will enhance data collection and analysis, shorten the duration of the process, allowing for us -- for an improved customer experience. 
That said, as we execute this process, we will not compromise our strong credit culture. We will enhance our technology capabilities while reducing our overall spend by optimizing our infrastructure and substantially reducing the number of IT applications across the bank. In doing so, we will continue to make technology advances such as enhancing our fraud protection capabilities, expanding online and mobile capabilities for customers, elevating the quality of data and information management and further modernizing our suite of customer-focused technology. 
Regarding our footprint, with the advancement of technology and broader application of alternative work arrangements, we need less real estate to operate our business. Therefore, we expect to reduce office and operation space as well as consolidate approximately 40 banking centers or about 8% of our total network over the next year or so. These actions are in line with industry trends as an increasing number of customers prefer to utilize alternative delivery channels such as mobile banking. 
Turning to Slide 6 and additional detail on our opportunities in Treasury Management, which is a meaningful contributor to our revenue initiative. While our Treasury Management product offering is robust and part of our high-caliber commercial banking franchise, we believe we can increase revenue through 3 opportunities. First, within our existing customer base, we intend to increase our share of wallet. Naturally, this has always been a goal for us, but through a focus on selling new products at higher margins and a new data-driven assessment tool, we are aiming to make significant progress in identifying new opportunities. We have already had success with the pilot program using this analytical tool in our California market, and we began rolling it out to all of our markets in June.
Secondly, we are realigning sales channels to increase efficiency and productivity. This includes further utilizing mobile applications to deliver and document services even faster than we do today. In addition, recalibrating our customer service coverage, we are ensuring our most valuable clients receive dedicated resources. 
Finally, another major contributor is expected to be our merchant services offering. Through our recent partnership with an industry leader, we have expanded our product suite and have increased our client penetration by 5%. This has resulted in tremendous growth, with revenue more than doubling since second quarter of 2015. We are gaining momentum, and the prospects are vast, with more than 20,000 of our clients currently processing with other vendors. 
In summary, we are implementing meaningful changes that we expect will allow us to operate more efficiency -- efficiently and lower expenses as well as increase revenue. And while rising rates can be a significant benefit to us, we are neither waiting nor relying on that to drive improved returns. We believe this initiative will drive enhanced value for our shareholders through increased profitability. 
Now turning to our second quarter results on Slide 7. Our overall results were solid and reflect the underlying resilience of our business model. Second quarter 2016 net income of $104 million or $0.58 per share included after-tax restructuring charges of $34 million or $0.19 per share. 
Slide 8 provides further detail on our results. Average loans increased $1.1 billion or 2% to $49.5 billion. We saw growth in Commercial Real Estate, Mortgage Banker Finance and National Dealer Services, partially offset by the expected decrease in Energy. The increase in Commercial Real Estate is driven by well-structured, attractive opportunities with existing customers. This includes a mix of drawdowns on construction commitments and term loans on stabilized properties. 
Our average total deposits declined slightly to $56.5 billion. Noninterest-bearing deposits grew over 1%, but were offset by a decline in interest-bearing deposits as we continued to maintain our pricing discipline. 
Net interest income declined $2 million to $445 million. The benefit from loan growth was offset by nonaccrual loan activity and an adjustment to the residual value of the lease. We had slightly higher funding costs due to an increase in wholesale debt to opportunistically prefund an upcoming debt maturity and support loan growth. Overall, credit quality was solid and reflects declines in criticized and nonaccrual loans as well as net charge-offs. This was a result of the improved credit performance of our energy portfolio. 
Energy loans have declined $356 million or 11%, and commitments have declined over $600 million or nearly 11% since the end of the first quarter as our customers continue to take the necessary actions to reduce their bank debt. We have completed 88% of the spring redeterminations of our E&P customers, and borrowing bases have come down about 22% on average. 
Criticized Energy loans have declined $281 million as of the end of second quarter. Energy charge-offs remain manageable and declined from the first quarter. While the performance of this portfolio has improved and oil and gas prices have increased since the first quarter, we remain cautious and believe we are adequately reserved with our reserve allocation at over 8% of Energy loans as of June 30. 
Noninterest income increased $23 million, with growth in nearly all customer-driven categories. The largest increases were in card fees, fiduciary income, customer derivative income and commercial lending fees. In addition, results benefited from a $10 million swing in deferred comp, which is offset in expenses. 
We continue to tightly manage expenses. Noninterest expenses include the $53 million restructuring charge that I just discussed. Excluding this, expenses increased $6 million. 
Our capital position remains solid. As far as our second quarter results compared to the same period a year ago, revenue is up over 5%. This reflects the benefit from the increase in short-term rates as well as growth in fee income as we continue to drive for deeper customer relationships. 
Expenses were impacted by the $53 million in restructuring charges we incurred this year as well as the net release of litigation reserves of $30 million in the second quarter of 2015. Putting these 2 items aside, you can see that expenses have been very well managed. 
And now I will turn the call over to Dave, who will go over the quarter in more detail."
318670,344495179,1008170,"Comerica Incorporated, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 19, 2016",2016-07-19,"Earnings Calls","Comerica Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Ralph. Good morning, everyone.  Turning to Slide 9. As Ralph mentioned, second quarter average loans increased $1.1 billion compared to the first quarter, including a $356 million decline in Energy loans. We continue to see solid growth in our C",1427,"Thanks, Ralph. Good morning, everyone.  
Turning to Slide 9. As Ralph mentioned, second quarter average loans increased $1.1 billion compared to the first quarter, including a $356 million decline in Energy loans. We continue to see solid growth in our Commercial Real Estate business with construction draws and term loans primarily with existing customers. The projects, predominantly multifamily in primary markets within California and Texas with proven developers, have favorable credit profiles that include significant equity content as we continue to be cautious and selective. 
Also, auto inventories are seasonally high, resulting an increased line utilization in our National Dealer business. Finally, summer home sales, combined with the decline in mortgage rates, made June a record month in our 50-year history in the mortgage banking business. Likewise, quarter-end loans were up $1 billion over the first quarter with all the same drivers. 
As of June 30, increased commitments in mortgage banker, Commercial Real Estate and National Dealer were offset by the large decline in Energy. Line utilization increased 1.5 percentage points to 53%, mostly driven by the seasonal increases in mortgage banker and National Dealer, and our strong pipeline increased further. Although interest earned on loans was unchanged quarter-over-quarter, our second quarter loan yield decreased 7 basis points. The benefit from loan growth was offset by a decline in interest recoveries on nonaccrual loans, a full quarter impact from the increase in nonaccrual loans in the first quarter and a lease residual valuation adjustment. 
Turning to Slide 10. Average deposits were basically stable quarter-over-quarter. We had typical seasonal growth in both interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing Retail Banking deposits. This was offset by a decline in commercial deposits, primarily due to seasonal weakness in municipalities and our relationship banking strategy and purposeful pricing in large corporate. Our deposit cost remained stable at 14 basis points as we continue to prudently manage pricing. We are closely monitoring our deposit base as well as the market, and we believe we are well positioned with predominantly operational relationship-oriented deposits. 
Turning to Slide 11. We maintained our securities book at about $12.5 billion. The estimated duration of our portfolio sits at about 3 years; in the expected duration under a 200 basis point rate shock extends it modestly to 3.9 years. In the current environment, we expect to see prepays increase moderately from $490 million in the second quarter to this $550 million to $650 million range in the third quarter. The minor pressure we saw in our security portfolio yield may increase slightly due to reinvestment of larger monthly prepays at a lower rate. 
To help combat this, we are selectively purchasing securities with modestly longer duration. For example, a couple of weeks ago, we were able to place a $100 million Ginnie Mae purchase at 1.68%, which had a duration of about 18 months longer than the current portfolio average but had similar extension risk. As of quarter end, our estimated LCR ratio continues to meet the fully phased-in 2017 requirement plus a buffer. 
Turning to Slide 12. Net interest income declined $2 million while the net interest margin decreased 7 basis points. As I discussed earlier, all loan-related impacts netted to 0 but had a 4 basis point negative effect on the margin. The benefit from loan growth was offset by the previously mentioned nonaccrual activity, a lease residual valuation adjustment as well as slightly lower accretion. 
Wholesale funding costs increased $3 million as we added $2.8 billion in FHLB loans at very attractive terms to prefund a $650 million November debt maturity as well as support loan growth. This was partly offset by income earned on higher balances at the Fed. 
Turning to Slide 13. Our overall credit picture remains strong, and performance of our Energy portfolio improved in the second quarter. Our allowance for credit losses increased $2 million to $772 million, and our allowance-to-loan ratio was 1.45%. Total criticized loans declined $377 million to $3.6 billion or only 7% of total loans at quarter end. Nonaccrual loans decreased $76 million, and net charge-offs declined to 38 basis points or $47 million. Energy accounted for over 2/3 of the net charge-offs, and total net charge-offs for all other business lines combined was only 13 basis points. 
As far as our Energy portfolio, outstandings declined 11% to $2.7 billion at quarter end and now comprises 5.4% of our total loans. E&P loans make up 70% of our Energy portfolio, and as Ralph mentioned, the spring redetermination process is nearly complete. So far, borrowing bases have come down about 22% on average, and the number of deficiencies has been relatively stable since last quarter. Energy services has been significantly impacted this cycle, yet loan outstandings declined 15% to $363 million and now comprise less than 1% of our total loan portfolio. 
Total criticized Energy loans decreased $281 million due to the decline in outstandings and a small number of risk rating upgrades as our customers have reduced expenses, sold assets and tapped the capital markets. Also noteworthy is that 100% of these nonaccrual loans are fully current on interest payments, including the 9 loans we have in bankruptcy. The reserve for Energy loans is over 8%, and remember, those reserves may not turn into ultimate losses. Further detail on our Energy portfolio can be found in the appendix. 
Slide 14 outlines noninterest income. We had broad-based growth, with total customer-driven fees increasing 5% over the first quarter. Our cross-sell efforts have helped drive increases in card fees and fiduciary income. Customer derivative income saw robust activity in conjunction with the Brexit vote, and commercial lending fees grew with a pickup in syndication activity following a first quarter lull. 
Foreign exchange and brokerage fees were also low. In addition, we had a $10 million increase in deferred compensation, which is included in other noninterest income and is offset in noninterest expense. 
Turning to Slide 15. Aside from the $53 million restructuring charge Ralph discussed, noninterest expenses increased $6 million. This included the $10 million increase in deferred compensation, which was partly offset by an $8 million gain on the sale of leased assets. The remaining increase was due to higher outside processing and advertising expense, which is connected to our revenue growth, along with higher FDIC insurance premiums. 
Salaries and benefits was down $1 million. The increase in deferred compensation as well as annual merit seasonal 401(k) contributions as well as slightly higher incentive comp, which is related to revenue growth, were offset by decreases in share-based comp and payroll taxes following seasonally high expense in the first quarter. 
Moving to Slide 16 and capital management. We continue to return excess capital to our shareholders in a meaningful way. We completed our 2015 capital plan, which included equity purchases -- repurchases of $290 million under our equity repurchase program over the 5 quarters. In the second quarter, we repurchased 1.5 million shares and increased the dividend 5% to $0.22 per share. Our 2016 capital plan includes share repurchases up to $440 million. 
The pace of our buyback will be dependent on balance sheet movements and our financial performance, which can be impacted by market factors, particularly interest rates. The plan also includes a further increase on our quarterly dividend to $0.23 per share, which will be considered by the board at the end of this month. Our tangible book value per share increased to $40.52 and has been steadily increasing over the past several years as we continue to focus on creating long-term shareholder value. 
Turning to Slide 17. While the outlook for a rate increase continues to fluctuate daily, I'll remind you that our balance sheet is well positioned to benefit from an increase in rates. The benefits of full year 2016 net interest income from the rate rise that occurred in December is expected to be about $90 million, assuming deposit pricing continues to remain stable. 
The table on this slide gives some estimated additional upside to net interest income over the annual period following a rate rise. For example, if the Federal Reserve raises its rates 25 basis points and our deposit prices begin to move at that rate rise at a 25% beta, we believe we would gain about $70 million more in annualized net interest income. Of course, deposit pricing is only one assumption on our interest rate sensitivity modeling. Other key variables include loan and deposit behavior in a rising rate environment. Our standard modeling and the list of assumptions we use are included in the appendix. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Ralph."

Turning to Slide 18 and our outlook for the full year 2016 relative to 2015. We have not changed our outlook for loans. We expect our average loan growth to be in line with U.S. GDP growth.

We expect our average loan growth to be in line with U.S. GDP growth. We expect to see the typical third quarter seasonal declines in dealer, mortgage banker and general Middle Market to be followed by a rebound in the fourth quarter. In addition, we anticipate the decline in Energy outstandings to continue but perhaps at a more moderate pace than we saw in the second quarter. 
Our expectations for net interest income also have not changed. As far as credit, we expect continued solid credit quality with metrics, absent Energy, to remain better than historical norms. With the significant reserve build we established in the first quarter, if the Energy outlook remains stable, we would expect the provision for the rest of the year to reflect net charge-offs between 35 and 45 basis points. This is a modest reduction from the outlook we provided last quarter as a result of better-than-anticipated performance of our Energy portfolio, including the spring redeterminations and decline in loan balances. 
Movements in the Energy reserve from here will depend on many factors, the biggest being oil and gas prices as well as Energy customers' continuing ability to cut costs, raise equity, sell assets and reduce debt. Our expectations for noninterest income have not changed. Of note, as I mentioned earlier, we have begun to implement initiatives to drive more fee income, and we expect we will start to see results early next year. 
We have also updated our noninterest expense outlook, which now includes total restructuring expenses of approximately $90 million to $110 million for the year. Partially offsetting this will be savings derived from GEAR Up of about $20 million to be achieved primarily in the fourth quarter. Expenses in the second half of the year relative to the first half are impacted by 2 more days, the full impact of merit increases and an expected increase in the FDIC expense as a result of the surcharge. Finally, outside processing expenses are expected to continue to grow with increased card revenue. Our tax rate for full year 2016 is now about 30%, which is a reduction from our prior guidance as a result of the impact from the restructuring charges. 
In closing, Comerica is dedicated to providing high-quality financial services and building lasting client relationships. We operate Comerica for the ultimate benefit of our shareholders, and all of our actions are directed to maximize value while not compromising our commitment to our clients, the communities we serve, regulatory standing and strong risk management. As I previously stated, through GEAR Up, I am confident that we can enhance shareholder returns through improved financial performance. 
And now we would be happy to take your questions."

To strengthen our competitive position and ensure that we remain a strong partner and trusted adviser to our customers for the ultimate benefit of our shareholders, we are fundamentally changing the way we opera",2199,"Good morning, and thank you for joining us. To strengthen our competitive position and ensure that we remain a strong partner and trusted adviser to our customers for the ultimate benefit of our shareholders, we are fundamentally changing the way we operate in many areas of our business. Today, we are announcing actions we are undertaking through our transformational enterprise-wide initiative that we refer to as GEAR Up. To date, we have already identified efficiency and revenue opportunities that are expected to drive at least $230 million in additional pretax income. Moreover, we are pursuing additional opportunities that will further enhance our profitability. 
This slide highlights some of the key components of the initiative so far. Through our comprehensive review and analysis over the past several months, we have identified more than 20 work streams focused on enhancing revenue and reducing expenses. We are moving expeditiously and have already begun the implementation process. We will measure our progress through tangible financial targets. We expect to increase profitability, with the end result being a meaningful improvement in our efficiency ratio and return on equity. I will provide further details in a moment. 
We currently estimate that through 2018, total pretax restructuring charges of $140 million to $160 million will be incurred. In the second quarter of 2016, we recorded about 1/3 of these charges, totaling $53 million, primarily related to severance. A significant portion of restructuring charges over the next 2 quarters is expected to be related to real estate consolidation. 
Our review demonstrated that our strategy of being a relationship-based commercial bank with a unique geographic footprint, strong industry expertise and superior risk culture positions Comerica for short- and long-term success. Specifically, our footprint is well situated as it provides diversity and significant growth opportunities with interdependencies that make each market valuable to our entire portfolio. 
Finally, I, along with our executive team, own this initiative, and we are committed to providing quarterly updates on our progress. We will hold ourselves accountable to achieving our goal of improved profitability. And as you know, our compensation is well-aligned with our shareholders as it is tied to the bank's financial results and the stock's performance. 
Comerica, along with the industry, has been managing through a difficult environment with prolonged low interest rates, slow economic growth as well as rising technology and regulatory costs. Over the last several years, we have been diligently working to reduce costs by judiciously renegotiating vendor contracts, reducing our real estate exposure and rationalizing operations. While these efforts were effective and meaningful in their own right, we recognize that we need to do more to meet the mounting challenges, which is why we launched this transformation initiative. 
As I have indicated previously, our board and management team are committed to evaluating all opportunities to enhance shareholder value and doing what is in the best long-term interest of our shareholders. If there are strategic alternatives that are realistic, achievable and will maximize shareholder value, they will be fully considered. We know we must earn our right to remain independent. That said, we are doing what is within our control to proactively position ourselves as a stronger, more competitive and profitable organization. 
Turning to Slide 4 and a closer look at the financial targets. Our initial analysis is identified that we can drive approximately $140 million in additional annual pretax income by the end of 2017 and $230 million in the run rate by the end of 2018. Approximately 30% or $70 million is associated with revenue enhancements. The expense savings of $160 million represents nearly 9% of fiscal year 2015 expenses. 
Looking at our efficiency ratio, you may recall that our 2015 efficiency ratio of 67% was impacted by a change in accounting presentation for a card program that added over 2 percentage points but had no impact to our bottom line. Without any increasing rates, we believe the actions we are taking will drive our efficiency ratio to the low 60s by the end of 2017 and at or below 60% by year-end 2018. 
By adding an unexpected 200 basis points to our ROE, these revenue and expense actions take us a long way towards achieving a double-digit return on equity. While we are focused on implementing these actions, management continues to identify further opportunities, which will assist us in reaching a double-digit return on equity. On a pro forma basis, the initial actions are expected to drive our ROE well above the 2015 peer average. I firmly believe that as we deliver on this plan, we will increase shareholder value and achieve the level of returns that our shareholders deserve. 
Turning to Slide 5. We have outlined some of the key actions identified to date that we are undertaking. Of note, this does not include business growth in the normal course, and we expect the initiative to drive further run-rate benefits beyond 2018. 
Our planned revenue enhancements, which equal approximately $30 million through 2017 and $70 million by year-end 2018, include increasing the customer penetration of our products and services and accelerating growth in Middle Market banking. 
To this end, on customer penetration, we are expanding product offerings, enhancing sales tools and training as well as realigning employee incentives. In addition, we recently began using improved customer analytics to identify opportunities, which should increase cross-sold products per customer relationship. We also have simplified leadership in both Wealth Management and treasury management to support speed, simplicity and agility in taking action as well as bring renewed vigor and focus to both areas. 
On the next slide, I will discuss the treasury management initiatives in more detail. As you know, Middle Market banking is our largest business line, but it has been slow growing in this economic cycle. In order to help drive growth in this segment, we have formed a team to create a national standardized process for sales, training and performance management. We expect this will leverage best practices across our geographies. Of course, our well-regarded approach to local relationship management will not change. 
Turning to the expense reductions. We currently expect $110 million in annual run-rate cost savings by year-end 2017 and $160 million in total by year-end 2018. Over the next year, we plan to reduce our total workforce by approximately 9%. We are eliminating management layers in order to get closer to our customers and accelerate decision-making. This includes consolidating functions and responsibilities while taking care to ensure we maintain our high standards for customer service and deep expertise and experience. While many of these actions are difficult, particularly for our employees, we must be proactive to overcome the challenges of the continuing low-rate environment. This is not an easy process, and we're being thoughtful and deliberate in our approach. 
In addition, we will increase capacity by obtaining better productivity and core operations through automation. Streamlining our credit process is a great example. Through further centralization and digitalization of our credit process from application to approval to documentation, we will enhance data collection and analysis, shorten the duration of the process, allowing for us -- for an improved customer experience. 
That said, as we execute this process, we will not compromise our strong credit culture. We will enhance our technology capabilities while reducing our overall spend by optimizing our infrastructure and substantially reducing the number of IT applications across the bank. In doing so, we will continue to make technology advances such as enhancing our fraud protection capabilities, expanding online and mobile capabilities for customers, elevating the quality of data and information management and further modernizing our suite of customer-focused technology. 
Regarding our footprint, with the advancement of technology and broader application of alternative work arrangements, we need less real estate to operate our business. Therefore, we expect to reduce office and operation space as well as consolidate approximately 40 banking centers or about 8% of our total network over the next year or so. These actions are in line with industry trends as an increasing number of customers prefer to utilize alternative delivery channels such as mobile banking. 
Turning to Slide 6 and additional detail on our opportunities in treasury management, which is a meaningful contributor to our revenue initiative. While our treasury management product offering is robust and part of our high-caliber commercial banking franchise, we believe we can increase revenue through 3 opportunities. First, within our existing customer base, we intend to increase our share of wallet. Naturally, this has always been a goal for us, but through a focus on selling new products at higher margins and a new data-driven assessment tool, we are aiming to make significant progress in identifying new opportunities. We have already had success with the pilot program using this analytical tool in our California market, and we began rolling it out to all of our markets in June.
Secondly, we are realigning sales channels to increase efficiency and productivity. This includes further utilizing mobile applications to deliver and document services even faster than we do today. In addition, recalibrating our customer service coverage, we are ensuring our most valuable clients receive dedicated resources. 
Finally, another major contributor is expected to be our merchant services offering. Through our recent partnership with an industry leader, we have expanded our product suite and have increased our client penetration by 5%. This has resulted in tremendous growth, with revenue more than doubling since second quarter of 2015. We are gaining momentum, and the prospects are vast, with more than 20,000 of our clients currently processing with other vendors. 
In summary, we are implementing meaningful changes that we expect will allow us to operate more efficiency -- efficiently and lower expenses as well as increase revenue. And while rising rates can be a significant benefit to us, we are neither waiting nor relying on that to drive improved returns. We believe this initiative will drive enhanced value for our shareholders through increased profitability. 
Now turning to our second quarter results on Slide 7. Our overall results were solid and reflect the underlying resilience of our business model. Second quarter 2016 net income of $104 million or $0.58 per share included after-tax restructuring charges of $34 million or $0.19 per share. 
Slide 8 provides further detail on our results. Average loans increased $1.1 billion or 2% to $49.5 billion. We saw growth in Commercial Real Estate, Mortgage Banker Finance and National Dealer Services, partially offset by the expected decrease in Energy. The increase in Commercial Real Estate is driven by well-structured, attractive opportunities with existing customers. This includes a mix of drawdowns on construction commitments and term loans on stabilized properties. 
Our average total deposits declined slightly to $56.5 billion. Noninterest-bearing deposits grew over 1%, but were offset by a decline in interest-bearing deposits as we continued to maintain our pricing discipline. 
Net interest income declined $2 million to $445 million. The benefit from loan growth was offset by nonaccrual loan activity and an adjustment to the residual value of the lease. We had slightly higher funding costs due to an increase in wholesale debt to opportunistically prefund an upcoming debt maturity and support loan growth. Overall, credit quality was solid and reflects declines in criticized and nonaccrual loans as well as net charge-offs. This was a result of the improved credit performance of our energy portfolio. 
Energy loans have declined $356 million or 11%, and commitments have declined over $600 million or nearly 11% since the end of the first quarter as our customers continue to take the necessary actions to reduce their bank debt. We have completed 88% of the spring redeterminations of our E&P customers, and borrowing bases have come down about 22% on average. 
Criticized Energy loans have declined $281 million as of the end of second quarter. Energy charge-offs remain manageable and declined from the first quarter. While the performance of this portfolio has improved and oil and gas prices have increased since the first quarter, we remain cautious and believe we are adequately reserved with our reserve allocation at over 8% of Energy loans as of June 30. 
Noninterest income increased $23 million, with growth in nearly all customer-driven categories. The largest increases were in card fees, fiduciary income, customer derivative income and commercial lending fees. In addition, results benefited from a $10 million swing in deferred comp, which is offset in expenses. 
We continue to tightly manage expenses. Noninterest expenses include the $53 million restructuring charge that I just discussed. Excluding this, expenses increased $6 million. 
Our capital position remains solid. As far as our second quarter results compared to the same period a year ago, revenue is up over 5%. This reflects the benefit from the increase in short-term rates as well as growth in fee income as we continue to drive for deeper customer relationships. 
Expenses were impacted by the $53 million in restructuring charges we incurred this year as well as the net release of litigation reserves of $30 million in the second quarter of 2015. Putting these 2 items aside, you can see that expenses have been very well managed. 
And now I will turn the call over to Dave, who will go over the quarter in more detail."
318670,344495179,1018580,"Comerica Incorporated, Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Jul 19, 2016",2016-07-19,"Earnings Calls","Comerica Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Ralph. Good morning, everyone.  Turning to Slide 9. As Ralph mentioned, second quarter average loans increased $1.1 billion compared to the first quarter, including a $356 million decline in Energy loans. We continue to see solid growth in our C",1427,"Thanks, Ralph. Good morning, everyone.  
Turning to Slide 9. As Ralph mentioned, second quarter average loans increased $1.1 billion compared to the first quarter, including a $356 million decline in Energy loans. We continue to see solid growth in our Commercial Real Estate business with construction draws and term loans primarily with existing customers. The projects, predominantly multifamily in primary markets within California and Texas with proven developers, have favorable credit profiles that include significant equity content as we continue to be cautious and selective. 
Also, auto inventories are seasonally high, resulting an increased line utilization in our National Dealer business. Finally, summer home sales, combined with the decline in mortgage rates, made June a record month in our 50-year history in the mortgage banking business. Likewise, quarter-end loans were up $1 billion over the first quarter with all the same drivers. 
As of June 30, increased commitments in mortgage banker, Commercial Real Estate and National Dealer were offset by the large decline in Energy. Line utilization increased 1.5 percentage points to 53%, mostly driven by the seasonal increases in mortgage banker and National Dealer, and our strong pipeline increased further. Although interest earned on loans was unchanged quarter-over-quarter, our second quarter loan yield decreased 7 basis points. The benefit from loan growth was offset by a decline in interest recoveries on nonaccrual loans, a full quarter impact from the increase in nonaccrual loans in the first quarter and a lease residual valuation adjustment. 
Turning to Slide 10. Average deposits were basically stable quarter-over-quarter. We had typical seasonal growth in both interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing Retail Banking deposits. This was offset by a decline in commercial deposits, primarily due to seasonal weakness in municipalities and our relationship banking strategy and purposeful pricing in large corporate. Our deposit cost remained stable at 14 basis points as we continue to prudently manage pricing. We are closely monitoring our deposit base as well as the market, and we believe we are well positioned with predominantly operational relationship-oriented deposits. 
Turning to Slide 11. We maintained our securities book at about $12.5 billion. The estimated duration of our portfolio sits at about 3 years; in the expected duration under a 200 basis point rate shock extends it modestly to 3.9 years. In the current environment, we expect to see prepays increase moderately from $490 million in the second quarter to this $550 million to $650 million range in the third quarter. The minor pressure we saw in our security portfolio yield may increase slightly due to reinvestment of larger monthly prepays at a lower rate. 
To help combat this, we are selectively purchasing securities with modestly longer duration. For example, a couple of weeks ago, we were able to place a $100 million Ginnie Mae purchase at 1.68%, which had a duration of about 18 months longer than the current portfolio average but had similar extension risk. As of quarter end, our estimated LCR ratio continues to meet the fully phased-in 2017 requirement plus a buffer. 
Turning to Slide 12. Net interest income declined $2 million while the net interest margin decreased 7 basis points. As I discussed earlier, all loan-related impacts netted to 0 but had a 4 basis point negative effect on the margin. The benefit from loan growth was offset by the previously mentioned nonaccrual activity, a lease residual valuation adjustment as well as slightly lower accretion. 
Wholesale funding costs increased $3 million as we added $2.8 billion in FHLB loans at very attractive terms to prefund a $650 million November debt maturity as well as support loan growth. This was partly offset by income earned on higher balances at the Fed. 
Turning to Slide 13. Our overall credit picture remains strong, and performance of our Energy portfolio improved in the second quarter. Our allowance for credit losses increased $2 million to $772 million, and our allowance-to-loan ratio was 1.45%. Total criticized loans declined $377 million to $3.6 billion or only 7% of total loans at quarter end. Nonaccrual loans decreased $76 million, and net charge-offs declined to 38 basis points or $47 million. Energy accounted for over 2/3 of the net charge-offs, and total net charge-offs for all other business lines combined was only 13 basis points. 
As far as our Energy portfolio, outstandings declined 11% to $2.7 billion at quarter end and now comprises 5.4% of our total loans. E&P loans make up 70% of our Energy portfolio, and as Ralph mentioned, the spring redetermination process is nearly complete. So far, borrowing bases have come down about 22% on average, and the number of deficiencies has been relatively stable since last quarter. Energy services has been significantly impacted this cycle, yet loan outstandings declined 15% to $363 million and now comprise less than 1% of our total loan portfolio. 
Total criticized Energy loans decreased $281 million due to the decline in outstandings and a small number of risk rating upgrades as our customers have reduced expenses, sold assets and tapped the capital markets. Also noteworthy is that 100% of these nonaccrual loans are fully current on interest payments, including the 9 loans we have in bankruptcy. The reserve for Energy loans is over 8%, and remember, those reserves may not turn into ultimate losses. Further detail on our Energy portfolio can be found in the appendix. 
Slide 14 outlines noninterest income. We had broad-based growth, with total customer-driven fees increasing 5% over the first quarter. Our cross-sell efforts have helped drive increases in card fees and fiduciary income. Customer derivative income saw robust activity in conjunction with the Brexit vote, and commercial lending fees grew with a pickup in syndication activity following a first quarter lull. 
Foreign exchange and brokerage fees were also low. In addition, we had a $10 million increase in deferred compensation, which is included in other noninterest income and is offset in noninterest expense. 
Turning to Slide 15. Aside from the $53 million restructuring charge Ralph discussed, noninterest expenses increased $6 million. This included the $10 million increase in deferred compensation, which was partly offset by an $8 million gain on the sale of leased assets. The remaining increase was due to higher outside processing and advertising expense, which is connected to our revenue growth, along with higher FDIC insurance premiums. 
Salaries and benefits was down $1 million. The increase in deferred compensation as well as annual merit seasonal 401(k) contributions as well as slightly higher incentive comp, which is related to revenue growth, were offset by decreases in share-based comp and payroll taxes following seasonally high expense in the first quarter. 
Moving to Slide 16 and capital management. We continue to return excess capital to our shareholders in a meaningful way. We completed our 2015 capital plan, which included equity purchases -- repurchases of $290 million under our equity repurchase program over the 5 quarters. In the second quarter, we repurchased 1.5 million shares and increased the dividend 5% to $0.22 per share. Our 2016 capital plan includes share repurchases up to $440 million. 
The pace of our buyback will be dependent on balance sheet movements and our financial performance, which can be impacted by market factors, particularly interest rates. The plan also includes a further increase on our quarterly dividend to $0.23 per share, which will be considered by the board at the end of this month. Our tangible book value per share increased to $40.52 and has been steadily increasing over the past several years as we continue to focus on creating long-term shareholder value. 
Turning to Slide 17. While the outlook for a rate increase continues to fluctuate daily, I'll remind you that our balance sheet is well positioned to benefit from an increase in rates. The benefits of full year 2016 net interest income from the rate rise that occurred in December is expected to be about $90 million, assuming deposit pricing continues to remain stable. 
The table on this slide gives some estimated additional upside to net interest income over the annual period following a rate rise. For example, if the Federal Reserve raises its rates 25 basis points and our deposit prices begin to move at that rate rise at a 25% beta, we believe we would gain about $70 million more in annualized net interest income. Of course, deposit pricing is only one assumption on our interest rate sensitivity modeling. Other key variables include loan and deposit behavior in a rising rate environment. Our standard modeling and the list of assumptions we use are included in the appendix. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Ralph."

We expect our average loan growth to be in line with U.S. GDP growth. We expect to see the typical third quarter seasonal declines in dealer, mortgage banker and general Middle Market to be followed by a rebound in the fourth quarter. In addition, we anticipate the decline in Energy outstandings to continue but perhaps at a more moderate pace than we saw in the second quarter. 
Our expectations for net interest income also have not changed. As far as credit, we expect continued solid credit quality with metrics, absent Energy, to remain better than historical norms. With the significant reserve build we established in the first quarter, if the Energy outlook remains stable, we would expect the provision for the rest of the year to reflect net charge-offs between 35 and 45 basis points. This is a modest reduction from the outlook we provided last quarter as a result of better-than-anticipated performance of our Energy portfolio, including the spring redeterminations and decline in loan balances. 
Movements in the Energy reserve from here will depend on many factors, the biggest being oil and gas prices as well as Energy customers' continuing ability to cut costs, raise equity, sell assets and reduce debt. Our expectations for noninterest income have not changed. Of note, as I mentioned earlier, we have begun to implement initiatives to drive more fee income, and we expect we will start to see results early next year. 
We have also updated our noninterest expense outlook, which now includes total restructuring expenses of approximately $90 million to $110 million for the year. Partially offsetting this will be savings derived from GEAR Up of about $20 million to be achieved primarily in the fourth quarter. Expenses in the second half of the year relative to the first half are impacted by 2 more days, the full impact of merit increases and an expected increase in the FDIC expense as a result of the surcharge. Finally, outside processing expenses are expected to continue to grow with increased card revenue. Our tax rate for full year 2016 is now about 30%, which is a reduction from our prior guidance as a result of the impact from the restructuring charges. 
In closing, Comerica is dedicated to providing high-quality financial services and building lasting client relationships. We operate Comerica for the ultimate benefit of our shareholders, and all of our actions are directed to maximize value while not compromising our commitment to our clients, the communities we serve, regulatory standing and strong risk management. As I previously stated, through GEAR Up, I am confident that we can enhance shareholder returns through improved financial performance.

Before we discuss our third quarter results, I'd like to give you an update on our expense and revenue initiative, which we call GEAR Up. As we announced on our last earnings call, we have identified",1603,"Good morning, and thank you for joining our call today. Before we discuss our third quarter results, I'd like to give you an update on our expense and revenue initiative, which we call GEAR Up. As we announced on our last earnings call, we have identified more than 20 work streams that are expected to drive a significant improvement in our bottom line. At that time, we also indicated that there was more to come as we were still identifying and analyzing other opportunities. 
We have now determined that those new opportunities add about $40 million in savings to our initial 2018 target. We now estimate that the GEAR Up initiative will drive additional pretax income of $180 million in 2017 and $270 million in 2018. Our total restructuring charge estimate remains unchanged at $140 million to $160 million. 
Without any increase in rates, we believe the actions we are taking will improve our efficiency ratio to the low 60s by the end of 2017 and at or below 60% by year-end 2018. The walk forward at the bottom of this slide illustrates how we expect to achieve our goal of a double-digit ROE in 2018. By adding our 200 basis points to our ROE, the actions under GEAR Up take us a long way towards achieving that goal, and we expect to meet or exceed this goal with sustained growth net of investment, normal credit cost, continued share buyback and only a 25 to 50 basis point increase in rates. We are not relying on a significantly better economic environment or a substantial increase in interest rates. 
We have already begun to execute our plan and many of our larger initiatives have been completed or are well underway. The top of Slide 4 outlines some of the progress we have made. 
We remain committed to our footprint. However, with customers migrating to a broader use of digital channels, we are consolidating 38 banking centers or about 8% of our network. We estimate these consolidations will result in $10 million to $13 million per annum in savings. This is net of attrition, which is expected to be nominal as we have another banking center within 2 to 5 miles from the bulk of the locations that are being closed. 
Also, with the advancement of technology and reduction in our workforce, we need less office and operations space to run our business. We have developed a plan to consolidate colleagues in central locations, implement alternative work solutions and shed the space we no longer need. We are targeting a 500,000-square foot reduction in real estate, which should result in approximately $7 million in savings in 2018 and more beyond 2018. 
At the bottom of the slide, you can see the 2 major drivers to the $40 million increase in our GEAR Up target. We are replacing our current pension and retirement account benefits with a newly redesigned retirement program. This is expected to contribute approximately $35 million in additional savings in 2017 and 2018 relative to our expected 2016 expense prior to this change. As a result of the redesign, we were able to avoid a substantial increase in our pension expense in 2017 that was expected due to the drop in the discount rate. Comerica retirees and our colleagues in the pension plan who are nearing retirement will not be impacted by this change. Our new retirement program will continue to provide highly competitive benefits. 
And as we discussed last quarter, our largest initiative involves streamlining our workforce. At the end of September, we completed the review of our management structure. We have eliminated about 30% of managerial positions in order to get closer to customers and accelerate decision-making. This also included consolidating functions and responsibilities while ensuring we maintain our high standards for customer service and deep expertise and experience. So far, nearly 700 people have been notified that their positions were eliminated or most of our expected reduction -- expected reductions. Separately, in terms of new initiatives, we streamlined some of our backroom operations and administrative support functions, which added approximately $5 million to our initial target. In total, we expect these workforce-related initiatives to result in more than $15 million in savings in the fourth quarter. 
We remain confident that we will drive enhanced shareholder value and achieve the level of returns that our shareholders deserve as we deliver on our GEAR Up initiative. In fact, since we announced our GEAR Up initiative on July 19, the date of our last earnings call, our stock is up 8%, and it is up 16% year-to-date, significantly outperforming nearly all of our peers at the key bank index and the S&P 500. 
Now turning to our third quarter results on Slide 5. Third quarter 2016 net income of $149 million or $0.84 per share included after-tax restructuring charges of $13 million or $0.08 per share. Quarter-over-quarter, our earnings per share increased 45%. This reflected strong credit quality, a reduction in restructuring charges, solid revenue growth and well-managed expenses. 
Slide 6 provides further detail on our results. Average loans declined $263 million including a $337 million reduction in our Energy portfolio. We also had the typical seasonal decline in National Dealer as our customers reduced their inventory in anticipation of delivery of 2017 models. 
In addition, there was a modest decrease in Technology and Life Sciences. This was partially -- partly offset by a seasonal increase in Mortgage Banker Finance and continued growth in Commercial Real Estate, albeit at a slower pace. Our Commercial Real Estate business continues to be driven by construction draws on existing projects with proven developers. 
Average deposits increased $1.5 billion, driven by strong noninterest-bearing deposit growth. The growth was broad based with most business lines posting increases. In addition, period-end deposits benefited from elevated activity associated with the government card program on the last day of the quarter. 
The recently released FDIC data, which captures market share as of June 30, reflects our low point for the year as well as our focus on LCR-friendly operational deposits. 
Net interest income increased $5 million to $450 million. This included the benefit of the increase in LIBOR, 1 more day in the quarter and interest earned on higher excess balances at the Fed. 
Credit quality was strong with net charge-offs of $16 million or 13 basis points, which is well below our historical norm and included $6 million in Energy charge-offs. 
Criticized loans declined almost $300 million, which contributed to a reduction in our provision expense to $16 million. Over the past year, Energy loans have declined almost $800 million or over 24%, and commitments have declined nearly $2 billion or nearly 30%. Criticized Energy loans declined $79 million. While the overall performance of this portfolio has improved and oil prices have remained in the $45 to $50 range for the past several months, we remain cautious and continue to maintain a reserve allocation of over 8% for Energy loans as of September 30. 
Of note, the results of the recent Shared National Credit exam have been reflected in our credit metrics. 
We had record noninterest income. The increase of $4 million or 2% included growth in commercial lending and investment banking fees. Noninterest expenses included $20 million in restructuring charges related to our GEAR Up initiative. The $33 million decrease in restructuring charges was partially offset by a smaller gain on sale of leased assets and increased outside processing expenses. 
Our capital position remained strong. In line with our CCAR plan, we increased our share repurchases to 2.1 million shares for a total of $97 million compared to $65 million in the second quarter. Restructuring charges are not expected to have an impact on the pace of our share buyback. 
Recent Fed announcements regarding the removal of the risk of qualitative failure and proposed tailoring of the stress test for regional banks like Comerica are certainly positive. Of course, details in the final rule as well as how it is interpreted and actually implemented will be key in determining the ultimate benefit. 
As far as our third quarter results compared to the same period a year ago, our earnings per share is up over 13%. This includes a 6% increase in revenue, which reflects the increase in short-term rates, a larger securities portfolio as well as growth in a number of fee categories including card fees, which has been an area of focus for us. 
Expenses were impacted by the $20 million restructuring charge we incurred this quarter as well as higher FDIC expense and technology investments. Putting these items aside, you can see that expenses have been well managed. And of course, our strong credit metrics have resulted in a lower provision for credit losses this year. 
Also noteworthy, last month, our board appointed a new independent director, Michael Van de Ven who is the Chief Operating Officer of Southwest Airlines. He brings to our board a number of key skills including a background in risk management, and as a CPA, deep understanding of financial planning and accounting. We have a strong and diverse board with a good mix of industry, financial and leadership backgrounds. Given the highly regulated nature of our industry as well as its cyclicality, we believe it's important to have long, tenured directors with a deep understanding of our business and environment. However, we also recognize the importance of bringing fresh perspectives, and we are pleased to welcome someone of Michael's caliber to our board. 
And now I will turn the call over to Dave who will go over the quarter in more detail."
318670,381521900,1056140,"Comerica Incorporated, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 18, 2016",2016-10-18,"Earnings Calls","Comerica Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Ralph. Good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 7. Following a $1.1 billion increase in average loans in the second quarter, third quarter loan growth was challenging for us, particularly since we had a reduction of over $300 million in the Energy",1257,"Thanks, Ralph. Good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 7. Following a $1.1 billion increase in average loans in the second quarter, third quarter loan growth was challenging for us, particularly since we had a reduction of over $300 million in the Energy portfolio, coupled with seasonality in our auto dealer business, which decreased about $200 million. Technology and Life Sciences also declined about $150 million due to the summer slowdown and our disciplined focused on maintaining a granular portfolio. Partially offsetting this was loan growth in our mortgage banking business, which benefited from summer home sales combined with robust refi activity. In addition, growth in our Commercial Real Estate business continued to be driven by well-structured, attractive opportunities with existing customers. 
Quarter-end loans were down over the second quarter with the largest declines in Energy and Dealer. As of September 30, commitments decreased about $700 million with the largest decline in Energy, and average loan utilization declined 2 percentage points to 51% with the largest decreases in Dealer and Energy. However, our pipeline remained strong. 
Interests earned on loans increased $5 million quarter-over-quarter, and our loan yield increased 2 basis points. There was a benefit from 1 more day in the quarter, an increase in LIBOR and the second quarter lease residual valuation adjustment that was not repeated. This was partially offset by lower loan balances and minor impacts from nonaccrual loans, lower fees in the margin and other portfolio dynamics. 
Turning to Slide 8. Deposit growth was robust, as Ralph described, increasing almost 3% quarter-over-quarter. Our deposit cost remained low at 14 basis points as we continue to prudently manage pricing for our relationship-oriented deposits. We have not increased our standard deposit pricing. 
Turning to Slide 9. We maintained our securities book at about $12.5 billion. The estimated duration of our portfolio sits at about 3 years. And the expected duration under a 200 basis point rate shock extends it modestly to 3.9 years. Seasonally higher prepays in the third quarter combined with the current rate environment put minor pressure on our security portfolio yield as we invest prepays at a lower rate. To help combat this, we continued to selectively purchase securities with modestly longer duration. For example, over the last few weeks, we have purchased some Ginnie Mae CMOs in the 170s with modestly longer duration and extension risks than the portfolio average. 
Turning to Slide 10. Net interest income increased $5 million while the net interest margin decreased 8 basis points. As I discussed earlier, all loan-related impacts netted to $5 million and added 1 basis point to the margin. Wholesale funding costs increased $2 million due to the increase in 6-month LIBOR along with the $2.8 billion in FHLB advances we added during the second quarter. This had a 1 basis point impact on the margin. Also, securities income declined $1 million as a result of continued yield pressure. Finally, the $2.3 billion increase in average balances at the Fed contributed $3 million, but had an 8 basis point negative impact on the margin. 
Turning to Slide 11. Our overall credit picture remained very strong. Total criticized loans declined almost $300 million to $3.3 billion or less than 7% of our total loans at quarter-end. Nonaccrual loans represent about 1.3% of our total loans and increased slightly with Energy loans driving the increase. Net charge-offs declined at 13 basis points or only $16 million. And our allowance for credit losses remained stable at $772 million, and our allowance-to-loan ratio was 1.48%. 
Energy loans declined 10% to under $2.5 billion at quarter-end. E&P loans make up about 70% of our Energy portfolio. As far as the fall redeterminations, we expect borrowing bases to decrease another 5% to 10% on average, which is much less than the 22% decline resulting from the spring redeterminations. 
Energy Services accounts for about 15% of our portfolio and is most impacted by the cycle. It has had a 35% decline in loans over the past year to about $330 million or less than 1% of our total loan portfolio. 
Energy net charge-offs were only $6 million, down from $32 million in the second quarter. The reserve for Energy loans continues to be over 8%, and of course, those reserves may not turn into ultimate losses. 
Slide 12 outlines noninterest income, which increased 2%. Commercial lending fees grew with continued strong syndication activity and an increase in commitment fees. Investment banking fees were also up. Partly offsetting this was a $2 million decline in fiduciary income following seasonally strong personal trust fees in the second quarter. 
In addition, nonfee categories increased modestly, primarily due to an increase in income from bank-owned life insurance, partially offset by a decrease in deferred compensation plan asset returns. 
Turning to Slide 13. Excluding the $20 million in GEAR Up-related restructuring charges, noninterest expenses increased $8 million primarily due to a $6 million reduction in the gain on sale of leased assets following a relatively large gain received in the second quarter. The remaining increase was primarily due to higher outside processing expense. 
Salaries and benefits expense was unchanged. There were many moving pieces, including the impact from 1 more day, an increase in stock comp following a stock forfeiture in the second quarter, seasonally higher staff insurance as well as the effect from the initial phase of workforce reductions related to the GEAR Up and a decline in deferred comp. As Ralph discussed, we expect to clearly see the benefits of our GEAR Up initiatives starting in the fourth quarter. 
Moving to Slide 14 and capital management. We continued to maintain strong capital ratios while returning excess capital to our shareholders in a meaningful way. Our 2016 capital plan includes share repurchases of up to $440 million. The pace of our buyback will be dependent on the balance sheet movements in our financial performance, and as Ralph previously stated, restructuring charges are not expected to have an impact on the pace of our share buyback. 
In the third quarter, we increased our share buyback and raised the dividend 4.5% to $0.23 per share, reflecting our confidence in the business. Through the buyback, together with the dividend, we returned $137 million to shareholders or over 90% of our third quarter net income. 
Our book value per share increased to $44.91 and has been steadily increasing over the past several years as we continue to focus on creating long-term shareholder value. 
Turning to Slide 15. Our balance sheet continues to be asset-sensitive. As I mentioned a moment ago, we have benefited from the recent increase in LIBOR. About 70% of our loans are LIBOR-based with the bulk driven by 30-day LIBOR. Therefore, as LIBOR has increased over the past couple of months, our loan portfolio repriced relatively quickly. Partially offsetting this is our wholesale funding, of which about 45% is based off of 6-month LIBOR. 
Separately, as shown on the table, if the Federal Reserve raises its rates 25 basis points and our deposit prices begin to move with that rise at a 25% beta, we believe we would gain about $70 million more in net interest income over a 12-month period. Of course, deposit pricing is only one assumption in our interest rate sensitivity modeling. We've provided additional scenarios, other key variables and a list of assumptions in the appendix. While the outlook for rate increase in the near term continues to fluctuate, our balance sheet is well positioned to benefit from any increase in rates. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Ralph."

Our outlook for the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter is shown on Slide 16. We expect average loan balances to be stable with a seasonal increase in National Dealer Services, a rebound in Technology and Life Sciences and small",535,"Thank you, Dave. Our outlook for the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter is shown on Slide 16. We expect average loan balances to be stable with a seasonal increase in National Dealer Services, a rebound in Technology and Life Sciences and small increases in several other businesses. This is expected to be offset by a seasonal decrease in Mortgage Banker and continued reduction in Energy. Our expectation is that we will see our loan growth resume next year on pace with GDP growth and with less of a headwind from Energy. We plan to provide our full outlook for 2017 on our earnings call next quarter. Our net interest income is expected to increase slightly in the fourth quarter. This includes the effect from the recent increase in LIBOR as well as the November maturity of $650 million in sub debt. 
With continued strong overall credit quality, we expect the provision in net charge-offs to remain low and range between second and third quarter levels. As far as the Energy portfolio, assuming prices and the environment remain relatively stable, we expect nonaccruals and charge-offs to remain manageable. Overall, we expect noninterest income to be relatively stable excluding the expected declines from third quarter levels of bank-owned life insurance and deferred comp, both of which are difficult to predict. Overall, we expect fourth quarter fee income to remain at the strong level we saw in third quarter. 
Noninterest expenses are expected to be lower excluding estimated restructuring expenses of approximately $30 million to $35 million. We expect about $25 million in savings derived from GEAR Up including the benefit from the redesign of our retirement program. Typical seasonal increases in staff benefits, outside processing, marketing and occupancy are expected to be partially offset by a decline in deferred comp, which was $2 million in the third quarter, and since it is difficult to predict, we are assuming it will not be repeated. 
Given recent industry headlines, I'd like to take a moment to discuss Comerica's sales culture. Overall, measurement of our banker's performance and compensation is based on a balanced scorecard that includes growth, customer satisfaction, operations, risk management and compliance. While we occasionally run special programs that focus certain products, these do not represent a significant portion of a banker's compensation and are not central to a banker's performance. 
Our incentive plans are reviewed regularly to help ensure they motivate the appropriate behaviors and operating results. In addition, they are closely monitored including reviews by our compliance, human resources, audit and finance divisions. 
Importantly, for the last past 167 years, our business has been built on providing high-quality financial services and establishing lasting client relationships. 
In closing, we believe we are well positioned for the future. We benefit meaningfully from any increase in interest rates. And as we continue to navigate the Energy downturn, our overall credit metrics have remained strong. But we are not waiting for the environment to improve. We are moving with urgency to execute our GEAR Up initiatives and are fully committed to delivering on these efficiency and revenue opportunities to further enhance our profitability and shareholder value. 
Now we will be happy to take any of your questions."

And then speaking of the Shared National Credit exam, it's very easy to downgrade credits that are Shared National Credits. It's a little bit stickier upgrading them because, first, we have to decide we want to upgrade a credit, but then also the agent and the regulators also have to decide. So the upgrades come more slowly than the downgrades. I think one thing that we feel pretty confident about though is, is that our losses continue to be much less than what we're reserving for or allocating to that Energy portfolio."

The natural sort of seasonality we see in dealer with new model sales both of those, I think, will be the headlines with the fourth quarter. Of course, we still got Energy working against us as that portfolio continues to decline. Ralph also shared the outlook going forward that as we think about sort of 2017, we do think that Energy decline will start to lessen, and we are seeing a few new opportunities that we are selectively looking at with the existing clients, and we also expect total loan growth kind of across the portfolio, which were to step back in line with GDP. Final thing I'd say just from a customer perspective beyond just the competitive environment we face, customers with commodity prices being down, we're certainly seeing less line utilization.

If you take a look 12 months from now, there's really no new supply coming on for another additional 18 months or so, and so we think that's going to bode well for rents in the market.

The first of which is really about freeing up sales capacity for relationship managers. We've been working intently to try to identify opportunities to centralize some tasks and functions that are taking up time from our relationship managers today and time from the sales process, and that's kind of an ongoing initiative. The second is that we have worked with the consultants that we were leveraging Boston Consulting Group to develop some new tools that are much more data driven around customer information, helping us to really take more of a needs-based approach in assessing our customers and where we think we have opportunities to provide additional services to our clients. We are very focused on a number of products where we think we have greater contribution margin, and that would include some product sets have been revamped for us like our merchant bank card product set and a whole number of what I would call products that complement our commercial lending activities from treasury management and card services, all of our capital markets activities, syndication, derivatives, et cetera. And then I think wrapping all that up is we're very intent around just making sure that we've got the right sales training with all of our bankers across the board, and so that when you look at it sort of in summary, there's not one product, one idea, but it's a combination of things that we're doing, and we feel pretty confident or very confident that we can achieve the overall target that we set from a revenue standpoint.

318670,381521900,1056236,"Comerica Incorporated, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 18, 2016",2016-10-18,"Earnings Calls","Comerica Incorporated","Executives","Good morning, and thank you for joining our call today. Before we discuss our third quarter results, I'd like to give you an update on our expense and revenue initiative, which we call GEAR Up. As we announced on our last earnings call, we have identified",1603,"Good morning, and thank you for joining our call today. Before we discuss our third quarter results, I'd like to give you an update on our expense and revenue initiative, which we call GEAR Up. As we announced on our last earnings call, we have identified more than 20 work streams that are expected to drive a significant improvement in our bottom line. At that time, we also indicated that there was more to come as we were still identifying and analyzing other opportunities. 
We have now determined that those new opportunities add about $40 million in savings to our initial 2018 target. We now estimate that the GEAR Up initiative will drive additional pretax income of $180 million in 2017 and $270 million in 2018. Our total restructuring charge estimate remains unchanged at $140 million to $160 million. 
Without any increase in rates, we believe the actions we are taking will improve our efficiency ratio to the low 60s by the end of 2017 and at or below 60% by year-end 2018. The walk forward at the bottom of this slide illustrates how we expect to achieve our goal of a double-digit ROE in 2018. By adding our 200 basis points to our ROE, the actions under GEAR Up take us a long way towards achieving that goal, and we expect to meet or exceed this goal with sustained growth net of investment, normal credit cost, continued share buyback and only a 25 to 50 basis point increase in rates. We are not relying on a significantly better economic environment or a substantial increase in interest rates. 
We have already begun to execute our plan and many of our larger initiatives have been completed or are well underway. The top of Slide 4 outlines some of the progress we have made. 
We remain committed to our footprint. However, with customers migrating to a broader use of digital channels, we are consolidating 38 banking centers or about 8% of our network. We estimate these consolidations will result in $10 million to $13 million per annum in savings. This is net of attrition, which is expected to be nominal as we have another banking center within 2 to 5 miles from the bulk of the locations that are being closed. 
Also, with the advancement of technology and reduction in our workforce, we need less office and operations space to run our business. We have developed a plan to consolidate colleagues in central locations, implement alternative work solutions and shed the space we no longer need. We are targeting a 500,000-square foot reduction in real estate, which should result in approximately $7 million in savings in 2018 and more beyond 2018. 
At the bottom of the slide, you can see the 2 major drivers to the $40 million increase in our GEAR Up target. We are replacing our current pension and retirement account benefits with a newly redesigned retirement program. This is expected to contribute approximately $35 million in additional savings in 2017 and 2018 relative to our expected 2016 expense prior to this change. As a result of the redesign, we were able to avoid a substantial increase in our pension expense in 2017 that was expected due to the drop in the discount rate. Comerica retirees and our colleagues in the pension plan who are nearing retirement will not be impacted by this change. Our new retirement program will continue to provide highly competitive benefits. 
And as we discussed last quarter, our largest initiative involves streamlining our workforce. At the end of September, we completed the review of our management structure. We have eliminated about 30% of managerial positions in order to get closer to customers and accelerate decision-making. This also included consolidating functions and responsibilities while ensuring we maintain our high standards for customer service and deep expertise and experience. So far, nearly 700 people have been notified that their positions were eliminated or most of our expected reduction -- expected reductions. Separately, in terms of new initiatives, we streamlined some of our backroom operations and administrative support functions, which added approximately $5 million to our initial target. In total, we expect these workforce-related initiatives to result in more than $15 million in savings in the fourth quarter. 
We remain confident that we will drive enhanced shareholder value and achieve the level of returns that our shareholders deserve as we deliver on our GEAR Up initiative. In fact, since we announced our GEAR Up initiative on July 19, the date of our last earnings call, our stock is up 8%, and it is up 16% year-to-date, significantly outperforming nearly all of our peers at the key bank index and the S&P 500. 
Now turning to our third quarter results on Slide 5. Third quarter 2016 net income of $149 million or $0.84 per share included after-tax restructuring charges of $13 million or $0.08 per share. Quarter-over-quarter, our earnings per share increased 45%. This reflected strong credit quality, a reduction in restructuring charges, solid revenue growth and well-managed expenses. 
Slide 6 provides further detail on our results. Average loans declined $263 million including a $337 million reduction in our Energy portfolio. We also had the typical seasonal decline in National Dealer as our customers reduced their inventory in anticipation of delivery of 2017 models. 
In addition, there was a modest decrease in Technology and Life Sciences. This was partially -- partly offset by a seasonal increase in Mortgage Banker Finance and continued growth in Commercial Real Estate, albeit at a slower pace. Our Commercial Real Estate business continues to be driven by construction draws on existing projects with proven developers. 
Average deposits increased $1.5 billion, driven by strong noninterest-bearing deposit growth. The growth was broad based with most business lines posting increases. In addition, period-end deposits benefited from elevated activity associated with the government card program on the last day of the quarter. 
The recently released FDIC data, which captures market share as of June 30, reflects our low point for the year as well as our focus on LCR-friendly operational deposits. 
Net interest income increased $5 million to $450 million. This included the benefit of the increase in LIBOR, 1 more day in the quarter and interest earned on higher excess balances at the Fed. 
Credit quality was strong with net charge-offs of $16 million or 13 basis points, which is well below our historical norm and included $6 million in Energy charge-offs. 
Criticized loans declined almost $300 million, which contributed to a reduction in our provision expense to $16 million. Over the past year, Energy loans have declined almost $800 million or over 24%, and commitments have declined nearly $2 billion or nearly 30%. Criticized Energy loans declined $79 million. While the overall performance of this portfolio has improved and oil prices have remained in the $45 to $50 range for the past several months, we remain cautious and continue to maintain a reserve allocation of over 8% for Energy loans as of September 30. 
Of note, the results of the recent Shared National Credit exam have been reflected in our credit metrics. 
We had record noninterest income. The increase of $4 million or 2% included growth in commercial lending and investment banking fees. Noninterest expenses included $20 million in restructuring charges related to our GEAR Up initiative. The $33 million decrease in restructuring charges was partially offset by a smaller gain on sale of leased assets and increased outside processing expenses. 
Our capital position remained strong. In line with our CCAR plan, we increased our share repurchases to 2.1 million shares for a total of $97 million compared to $65 million in the second quarter. Restructuring charges are not expected to have an impact on the pace of our share buyback. 
Recent Fed announcements regarding the removal of the risk of qualitative failure and proposed tailoring of the stress test for regional banks like Comerica are certainly positive. Of course, details in the final rule as well as how it is interpreted and actually implemented will be key in determining the ultimate benefit. 
As far as our third quarter results compared to the same period a year ago, our earnings per share is up over 13%. This includes a 6% increase in revenue, which reflects the increase in short-term rates, a larger securities portfolio as well as growth in a number of fee categories including card fees, which has been an area of focus for us. 
Expenses were impacted by the $20 million restructuring charge we incurred this quarter as well as higher FDIC expense and technology investments. Putting these items aside, you can see that expenses have been well managed. And of course, our strong credit metrics have resulted in a lower provision for credit losses this year. 
Also noteworthy, last month, our board appointed a new independent director, Michael Van de Ven, who is the Chief Operating Officer of Southwest Airlines. He brings to our board a number of key skills including a background in risk management, and as a CPA, deep understanding of financial planning and accounting. We have a strong and diverse board with a good mix of industry, financial and leadership backgrounds. Given the highly regulated nature of our industry as well as its cyclicality, we believe it's important to have long, tenured directors with a deep understanding of our business and environment. However, we also recognize the importance of bringing fresh perspectives, and we are pleased to welcome someone of Michael's caliber to our board. 
And now I will turn the call over to Dave who will go over the quarter in more detail."
318670,381521900,1056236,"Comerica Incorporated, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 18, 2016",2016-10-18,"Earnings Calls","Comerica Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Ralph. Good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 7. Following a $1.1 billion increase in average loans in the second quarter, third quarter loan growth was challenging for us, particularly since we had a reduction of over $300 million in the Energy",1257,"Thanks, Ralph. Good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 7. Following a $1.1 billion increase in average loans in the second quarter, third quarter loan growth was challenging for us, particularly since we had a reduction of over $300 million in the Energy portfolio, coupled with seasonality in our auto dealer business, which decreased about $200 million. Technology and Life Sciences also declined about $150 million due to the summer slowdown and our disciplined focused on maintaining a granular portfolio. Partially offsetting this was loan growth in our mortgage banking business, which benefited from summer home sales combined with robust refi activity. In addition, growth in our Commercial Real Estate business continued to be driven by well-structured, attractive opportunities with existing customers. 
Quarter-end loans were down over the second quarter with the largest declines in Energy and Dealer. As of September 30, commitments decreased about $700 million with the largest decline in Energy, and average loan utilization declined 2 percentage points to 51% with the largest decreases in Dealer and Energy. However, our pipeline remained strong. 
Interests earned on loans increased $5 million quarter-over-quarter, and our loan yield increased 2 basis points. There was a benefit from 1 more day in the quarter, an increase in LIBOR and the second quarter lease residual valuation adjustment that was not repeated. This was partially offset by lower loan balances and minor impacts from nonaccrual loans, lower fees in the margin and other portfolio dynamics. 
Turning to Slide 8. Deposit growth was robust, as Ralph described, increasing almost 3% quarter-over-quarter. Our deposit cost remained low at 14 basis points as we continue to prudently manage pricing for our relationship-oriented deposits. We have not increased our standard deposit pricing. 
Turning to Slide 9. We maintained our securities book at about $12.5 billion. The estimated duration of our portfolio sits at about 3 years. And the expected duration under a 200 basis point rate shock extends it modestly to 3.9 years. Seasonally higher prepays in the third quarter combined with the current rate environment put minor pressure on our security portfolio yield as we invest prepays at a lower rate. To help combat this, we continued to selectively purchase securities with modestly longer duration. For example, over the last few weeks, we have purchased some Ginnie Mae CMOs in the 170s with modestly longer duration and extension risks than the portfolio average. 
Turning to Slide 10. Net interest income increased $5 million while the net interest margin decreased 8 basis points. As I discussed earlier, all loan-related impacts netted to $5 million and added 1 basis point to the margin. Wholesale funding costs increased $2 million due to the increase in 6-month LIBOR along with the $2.8 billion in FHLB advances we added during the second quarter. This had a 1 basis point impact on the margin. Also, securities income declined $1 million as a result of continued yield pressure. Finally, the $2.3 billion increase in average balances at the Fed contributed $3 million, but had an 8 basis point negative impact on the margin. 
Turning to Slide 11. Our overall credit picture remained very strong. Total criticized loans declined almost $300 million to $3.3 billion or less than 7% of our total loans at quarter-end. Nonaccrual loans represent about 1.3% of our total loans and increased slightly with Energy loans driving the increase. Net charge-offs declined at 13 basis points or only $16 million. And our allowance for credit losses remained stable at $772 million, and our allowance-to-loan ratio was 1.48%. 
Energy loans declined 10% to under $2.5 billion at quarter-end. E&P loans make up about 70% of our Energy portfolio. As far as the fall redeterminations, we expect borrowing bases to decrease another 5% to 10% on average, which is much less than the 22% decline resulting from the spring redeterminations. 
Energy Services accounts for about 15% of our portfolio and is most impacted by the cycle. It has had a 35% decline in loans over the past year to about $330 million or less than 1% of our total loan portfolio. 
Energy net charge-offs were only $6 million, down from $32 million in the second quarter. The reserve for Energy loans continues to be over 8%, and of course, those reserves may not turn into ultimate losses. 
Slide 12 outlines noninterest income, which increased 2%. Commercial lending fees grew with continued strong syndication activity and an increase in commitment fees. Investment banking fees were also up. Partly offsetting this was a $2 million decline in fiduciary income following seasonally strong personal trust fees in the second quarter. 
In addition, nonfee categories increased modestly, primarily due to an increase in income from bank-owned life insurance, partially offset by a decrease in deferred compensation plan asset returns. 
Turning to Slide 13. Excluding the $20 million in GEAR Up-related restructuring charges, noninterest expenses increased $8 million primarily due to a $6 million reduction in the gain on sale of leased assets following a relatively large gain received in the second quarter. The remaining increase was primarily due to higher outside processing expense. 
Salaries and benefits expense was unchanged. There were many moving pieces, including the impact from 1 more day, an increase in stock comp following a stock forfeiture in the second quarter, seasonally higher staff insurance as well as the effect from the initial phase of workforce reductions related to the GEAR Up and a decline in deferred comp. As Ralph discussed, we expect to clearly see the benefits of our GEAR Up initiatives starting in the fourth quarter. 
Moving to Slide 14 and Capital Management. We continued to maintain strong capital ratios while returning excess capital to our shareholders in a meaningful way. Our 2016 capital plan includes share repurchases of up to $440 million. The pace of our buyback will be dependent on the balance sheet movements in our financial performance, and as Ralph previously stated, restructuring charges are not expected to have an impact on the pace of our share buyback. 
In the third quarter, we increased our share buyback and raised the dividend 4.5% to $0.23 per share, reflecting our confidence in the business. Through the buyback, together with the dividend, we returned $137 million to shareholders or over 90% of our third quarter net income. 
Our book value per share increased to $44.91 and has been steadily increasing over the past several years as we continue to focus on creating long-term shareholder value. 
Turning to Slide 15. Our balance sheet continues to be asset-sensitive. As I mentioned a moment ago, we have benefited from the recent increase in LIBOR. About 70% of our loans are LIBOR-based with the bulk driven by 30-day LIBOR. Therefore, as LIBOR has increased over the past couple of months, our loan portfolio repriced relatively quickly. Partially offsetting this is our wholesale funding, of which about 45% is based off of 6-month LIBOR. 
Separately, as shown on the table, if the Federal Reserve raises its rates 25 basis points and our deposit prices begin to move with that rise at a 25% beta, we believe we would gain about $70 million more in net interest income over a 12-month period. Of course, deposit pricing is only one assumption in our interest rate sensitivity modeling. We've provided additional scenarios, other key variables and a list of assumptions in the appendix. While the outlook for rate increase in the near term continues to fluctuate, our balance sheet is well positioned to benefit from any increase in rates. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Ralph."

We expect average loan balances to be stable with a seasonal increase in National Dealer Services, a rebound in Technology and Life Sciences and small",535,"Thank you, Dave. Our outlook for the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter is shown on Slide 16. We expect average loan balances to be stable with a seasonal increase in National Dealer Services, a rebound in Technology and Life Sciences and small increases in several other businesses. This is expected to be offset by a seasonal decrease in Mortgage Banker and continued reduction in Energy. Our expectation is that we will see our loan growth resume next year on pace with GDP growth and with less of a headwind from Energy. We plan to provide our full outlook for 2017 on our earnings call next quarter. Our net interest income is expected to increase slightly in the fourth quarter. This includes the effect from the recent increase in LIBOR as well as the November maturity of $650 million in sub debt. 
With continued strong overall credit quality, we expect the provision in net charge-offs to remain low and range between second and third quarter levels. As far as the Energy portfolio, assuming prices and the environment remain relatively stable, we expect nonaccruals and charge-offs to remain manageable. Overall, we expect noninterest income to be relatively stable excluding the expected declines from third quarter levels of bank-owned life insurance and deferred comp, both of which are difficult to predict. Overall, we expect fourth quarter fee income to remain at the strong level we saw in third quarter. 
Noninterest expenses are expected to be lower excluding estimated restructuring expenses of approximately $30 million to $35 million. We expect about $25 million in savings derived from GEAR Up including the benefit from the redesign of our retirement program. Typical seasonal increases in staff benefits, outside processing, marketing and occupancy are expected to be partially offset by a decline in deferred comp, which was $2 million in the third quarter, and since it is difficult to predict, we are assuming it will not be repeated. 
Given recent industry headlines, I'd like to take a moment to discuss Comerica's sales culture. Overall, measurement of our banker's performance and compensation is based on a balanced scorecard that includes growth, customer satisfaction, operations, risk management and compliance. While we occasionally run special programs that focus certain products, these do not represent a significant portion of a banker's compensation and are not central to a banker's performance. 
Our incentive plans are reviewed regularly to help ensure they motivate the appropriate behaviors and operating results. In addition, they are closely monitored including reviews by our compliance, human resources, audit and finance divisions. 
Importantly, for the last past 167 years, our business has been built on providing high-quality financial services and establishing lasting client relationships. 
In closing, we believe we are well positioned for the future. We benefit meaningfully from any increase in interest rates. And as we continue to navigate the Energy downturn, our overall credit metrics have remained strong. But we are not waiting for the environment to improve. We are moving with urgency to execute our GEAR Up initiatives and are fully committed to delivering on these efficiency and revenue opportunities to further enhance our profitability and shareholder value. 
Now we will be happy to take any of your questions."

But on the other hand, there are still a number of these E&P credits that are in bankruptcy. We want to see what happens there. Drilling activity has been coming back, but it's not as robust as we would like to see it. And then speaking of the Shared National Credit exam, it's very easy to downgrade credits that are Shared National Credits. It's a little bit stickier upgrading them because, first, we have to decide we want to upgrade a credit, but then also the agent and the regulators also have to decide.

When you look at the economies today in California, and I mentioned here, and Michigan and the growth that's expected for the year, they're in a very good position and our footprint's in a very good position and that's the reason we feel comfortable that we will be able to grow along with that GDP number.

Ralph in the narrative earlier and Dave as well talked about what we'd expect in the fourth quarter with some rebound in TLS coming off of a somewhat soft quarter in Q3. The natural sort of seasonality we see in Dealer with new model sales, both of those, I think, will be the headlines with the fourth quarter. Of course, we still got Energy working against us as that portfolio continues to decline. Ralph also shared the outlook going forward that as we think about sort of 2017, we do think that Energy decline will start to lessen and we are seeing a few new opportunities that we are selectively looking at with the existing clients, and we also expect total loan growth kind of across the portfolio, which were to step back in line with GDP. Final thing I'd say just from a customer perspective beyond just the competitive environment we face, customers with commodity prices being down, we're certainly seeing less line utilization. And then in some of our markets, we're seeing a fair amount of M&A activity, which is inuring to the benefit of our client in terms of liquidity events. I think you see that reflected in some of our deposit growth."

We had actually 2 projects pay off this past quarter, so we're down to 17 apartment projects. We're primarily an apartment construction lender in Houston. We don't do office or other product types, it's primarily apartments. And most of those apartments that are in lease-up are leasing up well with 1 or 2 months' worth of concessions, which is substantially less, probably less than half what we assumed in our severe adverse scenario under the stress test. So we're very pleased with what's going on there in Houston, and we're actually seeing some signs of rents stabilizing. If you take a look 12 months from now, there's really no new supply coming on for another additional 18 months or so and so we think that's going to bode well for rents in the market. And then last thing to keep in mind there is we've built that Houston Commercial Real Estate portfolio to withstand the ups and downs of the oil and gas cycles, and each one of those projects has 30% to 40% cash equity in them. So there's a lot of room for rents to drop before we're going to see issues with our projects."

The second is that we have worked with the consultant that we were leveraging, Boston Consulting Group, to develop some new tools that are much more data driven around customer information, helping us to really take more of a needs-based approach in assessing our customers and where we think we have opportunities to provide additional services to our clients. We're very focused on a number of products where we think we have greater contribution margin and that would include some product set have been revamped for us like our merchant bank card product set and a whole number of what I would call products that complement our commercial lending activities from treasury management, in card services, all our capital markets activities, syndication, derivatives, et cetera.

We are -- I think we will start to see a little bit of slowing in the decline in the portfolio overall, and as Pete has alluded to, our customers I think have behaved very well in terms of reducing expenses and line utilization has gone down with the redetermination process. Having said that, probably different than prior quarters, we are starting to see some select new opportunities with our clients. They've got very strong equity support, kind of modest advanced rates, very strong hedging, the kind of deals that we would want to participate in. But again, it's at a very modest pace. And so I think that the pace of reduction will continue to slow and we'll selectively see some new opportunities. But I think, on average, we'll keep as kind of in that range of about 5% of our portfolio overall."

Before we discuss our third quarter results, I'd like to give you an update on our expense and revenue initiative, which we call GEAR Up. As we announced on our last earnings call, we have identified",1600,"Good morning, and thank you for joining our call today. Before we discuss our third quarter results, I'd like to give you an update on our expense and revenue initiative, which we call GEAR Up. As we announced on our last earnings call, we have identified more than 20 work streams that are expected to drive a significant improvement in our bottom line. At that time, we also indicated that there was more to come as we were still identifying and analyzing other opportunities. 
We have now determined that those new opportunities add about $40 million in savings to our initial 2018 target. We now estimate that the GEAR Up initiative will drive additional pretax income of $180 million in 2017 and $270 million in 2018. Our total restructuring charge estimate remains unchanged at $140 million to $160 million. 
Without any increase in rates, we believe the actions we are taking will improve our efficiency ratio to the low 60s by the end of 2017 and at or below 60% by year-end 2018. The walk forward at the bottom of the slide illustrates how we expect to achieve our goal of a double-digit ROE in 2018. By adding our 200 basis points to our ROE, the actions under GEAR Up take us a long way towards achieving that goal, and we expect to meet or exceed this goal with sustained growth net of investment, normal credit cost, continued share buyback and only a 25 to 50 basis point increase in rates. We are not relying on a significantly better economic environment or a substantial increase in interest rates. 
We have already begun to execute our plan and many of our larger initiatives have been completed or are well under way. The top of Slide 4 outlines some of the progress we have made. 
We remain committed to our footprint. However, with customers migrating to a broader use of digital channels, we are consolidating 38 banking centers or about 8% of our network. We estimate these consolidations will result in $10 million to $13 million per annum in savings. This is net of attrition, which is expected to be nominal as we have another banking center within 2 to 5 miles from the bulk of the locations that are being closed. 
Also, with the advancement of technology and reduction in our workforce, we need less office and operations space to run our business. We have developed a plan to consolidate colleagues in central locations, implement alternative work solutions and shed the space we no longer need. We are targeting a 500,000-square-foot reduction in real estate, which should result in approximately $7 million in savings in 2018 and more beyond 2018. 
At the bottom of the slide, you can see the 2 major drivers to the $40 million increase in our GEAR Up target. We are replacing our current pension and retirement account benefits with a newly redesigned retirement program. This is expected to contribute approximately $35 million in additional savings in 2017 and 2018 relative to our expected 2016 expense prior to this change. As a result of the redesign, we were able to avoid a substantial increase in our pension expense in 2017 that was expected due to the drop in the discount rate. Comerica retirees and our colleagues in the pension plan who are nearing retirement will not be impacted by this change. Our new retirement program will continue to provide highly competitive benefits. 
And as we discussed last quarter, our largest initiative involves streamlining our workforce. At the end of September, we completed the review of our management structure. We have eliminated about 30% of managerial positions in order to get closer to customers and accelerate decision-making. This also included consolidating functions and responsibilities while ensuring we maintain our high standards for customer service and deep expertise and experience. So far, nearly 700 people have been notified that their positions were eliminated or most of our expected reduction -- expected reductions. Separately, in terms of new initiatives, we streamlined some of our backroom operations and administrative support functions, which added approximately $5 million to our initial target. In total, we expect these workforce-related initiatives to result in more than $15 million in savings in the fourth quarter. 
We remain confident that we will drive enhanced shareholder value and achieve the level of returns that our shareholders deserve as we deliver on our GEAR Up initiative. In fact, since we announced our GEAR Up initiative on July 19, the date of our last earnings call, our stock is up 8%, and it is up 16% year-to-date, significantly outperforming nearly all of our peers, the key bank index and the S&P 500. 
Now turning to our third quarter results on Slide 5. Third quarter 2016 net income of $149 million or $0.84 per share included after-tax restructuring charges of $13 million or $0.08 per share. Quarter-over-quarter, our earnings per share increased 45%. This reflected strong credit quality, a reduction in restructuring charges, solid revenue growth and well-managed expenses. 
Slide 6 provides further detail on our results. Average loans declined $263 million including a $337 million reduction in our Energy portfolio. We also had the typical seasonal decline in National Dealer as our customers reduced their inventory in anticipation of delivery of 2017 models. 
In addition, there was a modest decrease in Technology and Life Sciences. This was partially -- partly offset by a seasonal increase in Mortgage Banker Finance and continued growth in Commercial Real Estate, albeit at a slower pace. Our Commercial Real Estate business continues to be driven by construction draws on existing projects with proven developers. 
Average deposits increased $1.5 billion, driven by strong noninterest-bearing deposit growth. The growth was broad-based with most business lines posting increases. In addition, period-end deposits benefited from elevated activity associated with the government card program on the last day of the quarter. 
The recently released FDIC data, which captures market share as of June 30, reflects our low point for the year as well as our focus on LCR-friendly operational deposits. 
Net interest income increased $5 million to $450 million. This included the benefit of the increase in LIBOR, 1 more day in the quarter and interest earned on higher excess balances at the Fed. 
Credit quality was strong with net charge-offs of $16 million or 13 basis points, which is well below our historical norm and included $6 million in Energy charge-offs. 
Criticized loans declined almost $300 million, which contributed to a reduction in our provision expense to $16 million. Over the past year, Energy loans have declined almost $800 million or over 24%, and commitments have declined nearly $2 billion or nearly 30%. Criticized Energy loans declined $79 million. While the overall performance of this portfolio has improved and oil prices have remained in the $45 to $50 range for the past several months, we remain cautious and continue to maintain a reserve allocation of over 8% for Energy loans as of September 30. 
Of note, the results of the recent Shared National Credit exam have been reflected in our credit metrics. 
We had record noninterest income. The increase of $4 million or 2% included growth in commercial lending and investment banking fees. Noninterest expenses included $20 million in restructuring charges related to our GEAR Up initiative. The $33 million decrease in restructuring charges was partially offset by a smaller gain on sale of leased assets and increased outside processing expenses. 
Our capital position remained strong. In line with our CCAR plan, we increased our share repurchases to 2.1 million shares for a total of $97 million compared to $65 million in the second quarter. Restructuring charges are not expected to have an impact on the pace of our share buyback. 
Recent Fed announcements regarding the removal of the risk of qualitative failure and proposed tailoring of the stress test for regional banks like Comerica are certainly positive. Of course, details in the final rule as well as how it is interpreted and actually implemented will be key in determining the ultimate benefit. 
As far as our third quarter results compared to the same period a year ago, our earnings per share is up over 13%. This includes a 6% increase in revenue, which reflects the increase in short-term rates, a larger securities portfolio as well as growth in a number of fee categories including card fees, which has been an area of focus for us. 
Expenses were impacted by the $20 million restructuring charge we incurred this quarter, as well as higher FDIC expense and technology investments. Putting these items aside, you can see that expenses have been well managed. And of course, our strong credit metrics have resulted in a lower provision for credit losses this year. 
Also noteworthy, last month our board appointed a new independent director, Michael Van de Ven, who is the Chief Operating Officer of Southwest Airlines. He brings to our board a number of key skills including a background in risk management, and as a CPA, deep understanding of financial planning and accounting. We have a strong and diverse board with a good mix of industry, financial and leadership backgrounds. Given the highly regulated nature of our industry as well as its cyclicality, we believe it's important to have long-tenured directors with a deep understanding of our business and environment. However, we also recognize the importance of bringing fresh perspectives, and we are pleased to welcome someone of Michael's caliber to our board. 
And now I will turn the call over to Dave who will go over the quarter in more detail."
318670,381521900,1056485,"Comerica Incorporated, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 18, 2016",2016-10-18,"Earnings Calls","Comerica Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Ralph. Good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 7. Following a $1.1 billion increase in average loans in the second quarter, third quarter loan growth was challenging for us, particularly since we had a reduction of over $300 million in the Energy",1255,"Thanks, Ralph. Good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 7. Following a $1.1 billion increase in average loans in the second quarter, third quarter loan growth was challenging for us, particularly since we had a reduction of over $300 million in the Energy portfolio, coupled with seasonality in our auto dealer business, which decreased about $200 million. Technology and Life Sciences also declined about $150 million due to the summer slowdown and our disciplined focus on maintaining a granular portfolio. Partly offsetting this was loan growth in our mortgage banking business, which benefited from summer home sales combined with robust refi activity. In addition, growth in our Commercial Real Estate business continued to be driven by well-structured, attractive opportunities with existing customers. 
Quarter-end loans were down over the second quarter with the largest declines in Energy and Dealer. As of September 30, commitments decreased about $700 million with the largest decline in Energy, and average loan utilization declined 2 percentage points to 51% with the largest decreases in Dealer and Energy. However, our pipeline remained strong. 
Interest earned on loans increased $5 million quarter-over-quarter, and our loan yield increased 2 basis points. There was a benefit from 1 more day in the quarter, an increase in LIBOR and the second quarter lease residual valuation adjustment that was not repeated. This was partially offset by lower loan balances and minor impacts from nonaccrual loans, lower fees in the margin and other portfolio dynamics. 
Turning to Slide 8. Deposit growth was robust, as Ralph described, increasing almost 3% quarter-over-quarter. Our deposit cost remained low at 14 basis points as we continue to prudently manage pricing for our relationship-oriented deposits. We have not increased our standard deposit pricing. 
Turning to Slide 9. We maintained our securities book at about $12.5 billion. The estimated duration of our portfolio sits at about 3 years. And the expected duration under a 200 basis point rate shock extends it modestly to 3.9 years. Seasonally higher prepays in the third quarter combined with the current rate environment put minor pressure on our security portfolio yield as we invest prepays at a lower rate. To help combat this, we continued to selectively purchase securities with modestly longer duration. For example, over the last few weeks we have purchased some Ginnie Mae CMOs in the 170s with modestly longer duration and extension risks than the portfolio average. 
Turning to Slide 10. Net interest income increased $5 million while the net interest margin decreased 8 basis points. As I discussed earlier, all loan-related impacts netted to $5 million and added 1 basis point to the margin. Wholesale funding costs increased $2 million due to the increase in 6-month LIBOR along with the $2.8 billion in FHLB advances we added during the second quarter. This had a 1 basis point impact on the margin. Also, securities income declined $1 million as a result of continued yield pressure. Finally, the $2.3 billion increase in average balances at the Fed contributed $3 million, but had an 8 basis point negative impact on the margin. 
Turning to Slide 11. Our overall credit picture remains very strong. Total criticized loans declined almost $300 million to $3.3 billion or less than 7% of our total loans at quarter-end. Nonaccrual loans represent about 1.3% of our total loans and increased slightly with Energy loans driving the increase. Net charge-offs declined to 13 basis points or only $16 million, our allowance for credit losses remained stable at $772 million, and our allowance-to-loan ratio was 1.48%. 
Energy loans declined 10% to under $2.5 billion at quarter-end. E&P loans make up about 70% of our Energy portfolio. As far as the fall redeterminations, we expect borrowing bases to decrease another 5% to 10% on average, which is much less than the 22% decline resulting from the spring redeterminations. 
Energy Services accounts for about 15% of our portfolio and is most impacted by the cycle. It has had a 35% decline in loans over the past year to about $330 million, or less than 1% of our total loan portfolio. 
Energy net charge-offs were only $6 million, down from $32 million in the second quarter. The reserve for Energy loans continues to be over 8%, and of course those reserves may not turn into ultimate losses. 
Slide 12 outlines noninterest income, which increased 2%. Commercial lending fees grew with continued strong syndication activity and an increase in commitment fees. Investment banking fees were also up. Partly offsetting this was a $2 million decline in fiduciary income following seasonally strong personal trust fees in the second quarter. 
In addition, nonfee categories increased modestly, primarily due to an increase in income from bank-owned life insurance, partially offset by a decrease in deferred compensation plan asset returns. 
Turning to Slide 13. Excluding the $20 million in GEAR Up-related restructuring charges, noninterest expenses increased $8 million primarily due to a $6 million reduction in the gain on sale of leased assets following a relatively large gain received in the second quarter. The remaining increase was primarily due to higher outside processing expense. 
Salaries and benefits expense was unchanged. There were many moving pieces, including the impact from 1 more day, an increase in stock comp following a stock forfeiture in the second quarter, seasonally higher staff insurance as well as the effect from the initial phase of workforce reductions related to GEAR Up and a decline in deferred comp. As Ralph discussed, we expect to clearly see the benefits of our GEAR Up initiatives starting in the fourth quarter. 
Moving to Slide 14 and Capital Management. We continued to maintain strong capital ratios while returning excess capital to our shareholders in a meaningful way. Our 2016 capital plan includes share repurchases of up to $440 million. The pace of our buyback will be dependent on the balance sheet movements in our financial performance, and as Ralph previously stated, restructuring charges are not expected to have an impact on the pace of our share buyback. 
In the third quarter, we increased our share buyback and raised the dividend 4.5% to $0.23 per share, reflecting our confidence in the business. Through the buyback, together with the dividend, we returned $137 million to shareholders, or over 90% of our third quarter net income. 
Our book value per share increased to $44.91 and has been steadily increasing over the past several years as we continue to focus on creating long-term shareholder value. 
Turning to Slide 15. Our balance sheet continues to be asset-sensitive. As I mentioned a moment ago, we have benefited from the recent increase in LIBOR. About 70% of our loans are LIBOR-based with the bulk driven by 30-day LIBOR. Therefore, as LIBOR has increased over the past couple of months, our loan portfolio repriced relatively quickly. Partially offsetting this is our wholesale funding, of which about 45% is based off of 6-month LIBOR. 
Separately, as shown on the table, if the Federal Reserve raises its rates 25 basis points and our deposit prices begin to move with that rise at a 25% beta, we believe we would gain about $70 million more in net interest income over a 12-month period. Of course, deposit pricing is only one assumption in our interest rate sensitivity modeling. We've provided additional scenarios, other key variables and a list of assumptions in the appendix. While the outlook for rate increase in the near term continues to fluctuate, our balance sheet is well positioned to benefit from any increase in rates. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Ralph."

Our outlook for the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter is shown on Slide 16. We expect average loan balances to be stable with a seasonal increase in National Dealer Services, a rebound in Technology and Life Sciences and small",534,"Thank you, Dave. Our outlook for the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter is shown on Slide 16. We expect average loan balances to be stable with a seasonal increase in National Dealer Services, a rebound in Technology and Life Sciences and small increases in several other businesses. This is expected to be offset by a seasonal decrease in Mortgage Banker and continued reduction in Energy. Our expectation is that we will see our loan growth resume next year on pace with GDP growth and with less of a headwind from Energy. We plan to provide our full outlook for 2017 on our earnings call next quarter. Our net interest income is expected to increase slightly in the fourth quarter. This includes the effect from the recent increase in LIBOR as well as the November maturity of $650 million in sub debt. 
With continued strong overall credit quality, we expect the provision in net charge-offs to remain low and range between second and third quarter levels. As far as the Energy portfolio, assuming prices and the environment remain relatively stable, we expect nonaccruals and charge-offs to remain manageable. Overall, we expect noninterest income to be relatively stable, excluding the expected declines from third quarter levels of bank-owned life insurance and deferred comp, both of which are difficult to predict. Overall, we expect fourth quarter fee income to remain at the strong level we saw in third quarter. 
Noninterest expenses are expected to be lower, excluding estimated restructuring expenses of approximately $30 million to $35 million. We expect about $25 million in savings derived from GEAR Up, including the benefit from the redesign of our retirement program. Typical seasonal increases in staff, benefits, outside processing, marketing and occupancy are expected to be partially offset by a decline in deferred comp, which was $2 million in the third quarter, and since it is difficult to predict, we are assuming it will not be repeated. 
Given recent industry headlines, I'd like to take a moment to discuss Comerica's sales culture. Overall, measurement of our bankers' performance and compensation is based on a balanced scorecard that includes growth, customer satisfaction, operations, risk management and compliance. While we occasionally run special programs that focus certain products, these do not represent a significant portion of a banker's compensation and are not central to a banker's performance. 
Our incentive plans are reviewed regularly to help ensure they motivate the appropriate behaviors and operating results. In addition, they are closely monitored, including reviews by our compliance, human resources, audit and finance divisions. 
Importantly, for the past 167 years, our business has been built on providing high-quality financial services and establishing lasting client relationships. 
In closing, we believe we are well positioned for the future. We benefit meaningfully from any increase in interest rates, and as we continue to navigate the Energy downturn, our overall credit metrics have remained strong. But we are not waiting for the environment to improve. We are moving with urgency to execute our GEAR Up initiatives and are fully committed to delivering on these efficiency and revenue opportunities to further enhance our profitability and shareholder value. 
Now we will be happy to take any of your questions."

But on the other hand, there are still a number of these E&P credits that are in bankruptcy and we want to see what happens there. Drilling activity has been coming back, but it's not as robust as we would like to see it. And then speaking of the Shared National Credit exam, it's very easy to downgrade credits that are Shared National Credits. It's a little bit stickier upgrading them because first, we have to decide we want to upgrade a credit, but then also the agent and the regulators also have to decide. So the upgrades come more slowly than the downgrades.

Of course, we've still got Energy working against us as that portfolio continues to decline. Ralph also shared toward the outlook going forward that as we think about sort of 2017, we do think that Energy decline will start to lessen and we are seeing a few new opportunities that we are selectively looking at with existing clients, and we also expect total loan growth kind of across the portfolio, would sort of step back in line with GDP. Final thing I'd say just from a customer perspective, beyond just the competitive environment we face, customers with commodity prices being down, we're certainly seeing less line utilization.

We would certainly hope that we'll see a rate increase here in the not-too-distant future, but even without that, we are continuing to work diligently. Obviously, our provision coming down this quarter certainly helps that picture. As we implement GEAR Up, that certainly helps sort of add some strength to our financial performance.

We had actually 2 projects pay off this past quarter, so we're down to 17 apartment projects. We're primarily an apartment construction lender in Houston. We don't do office or other product types.

And most of those apartments that are in lease-up are leasing up well with 1 or 2 months' worth of concessions, which is substantially less, probably less than half what we assumed in our severe adverse scenario under the stress test. So we're very pleased with what's going on there in Houston, and we're actually seeing some signs of rents stabilizing. If you take a look 12 months from now, there's really no new supply coming on for another additional 18 months or so, and so we think that's going to bode well for rents in the market. And then last thing to keep in mind there is we built that Houston Commercial Real Estate portfolio to withstand the ups and downs of the oil and gas cycles, and each one of those projects has 30% to 40% cash equity in them. So there's a lot of room for rents to drop before we're going to see issues with our projects."

So we've been working intently to try to identify opportunities to centralize some tasks and functions that are taking up time from our relationship managers today and time from the sales process, and that's kind of an ongoing initiative. The second is that we have worked with a consultant that we were leveraging, Boston Consulting Group, to develop some new tools that are much more data driven around customer information, helping us to really take more of a needs-based approach in assessing our customers and where we think we have opportunities to provide additional services to our clients. We're very focused on a number of products where we think we have greater contribution margin, and that would include some products that have been revamped for us like our merchant bank card product set, and a whole number of what I would call products that complement our commercial lending activities, from treasury management and card services, all of our capital markets activities, syndication, derivatives, et cetera. And then I think wrapping all that up is we're very intent around just making sure that we've got the right sales training with all of our bankers across the board. And so that when you look at it sort of in summary, there's not one product, one idea, but it's a combination of things that we are doing.

Before we discuss our third quarter results, I'd like to give you an update on our expense and revenue initiative, which we call GEAR Up. As we announced on our last earnings call, we have identified",1600,"Good morning, and thank you for joining our call today. Before we discuss our third quarter results, I'd like to give you an update on our expense and revenue initiative, which we call GEAR Up. As we announced on our last earnings call, we have identified more than 20 work streams that are expected to drive a significant improvement in our bottom line. At that time, we also indicated that there was more to come as we were still identifying and analyzing other opportunities. 
We have now determined that those new opportunities add about $40 million in savings to our initial 2018 target. We now estimate that the GEAR Up initiative will drive additional pretax income of $180 million in 2017 and $270 million in 2018. Our total restructuring charge estimate remains unchanged at $140 million to $160 million. 
Without any increase in rates, we believe the actions we are taking will improve our efficiency ratio to the low 60s by the end of 2017 and at or below 60% by year-end 2018. The walk forward at the bottom of the slide illustrates how we expect to achieve our goal of a double-digit ROE in 2018. By adding our 200 basis points to our ROE, the actions under GEAR Up take us a long way towards achieving that goal, and we expect to meet or exceed this goal with sustained growth net of investment, normal credit cost, continued share buyback and only a 25 to 50 basis point increase in rates. We are not relying on a significantly better economic environment or a substantial increase in interest rates. 
We have already begun to execute our plan and many of our larger initiatives have been completed or are well under way. The top of Slide 4 outlines some of the progress we have made. 
We remain committed to our footprint. However, with customers migrating to a broader use of digital channels, we are consolidating 38 banking centers or about 8% of our network. We estimate these consolidations will result in $10 million to $13 million per annum in savings. This is net of attrition, which is expected to be nominal as we have another banking center within 2 to 5 miles from the bulk of the locations that are being closed. 
Also, with the advancement of technology and reduction in our workforce, we need less office and operations space to run our business. We have developed a plan to consolidate colleagues in central locations, implement alternative work solutions and shed the space we no longer need. We are targeting a 500,000-square-foot reduction in real estate, which should result in approximately $7 million in savings in 2018 and more beyond 2018. 
At the bottom of the slide, you can see the 2 major drivers to the $40 million increase in our GEAR Up target. We are replacing our current pension and retirement account benefits with a newly redesigned retirement program. This is expected to contribute approximately $35 million in additional savings in 2017 and 2018 relative to our expected 2016 expense prior to this change. As a result of the redesign, we were able to avoid a substantial increase in our pension expense in 2017 that was expected due to the drop in the discount rate. Comerica retirees and our colleagues in the pension plan who are nearing retirement will not be impacted by this change. Our new retirement program will continue to provide highly competitive benefits. 
And as we discussed last quarter, our largest initiative involves streamlining our workforce. At the end of September, we completed the review of our management structure. We have eliminated about 30% of managerial positions in order to get closer to customers and accelerate decision-making. This also included consolidating functions and responsibilities while ensuring we maintain our high standards for customer service and deep expertise and experience. So far, nearly 700 people have been notified that their positions were eliminated or most of our expected reduction -- expected reductions. Separately, in terms of new initiatives, we streamlined some of our backroom operations and administrative support functions, which added approximately $5 million to our initial target. In total, we expect these workforce-related initiatives to result in more than $15 million in savings in the fourth quarter. 
We remain confident that we will drive enhanced shareholder value and achieve the level of returns that our shareholders deserve as we deliver on our GEAR Up initiative. In fact, since we announced our GEAR Up initiative on July 19, the date of our last earnings call, our stock is up 8%, and it is up 16% year-to-date, significantly outperforming nearly all of our peers, the key bank index and the S&P 500. 
Now turning to our third quarter results on Slide 5. Third quarter 2016 net income of $149 million or $0.84 per share included after-tax restructuring charges of $13 million or $0.08 per share. Quarter-over-quarter, our earnings per share increased 45%. This reflected strong credit quality, a reduction in restructuring charges, solid revenue growth and well-managed expenses. 
Slide 6 provides further detail on our results. Average loans declined $263 million including a $337 million reduction in our Energy portfolio. We also had the typical seasonal decline in National Dealer as our customers reduced their inventory in anticipation of delivery of 2017 models. 
In addition, there was a modest decrease in Technology and Life Sciences. This was partially -- partly offset by a seasonal increase in Mortgage Banker Finance and continued growth in Commercial Real Estate, albeit at a slower pace. Our Commercial Real Estate business continues to be driven by construction draws on existing projects with proven developers. 
Average deposits increased $1.5 billion, driven by strong noninterest-bearing deposit growth. The growth was broad-based with most business lines posting increases. In addition, period-end deposits benefited from elevated activity associated with the government card program on the last day of the quarter. 
The recently released FDIC data, which captures market share as of June 30, reflects our low point for the year as well as our focus on LCR-friendly operational deposits. 
Net interest income increased $5 million to $450 million. This included the benefit of the increase in LIBOR, 1 more day in the quarter and interest earned on higher excess balances at the Fed. 
Credit quality was strong with net charge-offs of $16 million or 13 basis points, which is well below our historical norm and included $6 million in Energy charge-offs. 
Criticized loans declined almost $300 million, which contributed to a reduction in our provision expense to $16 million. Over the past year, Energy loans have declined almost $800 million or over 24%, and commitments have declined nearly $2 billion or nearly 30%. Criticized Energy loans declined $79 million. While the overall performance of this portfolio has improved and oil prices have remained in the $45 to $50 range for the past several months, we remain cautious and continue to maintain a reserve allocation of over 8% for Energy loans as of September 30. 
Of note, the results of the recent Shared National Credit exam have been reflected in our credit metrics. 
We had record noninterest income. The increase of $4 million or 2% included growth in commercial lending and investment banking fees. Noninterest expenses included $20 million in restructuring charges related to our GEAR Up initiative. The $33 million decrease in restructuring charges was partially offset by a smaller gain on sale of leased assets and increased outside processing expenses. 
Our capital position remained strong. In line with our CCAR plan, we increased our share repurchases to 2.1 million shares for a total of $97 million compared to $65 million in the second quarter. Restructuring charges are not expected to have an impact on the pace of our share buyback. 
Recent Fed announcements regarding the removal of the risk of qualitative failure and proposed tailoring of the stress test for regional banks like Comerica are certainly positive. Of course, details in the final rule as well as how it is interpreted and actually implemented will be key in determining the ultimate benefit. 
As far as our third quarter results compared to the same period a year ago, our earnings per share is up over 13%. This includes a 6% increase in revenue, which reflects the increase in short-term rates, a larger securities portfolio as well as growth in a number of fee categories including card fees, which has been an area of focus for us. 
Expenses were impacted by the $20 million restructuring charge we incurred this quarter, as well as higher FDIC expense and technology investments. Putting these items aside, you can see that expenses have been well managed. And of course, our strong credit metrics have resulted in a lower provision for credit losses this year. 
Also noteworthy, last month our board appointed a new independent director, Michael Van de Ven, who is the Chief Operating Officer of Southwest Airlines. He brings to our board a number of key skills including a background in risk management, and as a CPA, deep understanding of financial planning and accounting. We have a strong and diverse board with a good mix of industry, financial and leadership backgrounds. Given the highly regulated nature of our industry as well as its cyclicality, we believe it's important to have long-tenured directors with a deep understanding of our business and environment. However, we also recognize the importance of bringing fresh perspectives, and we are pleased to welcome someone of Michael's caliber to our board. 
And now I will turn the call over to Dave who will go over the quarter in more detail."
318670,381521900,1056798,"Comerica Incorporated, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 18, 2016",2016-10-18,"Earnings Calls","Comerica Incorporated","Executives","Thanks, Ralph. Good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 7. Following a $1.1 billion increase in average loans in the second quarter, third quarter loan growth was challenging for us, particularly since we had a reduction of over $300 million in the Energy",1255,"Thanks, Ralph. Good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 7. Following a $1.1 billion increase in average loans in the second quarter, third quarter loan growth was challenging for us, particularly since we had a reduction of over $300 million in the Energy portfolio, coupled with seasonality in our auto dealer business, which decreased about $200 million. Technology and Life Sciences also declined about $150 million due to the summer slowdown and our disciplined focus on maintaining a granular portfolio. Partly offsetting this was loan growth in our mortgage banking business, which benefited from summer home sales combined with robust refi activity. In addition, growth in our Commercial Real Estate business continued to be driven by well-structured, attractive opportunities with existing customers. 
Quarter-end loans were down over the second quarter with the largest declines in Energy and Dealer. As of September 30, commitments decreased about $700 million with the largest decline in Energy, and average loan utilization declined 2 percentage points to 51% with the largest decreases in Dealer and Energy. However, our pipeline remained strong. 
Interest earned on loans increased $5 million quarter-over-quarter, and our loan yield increased 2 basis points. There was a benefit from 1 more day in the quarter, an increase in LIBOR and the second quarter lease residual valuation adjustment that was not repeated. This was partially offset by lower loan balances and minor impacts from nonaccrual loans, lower fees in the margin and other portfolio dynamics. 
Turning to Slide 8. Deposit growth was robust, as Ralph described, increasing almost 3% quarter-over-quarter. Our deposit cost remained low at 14 basis points as we continue to prudently manage pricing for our relationship-oriented deposits. We have not increased our standard deposit pricing. 
Turning to Slide 9. We maintained our securities book at about $12.5 billion. The estimated duration of our portfolio sits at about 3 years. And the expected duration under a 200 basis point rate shock extends it modestly to 3.9 years. Seasonally higher prepays in the third quarter combined with the current rate environment put minor pressure on our security portfolio yield as we invest prepays at a lower rate. To help combat this, we continued to selectively purchase securities with modestly longer duration. For example, over the last few weeks we have purchased some Ginnie Mae CMOs in the 170s with modestly longer duration and extension risks than the portfolio average. 
Turning to Slide 10. Net interest income increased $5 million while the net interest margin decreased 8 basis points. As I discussed earlier, all loan-related impacts netted to $5 million and added 1 basis point to the margin. Wholesale funding costs increased $2 million due to the increase in 6-month LIBOR along with the $2.8 billion in FHLB advances we added during the second quarter. This had a 1 basis point impact on the margin. Also, securities income declined $1 million as a result of continued yield pressure. Finally, the $2.3 billion increase in average balances at the Fed contributed $3 million, but had an 8 basis point negative impact on the margin. 
Turning to Slide 11. Our overall credit picture remains very strong. Total criticized loans declined almost $300 million to $3.3 billion or less than 7% of our total loans at quarter-end. Nonaccrual loans represent about 1.3% of our total loans and increased slightly with Energy loans driving the increase. Net charge-offs declined to 13 basis points or only $16 million, our allowance for credit losses remained stable at $772 million, and our allowance-to-loan ratio was 1.48%. 
Energy loans declined 10% to under $2.5 billion at quarter-end. E&P loans make up about 70% of our Energy portfolio. As far as the fall redeterminations, we expect borrowing bases to decrease another 5% to 10% on average, which is much less than the 22% decline resulting from the spring redeterminations. 
Energy Services accounts for about 15% of our portfolio and is most impacted by the cycle. It has had a 35% decline in loans over the past year to about $330 million, or less than 1% of our total loan portfolio. 
Energy net charge-offs were only $6 million, down from $32 million in the second quarter. The reserve for Energy loans continues to be over 8%, and of course those reserves may not turn into ultimate losses. 
Slide 12 outlines noninterest income, which increased 2%. Commercial lending fees grew with continued strong syndication activity and an increase in commitment fees. Investment banking fees were also up. Partly offsetting this was a $2 million decline in fiduciary income following seasonally strong personal trust fees in the second quarter. 
In addition, nonfee categories increased modestly, primarily due to an increase in income from bank-owned life insurance, partially offset by a decrease in deferred compensation plan asset returns. 
Turning to Slide 13. Excluding the $20 million in GEAR Up-related restructuring charges, noninterest expenses increased $8 million primarily due to a $6 million reduction in the gain on sale of leased assets following a relatively large gain received in the second quarter. The remaining increase was primarily due to higher outside processing expense. 
Salaries and benefits expense was unchanged. There were many moving pieces, including the impact from 1 more day, an increase in stock comp following a stock forfeiture in the second quarter, seasonally higher staff insurance as well as the effect from the initial phase of workforce reductions related to GEAR Up and a decline in deferred comp. As Ralph discussed, we expect to clearly see the benefits of our GEAR Up initiatives starting in the fourth quarter. 
Moving to Slide 14 and Capital Management. We continued to maintain strong capital ratios while returning excess capital to our shareholders in a meaningful way. Our 2016 capital plan includes share repurchases of up to $440 million. The pace of our buyback will be dependent on the balance sheet movements in our financial performance, and as Ralph previously stated, restructuring charges are not expected to have an impact on the pace of our share buyback. 
In the third quarter, we increased our share buyback and raised the dividend 4.5% to $0.23 per share, reflecting our confidence in the business. Through the buyback, together with the dividend, we returned $137 million to shareholders, or over 90% of our third quarter net income. 
Our book value per share increased to $44.91 and has been steadily increasing over the past several years as we continue to focus on creating long-term shareholder value. 
Turning to Slide 15. Our balance sheet continues to be asset-sensitive. As I mentioned a moment ago, we have benefited from the recent increase in LIBOR. About 70% of our loans are LIBOR-based with the bulk driven by 30-day LIBOR. Therefore, as LIBOR has increased over the past couple of months, our loan portfolio repriced relatively quickly. Partially offsetting this is our wholesale funding, of which about 45% is based off of 6-month LIBOR. 
Separately, as shown on the table, if the Federal Reserve raises its rates 25 basis points and our deposit prices begin to move with that rise at a 25% beta, we believe we would gain about $70 million more in net interest income over a 12-month period. Of course, deposit pricing is only one assumption in our interest rate sensitivity modeling. We've provided additional scenarios, other key variables and a list of assumptions in the appendix. While the outlook for rate increase in the near term continues to fluctuate, our balance sheet is well positioned to benefit from any increase in rates. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Ralph."
318670,381521900,1056798,"Comerica Incorporated, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Oct 18, 2016",2016-10-18,"Earnings Calls","Comerica Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Dave. Our outlook for the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter is shown on Slide 16. We expect average loan balances to be stable with a seasonal increase in National Dealer Services, a rebound in Technology and Life Sciences and small",534,"Thank you, Dave. Our outlook for the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter is shown on Slide 16. We expect average loan balances to be stable with a seasonal increase in National Dealer Services, a rebound in Technology and Life Sciences and small increases in several other businesses. This is expected to be offset by a seasonal decrease in Mortgage Banker and continued reduction in Energy. Our expectation is that we will see our loan growth resume next year on pace with GDP growth and with less of a headwind from Energy. We plan to provide our full outlook for 2017 on our earnings call next quarter. Our net interest income is expected to increase slightly in the fourth quarter. This includes the effect from the recent increase in LIBOR as well as the November maturity of $650 million in sub debt. 
With continued strong overall credit quality, we expect the provision in net charge-offs to remain low and range between second and third quarter levels. As far as the Energy portfolio, assuming prices and the environment remain relatively stable, we expect nonaccruals and charge-offs to remain manageable. Overall, we expect noninterest income to be relatively stable, excluding the expected declines from third quarter levels of bank-owned life insurance and deferred comp, both of which are difficult to predict. Overall, we expect fourth quarter fee income to remain at the strong level we saw in third quarter. 
Noninterest expenses are expected to be lower, excluding estimated restructuring expenses of approximately $30 million to $35 million. We expect about $25 million in savings derived from GEAR Up, including the benefit from the redesign of our retirement program. Typical seasonal increases in staff, benefits, outside processing, marketing and occupancy are expected to be partially offset by a decline in deferred comp, which was $2 million in the third quarter, and since it is difficult to predict, we are assuming it will not be repeated. 
Given recent industry headlines, I'd like to take a moment to discuss Comerica's sales culture. Overall, measurement of our bankers' performance and compensation is based on a balanced scorecard that includes growth, customer satisfaction, operations, risk management and compliance. While we occasionally run special programs that focus certain products, these do not represent a significant portion of a banker's compensation and are not central to a banker's performance. 
Our incentive plans are reviewed regularly to help ensure they motivate the appropriate behaviors and operating results. In addition, they are closely monitored, including reviews by our compliance, human resources, audit and finance divisions. 
Importantly, for the past 167 years, our business has been built on providing high-quality financial services and establishing lasting client relationships. 
In closing, we believe we are well positioned for the future. We benefit meaningfully from any increase in interest rates, and as we continue to navigate the Energy downturn, our overall credit metrics have remained strong. But we are not waiting for the environment to improve. We are moving with urgency to execute our GEAR Up initiatives and are fully committed to delivering on these efficiency and revenue opportunities to further enhance our profitability and shareholder value. 
Now we will be happy to take any of your questions."

There's a lot of positive things happening in Energy right now: prices have been stable, capital markets are improving, asset sales remain very robust, we're getting a lot of paydowns on our criticized credits, and of course, this quarter our charge-offs were down as well. But on the other hand, there are still a number of these E&P credits that are in bankruptcy and we want to see what happens there. Drilling activity has been coming back, but it's not as robust as we would like to see it. And then speaking of the Shared National Credit exam, it's very easy to downgrade credits that are Shared National Credits. It's a little bit stickier upgrading them because first, we have to decide we want to upgrade a credit, but then also the agent and the regulators also have to decide. So the upgrades come more slowly than the downgrades. I think one thing that we feel pretty confident about though is, is that our losses continue to be much less than what we're reserving for or allocating to that Energy portfolio."

Final thing I'd say just from a customer perspective, beyond just the competitive environment we face, customers with commodity prices being down, we're certainly seeing less line utilization.

We had actually 2 projects pay off this past quarter, so we're down to 17 apartment projects. We're primarily an apartment construction lender in Houston. We don't do office or other product types. It's primarily apartments. And most of those apartments that are in lease-up are leasing up well with 1 or 2 months' worth of concessions, which is substantially less, probably less than half what we assumed in our severe adverse scenario under the stress test. So we're very pleased with what's going on there in Houston, and we're actually seeing some signs of rents stabilizing. If you take a look 12 months from now, there's really no new supply coming on for another additional 18 months or so, and so we think that's going to bode well for rents in the market. And then last thing to keep in mind there is we built that Houston Commercial Real Estate portfolio to withstand the ups and downs of the oil and gas cycles, and each one of those projects has 30% to 40% cash equity in them. So there's a lot of room for rents to drop before we're going to see issues with our projects."

Jon, the revenue side will, as we've shared I think previously, will layer in over the next 2 years and so it's not sort of a one-and-done type scenario. And it really -- it cuts across a combination of strategies that we're pursuing, the first of which is really about freeing up sales capacity for relationship managers. So we've been working intently to try to identify opportunities to centralize some tasks and functions that are taking up time from our relationship managers today and time from the sales process, and that's kind of an ongoing initiative. The second is that we have worked with a consultant that we were leveraging, Boston Consulting Group, to develop some new tools that are much more data driven around customer information, helping us to really take more of a needs-based approach in assessing our customers and where we think we have opportunities to provide additional services to our clients. We're very focused on a number of products where we think we have greater contribution margin, and that would include some products that have been revamped for us like our merchant bank card product set, and a whole number of what I would call products that complement our commercial lending activities, from treasury management and card services, all of our capital markets activities, syndication, derivatives, et cetera. And then I think wrapping all that up is we're very intent around just making sure that we've got the right sales training with all of our bankers across the board. And so that when you look at it sort of in summary, there's not one product, one idea, but it's a combination of things that we are doing. And we feel pretty confident or very confident that we can achieve the overall target that we've set from a revenue standpoint. But again, it will be layered in over the course of the next 24 months or so."

Having said that, probably different than prior quarters, we are starting to see some select new opportunities with our clients. They've got very strong equity support, kind of modest advanced rates, very strong hedging, the kind of deals that we would want to participate in. But again, it's at a very modest pace.
