EOG has committed a return focus capital discipline and we demonstrated that commitment in 2015 with a simple decision. After 4 years of 40% compound annual oil growth, we slammed on the brakes and decided to defer production growth. It was an easy decision. Outspending cash flow to grow oil and through an oversupply market makes no sense. Rather than chasing production growth through the down cycle, we focused on 3 main goals. First, we concentrated more than ever on resetting the company to be successful on a lower commodity price environment by reducing costs and improving well productivity. 
Second, we wanted to add high-quality drilling inventory through organic exploration and tactical acquisitions. And most importantly, our third goal was to protect our balance sheet. As a result, EOG had a record year in reducing cost, improving well productivity and adding new drilling potential to the company. We accomplished all this and ended the year with one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry. Here are a few highlights from the year. 
We reduced capital more than 40% from 2014 and maintained that U.S. oil production. Total cash operating cost per unit decreased 17% compared to 2014. We drilled 2 industry record wells, 1 each in the Bakken and Delaware Basin Wolfcamp. We added a company record 1.6 billion barrels of oil equivalent and net resource potential over -- and over 3,000 net locations. That means we replaced more than 6x the inventory that we drilled in 2015 and we acquired 34,000 net acres in the sweet spot of the Delaware Basin. 
2015 changed how we think about EOG's position in the industry long-term. It's no longer enough to be the low-cost producer in U.S. horizontal shale. EOG's goal is to be competitive, low-cost oil producer in the global market. Now let's talk about our plan in 2016. Our first objective this year is to achieve strong returns on our capital program, the sustainable profitability gains. In order to maximize return on capital invested, we are shifting into what we call premium drilling mode. 
Like last year, we will concentrate our efforts in capital in our top plays: the Eagle Ford, Delaware Basin, Bakken and Rockies. The difference in 2016 is that we had a flexibility to direct capital only towards our large inventory of premium quality wells. Premium inventories is find wells that generate direct after-tax rates of return of at least 30% at $40 oil. We identified over 2 billion barrels of equivalent of net resource potential and 3,200 net drilling locations that meet this hurdle. 
At our 2016 pace, and we expect to complete 270 wells this year, that represents 12 years of drilling potential. In addition, we are confident our premium inventory will continue to grow in size and quality. Our proven track record of organic exploration and sustainable gains through technology and efficiency will continue to add premium inventory for years to come. What that means, and this is the most important point, is that between our existing premium inventory and our confidence that we can replace it, EOG will be in premium drilling mode from now on. 
EOG's shift to premium drilling in 2016 is not just simple high grading. It is a permanent upgrade for all our future drillings. It's important to realize that this is much more than a small incremental shift in our drilling program, it's a major step change in terms of per well productivity. For the average 2016 well, we estimate a 50% increase in the first 120 days of production per foot of treated lateral versus wells we completed in 2015. 
Our shift to premium drilling allows EOG to quickly return to triple digits, and I'll say this again, to quickly return to triple digit capital rates of return as oil prices improve to modest levels. So the next logical question is: what becomes of the remaining inventory? Our nonpremium inventory is still very high-quality. By any industry standard, it is Tier 1 quality with tremendous value. 
Due to the quality, a large percentage of this inventory will be converted to premium through technology and efficiency gains over time, the remaining high-quality inventory will add value to property sales or trades as part of our ongoing upgrading process. Our second objective in 2016 is to protect our balance sheet. Two years in a row, we have cut capital by more than 40%, demonstrating our commitment to capital discipline. In addition, as a result of our ongoing evaluation of our portfolio upgrade our asset base, we are marketing certain valuable but noncore properties. EOG prioritizes profitability and a healthy balance sheet to prepare the company for uncertain commodity cycles, and that strategy has paid off. 
EOG entered 2016 in excellent financial and operational shape. The combination of EOG's high-quality assets, sustainable cost reductions, and well productivity improvements allow the company to lead the industry in returns year after year. EOG is uniquely positioned with a large and growing inventory of high return drilling even in a $40 price environment. Achieving strong returns in the current environment positions EOG to achieve tremendous returns as commodity prices improve. 
Now I'll turn the call over to David Trice who will update you on the Eagle Ford and Rockies place."

In 2015, we grew production while complete 38% fewer wells compared to 2014. Six years ago, we estimated Eagle Ford had 900 million barrels of oil equivalent of net resource potential. We've since updated that net resource potential 3x and the latest estimate from early 2014 was 3.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent. 
In 2015, we've got a number of things that will promise the further upside to the Eagle Ford's resource potential. First, refinements to our high-density completion techniques continue to improve well productivity in 2015 as can be seen in the cumulative production charts in our investor presentation on Page 10. Second, to complement high-density completions, we made tremendous progress on what we have termed precision targeting. This is one of the most promising developments not only for the Eagle Ford but for all of our plays. Precision targeting starts with first, identifying and then mapping the key petrophysical properties that make the difference between a good well and a great well. 
Once all the data has been integrated, we found that the real sweet spot in any given target can be very narrow. Where we previously landed our wells and 150-foot window, we now precisely steer them in a window as narrow as 20 feet. In addition, this work on precision targeting also reveal that in some areas, we may have 2 distinct sweet spot targets in the lower Eagle Ford alone. 
Finally, we conducted power test by drilling adjacent wells in a W pattern that also make between the 2 targets within the lower Eagle Ford. This allows for surface down-spacing closer than 300 feet use in our current development spacing and resource potential estimate. Early results from these tests are encouraging. In 2016, we have more program flexibility as 91% of our Eagle Ford acreage is held by production. We plan to complete 150 Eagle Ford wells while continuing to test the W pattern. Spacing wells 200 to 250 feet apart. 
Our advancements in precision targeting and completions along with cost efficiencies, may have significant implication on our resource potential and will allow us to continue to upgrade additional Eagle Ford locations to premium status. In our Rockies and Bakken plays, we proactively scaled back activity due to commodity prices. With the lower activity level, we're able to sharpen our focus on sustainable operational improvements. We are very pleased with the progress and in fact, the magnitude of operational improvements in these plays were best in the company. Here are the highlights. 
First, we upgraded our Bakken net resource potential to 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent and added almost 1,000 net locations. Second, we reduced Bakken completed well costs 18% and drilling days over 30%. Third, we've built water handling and water pipeline infrastructure that significantly reduced its long-term LOE. Fourth, we drilled several high-quality wells in the Powder River Basin, highlighted by the Flatbow 602 to 1621H that came online in the fourth quarter. This turner well averaged over 1,100 barrels of oil per day and 1.7 million cubic feet per day of rich natural gas in its first 90 days of production. 
Finally, we also drilled a -- an industry record well in the Bakken, the Riverview 102-32H produce an average of 2,700 barrels of oil over the first 30 days and 2,200 barrels of oil per day for the first 90 days production. This well was the first high-density completion on our Antelope Extension acreage and is an industry record even though it is only a 4,300 foot lateral. Going forward, we will continue to develop this area at a moderate pace as we build out infrastructure that will allow us to deliver long-term operating costs. 
We're encouraged by these 2015 accomplishments in the Rockies and Bakken, and while the activity level will remain low in 2016, our focus on operational and well performance improvements will continue. We expect to see additional cost efficiencies, and well productivity advancements through completions and targeting refinement. We plan to complete approximately 35 wells in the Rockies in 2016. As we continue progressing technically and reducing costs, we expect the premium location count to growth significantly. 
Finally, a quick update on our Conway project in the East Irish Sea. All work for startup has been completed by EOG and we are working with the part-time operator to reach final acceptance, which we believe is imminent. We expect first production by the end of the quarter. Here's Billy Helms to review our activity in the Permian Delaware Basin"

Our Permian Delaware Basin team has made tremendous amount of progress last year. Prior to 2015, we developed a successful winter program and had encouraging results with the Wolfcamp and Bone Spring's intervals. As we entered 2015, we laid out a specific plan to one, increase our technical knowledge to better understand the potential of these complex plays; two, improve our operational execution and cost performance; and three, expand the scope and the impact of the basin to EOG. 
Our efforts paid off. Here's a recap of our progress. First, we made tremendous progress utilizing 2 techniques: precision targeting and high-density completions. Our enhanced understanding of the regional of the basin, helps us to delineate the most productive target intervals within each formation. This technique requires a significant amount of technical data and data analysis expertise. And coupled with our high-density completion technique, generate solid improvements in well productivity as evidenced by our industry record-setting Wolfcamp well for 4 21 #702H, produced an average of 3,490 barrels of oil equivalent per day over its first 30 days of production. 
After 120 days, average production was an impressive 2,100 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Notably, the well was completed with a shorter lateral, yet still exceeded the longer lateral wells and absolute production. In fact, on average, our 2015 the Wolfcamp wells produced 40% more than the next best operator during the first 3 months of production as displayed on Slide 9 of our investor presentation. Second, we made significant progress generating sustainable cost reductions. For example, in the Wolfcamp oil window, we reduced average drilling time 33% and lower completed well cost 35% despite adding incremental cost to each well for high-density completions. In addition, we secured a long-term brackish water supply that as we move into 2016, it's expected to save us $200,000 to $300,000 per well. 
And finally, we increased the net resource potential for the Delaware Basin by 1.0 billion barrels of oil equivalent and added 2,200 net locations potentially adding decades of drilling inventory. This position us as -- this solidifies a position for the Delaware Basin as one of our high return wealth engines. We also executed on another 8,000 net-acre acquisition in the fourth quarter, bringing total 2015 Delaware Basin acquisitions to 34,000 net acres. This adds to our sweet spot acreage with significant upside potential through multiple stack targets. 
Thanks to the well productivity improvements and cost reductions achieved in 2015, the Delaware Basin delivers returns that compete for capital alongside the Eagle Ford. A large portion of the Delaware Basin is already considered premium and with our continued advancements, we expect to dramatically increase our inventory of premium location in the next few years. 
For 2016, we are continuing the momentum. The Delaware Basin will again be EOG's second most active basin next to the Eagle Ford. We plan to complete the same number of wells as we did in 2015, about 75, and we'll focus primarily on the Wolfcamp. Drilling the Wolfcamp generates excellent returns while allowing us to collect data on the shallower targets at the same time. I'll now address reserve replacement and funding costs. 
All in, proved reserves decreased 15% in 2015, driven primarily by price-related revisions. Excluding revision due to commodity price changes, we replaced 192% of our 2015 production, at a low funding costs of $11.91 per BOE. For the 28th consecutive year, the collier performed an independent engineering analysis of our reserves and their estimate is within 5% of our internal estimate. Their analysis covered about 86% of our crude reserves this year. We see the schedules in the company's earnings press release for the calculation of the reserve replacement funding cost. 
I'll now turn it over to Tim Driggers to discuss financials and capital structure."

I'll begin with a few comments about our capital spending last year and in the fourth quarter. Capital interest for the quarter was $8.9 million. For the fourth quarter 2015, total exploration and development expenditures were $737 million, including facilities of $116 million, and excluding acquisition and asset retirement obligations. In addition, expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants and other property plant and equipment were $35 million. 
There were $105 million of acquisitions during the quarter. For the full year 2015, capitalized interest was $41.8 million. Total exploration and development expenditures were $4.4 billion, including facilities of $765 million, and excluding acquisitions and asset retirement obligations. In addition, expenditure for gathering systems, processing plants and other property plant and equipment were $288 million. 
For the full year, capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions and asset retirement obligations were $4.7 billion, $200 million below the low end of our original 2015 guidance. Total cash flow from operations was $3.6 billion. In addition, proceeds from asset sales were $193 million. Total acquisitions for the year were $481 [ph] million. 
At year-end, total debt outstanding was $6.7 billion with debt-to-total capitalization ratio of 34%. Taking into account $719 million of cash flow at hand at year-end, net debt-to-total capital was 31%. In the fourth quarter of 2015, total impairments were $168 million, $94 million of these impairments were the results of significant declines in commodity prices during the fourth quarter. 
For the full year 2015, total impairments were $6.6 billion [ph], $6.3 billion of these impairments were results of declines in commodity prices and were related to legacy natural gas assets and marginal liquid plays. The remaining impairments for both the fourth quarter and full year 2015 were ongoing lease for producing company impairments. 
The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 29% and the deferred tax ratio was 92%. Yesterday, we included a guidance table with the earnings press release for the first quarter and full year 2016. Our 2016 CapEx estimate is $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion, excluding acquisitions. The exploration and development portion, excluding facilities will account for almost 80% of the total CapEx budget. 
Our 2016 CapEx estimate represents a 47% decrease from 2015 and a 70% less in 2014, capital expenditures demonstrating our commitment to capital discipline. The budget for exploration and development facilities and gathering processing and other accounts were approximately 20% of the total CapEx budget for 2016. 
We plan to concentrate our infrastructure spending in the Eagle Ford and Delaware Basin to support our drilling programs in those areas that enhance operating efficiency. In terms of hedges, for natural gas, we have approximately 60,000 MMBtu per day, close [ph] to $2.49 per MMBtu, the March 1 through August 31, 2016. We currently have no hedges in place for oil.

During the fourth quarter of 2014, EOG was early to respond to the price signals in the market. We cut CapEx, scaled back activity and focused on returns and instead of growing oil into an oversupply market. As we start 2016, we are encouraged by the disciplined operators are demonstrating around the world. This disciplined capital reduction is rapidly slowing U.S. oil drilling and reducing significant amounts of future supply worldwide. We believe the pace of market correction is increasing in 2016. 
Now in summary, I will leave you with a few important points. First, 2015 was a record year for EOG in terms of improving the company. We had record well and operating cost reductions and a record year in improving well productivity. We also had our best year ever in adding new, high-quality drilling inventory. Second, we are rapidly resetting the company to be successful in a lower commodity price environment. We are focused on improving returns and lowering operating costs instead of growing oil at the bottom of the market. 
Third, our shift to premium drilling this year should yield strong capital returns in a low commodity price environment. Premium wells generate after-tax rates of return of 30% or better at $40 oil. And over 100% after-tax rates of return at $60 oil. Therefore, EOG is uniquely positioned for tremendous performance as oil prices improve. Fourth, we do not view premium drilling mode as a temporary bridge to get to low oil prices. With over 2 billion barrels of oil equivalent, our premium net resource potential and 12 years of premium inventory, this is a permanent shift in the quality of EOG's future wells. 
We believe the company will continue to grow the size and quality of premium inventory for years to come. Fifth, we remain long-term focused. We continue to do the things that will add significant upside to the future of the company like investments in exploration, secondary recovery and other new technologies. Our focus is creating long-term shareholder value through sustainable productivity investments. 
And finally, our goal has always been to be the low-cost U.S. horizontal oil producer. As we look to the future, that's not enough. Our goal is now squarely set on being one of the lowest-cost producers in the competitive global oil market, and we are well on our way to reaching that goal.

Certainly, we believe that premium drilling mode is a step change in the future of the company. It is a substantial increase as we said. Over the last 2 years, it's about a 95% increase in quality of the wells we're going to drill and a 50% uplift for this year. So we're moving more rapidly than what maybe we might have even thought a few years ago. What's driving that is the quality of rock. And the quality of the rock is the most important factor in the productivity of the well. So we made extremely strong technical advancements in identifying of the best rock in the best plays over the years. And certainly, we believe we've captured the premium acreage in the premium plays in the U.S. And then also in each one of those plays, we developed petrophysical techniques, seismic techniques. We've used a lot of core data and have combined over 10 years of experience in these well plays to identify the best target zones in each one of the plays. And so that is the main driver, it's a lot of quality, and capturing its first and then being able to take all the technical knowledge and tools that we developed over the years. And to -- and our experience, to be able to pick out the best targets. And then we've developed proprietary techniques to not only identify, but to place the laterals in those targets and to keep the lateral in those targets for a long portion of the well. So our goal is to keep those targets -- those laterals in the best rock, about 95% or better on the well. So that's really the main driver. We think that's a very unique, very proprietary ability of EOG. And will be very difficult to duplicate in the future."

Obviously, over the years, we've collected a tremendous amount of data. Even in this last year in 2015, we drilled quite a few potholes where we actually drilled down through the Eagle Ford and collected a lot of data. So what that allowed us to see was that we have a lot of additional upside there as far as working on the targeting, like I've mentioned, we're drilling 20-foot target intervals and doing multiple targets within the lower Eagle Ford. And we're seeing very good results with that and we're quite encouraged. So I think really going forward, we see a real opportunity to continue to add premium locations. We stated in our slides that we've got approximately 1,500 premium locations in the Eagle Ford. But we certainly see that as a starting point as far as being able to continue to add premium locations.
Let me just add -- just answer your question specifically on the 450 net MBOE per well in the Eagle Ford, that is for an average Eagle Ford well and that is not a premium well. Premium wells would be quite a bit better than that. And then that number is stale. So we haven't updated that 450 net Mboe per well for several years and we've made quite a bit of advancement since then in the high-density frac technology. And now we're making advancements in targeting also. So those numbers, it takes a little bit of time to get confirmation on what the new EUR number is, so when you make these advancements, you want to make sure you get at least a year's of production and then you can adjust them up accordingly."

EOG has committed a return-focused capital discipline, and we demonstrated that commitment in 2015 with a simple decision. After 4 years of 40% compound annual oil growth, we slammed on the brakes and decided to defer production growth. It was an easy decision. Outspending cash flow to grow oil and through an oversupply market makes no sense.
Rather than chasing production growth through the down cycle, we focused on 3 main goals. First, we concentrated more than ever on resetting the company to be successful on a lower commodity price environment by reducing costs and improving well productivity. Second, we wanted to add high-quality drilling inventory through organic exploration and tactical acquisitions. And most importantly, our third goal was to protect our balance sheet.
As a result, EOG had a record year in reducing cost, improving well productivity and adding new drilling potential to the company. We accomplished all of this and ended the year with one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry. Here are a few highlights from the year.
We reduced capital more than 40% from 2014 and maintained flat U.S. oil production. Total cash operating cost per unit decreased 17% compared to 2014. We drilled 2 industry record wells, 1 each in the Bakken and Delaware Basin Wolfcamp. We added a company record 1.6 billion barrels of oil equivalent and net resource potential over -- and over 3,000 net locations. That means we replaced more than 6x the inventory that we drilled in 2015. And we acquired 34,000 net acres in a sweet spot of the Delaware Basin.
2015 changed how we think about EOG's position in the industry long term. It's no longer enough to be the low-cost producer in U.S. horizontal shale. EOG's goal is to be competitive, low-cost oil producer in the global market.
Now let's talk about our plan in 2016. Our first objective this year is to achieve strong returns on our capital program with [ph] sustainable profitability gains. In order to maximize return on capital invested, we are shifting into what we call premium drilling mode.
Like last year, we will concentrate our efforts in capital in our top plays: The Eagle Ford, Delaware Basin, Bakken and Rockies. The difference in 2016 is that we had a flexibility to direct capital only towards our large inventory of premium quality wells. Premium inventories is defined as wells that generate direct after-tax rates of return of at least 30% at $40 oil. We have identified over 2 billion barrels of equivalent of net resource potential and 3,200 net drilling locations that meet this hurdle. At our 2016 pace, and we expect to complete 270 wells this year, that represents 12 years of drilling potential.
In addition, we are confident our premium inventory will continue to grow in size and quality. Our proven track record of organic exploration and sustainable gains through technology and efficiency will continue to add premium inventory for years to come. What that means, and this is the most important point, is that between our existing premium inventory and our confidence that we can replace it, EOG will be in premium drilling mode from now on.
EOG's shift to premium drilling in 2016 is not just simple high grading. It is a permanent upgrade for all our future drillings. It's important to realize that this is much more than a small incremental shift in our drilling program. It's a major step change in terms of per well productivity.
For the average 2016 well, we estimate a 50% increase in the first 120 days of production per foot of treated lateral versus wells we completed in 2015. Our shift to premium drilling allows EOG to quickly return to triple digits, and I'll say this again, to quickly return to triple-digit capital rates of return as oil prices improve to modest levels.
So the next logical question is: What becomes of the remaining inventory? Our nonpremium inventory is still very high-quality. By any industry standard, it is Tier 1 quality with tremendous value. Due to the quality, a large percentage of this inventory will be converted to premium through technology and efficiency gains over time, the remaining high-quality inventory will add value to property sales or trades as part of our ongoing upgrading process.
Our second objective in 2016 is to protect our balance sheet. 2 years in a row, we have cut capital by more than 40%, demonstrating our commitment to capital discipline. In addition, as a result of our ongoing evaluation of our portfolio to upgrade our asset base, we are marketing certain valuable but noncore properties. EOG prioritizes profitability and a healthy balance sheet to prepare the company for uncertain commodity cycles and that strategy has paid off.
EOG entered 2016 in excellent financial and operational shape. The combination of EOG's high-quality assets, sustainable cost reductions, and well productivity improvements allow the company to lead the industry in returns year after year. EOG is uniquely positioned with a large and growing inventory of high-return drilling even in a $40 price environment. Achieving strong returns in the current environment positions EOG to achieve tremendous returns as commodity prices improve.
Now I'll turn the call over to David Trice who will update you on the Eagle Ford and Rockies plays."

Year after year, the Eagle Ford continues to impress us with the quality of its resource potential.

Year after year, the Eagle Ford continues to impress us with the quality of its resource potential. In 2015, we grew production while completing 38% fewer wells compared to 2014. 6 years ago, we estimated that Eagle Ford had 900 million barrels of oil equivalent of net resource potential. We've since updated that net resource potential 3x, and the latest estimate from early 2014 was 3.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent.
In 2015, we've got a number of things that will promise the further upside to the Eagle Ford's resource potential. First, refinements to our high-density completion techniques continue to improve well productivity in 2015 as can be seen in the cumulative production charts in our investor presentation on Page 10.
Second, to complement high-density completions, we made tremendous progress on what we have termed precision targeting. This is one of the most promising developments not only for the Eagle Ford but for all of our plays. Precision targeting starts with first, identifying and then mapping the key petrophysical properties that make the difference between a good well and a great well.
Once all the data has been integrated, we found that the real sweet spot in any given target can be very narrow. Where we previously landed our wells and 150-foot window, we now precisely steer them in a window as narrow as 20 feet. In addition, this work on precision targeting also reveal that in some areas, we may have 2 distinct sweet spot targets in the lower Eagle Ford alone.
Finally, we conducted a pilot test by drilling adjacent wells in a W pattern that alternate between the 2 targets within the lower Eagle Ford. This allows for surface downspacing closer than the 300 feet used in our current development spacing and resource potential estimate. Early results from these tests are encouraging.
In 2016, we have more program flexibility as 91% of our Eagle Ford acreage is held by production. We plan to complete 150 Eagle Ford wells while continuing to test the W pattern, spacing wells 200 to 250 feet apart. Our advancements in precision targeting and completions, along with cost efficiencies, may have significant implications on our resource potential and will allow us to continue to upgrade additional Eagle Ford locations to premium status.
In our Rockies and Bakken plays, we proactively scaled back activity due to commodity prices. With the lower activity level, we're able to sharpen our focus on sustainable operational improvements. We are very pleased with the progress and in fact, the magnitude of operational improvements in these plays were the best in the company. Here are the highlights.
First, we upgraded our Bakken net resource potential to 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent and added almost 1,000 net locations. Second, we reduced Bakken completed well costs 18% and drilling days over 30%. Third, we've built water handling and water pipeline infrastructure that significantly reduced its long-term LOE.
Fourth, we drilled several high-quality wells in the Powder River Basin, highlighted by the Flatbow 602-1621H that came online in the fourth quarter. This Turner well averaged over 1,100 barrels of oil per day and 1.7 million cubic feet per day of rich natural gas in its first 90 days of production.
Finally, we also drilled an industry record well in the Bakken. The Riverview 102-32H produced an average of 2,700 barrels of oil per day over the first 30 days and 2,200 barrels of oil per day for the first 90 days of production. This well was the first high-density completion on our Antelope Extension acreage and is an industry record, even though it is only a 4,300-foot lateral. Going forward, we will continue to develop this area at a moderate pace as we build out the infrastructure that will allow us to lower long-term operating costs.
We're encouraged by these 2015 accomplishments in the Rockies and Bakken. And while the activity level will remain low in 2016, our focus on operational and well performance improvements will continue. We expect to see additional cost efficiencies and well productivity advancements through completions and targeting refinement. We plan to complete approximately 35 wells in the Rockies in 2016. As we continue progressing technically and reducing costs, we expect the premium location count to grow significantly.
Finally, a quick update on our Conwy project in the East Irish Sea. All work for startup has been completed by EOG, and we are working with the platform operator to reach final acceptance, which we believe is imminent. We expect first production by the end of the quarter.
Here's Billy Helms to review our activity in the Permian Delaware Basin."

Our Permian Delaware Basin team has made tremendous amount of progress last year. Prior to 2015, we developed a successful winter program and had encouraging results with the Wolfcamp and Bone Springs intervals. As we entered 2015, we laid out a specific plan to one, increase our technical knowledge to better understand the potential of these complex plays; two, improve our operational execution and cost performance; and three, expand the scope and the impact of the basin to EOG.
Our efforts paid off. Here's a recap of our progress. First, we made tremendous progress utilizing 2 techniques: Precision targeting and high-density completions. Our enhanced understanding of the regional stratigraphy of the basin helps us to delineate the most productive target intervals within each formation. This technique requires a significant amount of technical data and data analysis expertise and coupled with our high-density completion technique, generate solid improvements in well productivity as evidenced by our industry record-setting Wolfcamp well.
The Thor 21 #702H produced an average of 3,490 barrels of oil equivalent per day over its first 30 days of production. After 120 days, average production was an impressive 2,100 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Notably, the well was completed with a shorter lateral, yet still exceeded the longer lateral wells in absolute production. In fact, on average, our 2015 Wolfcamp wells produced 40% more than the next best operator during the first 3 months of production as displayed on Slide 9 of our investor presentation.
Second, we made significant progress generating sustainable cost reductions. For example, in the Wolfcamp oil window, we reduced average drilling time 33% and lower completed well cost to 35% despite adding incremental cost to each well for high-density completions. In addition, we secured a long-term brackish water supply that, as we move into 2016, is expected to save us $200,000 to $300,000 per well.
And finally, we increased the net resource potential for the Delaware Basin by 1.0 billion barrels of oil equivalent and added 2,200 net locations potentially adding decades of drilling inventory. This position us as -- this solidifies the position for the Delaware Basin as one of our higher-return wealth engines. We also executed on another 8,000 net acre acquisition in the fourth quarter, bringing total 2015 Delaware Basin acquisitions to 34,000 net acres. This adds to our sweet spot acreage with significant upside potential through multiple stack targets.
Thanks to the well productivity improvements and cost reductions achieved in 2015, the Delaware Basin delivers returns that compete for capital alongside the Eagle Ford. A large portion of the Delaware Basin is already considered premium, and with our continued advancements, we expect to dramatically increase our inventory of premium location in the next few years.
For 2016, we are continuing the momentum. The Delaware Basin will again be EOG's second most active basin next to the Eagle Ford. We plan to complete the same number of wells as we did in 2015, about 75, and we'll focus primarily on the Wolfcamp. Drilling the Wolfcamp generates excellent returns while allowing us to collect data on the shallower targets at the same time. I'll now address reserve replacement and finding costs.
All in, proved reserves decreased 15% in 2015, driven primarily by price-related revisions. Excluding revisions due to commodity price changes, we replaced 192% of our 2015 production at a low finding cost of $11.91 per BOE. For the 28th consecutive year, DeGolyer and MacNaughton performed an independent engineering analysis of our reserves and their estimate is within 5% of our internal estimate. Their analysis covered about 86% of our crude reserves this year. We see the schedules accompanying earnings press release for the calculation of the reserve replacement and finding costs. 
I'll now turn it over to Tim Driggers to discuss financials and capital structure."

I'll begin with a few comments about our capital spending last year and in the fourth quarter. Capitalized interest for the quarter was $8.9 million. For the fourth quarter of 2015, total exploration and development expenditures were $737 million, including facilities of $116 million and excluding acquisition and asset retirement obligations. In addition, expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants and other property plant and equipment were $35 million.
There were $105 million of acquisitions during the quarter. For the full year 2015, capitalized interest was $41.8 million. Total exploration and development expenditures were $4.4 billion, including facilities of $765 million and excluding acquisitions and asset retirement obligations. In addition, expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants and other property plant and equipment were $288 million.
For the full year, capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions and asset retirement obligations, were $4.7 billion, $200 million below the low end of our original 2015 guidance. Total cash flow from operations was $3.6 billion. In addition, proceeds from asset sales were $193 million. Total acquisitions for the year were $481 million.
At year-end, total debt outstanding was $6.7 billion with debt to total capitalization ratio of 34%. Taking into account $719 million of cash on hand at year-end, net debt to total capital was 31%. In the fourth quarter of 2015, total impairments were $168 million. $94 million of these impairments were the result of significant declines in commodity prices during the fourth quarter.
For the full year 2015, total impairments were $6.6 billion. $6.3 billion of these impairments were the results of decline in commodity prices and were related to legacy natural gas assets and marginal liquids plays. The remaining impairments for both the fourth quarter and full year 2015 were ongoing lease and producing property impairments. 
The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 29% and the deferred tax ratio was 92%. Yesterday, we included a guidance table with our earnings press release for the first quarter and full year 2016. Our 2016 CapEx estimate is $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion, excluding acquisitions. The exploration and development portion, excluding facilities, will account for almost 80% of the total CapEx budget.
Our 2016 CapEx estimate represents a 47% decrease from 2015 and is 70% less in 2014. Capital expenditure is demonstrating our commitment to capital discipline. The budget for exploration and development facilities and gathering, processing and other accounts for approximately 20% of the total CapEx budget for 2016.
We plan to concentrate our infrastructure spending in the Eagle Ford and Delaware Basin to support our drilling programs in those areas that enhance operating efficiency. In terms of hedges, for natural gas, we have approximately 60,000 MMBtu per day, hedged at $2.49 per MMBtu from March 1 through August 31, 2016. We currently have no hedges in place for oil.

During the fourth quarter of 2014, EOG was early to respond to the price signals in the market. We cut CapEx, scaled back activity and focused on returns and instead of growing oil into an oversupplied market. As we start 2016, we are encouraged by the discipline operators are demonstrating around the world. This disciplined capital reduction is rapidly slowing U.S. oil drilling and reducing significant amounts of future supply worldwide. We believe the pace of market correction is increasing in 2016.
Now in summary, I will leave you with a few important points. First, 2015 was a record year for EOG in terms of improving the company. We had record well and operating cost reductions and a record year in improving well productivity. We also had our best year ever in adding new, high-quality drilling inventory. Second, we are rapidly resetting the company to be successful in a lower commodity price environment. We are focused on improving returns and lowering operating costs instead of growing oil at the bottom of the market.
Third, our shift to premium drilling this year should yield strong capital returns in a low commodity price environment. Premium wells generate after-tax rates of return of 30% or better at $40 oil and over 100% after-tax rates of return at $60 oil. Therefore, EOG is uniquely positioned for tremendous performance as oil prices improve.
Fourth, we do not view premium drilling mode as a temporary bridge to get to low oil prices. With over 2 billion barrels of oil equivalent, our premium net resource potential and 12 years of premium inventory, this is a permanent shift in the quality of EOG's future wells. We believe the company will continue to grow the size and quality of premium inventory for years to come.
Fifth, we remain long-term focused. We continue to do the things that will add significant upside to the future of the company like investments in exploration, secondary recovery and other new technologies. Our focus is creating long-term shareholder value through sustainable productivity investments.
And finally, our goal has always been to be the low-cost U.S. horizontal oil producer. As we look to the future, that's not enough. Our goal is now squarely set on being one of the lowest-cost producers in the competitive global oil market, and we are well on our way to reaching that goal.
Thanks for listening. Now we'll go to Q&A."

It's a substantial increase, as we said. Over the last 2 years, it's about a 95% increase in the quality of the wells we're going to drill and a 50% uplift for this year. So we're moving more rapidly than what maybe we might have even thought a few years ago. What's driving that is the quality of rock. And the quality of the rock is the most important factor in the productivity of the well. So we made extremely strong technical advancements in identifying the best rock in the best plays over the years. And certainly, we believe we've captured the premier acreage in the premier plays in the U.S. And then also, in each one of those plays, we developed petrophysical techniques, seismic techniques. We've used a lot of core data and our combined over 10 years of experience in these horizontal plays to identify the best target zones in each one of the plays. And so that is the main driver. It's to lock quality, capturing it first and then being able to take all the technical knowledge and tools that we developed over the years and to, in our experience, to be able to pick out the best targets. And then we developed proprietary techniques to not only identify, but to place the laterals in those targets and to keep the lateral in those targets for a long portion of the well. So our goal is to keep those targets -- those laterals in the best rock, about 95% or better on the well. So that's really the main driver. We think that's a very unique, very proprietary ability of EOG, and it will be very difficult to duplicate in the future."

And so we see this as really just the beginning of a continuing, we believe, sustainable productivity increase in our drilling going forward. As we said in the opening, we've identified 3,200 locations and over 2 billion barrels of oil equivalent so far as premium, and we expect that to grow over time in numbers and quality. So we're -- this is really a big game changer for the company. We think it's very proprietary. And so we think it's going to give us an extremely competitive edge going forward. So we believe, as oil prices improve, we will be able to rapidly be able to generate triple-digit rates of return going forward. So this is a very meaningful step for the company."

But we certainly see that as a starting point as far as being able to continue to add premium locations. Let me just [indiscernible] to answer your question specifically on the 450 net MBoe per well in the Eagle Ford, that is for an average Eagle Ford well and that is not a premium well. Premium wells would be quite a bit better than that and that number is stale. So we haven't updated that 450 net MBoe per well for several years, and we've made quite a bit of advancement since then in the high-density frac technology, and now we're making advancements in targeting also.

The first avenue will be that we believe the majority of it will be converted to premium over time as we continue to learn how to target the rock more correctly, and we continue to be able to be better at picking out the high-quality rock in the target zones. So it's an ongoing process in every one of these plays and we expect a continued improvement. If it doesn't make into the premium inventory level and it never gets in our CapEx, then certainly, it has a lot of value. All this nonpremium inventory that we have, if you compared it to the rest of the industry, it would be Tier 1 inventory. It's very high-quality. So that gives us a chance to market this as we go forward down the road through property sales as we normally do in our asset upgrading process."

It",883,"Thanks, Tim. EOG is committed to a return-focused capital discipline, and we demonstrated that commitment in 2015 with a simple decision: After 4 years of 40% compound annual oil growth, we slammed on the brakes and decided to defer production growth. It was an easy decision. Outspending cash flow to grow oil and to an oversupplied market makes no sense.
Rather than chasing production growth through the down cycle, we focused on 3 main goals. First, we concentrated more than ever on resetting the company to be successful in a lower commodity price environment by reducing costs and improving well productivity. Second, we wanted to add high-quality drilling inventory through organic exploration and tactical acquisitions. And most importantly, our third goal was to protect our balance sheet.
As a result, EOG had a record year in reducing cost, improving well productivity and adding new drilling potential to the company. We accomplished all of this and ended the year with one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry. Here are a few highlights from the year.
We reduced capital more than 40% from 2014 and maintained flat U.S. oil production. Total cash operating cost per unit decreased 17% compared to 2014. We drilled 2 industry record wells: 1 each in the Bakken and Delaware Basin Wolfcamp. We added a company record 1.6 billion barrels of oil equivalent and net resource potential over -- and over 3,000 net locations. That means we replaced more than 6x the inventory that we drilled in 2015. And we acquired 34,000 net acres in the sweet spot of the Delaware Basin.
2015 changed how we think about EOG's position in the industry long term. It's no longer enough to be the low-cost producer in U.S. horizontal shale. EOG's goal is to be a competitive, low-cost oil producer in the global market.
Now let's talk about our plan in 2016. Our first objective this year is to achieve strong returns on our capital program through sustainable profitability gains. In order to maximize return on capital invested, we are shifting into what we call premium drilling mode.
Like last year, we will concentrate our efforts in capital in our top plays: The Eagle Ford, Delaware Basin, Bakken and Rockies. The difference in 2016 is that we have a flexibility to direct capital only towards our large inventory of premium quality wells. Premium inventory is defined as wells that generate direct after-tax rates of return of at least 30% at $40 oil. We have identified over 2 billion barrels of equivalent of net resource potential and 3,200 net drilling locations that meet this hurdle. At our 2016 pace, and we expect to complete 270 wells this year, that represents 12 years of drilling potential.
In addition, we are confident our premium inventory will continue to grow in size and quality. Our proven track record of organic exploration and sustainable gains through technology and efficiency will continue to add premium inventory for years to come. What that means, and this is the most important point, is that between our existing premium inventory and our confidence that we can replace it, EOG will be in premium drilling mode from now on.
EOG's shift to premium drilling in 2016 is not just simple high-grading. It is a permanent upgrade for all our future drillings. It's important to realize that this is much more than a small incremental shift in our drilling program. It's a major step change in terms of per-well productivity.
For the average 2016 well, we estimate a 50% increase in the first 120 days of production per foot of treated lateral versus wells we completed in 2015. Our shift to premium drilling allows EOG to quickly return to triple digits, and I'll say this again, to quickly return to triple-digit capital rates of return as oil prices improve to modest levels.
So the next logical question is: What becomes of the remaining inventory? Our nonpremium inventory is still very high quality. By any industry standard, it is Tier 1 quality with tremendous value. Due to the quality, a large percentage of this inventory will be converted to premium through technology and efficiency gains over time. The remaining high-quality inventory will add value through property sales or trades as part of our ongoing upgrading process.
Our second objective in 2016 is to protect our balance sheet. 2 years in a row, we have cut capital by more than 40%, demonstrating our commitment to capital discipline. In addition, as a result of our ongoing evaluation of our portfolio to upgrade our asset base, we are marketing certain valuable but noncore properties. EOG prioritizes profitability and a healthy balance sheet to prepare the company for uncertain commodity cycles, and that strategy has paid off.
EOG entered 2016 in excellent financial and operational shape. The combination of EOG's high-quality assets, sustainable cost reductions, and well productivity improvements allow the company to lead the industry in returns year after year. EOG is uniquely positioned with a large and growing inventory of high-return drilling, even in a $40 price environment. Achieving strong returns in the current environment positions EOG to achieve tremendous returns as commodity prices improve.

Year after year, the Eagle Ford continues to impress us with the quality of its resource potential. In 2015, we grew production while completing 38% fewer wells compared to 2014. 6 years ago, we estimated that Eagle Ford had 900 million barrels of oil equivalent of net resource potential. We've since updated that net resource potential 3 times, and the latest estimate from early 2014 was 3.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent.
In 2015, we've done a number of things that hold promise for further upside to the Eagle Ford's resource potential. First, refinements to our high-density completion techniques continue to improve well productivity in 2015, as can be seen in the cumulative production charts in our investor presentation on Page 10.
Second, to complement high-density completions, we made tremendous progress on what we have termed precision targeting. This is one of the most promising developments not only for the Eagle Ford, but for all of our plays. Precision targeting starts with, first, identifying and then mapping the key petrophysical properties that make the difference between a good well and a great well.
Once all the data has been integrated, we found that the real sweet spot in any given target can be very narrow. Where we previously landed our wells in a 150-foot window, we now precisely steer them in a window as narrow as 20 feet. In addition, this work on precision targeting also reveals that in some areas, we may have 2 distinct sweet spot targets in the lower Eagle Ford alone.
Finally, we conducted a pilot test by drilling adjacent wells in a W pattern that alternate between the 2 targets within the lower Eagle Ford. This allows for surface downspacing closer than the 300 feet used in our current development spacing and resource potential estimate. Early results from these tests are encouraging.
In 2016, we have more program flexibility as 91% of our Eagle Ford acreage is held by production. We plan to complete 150 Eagle Ford wells while continuing to test the W pattern, spacing wells 200 to 250 feet apart. Our advancements in precision targeting and completions, along with cost efficiencies, may have significant implications on our resource potential and will allow us to continue to upgrade additional Eagle Ford locations to premium status.
In our Rockies and Bakken plays, we proactively scaled back activity due to commodity prices. With the lower activity level, we're able to sharpen our focus on sustainable operational improvements. We are very pleased with the progress and in fact, the magnitude of operational improvements in these plays were the best in the company. Here are the highlights.
First, we upgraded our Bakken net resource potential to 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent and added almost 1,000 net locations. Second, we reduced Bakken completed well costs 18% and drilling days over 30%. Third, we've built water handling and water pipeline infrastructure that significantly reduces long-term LOE.
Fourth, we drilled several high-quality wells in the Powder River Basin, highlighted by the Flatbow 602-1621H that came online in the fourth quarter. This Turner well averaged over 1,100 barrels of oil per day and 1.7 million cubic feet per day of rich natural gas in its first 90 days of production.
Finally, we also drilled an industry-record well in the Bakken. The Riverview 102-32H produced an average of 2,700 barrels of oil per day over the first 30 days and 2,200 barrels of oil per day for the first 90 days of production. This well was the first high-density completion on our Antelope Extension acreage and is an industry record, even though it is only a 4,300-foot lateral. Going forward, we will continue to develop this area at a moderate pace as we build out the infrastructure that will allow us to lower long-term operating costs.
We're encouraged by these 2015 accomplishments in the Rockies and Bakken. And while the activity level will remain low in 2016, our focus on operational and well performance improvements will continue. We expect to see additional cost efficiencies and well productivity advancements through completions and targeting refinements. We plan to complete approximately 35 wells in the Rockies in 2016. As we continue progressing technically and reducing costs, we expect the premium location count to grow significantly.
Finally, a quick update on our Conwy project in the East Irish Sea. All work for startup has been completed by EOG, and we are working with the platform operator to reach final acceptance, which we believe is imminent. We expect first production by the end of the quarter.
Here's Billy Helms to review our activity in the Permian Delaware Basin."

Our Permian Delaware Basin team has made a tremendous amount of progress last year. Prior to 2015, we developed a successful winter program and had encouraging results with the Wolfcamp and Bone Springs intervals. As we entered 2015, we laid out a specific plan to, one, increase our technical knowledge to better understand the potential of these complex plays; two, improve our operational execution and cost performance; and three, expand the scope and the impact of the basin to EOG.
Our efforts paid off. Here's a recap of our progress. First, we made tremendous progress utilizing 2 techniques: precision targeting and high-density completions. Our enhanced understanding of the regional stratigraphy of the basin helps us to delineate the most productive target intervals within each formation. This technique requires a significant amount of technical data and data analysis expertise, and coupled with our high-density completion technique, generate solid improvements in well productivity as evidenced by our industry record-setting Wolfcamp well.
The Thor 21 #702H produced an average of 3,490 barrels of oil equivalent per day over its first 30 days of production. After 120 days, average production was an impressive 2,100 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Notably, the well was completed with a shorter lateral, yet still exceeded the longer-lateral wells in absolute production. In fact, on average, our 2015 Wolfcamp wells produced 40% more than the next-best operator during the first 3 months of production, as displayed on Slide 9 of our investor presentation.
Second, we made significant progress generating sustainable cost reductions. For example, in the Wolfcamp oil window, we reduced average drilling time 33% and lowered completed well cost 35% despite adding incremental cost to each well for high-density completions. In addition, we secured a long-term brackish water supply that, as we move into 2016, is expected to save us $200,000 to $300,000 per well.
And finally, we increased the net resource potential for the Delaware Basin by 1.0 billion barrels of oil equivalent and added 2,200 net locations, potentially adding decades of drilling inventory. This position us as -- this solidifies the position for the Delaware Basin as one of our higher-return growth engines. We also executed on another 8,000 net acre acquisition in the fourth quarter, bringing total 2015 Delaware Basin acquisitions to 34,000 net acres. This adds to our sweet-spot acreage with significant upside potential through multiple stack targets.
Thanks to the well productivity improvements and cost reductions achieved in 2015, the Delaware Basin delivers returns that compete for capital alongside the Eagle Ford. A large portion of the Delaware Basin is already considered premium, and with our continued advancements, we expect to dramatically increase our inventory of premium locations in the next few years.
For 2016, we are continuing the momentum. The Delaware Basin will again be EOG's second most active basin, next to the Eagle Ford. We plan to complete the same number of wells as we did in 2015, about 75, and we'll focus primarily on the Wolfcamp. Drilling the Wolfcamp generates excellent returns while allowing us to collect data on the shallower targets at the same time. I'll now address reserve replacement and finding costs.
All in, proved reserves decreased 15% in 2015, driven primarily by price-related revisions. Excluding revisions due to commodity price changes, we replaced 192% of our 2015 production at a low finding cost of $11.91 per BOE. For the 28th consecutive year, DeGolyer and MacNaughton performed an independent engineering analysis of our reserves, and their estimate was within 5% of our internal estimate. Their analysis covered about 86% of our crude reserves this year. Please see the schedules accompanying this earnings press release for the calculation of the reserve replacement and finding costs.

I'll begin with a few comments about our capital spending last year and in the fourth quarter. Capitalized interest for the quarter was $8.9 million. For the fourth quarter of 2015, total exploration and development expenditures were $737 million, including facilities of $116 million and excluding acquisition and asset retirement obligations. In addition, expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants and other property, plant and equipment were $35 million.
There were $105 million of acquisitions during the quarter. For the full year 2015, capitalized interest was $41.8 million. Total exploration and development expenditures were $4.4 billion, including facilities of $765 million and excluding acquisitions and asset retirement obligations. In addition, expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants and other property, plant and equipment were $288 million.
For the full year, capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions and asset retirement obligations, were $4.7 billion, $200 million below the low end of our original 2015 guidance. Total cash flow from operations was $3.6 billion. In addition, proceeds from asset sales were $193 million. Total acquisitions for the year were $481 million.
At year-end, total debt outstanding was $6.7 billion with debt to total capitalization ratio of 34%. Taking into account $719 million of cash on hand at year-end, net debt to total capital was 31%. In the fourth quarter of 2015, total impairments were $168 million. $94 million of these impairments were the result of significant declines in commodity prices during the fourth quarter.
For the full year 2015, total impairments were $6.6 billion. $6.3 billion of these impairments were the results of declines in commodity prices and were related to legacy natural gas assets and marginal liquids plays. The remaining impairments for both the fourth quarter and full year 2015 were ongoing lease and producing property impairments. 
The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 29% and the deferred tax ratio was 92%. Yesterday, we included a guidance table with our earnings press release for the first quarter and full year 2016. Our 2016 CapEx estimate is $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion, excluding acquisitions. The exploration and development portion, excluding facilities, will account for almost 80% of the total CapEx budget.
Our 2016 CapEx estimate represents a 47% decrease from 2015 and is 70% less than 2014 capital expenditures, demonstrating our commitment to capital discipline. The budget for exploration and development facilities and gathering, processing and other accounts for approximately 20% of the total CapEx budget for 2016.
We plan to concentrate our infrastructure spending in the Eagle Ford and Delaware Basin to support our drilling programs in those areas and enhance operating efficiency. In terms of hedges, for natural gas, we have approximately 60,000 MMBtu per day, hedged at $2.49 per MMBtu from March 1 through August 31, 2016. We currently have no hedges in place for oil.

During the fourth quarter of 2014, EOG was early to respond to the price signals in the market. We cut CapEx, scaled back activity and focused on returns instead of growing oil into an oversupplied market. As we start 2016, we are encouraged by the discipline operators are demonstrating around the world. This disciplined capital reduction is rapidly slowing U.S. oil drilling and reducing significant amounts of future supply worldwide. We believe the pace of market correction is increasing in 2016.
Now in summary, I will leave you with a few important points. First, 2015 was a record year for EOG in terms of improving the company. We had record well and operating cost reductions and a record year in improving well productivity. We also had our best year ever in adding new, high-quality drilling inventory. Second, we are rapidly resetting the company to be successful in a lower commodity price environment. We are focused on improving returns and lowering operating costs instead of growing oil at the bottom of the market.
Third, our shift to premium drilling this year should yield strong capital returns in a low commodity price environment. Premium wells generate after-tax rates of return of 30% or better at $40 oil and over 100% after-tax rates of return at $60 oil. Therefore, EOG is uniquely positioned for tremendous performance as oil prices improve.
Fourth, we do not view premium drilling mode as a temporary bridge to get through low oil prices. With over 2 billion barrels of oil equivalent, our premium net resource potential and 12 years of premium inventory, this is a permanent shift in the quality of EOG's future wells. We believe the company will continue to grow the size and quality of premium inventory for years to come.
Fifth, we remain long-term focused. We continue to do the things that will add significant upside to the future of the company like investments in exploration, secondary recovery and other new technologies. Our focus is creating long-term shareholder value through sustainable productivity investments.
And finally, our goal has always been to be the low-cost U.S. horizontal oil producer. As we look to the future, that's not enough. Our goal is now squarely set on being one of the lowest-cost producers in the competitive global oil market, and we are well on our way to reaching that goal.
Thanks for listening. Now we'll go to Q&A."

It's a substantial increase, as we said. Over the last 2 years, it's about a 95% increase in the quality of the wells we're going to drill and a 50% uplift for this year. So we're moving more rapidly than what maybe we might have even thought a few years ago. What's driving that is the quality of rock. And the quality of the rock is the most important factor in the productivity of the well. So we made extremely strong technical advancements in identifying the best rock in the best plays over the years. And certainly, we believe we've captured the premier acreage in the premier plays in the U.S. And then also, in each one of those plays, we developed petrophysical techniques, seismic techniques. We've used a lot of core data and our, combined, over 10 years of experience in these horizontal plays to identify the best target zones in each one of the plays. And so that is the main driver. It's to lock quality, capturing it first and then being able to take all the technical knowledge and tools that we developed over the years and to, in our experience, to be able to pick out the best targets. And then we developed proprietary techniques to not only identify, but to place the laterals in those targets and to keep the lateral in those targets for a long portion of the well. So our goal is to keep those targets -- those laterals in the best rock, about 95% or better on the well. So that's really the main driver. We think that's a very unique, very proprietary ability of EOG, and it will be very difficult to duplicate in the future."

And so we see this as really just the beginning of a continuing, we believe, sustainable productivity increase in our drilling going forward. As we said in the opening, we've identified 3,200 locations and over 2 billion barrels of oil equivalent so far as premium, and we expect that to grow over time in numbers and quality. So we're -- this is really a big game changer for the company. We think it's very proprietary. And so we think it's going to give us an extremely competitive edge going forward. So we believe, as oil prices improve, we will be able to rapidly be able to generate triple-digit rates of return going forward. So this is a very meaningful step for the company."

Obviously, over the years, we've collected a tremendous amount of data. Even this last year in 2015, we drilled quite a few pilot holes where we actually drilled down through the Eagle Ford and collected a lot of data. And so what that allowed us to see was that we have a lot of additional upside there as far as working on the targeting. Like I've mentioned, I mean, we're drilling 20-foot target intervals and doing multiple targets within the lower Eagle Ford. We're seeing very good results with that and we're quite encouraged. So I think really, going forward, we see a real opportunity to continue to add premium locations. We stated in our slides that we've got approximately 1,500 premium locations in the Eagle Ford. But we certainly see that as a starting point as far as being able to continue to add premium locations. Let me just add, to answer your question specifically on the 450 net MBoe per well in the Eagle Ford. That is for an average Eagle Ford well and that is not a premium well. Premium wells would be quite a bit better than that, and that number is stale. So we haven't updated that 450 net MBoe per well for several years, and we've made quite a bit of advancements since then in the high-density frac technology, and now we're making advancements in targeting also. So those numbers, it takes a little bit of time to get confirmation on what the new EUR number is, so when you make these advancements, you want to make sure you get at least a years' of production and then you can adjust them up accordingly."

EOG is becoming an even better company than it was just a year ago by lowering development and production costs and increasing returns. In the yesterday's press release, we announced 2 exciting developments that have the potential to be significant additional drivers of higher returns of lower costs. I'll briefly highlight those, and Billy and David will provide details in a moment. Finally, I'll review our shift to premium drilling and how this shift is a game-changing event with significant long-term implications for EOG shareholders. 
First, I want to highlight EOG's development on the first successful on enhanced oil recovery technology in U.S. [indiscernible] on sale. We initiated our EOR efforts in the Eagle Ford 3 years ago. Here's what's we've learned since that time. Number one, geology matters. The Eagle Ford is unique. The same geological characteristic that make the Eagle Ford prolific and primary development  also make it unique for enhanced oil recovery. That EOR process we're using to produce incremental oil out of the Eagle Ford is not necessarily applicable to other horizontal basins. 
Number two. How you initially drilled the field matters. Secondary recovery works best on leased units that were developed using the best completions with optimal space. 
Finally, returns matter. We figured out how to execute EOR economically. The process can be implemented at rates of return that rival our premium drilling and significantly lower funding costs over time. 
The second item I will highlight is our discovery in the South Texas Austin Chalk. The turn discovery is loaded as many operators have been drilling the chart for years with varying degrees of success. Perhaps a more accurate characterization is that we discovered a new geologic concept in an existing play. Our team EOG has cracked the code on how to make our particular footprint in the Austin Chalk a top-tier horizontal play earning returns on par with the Eagle Ford, Permian and Bakken. The third item I would like to review its EOG's shift to premium drilling this year. This shift is a game-changer with significant long-term implications. I will cover those implications in a moment. But first, let's review by what we mean by premium. 
Premium inventory is defined as drilling locations that generate at least 30% [ph] direct after-tax rate of return at $40 oil. Here's a few more clarifying points regarding this inventory. First, 30% return is not an average. It's a minimum. Second, 30% was established as the minimum direct return to ensure that when indirect costs are included, the drilling program are in healthy full cycle returns. Third, we fully expect to more than replace our drilling inventory with new premium locations every year. Therefore, this is the most -- and this is the most important point, our shift to premium is permanent and not simply a temporary high-grading process in a low-commodity price environment. So 2016 will mark a point in time when EOG made a significant permanent shifted its drilling program. There are many long-term implications for that shift. The first is superior capital discipline. Premium drilling set a new higher standard for capital allocation within the company. The second is a large capital efficiency gain. We do not need 50 rigs drilling thousands of wells per year. It will take far west capital for growth production at strong double-digit rates. The third implication is we can return the triple-digit direct rates of return with oil as low as $60 per barrel. And if history is any indication, we will continue to post the oil price needed for triple-digit returns even lower. And finally, premium drilling extends our lead as low cost horizontal oil reserve. As I outlined, our premium shift to premium drilling this year is a game-changing event for EOG. Yesterday's announcement regarding our enhanced oil recovery success in the Eagle Ford and are often drilling success are 2 more technical and operational achievements that will help us reach our long-term goal of being one of the lower-cost producers in the global oil market. Now I'll turn it over to Billy Helms to discuss our exciting results from enhanced oil recovery in the Eagle Ford."

Three years ago, we initiated an effort to test EOR using gas injection and horizontal shale. Results from lab experiments indicated that the process was technically feasible, but the economics and operational execution were going to be challenged without some creative problem-solving. Our EOR team has only saw the problem the demonstrated returns that are competitive with our premium program. That EOR processes developed is highly proprietary and this limits the amount of detail we are able to disclose. However, I will share several reasons why EOG is uniquely positioned to achieve a successful outcome. As Bill mentioned earlier, the geological setting is important. We have long discuss the competent barriers that it takes to Eagle Ford and provide vertical containments for comletions. This unique feature allows plays -- also plays a significant role in keeping the injection in contact with the targeted reservoir. The injected gas is thus able to become admissible, with the oil and the reservoir exceptionally driving incremental oil recovery. EOG's acreage position is situated in the optimal thermal maturity of the play to maximize oil recovery. Being in the oil window has provided many benefits during the primary development, but it's also important for the EOR process acreage that is too far down deep or at dip in the play may not benefit us greatly. That EOR economics are significantly enhanced by the scale out of EOG's footprint in the play. The infrastructure and facilities that are utilized during primary development across the field are keys to be able to operationally execute the EOR process. Thus, providing a significant economic benefit. These reasons are the keys to the process of success and are why -- why we believe EOR will not be a blanket application across the Eagle Ford or necessarily applicable to other horizontal shale plays. We have not yet determined how much the EOG's acreage will benefit from EOR or what the overall resource potential may be. The 4 pilot projects have tested different geographic and geologic settings, each proving the concept successful. But further definition and time will be needed to assess the applicability and overall benefit across EOG's acreage position. 
Here are some of the key takeaways regarding the economics and recovery potential. One, this EOR technique is not capital-intensive. There is no incremental drilling required for capital cost to average approximately $1 million per well. Two, the operating costs are low. The process makes use of produced gas readily available to the field and there are a few other incremental operating costs. Three, EOR may have significant effect on our long-term base profile unlock typical secondary recovery projects, the production response occurs quickly within the first 2 to 3 months and hold steady for longer. Four, the combination of operating costs and steady production delivers a return profile that complements our primary drilling program. Primarily drilling delivers high returns and short paybacks. Our EOR [indiscernible] has a much different profile characterized by modest upfront capital investment that delivers a longer annuity of incremental oil production and strong cash flow. The rate of return is still on par with primary drilling. But for each dollar invested, EOR delivers at least twice the net present value created as primary drilling. Finally, our models indicate that this process will increase recovery by 30% to 70%. I want to emphasize these are incremental potential reserves not accelerated production delivering at -- delivered at potential finite cost of $6 per barrel of oil or less. We will conduct a the pilot in 2016 and we will evaluate the results and review our acreage. We will determine the long-term capital production and earnings effect of EOR. It's important to note that while this is a significant technical and economic breakthrough, drilling out this effort will take time and it is dependent on the pace of primary drilling and field development. Now here is David Trice."

Another exciting development on our South Texas acreage position concerns the Austin Chalk. In our press release yesterday, we published the results of our 2 tremendous Austin Chalk wells, the Leonard AC Unit 101H, producing an average with 2,715 barrels of oil equivalent per day for 30 days. The unit 101H was completed in April and its average production for the first 20 days was 3,130 barrels of oil equivalent per day. While the Austin Chalk is not a new play, historically industry production has been inconsistent from well to well. While good wells are possible, the performance and resulting returns are highly variable across the play. However, use of proprietary metaphysical analysis we discovered how to find new geologic concepts to the Austin Chalk and drill prolific wells consistently. Much like the Eagle Ford, the Chalk responds very well to EOG style completions. Our high-density completions rig great complex fracture systems both to the well bore in significantly improving well performance. Also like the Eagle Ford, the Austin Chalk benefits from the detailed work we conduct to determine the best target. The Chalk can be as thick as 140 feet in some areas, but our targeting efforts keep the drill bit confined to this 20 to 30 feet of rock. Precision targeting combined with EOG stock equations is now generating prolific premium level well performance. It's too early in our exploration efforts to know how much of the Austin Chalk is perspective over our acreage. The self-service data and detailed mapping, the Austin fields are encouraging. We plan to drill additional 7 Austin Chalk wells in 2016 and look forward to updating you with future drilling results as we learn more. In the Permian Delaware Basin, our recent activity has focused on the Wolfcamp oil window. Drilling the Wolfcamp generates excellent returns while allowing us to collect data on the shower targets such as the Second Bone Spring Sand. During the first quarter, we completed a dozen wells with per well average 13 day rates over 2,100 barrels of oil equivalent per day with approximately 17% oil pad. The average lateral of these Wolfcamp wells is approximately 4,500 [ph] feet. Over the last year, we focused on increasing our understanding of the geology and maximizing well performance through better technologies such as precision targeting, completions and better wellbore design. As a result, our wells are industry-leading as illustrated on Slide 8 on our investor presentation. Since January of last year, our wells have been twice as good as industry average in the Midland or Delaware Basin when normalized collaterally. This is approach EOG takes across all of our plays. We seek to first understand the geology; second, optimize the completions; and finally, enhance operational practices that maximize efficiencies and lower costs. 
Our next step for Wolfcamp optimization is to extend the lateral. Breakthroughs we made in wellbore design will allow us to apply EOG style high-density completions to long Wolfcamp laterals. Longer will enhance our highly successful Wolfcamp program and reduce our service footprint across the play. In April, we drilled 2 7,000-foot laterals, the Rattlesnake 21 feet 701H and 702H. These wells are too new to report at 30-day rate. However, the first 20 days of production are averaging more than 3,800 barrels of oil equivalent per day per well with maximum 24-hour rates at 4,200 barrels of oil equivalent per day per well. 
Meanwhile, we continue to further improve operational efficiencies and cost in the Wolfcamp. During the first quarter, drilling days decreased 14% from our 2015 average to 16.1 days. Also, total well cost decreased 8% to $6.9 million, more than offsetting costs associated with continued completion enhancements. In addition, in the second quarter, we'll begin using our brackish water supply for our New Mexico completions with an anticipated savings of $150 million per well. This new water supply, along with many other operational improvements, will allow EOG to continue to lower cost and increase returns. On international front, we are very happy to report that our East Irish Sea Conway project achieved first production in late March. We're currently addressing normal start-up items and running tests to determine the optimal production rate. Our full-year guidance has been adjusted until we complete more testing. Here's Tim Driggers."

First, a brief word on our macro views and how they relate to EOG's plans. The substantial capital of capital investment by the industry in 2015 and 2016 is causing oil supply to decline in many producing regions around the world. Led by steady declines in the U.S. and supported by strong gasoline demand, the market continues to rebalance. We agree with consensus that this process will accelerate in the second half of this year and into 2017. We believe that in the U.S., it will take a sustained $60 to $65 oil price and 12 months of lead time for the industry to deliver a modest level of growth. However, what is true for the industry in general does not hold for EOG. EOG is a low-cost U.S. horizontal oil producer. With our premium drilling inventory, we believe our reinvestment advantage is $15 to $20 per barrel lower than the average industry operator. When the market balances and prices recover to moderate levels, our leading asset quality, best-in-class technology and low-cost structure will become apparent with how quickly we can resume higher return oil growth.
And that may be the #1 question we received the last 2 months. And or more accurately, at what price will we accelerate and return to growth? Our first priority this year is to completely find our capital program with cash flow and reduce net debt with property sales. We're in the late stages of negotiating on a number of deals and are confident we will be successful on many this year. We expect their collective impact will be meaningful. Our second priority will be to complete [indiscernible]. We have managed our operations such that we have the capacity to add 40% more completions without adding any additional equipment from the service industry. We can respond quickly as supply and demand balance and oil process firm. 
In summary, I would like to leave you with the following important takeaways from this call. Number one, our shift to premium drilling this year is a game-changer. We expect well productivity to improve more than 50% in 2016, which is the largest 1 year improvement in the history of the company. More importantly, this shift is permanent. Premium drilling will allow us to maintain a balanced capital program and resume high return oil growth in a moderate oil price environment. Number two, our enhanced oil recovery success is another example of EOG's ability to make significant technology games. EOR has the potential to add meaningful long-term value to our Eagle Ford asset by adding low-decline, low-cost, high-return reserves. Number three. The new Austin Chalk results are encouraging for our South Texas acreage position. Time will tell. But we believe the chalk geology we discovered is substantially better and more repeatable than previous chalk drilling. Number four. Last year, last year we said 2015 was a record year for improving the company. As we start this year, we are beginning to realize that the improvements in 2016 may be even stronger than 2015. Our sustainable gains in technology and efficiencies are running at record-setting pace and we are excited about what we can achieve in cost reduction and productivity improvements in 2016. Number five. Our goal has always been to be the highest return E&P company in the U.S. and we believe that we have achieved that goal. Our sites are now set on becoming one of the lowest-cost producers in the global oil market. We believe it's possible and we are moving toward that target rapid. Thanks for listening. And now, we'll go to Q&A."

And to connect as much rock to the primary process. And that really enhances the EOR effectiveness as we go forward. So we'll move along both of them in a nice steady pace. And we'll just continue to learn as we go forward. And I think the EOR process will be much like the drilling program.

And so we believe a large percentage of inventory that we have in the Eagle Ford will be converted to premium.

So as Bill mentioned earlier that the primarily goal would be go through and do a full-scale development on each and every lease with the latest high combinations. That's the number one goal and the pace of development from that will dictate us to when we roll out the secondary or the EOR process. But typically, as we -- I think we have a slide on the deck, I think Slide 4 that, that the time frame will be somewhere in the first 2 to 5 years. So I think that would probably be our initial guide. There's really no detriment that we see as to -- if you wait too long to implement it, it's going to be detrimental. We think it's a great tool for just continuing to contact the remaining oil left in the reservoir. Certainly economically, there'll not be an advantage to doing it earlier than later. But more importantly, the advance completions are driving probably incrementally more success to start with. So I don't know if that helps answer your question. But that -- I would say that it'll be somewhere in that first couple of years 2, 3 years of development."

The second part of your question in the extent of the acreage that might be applicable to this. Honestly, we just don't know that this point. We do know that there are some areas that probably will be challenged to work economically we -- but we are still early on that process and trying to determine how much of the acreage is applicable. We just don't know yet. Now the 32-well pattern is probably a good indication of may be what we'll look at the future. It may be subsets or leases that will dictate the size of how we develop going forward. So maybe you've got to think about it instead of a single well, it'll be groups of wells that will be implemented at onetime and not single wells. So we're kind of giving you some guidance on what we think the capital cost is and we try to boil that down to a single well to try to think about this and knowing that each lease will have different counts of well, maybe 12 to 20 wells on a given lease, say. And then the production profile we've kind of given a curve out there that maybe give you some insights what the Kim curves might looks like. The production response from this is pretty unique in the sense of secondary recovery projects it's probably only the process that gives you a rapid production response. You get a response in the first 3 months essentially, which is pretty fast. And then it holds pretty steady for a number of years. So that made -- and so that's probably about as much detail on how we see the -- how it would be rolled out. Again, the pace of development, I know it's a model economically. The pace of development is purely just going to be on the things that we learn from this next pilot and then our develop of existing units using our high completions. So we do expect this to increase that I would expect that do with increase the number of wells this year as we roll out the new budgets and ever-increasing part of San Antonio's capital allocation."

I would say that our challenge technically -- so we're working on some enhanced models to better understand what the long-term production will actually be. So I think what just needs further clarification and tests from existing pilots that were -- and featured pilots to really not let down. And then you're right, I think the advantage of the completion. So we'll make a big difference.

EOG is becoming an even better company than it was just a year ago by lowering development and production costs and increasing returns. In the yesterday's press release, we announced 2 exciting developments that have the potential to be significant additional drivers of higher returns and lower costs. I'll briefly highlight those, and Billy and David will provide details in a moment. Finally, I'll review our shift to premium drilling and how this shift is a game-changing event with significant long-term implications for EOG shareholders. 
First, I want to highlight EOG's development on the first successful enhanced oil recovery technology in U.S. horizontal shale. We initiated our EOR efforts in the Eagle Ford 3 years ago. Here's what we've learned since that time. Number one, geology matters. The Eagle Ford is unique. The same geologic characteristic that make the Eagle Ford prolific and primary development also make it unique for enhanced oil recovery. That EOR process we are using to produce incremental oil out of the Eagle Ford is not necessarily applicable to other horizontal basins. 
Number two, how you initially drill would be all matters. Secondary recovery works best on lease units that were developed using the best completions with optimal spacing. 
Finally, returns matter. We figured out how to execute EOR economically. The process can be implemented at rates of return that rival our premium drilling and significantly low refining cost over time. 
The second item I will highlight is our discovery in the South Texas Austin Chalk. The turn discovery is loaded as many operators have been drilling the chalk for years with varying degrees of success. Perhaps a more accurate characterization is that we discovered a new geologic concept in an existing play. Our team at EOG has cracked the code on how to make our particular footprint in the Austin Chalk a top-tier horizontal play earning returns on par with the Eagle Ford, Permian and Bakken. The third item I would like to review is EOG's shift to premium drilling this year. This shift is a game-changer with significant long-term implications. I will cover those implications in a moment. But first, let's review what we mean by premium. 
Premium inventory is defined as drilling locations that generate at least 30% direct after-tax rate of return at $40 oil. Here's a few more clarifying points regarding this inventory. First, 30% return is not an average. It's a minimum. Second, 30% was established as the minimum direct return to ensure that when indirect costs are included, the drilling program are in healthy full cycle returns. Third, we fully expect to more than replace our drilling inventory with new premium locations every year. Therefore, this is the most -- and this is the most important point, our shift to premium is permanent and not simply a temporary high-grading process in a low-commodity price environment. So 2016 will mark the point of time when EOG made a significant permanent shift in its drilling program. There are many long-term implications for that shift. The first is superior capital discipline. Premium drilling sets a new higher standard for capital allocation within the company. The second is a large capital efficiency gain. We do not need 50 rigs drilling thousands of wells per year. It will take far less capital for growth production at strong double-digit rates. The third implication is we can return the triple-digit direct rates of return with oil as low as $60 per barrel. And if history is any indication, we will continue to post the oil price needed for triple-digit returns even low. And finally, premium drilling extends our lead as the low cost horizontal oil reserve. As I outlined, our permanent shift to premium drilling this year is a game-changing event for EOG. Yesterday's announcement regarding our enhanced oil recovery success in the Eagle Ford and our Austin Chalk drilling success are 2 more technical and operational achievements that will help us reach our long-term goal of being one of the lower-cost producers in the global oil market. Now I'll turn it over to Billy Helms to discuss our exciting results from enhanced oil recovery in the Eagle Ford."
269660,330157141,976060,"EOG Resources, Inc., Q1 2016 Earnings Call, May 06, 2016",2016-05-06,"Earnings Calls","EOG Resources, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bill.

Three years ago, we initiated an effort to test EOR using gas injection in horizontal shale. Results from lab experiments indicated that the process was technically feasible, but the economics and operational execution were going to be challenged without some creative problem-solving. Our EOR team has only saw the problem. They demonstrated returns that are competitive with our premium drilling program. The EOR process we developed is highly proprietary and this limits the amount of detail we are able to disclose. However, I will share several reasons why EOG is uniquely positioned to achieve a successful outcome. As Bill mentioned earlier, the geological setting is important. We have long discussed the competent barriers that intakes at Eagle Ford and provide vertical containment for completions. This unique feature allows plays -- also plays a significant role in keeping the injection in contact with the targeted reservoir. The injected gas is thus able to become miscible, with the oil in the reservoir and subsequently drive incremental oil recovery. EOG's acreage position is situated in the optimal thermal maturity of the play to maximize oil recovery. Being in the oil window has provided many benefits during the primary development, but it's also important for the EOR process acreage that is too far downdip or updip in the play may not benefit us greatly. The EOR economics are significantly enhanced by the scale out of EOG's footprint in the play. The infrastructure and facilities that are utilized during primary development across the field are key to being able to operationally execute the EOR process thus providing a significant economic benefit. These reasons are the keys to the process of success and are why EOG -- why that we believe EOR will not be a blanket application across the Eagle Ford or necessarily applicable to other horizontal shale plays. We have not yet determined how much the EOG's acreage will benefit from EOR or what the overall resource potential may be. The 4 pilot projects have tested different geographic and geologic settings, each proving the concept successful. But further definition and time will be needed to assess the applicability and overall benefit across EOG's acreage position. 
Here are some of the key takeaways regarding the economics and recovery potential. One, this EOR technique is not capital-intensive. There is no incremental drilling required for capital cost to average approximately $1 million per well. Two, the operating costs are low. The process makes use of produced gas readily available to the field, and there are few other incremental operating costs. Three, EOR may have significant effect on our long-term Eagle Ford base production profile, unlock typical secondary recovery projects, the production response occurs quickly within the first 2 to 3 months and hold steady for longer. Four, the combination of lower operating costs and steady production delivers a return profile that complements our primary drilling program. Primarily drilling delivers high returns and short paybacks. Our EOR pilots have a much different profile characterized by modest upfront capital investment that delivers a longer annuity of incremental oil production and strong cash flow. The rate of return is still on par with primary drilling. But for each dollar invested, EOR delivers at least twice the net present value created as primary drilling. Finally, our models indicate that this process will increase recovery by 30% to 70%. I want to emphasize these are incremental potential reserves, not accelerated production, delivering at -- delivered at potential finite cost of $6 per barrel of oil or less. We will conduct a pit pilot in 2016, and we will evaluate the results and review our acreage. We will determine the long-term capital production and earnings effect of EOR. It's important to note that while this is a significant technical and economic breakthrough, drilling out this effort will take time, and it is dependent on the pace of primary drilling and field development. Now here is David Trice."

Another exciting development on our South Texas acreage position concerns the Austin Chalk. In our press release yesterday, we published the results of 2 tremendous Austin Chalk wells, the Leonard AC Unit 101H, producing average of 2,715 ba",709,"Thanks, Billy. Another exciting development on our South Texas acreage position concerns the Austin Chalk. In our press release yesterday, we published the results of 2 tremendous Austin Chalk wells, the Leonard AC Unit 101H, producing average of 2,715 barrels of oil equivalent per day for 30 days. The Denali Unit 101H was completed in April and its average production for the first 20 days was 3,130 barrels of oil equivalent per day. While the Austin Chalk is not a new play, historically industry production has been inconsistent from well to well. While good wells are possible, the performance and resulting returns are highly variable across the play. However, using proprietary petrophysical analysis, we discovered how to apply new geologic concepts to the Austin Chalk and drill prolific wells consistently. Much like the Eagle Ford, the chalk responds very well to EOG-style completions. Our high-density completions create complex fracture systems close to the wellbore significantly improving the well performance. Also like the Eagle Ford, the Austin Chalk benefits from the detailed work we conduct to determine the best target. The chalk can be as thick as 140 feet in some areas, but our targeting efforts keep the drill bit confined to the best 20 to 30 feet of rock. Precision targeting combined with EOG-style completions is now generating prolific premium level well performance. It's too early in our exploration efforts to know how much of the Austin Chalk is perspective of our acreage. The subsurface data and detailed mapping of the output field are encouraging. We plan to drill 7 additional Austin Chalk wells in 2016 and look forward to updating you with future drilling results as we learn more. In the Permian Delaware Basin, our recent activity has focused on the Wolfcamp oil window. Drilling the Wolfcamp generates excellent returns while allowing us to collect data on the shallower targets such as the Second Bone Spring Sand. During the first quarter, we completed a dozen wells with per well average 30-day rates over 2,100 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with approximately 70% well pad. The average lateral of these Wolfcamp wells is approximately 4,500 feet. Over the last year, we focused on increasing our understanding of the geology and maximizing well performance through better technologies such as precision targeting, high-density completions and better wellbore design. As a result, our wells are industry-leading as illustrated on Slide 8 on our investor presentation. Since January of last year, our wells have been twice as good as industry average in the Midland or Delaware Basin when normalized for lateral length. This is approach EOG takes across all our plays. We seek to first understand the geology; second, optimize the completions; and finally, enhance operational practices that maximize efficiencies and lower costs. 
Our next step for Wolfcamp optimization is to extend the lateral. Breakthroughs we made in wellbore design will allow us to apply EOG-style high-density completions to long Wolfcamp laterals. Longer laterals will enhance our highly successful Wolfcamp program and reduce our surface footprint across the play. In April, we drilled 2 7,000-foot laterals, the Rattlesnake 21 Fed Com 701H and 702H. These wells are too new to report at 30-day rate. However, the first 20 days of production are averaging more than 3,800 barrels of oil equivalent per day per well with maximum 24-hour rates at 4,200 barrels of oil equivalent per day per well. 
Meanwhile, we continue to further improve operational efficiencies and costs in the Wolfcamp. During the first quarter, drilling days decreased 14% from our 2015 average to 16.1 days. Also, total well cost decreased 8% to $6.9 million, more than offsetting costs associated with continued completion enhancements. In addition, in the second quarter, we'll begin using our brackish water supply for our New Mexico completions, with an anticipated saving of $150,000 per well. This new water supply, along with many other operational improvements, will allow EOG to continue lower cost and increased returns. On international front, we're very happy to report that our East Irish Sea Conwy project achieved first production in late March. We are currently addressing normal start-up items and running tests to determine the optimal production rate. Our full year guidance has been adjusted until we complete more testing. Here's Tim Driggers."

First, a brief word on our macro views and how they relate to EOG's plans. The substantial reduction in capital investment by the industry in 2015 and 2016 is causing oil supply to decline in many producing regions around the world. Led by steady declines in the U.S. and supported by strong gasoline demand, the market continues to rebalance. We agree with consensus that this process will accelerate in the second half of this year and into 2017. We believe that in the U.S., it will take a sustained $60 to $65 oil price and 12 months of lead time for the industry to deliver a modest level of growth. However, what is true for the industry in general does not hold for EOG. EOG is a low-cost U.S. horizontal oil producer. With our premium drilling inventory, we believe our reinvestment advantage is $15 to $20 per barrel lower than the average industry operator. When the market balances and prices recover to moderate levels, our leading asset quality, best-in-class technology and low-cost structure will become apparent with how quickly we can resume higher return oil growth.
And that may be the #1 question we received in the last 2 months. And or more accurately, at what price will you accelerate the -- and return to growth? Our first priority this year is to completely fund our capital program with cash flow and reduce net debt with property sales. We are in the late stages of negotiating on a number of deals and are confident we will be successful on many this year. We expect their collective impact will be meaningful. Our second priority will be to complete DUCs. We have managed our operations such that we have the capacity to add 40% more completions without adding any additional equipment from the service industry. We can respond quickly as supply and demand balance in oil prices firm. 
In summary, I would like to leave you with the following important takeaways from this call. Number one, our shift to premium drilling this year is a game-changer. We expect well productivity to improve more than 50% in 2016, which is the largest 1 year improvement in the history of the company. More importantly, this shift is permanent. Premium drilling will allow us to maintain a balanced capital program and resume high return oil growth in a moderate oil price environment. Number two, our enhanced oil recovery success is another example of EOG's ability to make significant technology gains. EOR has the potential to add meaningful long-term value to our Eagle Ford asset by adding low-decline, low-cost, high-return reserves. Number three, the new Austin Chalk results are encouraging for our South Texas acreage position. Time will tell, but we believe the chalk geology we discovered is substantially better and more repeatable than previous chalk drilling. Number four, last year, we said 2015 was a record year for improving the company. As we start this year, we are beginning to realize that improvements in 2016 may be even stronger than 2015. Our sustainable gains in technology and efficiencies are running at record-setting pace, and we are excited about what we can achieve in cost reduction and productivity improvements in 2016. Number five, our goal has always been to be the highest return E&P company in the U.S., and we believe we have achieved that goal. Our sites are now set on becoming one of the lowest-cost producers in the global oil market. We believe it's possible, and we are moving toward that target rapidly. Thanks for listening. And now, we'll go to Q&A."

And primarily, the pace of development in the future will depend on our pace of development primarily for the developing out the remaining leases and then how we roll that out. I would say that our pace of roll out, we expect to continue to announce new wells or bring new wells into that process in the coming years. And it will become a part of our overall capital allocation to the Eagle Ford that we do primarily each year. We roll out certainly our 2017 guidance on that probably in February. But we are very encouraged with our initial results. So it is probably a little bit too early to talk about how we're going to roll that out. We still have a lot to learn from our 32-well pilot.

And that really enhances the EOR effectiveness as we go forward. So we'll move along both of them at a nice steady pace. And we'll just continue to learn as we go forward.

So as we increased productivity through being able to identify better luck in this precision targeting and yet even better with our high-density frac techniques, we believe that the well productivity will continue to increase. That would be 1 way to convert. And then we also believe that we have sustainable cost reduction. So 2/3 of our cost reductions during the downturn have been through technology and efficiency gains. And we do not see any end in that. So we're quite confident that efficiency and technology will continue to drive those costs down. And so we believe a large percentage of the inventory that we have in the Eagle Ford will be converted to premium. And we also believe that in the Permian -- and we believe we'll add continued premium in the Bakken and other plays too.

So as Bill mentioned earlier that the primarily goal would be to go through and do at a full-scale development on each net release with the latest high-density completions. That's the number one goal. And the pace of development from that will dictate us to when we roll out the secondary or the EOR process. But typically, as we -- I think we have a slide in the deck, I think Slide 4 that shows that time frame will be somewhere in the first 2 to 5 years. So I think that would probably be our initial guide. There's really no detriment that we see as to -- if you wait too long to implement it, it's going to be detrimental. We think it's a great tool for just continuing to contact the remaining oil left in the reservoir. Certainly, economically, there'll not be an advantage to doing it earlier than later. But more importantly, the advance completions are driving probably incrementally more success to start with. So I don't know if that helps answer your question.

We do know that there are some areas that probably will be challenged to work economically. We -- but we are still early on that process and trying to determine how much of the acreage is applicable. We just don't know yet. Now the 32-well pattern is probably a good indication of maybe what we'll do look at in the future, will be subsets or leases that will dictate the size of how we develop it going forward. So maybe you got to think about it instead of the single well. It'll be groups of wells that will be implemented at onetime and not single wells. So we're kind of giving you some guidance on what we think the capital cost is, and we try to boil that down to a single well and so you kind of think about it and knowing that each lease will have different counts of well, maybe 12 to 20 wells on a given lease, say. And then the production profile, we've kind of given a king curve out there that maybe give you some insights and what the king curves might looks like. The production response from this is pretty unique in the sense of secondary recovery projects and that it's probably the only process that gives you such a rapid production response. You get a response in the first 3 months essentially, which is pretty fast. And then it holds pretty steady for a number of years. So that maybe -- and so that's probably about as much detail on how we see the -- how it would be rolled out. Again, the pace of development, I know it's adaptive model economically. The pace of development is purely this is going to be on the things we learn from this next pilot and then our development of existing units we've used in our high-density completions.

I think that's a part of it. First of all, we're early in the process. So you have to remember that our forecast started out with trying to model -- trying to use simulation models to max our history from the pilot projects and then forecast what the future production might be for these. So we haven't actually seen long-term production from a pilot over the number of years. It would take to demonstrate what the ultimate recovery is going to be. We're trying to model that with some simulation techniques. I would say that our challenged technically -- so we're working on some enhanced models to better understand what the long-term production will actually be. So I think we think we just need further clarification and tests from existing pilots that were -- and feature pilots to really now let down. And then you're right. I think the advantage of the completion. So we'll make a big difference. The new high-density completions we expect will respond better than some of the completions done several years ago. Our pilot projects to-date have been older stall completions in large parts. So we expect improvements to continue to improve. I think there's upside there."

EOG is becoming an even better company than it was just a year ago by lowering development and production costs and increasing returns. In yesterday's press release, we announced 2 exciting developments that have the potential to be significant additional drivers of higher returns and lower costs. I'll briefly highlight those, and Billy and David will provide details in a moment. Finally, I'll review our shift to premium drilling and how this shift is a game-changing event with significant long-term implications for EOG shareholders. 
First, I want to highlight EOG's development of the first successful enhanced oil recovery technology in U.S. horizontal shale. We initiated our EOR efforts in the Eagle Ford 3 years ago. Here's what we've learned since that time. Number one, geology matters. The Eagle Ford is unique. The same geologic characteristic that make the Eagle Ford prolific in primary development also make it unique for enhanced oil recovery. That EOR process we are using to produce incremental oil out of the Eagle Ford is not necessarily applicable to other horizontal basins. 
Number two, how you initially drill the field matters. Secondary recovery works best on leeched units that were developed using the best completions with optimal spacing. 
Finally, returns matter. We figured out how to execute EOR economically. The process can be implemented at rates of return that rival our premium drilling and significantly lower finding cost over time. 
The second item I will highlight is our discovery in the South Texas Austin Chalk. The term discovery is loaded, as many operators have been drilling the Chalk for years with varying degrees of success. Perhaps a more accurate characterization is that we discovered a new geologic concept in an existing play. Our team at EOG has cracked the code on how to make our particular footprint in the Austin Chalk a top-tier horizontal play, earning returns on par with the Eagle Ford, Permian and Bakken. The third item I would like to review is EOG's shift to premium drilling this year. This shift is a game-changer with significant long-term implications. I will cover those implications in a moment, but first, let's review what we mean by premium. 
Premium inventory is defined as drilling locations that generate at least 30% direct after-tax rate of return at $40 oil. Here's a few more clarifying points regarding this inventory. First, 30% return is not an average. It's a minimum. Second, 30% was established as the minimum direct return to ensure that when indirect costs are included, the drilling program earns healthy full cycle returns. Third, we fully expect to more than replace our drilling inventory with new premium locations every year. Therefore, this is the most -- and this is the most important point, our shift to premium is permanent and not simply a temporary high-grading process in a low commodity price environment. So 2016 will mark the point of time when EOG made a significant permanent shift in its drilling program. There are many long-term implications for that shift. The first is superior capital discipline. Premium drilling sets a new higher standard for capital allocation within the company. The second is a large capital efficiency gain. We do not need 50 rigs drilling thousands of wells per year. It will take far less capital to grow production at strong double-digit rates. The third implication is we can return to triple-digit direct rates of return with oil as low as $60 per barrel. And if history is any indication, we will continue to push the oil price needed for triple-digit returns even lower. And finally, premium drilling extends our lead as the low-cost horizontal oil producer. As I outlined, our permanent shift to premium drilling this year is a game-changing event for EOG. Yesterday's announcement regarding our enhanced oil recovery success in the Eagle Ford and our Austin Chalk drilling success are 2 more technical and operational achievements that will help us reach our long-term goal of being one of the lowest-cost producers in the global oil market. Now I'll turn it over to Billy Helms to discuss our exciting results from enhanced oil recovery in the Eagle Ford."

Three years ago, we initiated an effort to test EOR using gas injection in horizontal shale. Results from lab experiments indicated that the process was technically feasible, but the economics and operational execution were going to be challenged without some creative problem-solving. Our EOR team has not only solved the problem, they demonstrated returns that are competitive with our premium drilling program. The EOR process we developed is highly proprietary and this limits the amount of detail we are able to disclose. However, I will share several reasons why EOG is uniquely positioned to achieve a successful outcome. As Bill mentioned earlier, the geological setting is important. We have long discussed the competent barriers that encase the Eagle Ford and provide vertical containment for completions. This unique feature allows plays -- also plays a significant role in keeping the injection in contact with the targeted reservoir. The injected gas is thus able to become miscible with the oil in the reservoir and subsequently drive incremental oil recovery. EOG's acreage position is situated in the optimal thermal maturity of the play to maximize oil recovery. Being in the oil window has provided many benefits during the primary development, but it's also important for the EOR process. Acreage that is too far downdip or updip in the play may not benefit as greatly. The EOR economics are significantly enhanced by the scale out of EOG's footprint in the play. The infrastructure and facilities that are utilized during primary development across the field are key to being able to operationally execute the EOR process, thus providing a significant economic benefit. These reasons are the keys to the process's success and are why EOG -- why that we believe EOR will not be a blanket application across the Eagle Ford or necessarily applicable to other horizontal shale plays. We have not yet determined how much of EOG's acreage will benefit from EOR or what the overall resource potential may be. The 4 pilot projects have tested different geographic and geologic settings, each proving the concept successful. But further definition and time will be needed to assess the applicability and overall benefit across EOG's acreage position. 
Here are some of the key takeaways regarding the economics and recovery potential. One, this EOR technique is not capital-intensive. There is no incremental drilling required for capital cost to average approximately $1 million per well. Two, the operating costs are low. The process makes use of produced gas readily available to the field, and there are few other incremental operating costs. Three, EOR may have significant effect on our long-term Eagle Ford base production profile. Unlike typical secondary recovery projects, the production response occurs quickly within the first 2 or 3 months and holds steady for longer. Four, the combination of lower operating costs and steady production delivers a return profile that complements our primary drilling program. Primary drilling delivers high returns and short paybacks. Our EOR pilots have a much different profile, characterized by a modest upfront capital investment that delivers a long annuity of incremental oil production and strong cash flow. The rate of return is still on par with primary drilling. But for each dollar invested, EOR delivers at least twice the net present value created as primary drilling. Finally, our models indicate that this process will increase recovery by 30% to 70%. I want to emphasize these are incremental potential reserves, not accelerated production, delivering at -- delivered at potential finding cost of $6 per barrel of oil or less. We will conduct a fifth pilot in 2016, and we will evaluate the results and review our acreage. We will determine the long-term capital production and earnings effect of EOR. It's important to note that while this is a significant technical and economic breakthrough, drilling out this effort will take time, and it is dependent on the pace of primary developed drilling and field development. Now here is David Trice."

Another exciting development on our South Texas acreage position concerns the Austin Chalk.

Another exciting development on our South Texas acreage position concerns the Austin Chalk. In our press release yesterday, we published the results of 2 tremendous Austin Chalk wells, the Leonard AC Unit 101H produced an average of 2,715 barrels of oil equivalent per day for 30 days. The Denali Unit 101H was completed in April and its average production for the first 20 days was 3,130 barrels of oil equivalent per day. While the Austin Chalk is not a new play, historically, industry production has been inconsistent from well to well. While good wells are possible, the performance and resulting returns are highly variable across the play. However, using proprietary petrophysical analysis, we discovered how to apply new geologic concepts to the Austin Chalk and drill prolific wells consistently. Much like the Eagle Ford, the Chalk responds very well to EOG-style completions. Our high-density completions create complex fracture systems close to the wellbore, significantly improving well performance. Also like the Eagle Ford, the Austin Chalk benefits from the detailed work we conduct to determine the best target. The Chalk can be as thick as 140 feet in some areas, but our targeting efforts keep the drill bit confined to the best 20 to 30 feet of rock. Precision targeting, combined with EOG-style completions, is now generating prolific premium level well performance. It's too early in our exploration efforts to know how much of the Austin Chalk is prospective over our acreage, but subsurface data and detailed mapping throughout the field are encouraging. We plan to drill 7 additional Austin Chalk wells in 2016 and look forward to updating you with future drilling results as we learn more. In the Permian Delaware Basin, our recent activity has focused on the Wolfcamp oil window. Drilling the Wolfcamp generates excellent returns while allowing us to collect data on the shallower targets, such as the Second Bone Spring Sand. During the first quarter, we completed a dozen wells with per well average 30-day rates over 2,100 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with approximately 70% oil pet [ph]. The average lateral of these Wolfcamp wells is approximately 4,500 feet. Over the last year, we focused on increasing our understanding of the geology and maximizing well performance through better technologies such as precision targeting, high-density completions and better wellbore design. As a result, our wells are industry-leading, as illustrated on Slide 8 in our investor presentation. Since January of last year, our wells have been twice as good as industry average in the Midland or Delaware Basin when normalized for lateral length. This is the approach EOG takes across all our plays. We seek to first understand the geology; second, optimize the completions; and finally, enhance operational practices that maximize efficiencies and lower costs. 
Our next step for Wolfcamp optimization is to extend the lateral. Breakthroughs we made in wellbore design will allow us to apply EOG-style high-density completions to long Wolfcamp laterals. Longer laterals will enhance our highly successful Wolfcamp program and reduce our surface footprint across the play. In April, we drilled 2 7,000-foot laterals, the Rattlesnake 21 Fed Com 701H and 702H. These wells are too new to report a 30-day rate. However, the first 20 days of production are averaging more than 3,800 barrels of oil equivalent per day per well with maximum 24-hour rates at 4,200 barrels of oil equivalent per day per well. 
Meanwhile, we continue to further improve operational efficiencies and costs in the Wolfcamp. During the first quarter, drilling days decreased 14% from our 2015 average to 16.1 days. Also, total well cost decreased 8% to $6.9 million, more than offsetting costs associated with continued completion enhancements. In addition, in the second quarter, we'll begin using our brackish water supply for our New Mexico completions, with an anticipated saving of $150,000 per well. This new water supply, along with many other operational improvements, will allow EOG to continue to lower cost and increase returns. On the international front, we are very happy to report that our East Irish Sea Conwy project achieved first production in late March. We are currently addressing normal startup items and running tests to determine the optimal production rate. Our full year guidance has been adjusted until we complete more testing. Here's Tim Driggers."

First, a brief word on our macro views and how they relate to EOG's plans. The substantial reduction in capital investment by the industry in 2015 and 2016 is causing oil supply to decline in many producing regions around the world. Led by steady declines in the U.S. and supported by strong gasoline demand, the market continues to rebalance. We agree with consensus that this process will accelerate in the second half of this year and into 2017. We believe that in the U.S., it will take a sustained $60 to $65 oil price and 12 months of lead time for the industry to deliver a modest level of growth. However, what is true for the industry in general does not hold for EOG. EOG is a low-cost U.S. horizontal oil producer. With our premium drilling inventory, we believe our reinvestment advantage is $15 to $20 per barrel lower than the average industry operator. When the market balances and prices recover to moderate levels, our leading asset quality, best-in-class technology and low cost structure will become apparent with how quickly we can resume high-return oil growth.
And that may be the #1 question we received in the last 2 months. And or more accurately, at what price will you accelerate -- and return to growth? Our first priority this year is to completely fund our capital program with cash flow and reduce net debt with property sales. We are in the late stages of negotiating on a number of deals and are confident we will be successful on many this year. We expect their collective impact will be meaningful. Our second priority will be to complete DUCs. We have managed our operations such that we have the capacity to add 40% more completions without adding any additional equipment from the service industry. We can respond quickly as supply and demand balance and oil prices firm. 
In summary, I would like to leave you with the following important takeaways from this call. Number one, our shift to premium drilling this year is a game-changer. We expect well productivity to improve more than 50% in 2016, which is the largest 1-year improvement in the history of the company. More importantly, this shift is permanent. Premium drilling will allow us to maintain a balanced capital program and resume high-return oil growth in a moderate oil price environment. Number two, our enhanced oil recovery success is another example of EOG's ability to make significant technology gains. EOR has the potential to add meaningful long-term value to our Eagle Ford asset by adding low-decline, low-cost, high-return reserves. Number three, the new Austin Chalk results are encouraging for our South Texas acreage position. Time will tell, but we believe the Chalk geology we discovered is substantially better and more repeatable than previous Chalk drilling. Number four, last year we said 2015 was a record year for improving the company. As we start this year, we are beginning to realize that improvements in 2016 may be even stronger than 2015. Our sustainable gains in technology and efficiencies are running at record-setting pace, and we are excited about what we can achieve in cost reduction and productivity improvements in 2016. Number five, our goal has always been to be the highest-return E&P company in the U.S., and we believe we have achieved that goal. Our sights are now set on becoming one of the lowest-cost producers in the global oil market. We believe it's possible, and we are moving toward that target rapidly. Thanks for listening. And now, we'll go to Q&A."

We typically -- the governing part will mainly be, in actual field applications, will be around how we develop each pattern. So as Bill mentioned earlier, the primary goal would be to go through and do a full-scale development on each and every lease with the latest high-density completions. That's the number one goal. And the pace of development from that will dictate as to when we roll out the secondary or the EOR process. But typically, as we -- I think we have a slide in the deck, I think Slide 4, that shows that time frame will be somewhere in the first 2 to 5 years. So I think that would probably be our initial guide. There's really no detriment that we see as to -- if you wait too long to implement it, it's going to be detrimental. We think it's a great tool for just continuing to contact the remaining oil left in the reservoir. Certainly, economically, there might be an advantage to doing it earlier than later. But more importantly, the advance completions are driving probably incrementally more success to start with. So I don't know if that helps answer your question, but that -- I would say that it'll be somewhere in that first couple of years, 2, 3 years of development."

We do know that there are some areas that probably will be challenged to work economically. We -- but we are still early on in that process and trying to determine how much of the acreage is applicable, we just don't know yet. Now the 32-well pattern is probably a good indication of maybe what we'll look at in the future will be subsets or leases that will dictate the size of how we develop it going forward. So maybe you've got to think about it instead of a single well, it'll be groups of wells that will be implemented at one time and not single wells. So we've kind of given you some guidelines on what we think the capital cost is, and we try to boil that down to a single well, just so you kind of think about it and knowing that each lease will have different counts of well, maybe 12 to 20 wells on a given lease, say. And then the production profile, we've kind of given a cume curve out there that maybe give you some insights on what the cume curves might looks like. The production response from this is pretty unique in the sense of secondary recovery projects, in that it's probably the only process that gives you such a rapid production response. You get a response in the first 3 months, essentially, which is pretty fast. And then it holds pretty steady for a number of years. So that may be -- and so that's probably about as much detail on how we see the -- how it would be rolled out. Again, the pace of development, I know it's tough to model economically. The pace of development is purely just going to be on the things we learn from this next pilot and then our development of existing units we've used in our high-density completions. So we do expect this to increase. I would say we expect to increase the number of wells each year as we roll out the new budgets and it'll become an ever-increasing part of San Antonio's capital allocation."

EOG is becoming an even better company than it was just a year ago by lowering development and production costs and increasing returns. In yesterday's press release, we announced 2 exciting developments that have the potential to be significant additional drivers of higher returns and lower costs. I'll briefly highlight those, and Billy and David will provide details in a moment. Finally, I'll review our shift to premium drilling and how this shift is a game-changing event with significant long-term implications for EOG shareholders. 
First, I want to highlight EOG's development of the first successful enhanced oil recovery technology in U.S. horizontal shale. We initiated our EOR efforts in the Eagle Ford 3 years ago. Here's what we've learned since that time. Number one, geology matters. The Eagle Ford is unique. The same geologic characteristic that make the Eagle Ford prolific in primary development also make it unique for enhanced oil recovery. That EOR process we are using to produce incremental oil out of the Eagle Ford is not necessarily applicable to other horizontal basins. 
Number two, how you initially drill the field matters. Secondary recovery works best on leeched units that were developed using the best completions with optimal spacing. 
Finally, returns matter. We figured out how to execute EOR economically. The process can be implemented at rates of return that rival our premium drilling and significantly lower finding cost over time. 
The second item I will highlight is our discovery in the South Texas Austin Chalk. The term discovery is loaded, as many operators have been drilling the Chalk for years with varying degrees of success. Perhaps a more accurate characterization is that we discovered a new geologic concept in an existing play. Our team at EOG has cracked the code on how to make our particular footprint in the Austin Chalk a top-tier horizontal play, earning returns on par with the Eagle Ford, Permian and Bakken. The third item I would like to review is EOG's shift to premium drilling this year. This shift is a game-changer with significant long-term implications. I will cover those implications in a moment, but first, let's review what we mean by premium. 
Premium inventory is defined as drilling locations that generate at least 30% direct after-tax rate of return at $40 oil. Here's a few more clarifying points regarding this inventory. First, 30% return is not an average. It's a minimum. Second, 30% was established as the minimum direct return to ensure that when indirect costs are included, the drilling program earns healthy full cycle returns. Third, we fully expect to more than replace our drilling inventory with new premium locations every year. Therefore, this is the most -- and this is the most important point, our shift to premium is permanent and not simply a temporary high-grading process in a low commodity price environment. So 2016 will mark the point of time when EOG made a significant permanent shift in its drilling program. There are many long-term implications for that shift. The first is superior capital discipline. Premium drilling sets a new higher standard for capital allocation within the company. The second is a large capital efficiency gain. We do not need 50 rigs drilling thousands of wells per year. It will take far less capital to grow production at strong double-digit rates. The third implication is we can return to triple-digit direct rates of return with oil as low as $60 per barrel. And if history is any indication, we will continue to push the oil price needed for triple-digit returns even lower. And finally, premium drilling extends our lead as the low-cost horizontal oil producer. As I outlined, our permanent shift to premium drilling this year is a game-changing event for EOG. Yesterday's announcement regarding our enhanced oil recovery success in the Eagle Ford and our Austin Chalk drilling success are 2 more technical and operational achievements that will help us reach our long-term goal of being one of the lowest-cost producers in the global oil market. Now I'll turn it over to Billy Helms to discuss our exciting results from enhanced oil recovery in the Eagle Ford."

Three years ago, we initiated an effort to test EOR using gas injection in horizontal shale. Results from lab experiments indicated that the process was technically feasible, but the economics and operational execution were going to be challenged without some creative problem-solving. Our EOR team has not only solved the problem, they demonstrated returns that are competitive with our premium drilling program. The EOR process we developed is highly proprietary and this limits the amount of detail we are able to disclose. However, I will share several reasons why EOG is uniquely positioned to achieve a successful outcome. As Bill mentioned earlier, the geological setting is important. We have long discussed the competent barriers that encase the Eagle Ford and provide vertical containment for completions. This unique feature allows plays -- also plays a significant role in keeping the injection in contact with the targeted reservoir. The injected gas is thus able to become miscible with the oil in the reservoir and subsequently drive incremental oil recovery. EOG's acreage position is situated in the optimal thermal maturity of the play to maximize oil recovery. Being in the oil window has provided many benefits during the primary development, but it's also important for the EOR process. Acreage that is too far downdip or updip in the play may not benefit as greatly. The EOR economics are significantly enhanced by the scale out of EOG's footprint in the play. The infrastructure and facilities that are utilized during primary development across the field are key to being able to operationally execute the EOR process, thus providing a significant economic benefit. These reasons are the keys to the process's success and are why EOG -- why that we believe EOR will not be a blanket application across the Eagle Ford or necessarily applicable to other horizontal shale plays. We have not yet determined how much of EOG's acreage will benefit from EOR or what the overall resource potential may be. The 4 pilot projects have tested different geographic and geologic settings, each proving the concept successful. But further definition and time will be needed to assess the applicability and overall benefit across EOG's acreage position. 
Here are some of the key takeaways regarding the economics and recovery potential. One, this EOR technique is not capital-intensive. There is no incremental drilling required for capital cost to average approximately $1 million per well. Two, the operating costs are low. The process makes use of produced gas readily available to the field, and there are few other incremental operating costs. Three, EOR may have significant effect on our long-term Eagle Ford base production profile. Unlike typical secondary recovery projects, the production response occurs quickly within the first 2 or 3 months and holds steady for longer. Four, the combination of lower operating costs and steady production delivers a return profile that complements our primary drilling program. Primary drilling delivers high returns and short paybacks. Our EOR pilots have a much different profile, characterized by a modest upfront capital investment that delivers a long annuity of incremental oil production and strong cash flow. The rate of return is still on par with primary drilling. But for each dollar invested, EOR delivers at least twice the net present value created as primary drilling. Finally, our models indicate that this process will increase recovery by 30% to 70%. I want to emphasize these are incremental potential reserves, not accelerated production, delivering at -- delivered at potential finding cost of $6 per barrel of oil or less. We will conduct a fifth pilot in 2016, and we will evaluate the results and review our acreage. We will determine the long-term capital production and earnings effect of EOR. It's important to note that while this is a significant technical and economic breakthrough, drilling out this effort will take time, and it is dependent on the pace of primary developed drilling and field development. Now here is David Trice."

Another exciting development on our South Texas acreage position concerns the Austin Chalk. In our press release yesterday, we published the results of 2 tremendous Austin Chalk wells, the Leonard AC Unit 101H produced an average of 2,715 b",713,"Thanks, Billy. Another exciting development on our South Texas acreage position concerns the Austin Chalk. In our press release yesterday, we published the results of 2 tremendous Austin Chalk wells, the Leonard AC Unit 101H produced an average of 2,715 barrels of oil equivalent per day for 30 days. The Denali Unit 101H was completed in April and its average production for the first 20 days was 3,130 barrels of oil equivalent per day. While the Austin Chalk is not a new play, historically, industry production has been inconsistent from well to well. While good wells are possible, the performance and resulting returns are highly variable across the play. However, using proprietary petrophysical analysis, we discovered how to apply new geologic concepts to the Austin Chalk and drill prolific wells consistently. Much like the Eagle Ford, the Chalk responds very well to EOG-style completions. Our high-density completions create complex fracture systems close to the wellbore, significantly improving well performance. Also like the Eagle Ford, the Austin Chalk benefits from the detailed work we conduct to determine the best target. The Chalk can be as thick as 140 feet in some areas, but our targeting efforts keep the drill bit confined to the best 20 to 30 feet of rock. Precision targeting, combined with EOG-style completions, is now generating prolific premium level well performance. It's too early in our exploration efforts to know how much of the Austin Chalk is prospective over our acreage, but subsurface data and detailed mapping throughout the field are encouraging. We plan to drill 7 additional Austin Chalk wells in 2016 and look forward to updating you with future drilling results as we learn more. In the Permian Delaware Basin, our recent activity has focused on the Wolfcamp oil window. Drilling the Wolfcamp generates excellent returns while allowing us to collect data on the shallower targets, such as the Second Bone Spring Sand. During the first quarter, we completed a dozen wells with per well average 30-day rates over 2,100 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with approximately 70% oil pet [ph]. The average lateral of these Wolfcamp wells is approximately 4,500 feet. Over the last year, we focused on increasing our understanding of the geology and maximizing well performance through better technologies such as precision targeting, high-density completions and better wellbore design. As a result, our wells are industry-leading, as illustrated on Slide 8 in our investor presentation. Since January of last year, our wells have been twice as good as industry average in the Midland or Delaware Basin when normalized for lateral length. This is the approach EOG takes across all our plays. We seek to first understand the geology; second, optimize the completions; and finally, enhance operational practices that maximize efficiencies and lower costs. 
Our next step for Wolfcamp optimization is to extend the lateral. Breakthroughs we made in wellbore design will allow us to apply EOG-style high-density completions to long Wolfcamp laterals. Longer laterals will enhance our highly successful Wolfcamp program and reduce our surface footprint across the play. In April, we drilled 2 7,000-foot laterals, the Rattlesnake 21 Fed Com 701H and 702H. These wells are too new to report a 30-day rate. However, the first 20 days of production are averaging more than 3,800 barrels of oil equivalent per day per well with maximum 24-hour rates at 4,200 barrels of oil equivalent per day per well. 
Meanwhile, we continue to further improve operational efficiencies and costs in the Wolfcamp. During the first quarter, drilling days decreased 14% from our 2015 average to 16.1 days. Also, total well cost decreased 8% to $6.9 million, more than offsetting costs associated with continued completion enhancements. In addition, in the second quarter, we'll begin using our brackish water supply for our New Mexico completions, with an anticipated saving of $150,000 per well. This new water supply, along with many other operational improvements, will allow EOG to continue to lower cost and increase returns. On the international front, we are very happy to report that our East Irish Sea Conwy project achieved first production in late March. We are currently addressing normal startup items and running tests to determine the optimal production rate. Our full year guidance has been adjusted until we complete more testing. Here's Tim Driggers."

The substantial reduction in capital investment by the industry in 2015 and 2016 is causing oil supply to decline in many producing regions around the world. Led by st",596,"Thanks, Tim. First, a brief word on our macro views and how they relate to EOG's plans. The substantial reduction in capital investment by the industry in 2015 and 2016 is causing oil supply to decline in many producing regions around the world. Led by steady declines in the U.S. and supported by strong gasoline demand, the market continues to rebalance. We agree with consensus that this process will accelerate in the second half of this year and into 2017. We believe that in the U.S., it will take a sustained $60 to $65 oil price and 12 months of lead time for the industry to deliver a modest level of growth. However, what is true for the industry in general does not hold for EOG. EOG is a low-cost U.S. horizontal oil producer. With our premium drilling inventory, we believe our reinvestment advantage is $15 to $20 per barrel lower than the average industry operator. When the market balances and prices recover to moderate levels, our leading asset quality, best-in-class technology and low cost structure will become apparent with how quickly we can resume high-return oil growth.
And that may be the #1 question we received in the last 2 months. And or more accurately, at what price will you accelerate -- and return to growth? Our first priority this year is to completely fund our capital program with cash flow and reduce net debt with property sales. We are in the late stages of negotiating on a number of deals and are confident we will be successful on many this year. We expect their collective impact will be meaningful. Our second priority will be to complete DUCs. We have managed our operations such that we have the capacity to add 40% more completions without adding any additional equipment from the service industry. We can respond quickly as supply and demand balance and oil prices firm. 
In summary, I would like to leave you with the following important takeaways from this call. Number one, our shift to premium drilling this year is a game-changer. We expect well productivity to improve more than 50% in 2016, which is the largest 1-year improvement in the history of the company. More importantly, this shift is permanent. Premium drilling will allow us to maintain a balanced capital program and resume high-return oil growth in a moderate oil price environment. Number two, our enhanced oil recovery success is another example of EOG's ability to make significant technology gains. EOR has the potential to add meaningful long-term value to our Eagle Ford asset by adding low-decline, low-cost, high-return reserves. Number three, the new Austin Chalk results are encouraging for our South Texas acreage position. Time will tell, but we believe the Chalk geology we discovered is substantially better and more repeatable than previous Chalk drilling. Number four, last year we said 2015 was a record year for improving the company. As we start this year, we are beginning to realize that improvements in 2016 may be even stronger than 2015. Our sustainable gains in technology and efficiencies are running at record-setting pace, and we are excited about what we can achieve in cost reduction and productivity improvements in 2016. Number five, our goal has always been to be the highest-return E&P company in the U.S., and we believe we have achieved that goal. Our sights are now set on becoming one of the lowest-cost producers in the global oil market. We believe it's possible, and we are moving toward that target rapidly. Thanks for listening. And now, we'll go to Q&A."

And it will become a part of our overall capital allocation to the Eagle Ford that we do primarily each year, and we'll roll out, certainly, our 2017 guidance on that, probably in February.

That would be one way to convert. And then we also believe that we have sustainable cost reductions. So 2/3 of our cost reductions during the downturn have been through technology and efficiency gains. And we do not see any end in that. So we're quite confident that efficiency and technology will continue to drive those costs down. And so we believe a large percentage of the inventory that we have in the Eagle Ford will be converted to premium.

And the pace of development from that will dictate as to when we roll out the secondary or the EOR process. But typically, as we -- I think we have a slide in the deck, I think Slide 4, that shows that time frame will be somewhere in the first 2 to 5 years. So I think that would probably be our initial guide. There's really no detriment that we see as to -- if you wait too long to implement it, it's going to be detrimental. We think it's a great tool for just continuing to contact the remaining oil left in the reservoir. Certainly, economically, there might be an advantage to doing it earlier than later. But more importantly, the advance completions are driving probably incrementally more success to start with. So I don't know if that helps answer your question, but that -- I would say that it'll be somewhere in that first couple of years, 2, 3 years of development."

Yes, the second part of your question there, the extent of the acreage that might be applicable to this, honestly, we just don't know at this point. We do know that there are some areas that probably will be challenged to work economically. We -- but we are still early on in that process and trying to determine how much of the acreage is applicable, we just don't know yet. Now the 32-well pattern is probably a good indication of maybe what we'll look at in the future will be subsets or leases that will dictate the size of how we develop it going forward. So maybe you've got to think about it instead of a single well, it'll be groups of wells that will be implemented at one time and not single wells. So we've kind of given you some guidelines on what we think the capital cost is, and we try to boil that down to a single well, just so you kind of think about it and knowing that each lease will have different counts of well, maybe 12 to 20 wells on a given lease, say. And then the production profile, we've kind of given a cume curve out there that maybe give you some insights on what the cume curves might looks like. The production response from this is pretty unique in the sense of secondary recovery projects, in that it's probably the only process that gives you such a rapid production response. You get a response in the first 3 months, essentially, which is pretty fast. And then it holds pretty steady for a number of years. So that may be -- and so that's probably about as much detail on how we see the -- how it would be rolled out. Again, the pace of development, I know it's tough to model economically. The pace of development is purely just going to be on the things we learn from this next pilot and then our development of existing units we've used in our high-density completions. So we do expect this to increase. I would say we expect to increase the number of wells each year as we roll out the new budgets and it'll become an ever-increasing part of San Antonio's capital allocation."

So you have to remember that our forecast started out with trying to model -- trying to use simulation models to match our history from the pilot projects and then forecast what the future production might be from these. So we haven't actually seen long-term production from a pilot. Over the number of years it would take to demonstrate what the ultimate recovery is going to be, we're trying to model that with some simulation techniques. I would say that our challenge technically -- so we're working on some enhanced models to better understand what the long-term production will actually be. So I think we just need further clarification and tests from existing pilots that were -- and feature pilots to really nail that down. And then you're right. I think the vintage of the completion, so will make a big difference. The new high-density completions we expect will respond better than some of the completions done several years ago. Our pilot projects to-date have been older-style completions in large part, so we expect improvements to continue to improve. I think there's upside there."

269660,369549211,1026922,"EOG Resources, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2016",2016-08-05,"Earnings Calls","EOG Resources, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Dan. Good morning, everyone.

EOG goal during this downturn has been squarely focused on resetting the company to be successful at our low commodity price environment. We are focused on lower operational cost and achieving a strong return on capital invested in a $40 [ph] oil environment. Our goal is to continue to be the leader -- U.S. leader in investment returns and be competitive with the lowest-cost producers in the global oil market. 
On this call this morning, we have important updates that highlight significant progress towards reaching our goals. 
First, per unit lease operating costs decreased by 27% in the first half of 2016 versus 2015, and per unit cash operating cost in the first half are down 15% compared to full year 2015 and 30% below 2014 levels. Second, with outstanding capital efficiency gains, we exceeded the high end of our second quarter U.S. oil production target and worked on increasing our full year U.S. oil forecast by 2% without increasing CapEx guidance. Third, we have increased our premium inventory by 34% and increased our premium reserve potential by a whopping 75%. And fourth, we closed on $425 million of noncore property sales this year. Along with maintaining our strong balance sheet, we are upgrading our portfolio by investing in high return premium assets.  
As a reminder, our premium well as defined by an after-tax direct order return of at least 30% at $40 oil. We believe this metric makes EOG unique in the U.S. when it comes to quality of inventory and investment returns. There are a few additional points regarding this definition of premium that I want to be sure are very clear. Number one, 30% is a minimum return. This means the average return for premium drilling inventory is clearly higher; number two, 30% was selected as a minimum so that the fully-loaded investment, including all indirect cost, generates a healthy all-in corporate rate of return; number three, 30% at $40 oil is the premium benchmark regardless of what the prevailing market price for oil is. Meaning, if oil goes to $50 or $60, the returns quickly move into the triple digit range; finally, premium inventory is a return based metric. It can be achieved by cost reductions or productivity increases or a combination of both. Because our technical and efficiency gains are sustainable, we are confident that a large majority of our remaining inventory will be converted to premium over time. 
EOG shift to premium is a new chapter for the company. Premium drilling establishes a higher permanent standard for capital allocation and, therefore, will significantly increase capital productivity over time. This shift enables EOG to deliver high return, robust growth using far less capital at a far lower oil price, which leads me to another highlight from yesterday's press release; the 2020 growth outlook we provided. Due to the sustainable gains in well productivity and cost, we can grow oil production at a 10% compound annual growth rate at $50 oil. 
At $60 oil, our compound annual growth rate jumped to 20%. And most importantly, we can deliver that oil production growth [indiscernible] covering our capital expenditures and our dividend with cash flow, enabling us to meet our goal of maintaining strong balance sheet. As prices improve, we expect to incrementally reduce the net debt-to-capital ratio to our historical [indiscernible] of 30% or less by generating free cash flow and, to a lesser extent, through noncore property sales. While the shift to premium drilling has tremendous impact on EOG's returns, growth and capital productivity, the question remains, is this shift really permanent? In other words, can EOG continue to replace its premium inventory? And the answer is yes. The 3 ways we add premium inventory are conversion, exploration and acquisition. The first and most immediate way is through conversion. Conversion locations that were in the edge of a 30% [ph] total rate is the source of the 1,100 new premium locations we announced yesterday. Furthermore, we have much more inventory on the merger conversion. I am [indiscernible] lowering cost in most cases, both, we expect most of our current nonpremium inventory at the top basins to be converted to premium overtime. Improvements to well productivity and cost savings are ongoing and never-ending. In a moment, Billy Helms and David Trice will talk more about how productivity improvements, cost reductions and longer laterals will add to premium inventory
The second way we add premium inventory is through exploration. EOG is a leader in organic exploration growth because in our core, we are an exploration-driven company. In this lower commodity price environment, we have not stopped looking. With EOG's decentralized structure, we have 6 [ph] experienced exploration team for the U.S., generating new ideas with our client leases and developing new plays. EOG is a prospect-generating machine and our shift to premium has not slowed that effort down. In fact, it has enhanced the return hurdle by which new plays are evaluating. 
The third way we expect to add premium inventory is through targeted bolt-on acquisitions. Due to the current low commodity price environment, we are actively pursuing opportunities to capture top-tier acreage. We were successful in for such transactions in the Delaware Basin last year and are optimistic we can execute on more through this down cycle. And I'm confident we can return to premium level drilling in the year [ph] through conversion, exploration and acquisition. And as I said last quarter, this shift to premium drilling is a permanent and it's a game-changing event for EOG. 
Now I'll turn it over to Billy Helms to discuss Eagle Ford."
269660,369549211,1026922,"EOG Resources, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2016",2016-08-05,"Earnings Calls","EOG Resources, Inc.","Executives","As highlighted in the press release yesterday, we added 390 net locations to our Eagle Ford premium inventory. That's a 25% increase to our original estimate 6 [ph] months ago and takes the total premium well count in the Eagle Ford to almost 2,000 [ph] l",566,"As highlighted in the press release yesterday, we added 390 net locations to our Eagle Ford premium inventory. That's a 25% increase to our original estimate 6 [ph] months ago and takes the total premium well count in the Eagle Ford to almost 2,000 [ph] locations. 10,000 [ph] locations represents 10 years of premium, high-returned drilling. What's more, there are at least 2,000 [ph] more Eagle Ford locations that are on the verge of premium designation. 
To convert these locations, we only need to reduce current well cost by 10% or improve EURs by 10%.  Slide 11 of our investor presentation illustrates this. By making small, very attainable improvements, we can add another 10 years of premium high return Eagle Ford inventory from our existing acreage. I'm confident we will make this conversion over time. 
One of the ways we convert locations to premium is by drilling longer laterals. Our success in the Western Eagle Ford, as illustrated on Slide 9, is a good example. The trick with longer laterals is to maintain or preferably enhance productivity per foot of lateral. Due to the engineering breakthroughs and EOG's completion design, we have gone out as far as 2 miles with no degradation in productivity per foot. 
While longer laterals are one source of future premium inventory, 2 more significant sources will be EOG focus on performance improvement through advancing our technical understanding and lowering cost. On the technical side, geological and geophysical advancements enable us to refine our precision targeting efforts. For example, we are determining where there may be multiple Eagle Ford targets to support drilling and W pattern. We are also working to understand where the upper Eagle Ford is perspective. While the perspective area for the upper Eagle Ford is geographically limited, there are some sweet spots that may contribute premium well locations.  
Finally, as we discussed last quarter, we will be completing 7 additional Austin Chalk wells and continue to delineate the play and understand its full potential. 
On the cost side, we are finding creative ways to drive cost down further. We are drilling more wells per pad with  more efficient rigs designed for bad drilling. The rig design allows for simultaneous operations such as conducting drilling and cementing operations on multiple wells at the same time, reducing both time and cost. On the completion side, we continue to optimize propane schedules and stage links, reduce cost for items like sand and chemicals, while maintaining the EOG high-density completion process. Our continuing focus on every facet of our operations has allowed us to drop Eagle Ford total well cost another 11% year-to-date to $5.1 million. Also, we continue to be encouraged with our enhanced oil recovery for EOR projects. As a reminder, the process is highly economic and provides another way to create premium inventory. It not only increases the recovery, but also provides a means to flatten the field production decline. 
Finally, I'll draw your attention to Slide 23. We added another line to the chart representing 2016 [ph] year-to-date cumulative production. Year after year, we improve our well productivity in the Eagle Ford. Much of this year's increase can be attributed to our shift to premium drilling. However, as Slide 5 illustrates, just 60% of our 2016 drilling program is premium, so we expect to see this chart show improvement for many years to come. 
And here's David Trice."

Like the Eagle Ford, the Delaware Basin also added its premium drilling inventory. 520 net locations were added across all 3 plays, the Wolfcamp, Second Bone Spring and Leonard. The new premium total now stands at more than 1,700 locations.",736,"Thanks, Billy. Like the Eagle Ford, the Delaware Basin also added its premium drilling inventory. 520 net locations were added across all 3 plays, the Wolfcamp, Second Bone Spring and Leonard. The new premium total now stands at more than 1,700 locations. That's almost 20 years of premium high return drilling. In the Delaware Basin, the main driver of premium additions was improvement in well productivity through better targeting and completions. For example, Slide 7 of the investor presentation shows EOG's 2016 Wolfcamp oil wells produced more than 200,000 barrels equivalent on average on the first 180 days. That's a 17% increase in 180-day cumulative oil production over wells in our 2015 [ph] program. More importantly, it shows a 45% uplift over a typical 750 MBoe well, which is the gross per well EUR given our last Wolfcamp update. 
Finally, it's worth noting that the data in this chart is normalized for 4,500-foot laterals, meaning EOG's 4,500-foot laterals in the Delaware Basin are as good or better than 10,000-foot laterals in the Midland Basin. In addition to productivity gains, longer laterals in the Delaware Basin are another way we've added premium locations to the Wolfcamp as well as in the other 2 plays. Innovations made to wellbore design in the last 6 months allow us to grow longer [indiscernible] high-density completions so that we do not sacrifice long-term reserves. The new design will allow us to maintain higher recovery rates on the longer laterals while lowering costs and increasing returns. 16 gross Wolfcamp oil and combo wells were brought online in the second quarter with an average 30-day rate of more than 2,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day and an average lateral length of 6,500 feet. These are industry-leading Wolfcamp results regardless of operator or basin as shown on Slide 8 of our investor presentation. EOG's expecting to complete 70 [ph] Wolfcamp wells in 2016. 
While the effort in the last couple of years had clearly been focused on the Wolfcamp, we have been able to collect a tremendous amount of data on all of the shallower targets such as the Second Bone Spring and the Leonard Shale. Despite limited drilling this year, results in the Second Bone Spring have also been impressive. 90-day cumulative production has increased 27% over 2015 wells and 60% better than a typical 500 MBoe well. The Second Bone Spring tends to be more stratigraphically  complex, so additional data we collect from drilling Wolfcamp wells has aided in  much better targeting, longer laterals and more premium wells. We expect similar or better uplift to our Leonard shale result in a go-forward basis. 
In the Rockies, we've had great success in the Powder River Basin and Wyoming DJ Basin. As announced in our press release yesterday, we drilled 3 Turner wells last quarter that averaged almost 2,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, with [indiscernible] well cost which include drilling, completion and unleashed facilities averaged $5.4 million for a 6,500-foot laterals down from $6.5 million in 2015. These Turner wells are incredibly economic at $40 oil. We plan to drill a total of 20 net wells in the Turner this year. When we conducted our first count of premium inventory in December of last year, the DJ Basin Codell and Wyoming was slightly below the premium threshold. Due to sustainable cost reductions and better targeting, we added 200 premium locations in this play. Currently, Codell wells cost $5.9 million for a 9,400-foot lateral. As noted in our press release of today, our latest Codell well produced approximately 1,400 barrels of oil equivalent in the first 30 days. We expect cost and well improvements to continue and are working to expand gas take away options in Wyoming. The DJ Basin Codell will become a larger part of our premium drilling program in the near future. 
In East Irish Sea, I'm happy to report that Conway is currently producing approximately 10,000 barrels of oil per day. During the second quarter, Conway was down to the issues of the Douglas production platform. While Conway wells were initially tested at daily rates over more than 20,000 barrels of oil, results from recent production testing indicate the optimal level production is 10,000 barrels of oil per day. For the remainder of the year, we expect to average about 4,000 to 8,000 barrels of oil per day to accommodate further tests and potential downtime. 
Here's Tim Driggers."

Even though oil prices have been volatile, our yields supply demand fundamentals have not changed. We believe $40 oil will not provide enough cash flow or investment return to overcome the combined effect of production decline and demand growth worldwide. While EOG can deliver healthy  growth within cash flow in $50 oil, we continue to believe the U.S. horizontal oil industry as a whole needs a sustained $60 oil price and extended lead time to deliver a moderate level of growth. As we discussed last quarter, the sustainable reduction in capital -- the substantial reduction in capital investments by the industry since 2014 is causing oil supply to decline in many producing regions worldwide. As production continues to decline, the inventory overhang will slowly work off. The consensus view is the market will balance during 2017. 
For 2016, given the uncertainty of the covered commodity environment, we are maintaining our CapEx guidance at $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion. However, as a result of cost savings, we are increasing our well count to 250 drilled wells and 350 completed well. This is an additional 50 wells drilled and 80 completions above our original plan for the same CapEx. 
In summary, I would like to leave you with the following important takeaways on this call. Number one, we continue to reduce operating cost. We believe these reductions are sustainable and we have additional efforts underway for this future operational cost; number two, our shift to premium is achieving what we believe are the strongest investment returns at $40 oil in the U.S.; number three, our shift to premium is permanent. We are confident we can grow premium quality inventory much faster than we drilled; number four, we continue to exceed our U.S. production targets by increasing capital efficiency. We believe these efficiency gains are sustainable and give EOG a significant advantage as we enter the next recovery; and number five, we are maintaining our strong balance sheet through disciplined spending. 
I'll close this call with our view of EOG's future through 2020. There are 4 goals we plan to achieve. The first goal is to be the U.S. leader in the rate of return on capital investments; the second goal is to be the low-cost U.S. producer and, therefore, competitive in the global oil market; our third goal is to be the leader in Lower 48 absolute oil growth through 2020; and our fourth gold is to maintain a strong balance sheet through disciplined spending. BY achieving these 4 goals, we will accomplish our ultimate goal of creating long-term shareholder value, producing growth by consistently outstanding and drilling uneconomic wells is not an EOG's vocabulary. We firmly believe that growth should be the result of strong returns and disciplined spending. EOG's unwavering commitment to our long-term shareholders is the focus on returns first. The company is uniquely positioned to produce strong returns and higher return growth as commodity prices improve. Thanks for listening. And now we go to Q&A."

So if oil, say, with a $60 [ph] or $70 [ph] really quick, we could ramp up appropriately, but we wouldn't do it wait overnight. We couldn't do it overnight. We would have to build up the service quality and we would certainly want to maintain our efficiency that we've already built in. That's the one thing we don't want to do.

So as we get more data, even in a very mature area like the Eagle Ford, we get more data, we continue to find out more about the rock and the section and we're able to discriminate and pit better rock all the time. So it's an ongoing process even there. In the Delaware Basin, we're probably in the second and third innings there. There is so much potential pay there and we're still learning and we've got a lot of data to gather. As we drill the Delaware wells, we're focused on the Wolfcamp for 2 reasons. They're fantastic wells, but another, too, you'll get to see all the Bone Springs, Sands and all the place above you, and so you're gathering data as you drill these wells and that helps with delineating targets and working in the [indiscernible] out in mapping. So each one of the plays have a different stamp, a different position on improvements. But we think there's really a long way to go. We're not anywhere close to the end of being able to make additional improvements and even that side of the business or the cost side, too. So it's an ongoing process and it's a very sustainable process."

And then as through just all the primary efficiencies I've mentioned earlier, with us having the top rigs, we have quite a number of rigs in 2016 under contract placed a couple of years ago, high rates at just $26,000 to $27,000 a rig. Now those are rolling off and we'll be able to replace those, about half of those rigs were rigs that are in the $13,000 to $15,000 per day rate. So that allows drilling cost to be down around a 20% to 25%. Our tubulars, we've depleted our inventory here early 2017. And with the arrangements we have in place,  they'll allow those cost to go down in the 20% to 25%. With our sand, as I mentioned earlier, we've reduced our production cost, optimized the transportation, just all of those sorts of things will allow us to reduce sand cost by about 15%. Same with rigs, we have many of our frac leaves under long-term contract. Half of those are going away, which allow us to bring in the lower frac rates. We continue to improve those completion efficiency with faster completions, wireline downtimes, just our staged arrangements. Water infrastructure is continuing to be enhanced and it allows us to reduce our water cost. Our wellhead inventory is somewhat depleted and that will allow us to raise those costs into the 25% range. So all of this -- and that probably accounts to 50% to 60% of our well costs allows us to further reduce well cost going into 2017. Yes, we are still pleased with the vendor help service providers. They had -- we've got the top rigs, top frac equipment. It's a fast-changing technology, so we glad not to have ownership, but just to work and partner with the service providers to have outstanding service at competitive prices. They're not always the same providers, but they are the best and the most cost-effective in our arena. And the other thing is that our rig efficiency has improved such that yes, we do not have to have a number of rigs we have back in 2013 and '15. As a matter of fact, when we look at our 10% growth in the 20% growth, we think we'll be able to provide this sort of growth running somewhere between 25 to 35 rigs. The number of frac rates are required with the efficiency we're see you are going to be in the 15 to 20 frac fleets running for us. And that's only compact average growth with increased rates. By the time we get to 2020, we're talking, yes, that's the 35 rigs on the 20% growth. So yes, the downturn has allowed EOG just to enhance our overall operations. Our divisions are performing, specially oil, continuing to lower our costs. And during the ramp up, we would expect the same because if we look back and see what has been done by EOG in the period  that we are growing volumes 30% to 40%, we will continue lowering our well costs and improving our efficiencies. Now we expect our divisions to continue to do the same especially with all the [indiscernible] we have right now for further reduction."

Our goal is to continue to be the leader -- U.S. leader in investment returns and be competitive with the lowest-cost producers in the global oil market.
On this call this morning, we have important updates that highlight significant progress towards reaching our goals.
First, per-unit lease operating cost decreased by 27% in the first half of 2016 versus 2015, and per-unit cash operating cost in the first half are down 15% compared to full year 2015 and 30% below 2014 levels. 
Second, with outstanding capital efficiency gains, we exceeded the high end of our second quarter U.S. oil production target and we are increasing our full year U.S. oil forecast by 2% without increasing CapEx guidance. 
Third, we have increased our premium inventory by 34% and increased our premium reserve potential by a whopping 75%. 
And fourth, we closed on $425 million of noncore property sales this year. Along with maintaining our strong balance sheet, we are upgrading our portfolio by investing in high-return premium assets.
As a reminder, our premium well is defined by an after-tax direct rate of return of at least 30% at $40 oil. We believe this metric makes EOG unique in the U.S. when it comes to quality of inventory and investment returns. There are few additional points regarding this definition of premium that I want to be sure are very clear. Number one, 30% is a minimum return. This means the average return for our premium drilling inventory is clearly higher. Number two, 30% was selected as a minimum so that the fully-loaded investment, including all indirect costs, generates a healthy all-in corporate rate of return. Number three, 30% at $40 oil is the premium benchmark regardless of what the prevailing market price for oil is. Meaning, if oil goes to $50 or $60, the returns quickly move into the triple digit range. Finally, premium inventory is a return-based metric. It can be achieved by cost reductions or productivity increases or a combination of both. Because our technical and efficiency gains are sustainable, we are confident that a large majority of our remaining inventory will be converted to premium over time.
EOG shift to premium is a new chapter for the company. Premium drilling establishes a higher permanent standard for capital allocation and, therefore, will significantly increase capital productivity over time. This shift enables EOG to deliver high return, robust growth using far less capital at a far lower oil price, which leads me to another highlight from the yesterday's press release; the 2020 growth outlook we provided. Due to the sustainable gains in well productivity and costs, we can grow oil production at a 10% compound annual growth rate at $50 oil.
At $60 oil, our compound annual growth rate jumps to 20%. And most importantly, we can deliver that oil production growth while covering our capital expenditures and our dividend with cash flow, enabling us to meet our goal of maintaining a strong balance sheet. As prices improve, we expect to incrementally reduce the net debt-to-capital ratio to our historical norm of 30% or less by generating free cash flow and, to a lesser extent, through noncore property sales. While the shift to premium drilling has tremendous impact on EOG's returns, growth and capital productivity, the question remains, is this shift really permanent? In other words, can EOG continue to replace its premium inventory? And the answer is yes. The 3 ways we add premium inventory are conversion, exploration and acquisition. The first and most immediate way is through conversion. Conversion locations that were on the edge of the 30% total rate is the source of the 1,100 new premium locations we announced yesterday. Furthermore, we have much more inventory on the merger conversion. By including well productivity, our lowering costs in most cases, both, we expect much of our current nonpremium inventory in the top basins to be converted to premium over time. Improvements to the well productivity and cost savings are ongoing and never-ending. In a moment, Billy Helms and David Trice will talk more about how productivity improvements, cost reductions and longer laterals will add to premium inventory.
The second way we add premium inventory is through exploration. EOG is a leader in organic exploration growth, because in our core, we are an exploration-driven company. In this lower commodity price environment, we have not stopped looking. With EOG's decentralized structure, we have 6 experienced exploration teams in the U.S., generating new ideas, acquiring leases and developing new plays. EOG is a prospect-generating machine and our shift to premium has not slowed that effort down. In fact, it has enhanced the return hurdle by which new plays are evaluated.
The third way we expect to add premium inventory is through targeted bolt-on acquisitions. Due to the current low commodity price environment, we are actively pursuing opportunities to capture top-tier acreage. We were successful on 4 such transactions in the Delaware Basin last year and are optimistic we can execute on more through this down cycle. And I'm confident we can replace premium-level drilling end year to conversions, exploration and acquisitions. And as I said last quarter, this shift to premium drilling is a permanent and it's a game-changing event for EOG. 
Now I'll turn it over to Billy Helms to discuss Eagle Ford."

As highlighted in the press release yesterday, we added 390 net locations to our Eagle Ford premium inventory. That's a 25% increase to our original estimate 6 months ago and takes the total premium well count in the Eagle Ford to almost 2,0",565,"Thanks, Bill. As highlighted in the press release yesterday, we added 390 net locations to our Eagle Ford premium inventory. That's a 25% increase to our original estimate 6 months ago and takes the total premium well count in the Eagle Ford to almost 2,000 locations. 10,000 locations represents 10 years of premium high-return drilling. 
What's more, there are at least 2,000 more Eagle Ford locations that are on the verge of premium designation. To convert these locations, we only need to reduce current well cost by 10% or improve the EURs by 10%. Slide 11 of our investor presentation illustrates this. By making small, very attainable improvements, we can add another 10 years of premium high-return Eagle Ford inventory from our existing acreage. I'm confident we will make this conversion over time. 
One of the ways we convert locations to premium is by drilling longer laterals. Our success in the Western Eagle Ford, as illustrated on Slide 9, is a good example. The trick with longer laterals is to maintain or preferably enhance productivity per foot of lateral. Due to engineering breakthroughs and EOG's completion design, we have gone out as far as 2 miles with no degradation in productivity per foot.
While longer laterals would be one source of future premium inventory, 2 more significant sources will be EOG's focus on performance improvement through advancing our technical understanding and lowering cost. On the technical side, geological and geophysical advancements enable us to refine our precision targeting efforts. For example, we are determining where there may be multiple lower Eagle Ford targets to support drilling a W pattern. We are also working to understand where the upper Eagle Ford is perspective. While the perspective area for the upper Eagle Ford is geographically limited, there are some sweet spots that would -- may contribute premium well locations.
Finally, as we discussed last quarter, we will be completing 7 additional Austin Chalk wells and continue to delineate the play and understand its full potential.
On the cost side, we are finding creative ways to drive cost down further. We are drilling more wells per pad with more efficient rigs designed for pad drilling. The rig design allows for simultaneous operations such as conducting drilling and cementing operations on multiple wells at the same time, reducing both time and cost. 
On the completion side, we continue to optimize proppant schedules and stage lengths, reduce cost for items like sand and chemicals, while maintaining the EOG high-density completion process. Our continuing focus on every facet of our operations has allowed us to drop Eagle Ford total well cost another 11% year-to-date to $5.1 million. Also, we continue to be encouraged with our enhanced oil recovery or EOR projects. As a reminder, the process is highly economic and provides another way to create premium inventory. It not only increases the recovery, but also provides a means to flatten the field production decline.
Finally, I'll draw your attention to Slide 23. We added another line to the chart representing 2016 year-to-date cumulative production. Year-after-year, we improve our well productivity in the Eagle Ford. Much of this year's increase can be attributed to our shift to premium drilling. However, as Slide 5 illustrates, just 60% of our 2016 drilling program is premium, so we expect to see this chart show improvement for many years to come.
Now here is David Trice."
269660,369549211,1027432,"EOG Resources, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2016",2016-08-05,"Earnings Calls","EOG Resources, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Billy. Like the Eagle Ford, the Delaware Basin also added to its premium drilling inventory. 520 net locations were added across all 3 plays, the Wolfcamp, Second Bone Spring and Leonard. The new premium total now stands at more than 1,700 locatio",734,"Thanks, Billy. Like the Eagle Ford, the Delaware Basin also added to its premium drilling inventory. 520 net locations were added across all 3 plays, the Wolfcamp, Second Bone Spring and Leonard. The new premium total now stands at more than 1,700 locations. That's almost 20 years of premium high-return drilling. 
In the Delaware Basin, the main driver of premium additions was improvement in well productivity through better targeting and completions. For example, Slide 7 of the investor presentation shows EOG's 2016 Wolfcamp oil wells produced more than 200,000 barrels equivalent on average in the first 180 days. That's a 17% increase in 180-day cumulative oil production over wells in our 2015 program. More importantly, it shows a 45% uplift over a typical 750 MBoe well, which is the gross per well EUR given our last Wolfcamp update.
Finally, it's worth noting that the data in this chart is normalized to 4,500-foot laterals, meaning EOG's 4,500-foot laterals in the Delaware Basin are as good or better than 10,000-foot laterals in the Midland Basin. In addition to productivity gains, longer laterals in the Delaware Basin are another way we've added premium locations to the Wolfcamp as well as the other 2 parties. Innovations made to wellbore design in the last 6 months allow us to drill longer, but still applying high-density completions so that we do not sacrifice long-term reserves. The new design will allow us to maintain higher recovery rates on the longer laterals while lowering costs and increasing returns. 16 gross Wolfcamp oil and combo wells were brought online in the second quarter with an average 30-day rate of more than 2,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day and an average lateral length of 6,500 feet. These are industry-leading Wolfcamp results regardless of operator or basin as shown on Slide 8 of our investor presentation. EOG expects to complete 70 Wolfcamp wells in 2016.
While the effort in the last couple of years had clearly been focused on the Wolfcamp, we have been able to collect a tremendous amount of data on all of the shallower targets such as the Second Bone Spring and the Leonard Shale. Despite limited drilling this year, results in the Second Bone Spring have also been impressive. 90-day cumulative production has increased 27% over 2015 wells and 60% better than a typical 500 MBoe well. The Second Bone Spring tends to be more stratigraphically  complex, so additional data we collect from drilling Wolfcamp wells has aided in much better targeting in longer laterals and more premium wells. We expect similar or better uplift to our Leonard shale result on a go-forward basis.
In the Rockies, we've had great success in the Powder River Basin and Wyoming DJ Basin. As announced in our press release yesterday, we drilled 3 Turner wells last quarter that averaged almost 2,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and clear well costs which include drilling, completion and unleashed facilities averaged $5.4 million for a 6,500-foot laterals down from $6.5 million in 2015. These Turner wells are incredibly economic at $40 oil. We plan to drill a total of 20 net wells in the Turner this year. When we conducted our first count of premium inventory in December of last year, the DJ Basin Codell and Wyoming was slightly below the premium threshold. 
Due to sustainable cost reductions and better targeting, we added 200 premium locations in this play. Currently, Codell wells cost $5.9 million for a 9,400-foot lateral. As noted in our press release yesterday, our latest Codell well produced approximately 1,400 barrels of oil equivalent in first 30 days. We expect cost and well improvements to continue and are working to expand gas take away options in Wyoming. The DJ Basin Codell will become a larger part of our premium drilling program in the near future.
In East Irish Sea, I'm happy to report that Conway is currently producing approximately 10,000 barrels of oil per day. During the second quarter, Conway was down due to issues on the Douglas production platform. While Conway wells were initially tested at daily rate over more than 20,000 barrels of oil, results from recent production testing indicate the optimal level production is 10,000 barrels of oil per day. For the remainder of the year, we expect to average about 4,000 to 8,000 barrels of oil per day to accommodate further tests and potential downtime.
Here's Tim Driggers."

Even though oil prices have been volatile, our yield supply demand fundamentals has not changed. We believe $40 oil will not provide enough cash flow or investment return to overcome the combined effect of production decline and demand growth worldwide. While EOG can deliver healthy growth within cash flow at $50 oil, we continue to believe the U.S. horizontal oil industry as a whole needs a sustained $60 oil price and extended lead time to deliver a moderate level of growth. As we discussed last quarter, the sustainable reduction in capital -- the substantial reduction in capital investments by the industry since 2014 is causing oil supply to decline in many producing regions worldwide. As production continues to decline, the inventory overhang will slowly work off. The consensus view here is the market will balance during 2017.
For 2016, given the uncertainty of the current commodity environment, we are maintaining our CapEx guidance at $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion. However, as a result of cost savings, we are increasing our well count to 250 drilled wells and 350 completed wells. This is an additional 50 wells drilled and 80 completions above our original plan for the same CapEx.
In summary, I would like to leave you with the following important takeaways from this call. Number one, we continue to reduce operating costs. We believe these reductions are sustainable, and we have additional efforts underway to reduce future operational costs. Number two, our shift to premium is achieving what we believe are the strongest investment returns at $40 oil in the U.S. Number three, our shift to premium is permanent. We are confident we can grow premium quality inventory much faster than we drill it. Number four, we continue to exceed our U.S. production targets by increasing capital efficiency. We believe these efficiency gains are sustainable and give EOG a significant advantage as we enter the next recovery. And number five, we are maintaining our strong balance sheet through disciplined spending.
I'll close this call with our view of EOG's future through 2020. There are 4 goals we plan to achieve. The first goal is to be the U.S. leader in the rate of return on capital investments, the second goal is to be the low-cost U.S. producer and, therefore, competitive in the global oil market, our third goal is to be the leader in lower 48 absolute oil growth through 2020, and our fourth goal is to maintain a strong balance sheet through disciplined spending. By achieving these 4 goals, we will accomplish our ultimate goal of creating long-term shareholder value, producing growth by consistently outstanding and drilling uneconomic wells is not an EOG's vocabulary. We firmly believe that growth should be the result of strong returns and disciplined spending. EOG's unwavering commitment to our long-term shareholders is the focus on returns first. The company is uniquely positioned to produce strong returns and resume high-return growth as commodity prices improve. Thanks for listening. And now we go to Q&A."

And that is yes through just all the primary efficiencies I've mentioned earlier, with us having the top rigs. And you will notice that we have quite a number of our rigs in 2016 under contract placed couple of years ago, higher rates at just $26,000 to $27,000 a rig. Now those are rolling off, and we'll not be able to replace those. About half of those rigs were rigs that are in the $13,000 to $15,000 per day rate. So that allows drilling cost to be down about 20% to 25%. Our [indiscernible] , we depleted our inventory here early 2017. And with the arrangements we have in place, they'll allow those costs to go down in the 20% to 25%. With our sand, as I mentioned earlier, we've reduced our production cost, optimized the transportation, just all of those sorts of things would allow us to reduce sand cost by about 15%. Saying with rigs, we have many of our frac fleets under long-term contract. Half of those are going away, which allow us, again, to bring in the lower frac rates. We continue to improve those completion efficiency with faster completions, wireline downtimes, just our stage arrangements. The water infrastructure is continuing to be enhanced, and it allow us to reduce our water cost. Our wellhead inventory is somewhat depleted and that will allow us to raise those costs in the 25% range. So all of this -- and that probably accounts to 50% to 60% of our well costs allows us to further reduce well costs here going into 2017. Yes, we are still pleased with the vendor help service providers. They had -- we've got the top rigs, top frac equipment. It's a fast-changing technology, so we're glad not to have ownership, but just to work and partner with these service providers to have outstanding service at competitive prices. They're not always the same providers, but they are the best and the most cost-effective in our arena. And the other thing is that our rig efficiency has improved such that yes, we will not have to have the number of rigs we had back in 2013 and '15. As a matter of fact, when we look at our 10% growth and our 20% growth, we think we'll be able to provide this sort of growth running somewhere between 25 to 35 rigs. The number of frac fleets then required with the efficiency we're seeing are going to be in the 15 to 20 frac fleets running for us. And that's only compound average growth with increased rates. By the time we get to 2020, we're talking, yes, that's the 35 rigs on the 20% growth. So yes, the downturn has allowed EOG just to enhance our overall operations. Our divisions are performing, especially oil, continuing to lower our costs. And during the ramp up, we would expect the same because if we look back and see what has been done by EOG in the period that we're growing volumes 30% to 40%, we will continue lowering our well costs and improving our efficiencies. Now we expect our divisions to continue to do the same, especially with all the ideas we had now for further reduction."

269660,369549211,1027838,"EOG Resources, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2016",2016-08-05,"Earnings Calls","EOG Resources, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone. EOG's goal during this downturn has been squarely focused on resetting the company to be successful in a low commodity price environment. We are focused on lowering operational cost and achieving a strong return on cap",931,"Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone. EOG's goal during this downturn has been squarely focused on resetting the company to be successful in a low commodity price environment. We are focused on lowering operational cost and achieving a strong return on capital invested in a $40 oil environment. Our goal is to continue to be the leader -- U.S. leader in investment returns and be competitive with the lowest-cost producers in the global oil market.
On this call this morning, we have important updates that highlight significant progress towards reaching our goals.
First, per-unit lease operating cost decreased by 27% in the first half of 2016 versus 2015, and per-unit cash operating cost in the first half are down 15% compared to full year 2015 and 30% below 2014 levels. 
Second, with outstanding capital efficiency gains, we exceeded the high end of our second quarter U.S. oil production target and we are increasing our full year U.S. oil forecast by 2% without increasing CapEx guidance. 
Third, we have increased our premium inventory by 34% and increased our premium reserve potential by a whopping 75%. 
And fourth, we closed on $425 million of noncore property sales this year. Along with maintaining our strong balance sheet, we are upgrading our portfolio by investing in high-return premium assets.
As a reminder, our premium well is defined by an after-tax direct rate of return of at least 30% at $40 oil. We believe this metric makes EOG unique in the U.S. when it comes to quality of inventory and investment returns. There are few additional points regarding this definition of premium that I want to be sure are very clear. Number one, 30% is a minimum return. This means the average return for our premium drilling inventory is clearly higher. Number two, 30% was selected as a minimum so that the fully-loaded investment, including all indirect costs, generates a healthy all-in corporate rate of return. Number three, 30% at $40 oil is the premium benchmark regardless of what the prevailing market price for oil is. Meaning, if oil goes to $50 or $60, the returns quickly move into the triple digit range. Finally, premium inventory is a return-based metric. It can be achieved by cost reductions or productivity increases or a combination of both. Because our technical and efficiency gains are sustainable, we are confident that a large majority of our remaining inventory will be converted to premium over time.
EOG shift to premium is a new chapter for the company. Premium drilling establishes a higher permanent standard for capital allocation and, therefore, will significantly increase capital productivity over time. This shift enables EOG to deliver high return, robust growth using far less capital at a far lower oil price, which leads me to another highlight from the yesterday's press release; the 2020 growth outlook we provided. Due to the sustainable gains in well productivity and costs, we can grow oil production at a 10% compound annual growth rate at $50 oil.
At $60 oil, our compound annual growth rate jumps to 20%. And most importantly, we can deliver that oil production growth while covering our capital expenditures and our dividend with cash flow, enabling us to meet our goal of maintaining a strong balance sheet. As prices improve, we expect to incrementally reduce the net debt-to-capital ratio to our historical norm of 30% or less by generating free cash flow and, to a lesser extent, through noncore property sales. While the shift to premium drilling has tremendous impact on EOG's returns, growth and capital productivity, the question remains, is this shift really permanent? In other words, can EOG continue to replace its premium inventory? And the answer is yes. The 3 ways we add premium inventory are conversion, exploration and acquisition. The first and most immediate way is through conversion. Conversion locations that were on the edge of the 30% total rate is the source of the 1,100 new premium locations we announced yesterday. Furthermore, we have much more inventory on the merger conversion. By including well productivity, our lowering costs in most cases, both, we expect much of our current nonpremium inventory in the top basins to be converted to premium over time. Improvements to the well productivity and cost savings are ongoing and never-ending. In a moment, Billy Helms and David Trice will talk more about how productivity improvements, cost reductions and longer laterals will add to premium inventory.
The second way we add premium inventory is through exploration. EOG is a leader in organic exploration growth, because in our core, we are an exploration-driven company. In this lower commodity price environment, we have not stopped looking. With EOG's decentralized structure, we have 6 experienced exploration teams in the U.S., generating new ideas, acquiring leases and developing new plays. EOG is a prospect-generating machine and our shift to premium has not slowed that effort down. In fact, it has enhanced the return hurdle by which new plays are evaluated.
The third way we expect to add premium inventory is through targeted bolt-on acquisitions. Due to the current low commodity price environment, we are actively pursuing opportunities to capture top-tier acreage. We were successful on 4 such transactions in the Delaware Basin last year and are optimistic we can execute on more through this down cycle. And I'm confident we can replace premium-level drilling end year to conversions, exploration and acquisitions. And as I said last quarter, this shift to premium drilling is a permanent and it's a game-changing event for EOG. 
Now I'll turn it over to Billy Helms to discuss Eagle Ford."
269660,369549211,1027838,"EOG Resources, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2016",2016-08-05,"Earnings Calls","EOG Resources, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bill. As highlighted in the press release yesterday, we added 390 net locations to our Eagle Ford premium inventory. That's a 25% increase to our original estimate 6 months ago and takes the total premium well count in the Eagle Ford to almost 2,0",565,"Thanks, Bill. As highlighted in the press release yesterday, we added 390 net locations to our Eagle Ford premium inventory. That's a 25% increase to our original estimate 6 months ago and takes the total premium well count in the Eagle Ford to almost 2,000 locations. 10,000 locations represents 10 years of premium high-return drilling. 
What's more, there are at least 2,000 more Eagle Ford locations that are on the verge of premium designation. To convert these locations, we only need to reduce current well cost by 10% or improve the EURs by 10%. Slide 11 of our investor presentation illustrates this. By making small, very attainable improvements, we can add another 10 years of premium high-return Eagle Ford inventory from our existing acreage. I'm confident we will make this conversion over time. 
One of the ways we convert locations to premium is by drilling longer laterals. Our success in the Western Eagle Ford, as illustrated on Slide 9, is a good example. The trick with longer laterals is to maintain or preferably enhance productivity per foot of lateral. Due to engineering breakthroughs and EOG's completion design, we have gone out as far as 2 miles with no degradation in productivity per foot.
While longer laterals would be one source of future premium inventory, 2 more significant sources will be EOG's focus on performance improvement through advancing our technical understanding and lowering cost. On the technical side, geological and geophysical advancements enable us to refine our precision targeting efforts. For example, we are determining where there may be multiple lower Eagle Ford targets to support drilling a W pattern. We are also working to understand where the upper Eagle Ford is prospective. While the prospective area for the upper Eagle Ford is geographically limited, there are some sweet spots that would -- may contribute premium well locations.
Finally, as we discussed last quarter, we will be completing 7 additional Austin Chalk wells and continue to delineate the play and understand its full potential.
On the cost side, we are finding creative ways to drive cost down further. We are drilling more wells per pad with more efficient rigs designed for pad drilling. The rig design allows for simultaneous operations such as conducting drilling and cementing operations on multiple wells at the same time, reducing both time and cost. 
On the completion side, we continue to optimize proppant schedules and stage lengths, reduce cost for items like sand and chemicals, while maintaining the EOG high-density completion process. Our continuing focus on every facet of our operations has allowed us to drop Eagle Ford total well cost another 11% year-to-date to $5.1 million. Also, we continue to be encouraged with our enhanced oil recovery or EOR projects. As a reminder, the process is highly economic and provides another way to create premium inventory. It not only increases the recovery, but also provides a means to flatten the field production decline.
Finally, I'll draw your attention to Slide 23. We added another line to the chart representing 2016 year-to-date cumulative production. Year-after-year, we improve our well productivity in the Eagle Ford. Much of this year's increase can be attributed to our shift to premium drilling. However, as Slide 5 illustrates, just 60% of our 2016 drilling program is premium, so we expect to see this chart show improvement for many years to come.
Now here is David Trice."

Like the Eagle Ford, the Delaware Basin also added to its premium drilling inventory. 520 net locations were added across all 3 plays, the Wolfcamp, Second Bone Spring and Leonard. The new premium total now stands at more than 1,700 locations. That's almost 20 years of premium high-return drilling. 
In the Delaware Basin, the main driver of premium additions was improvement in well productivity through better targeting and completions. For example, Slide 7 of the investor presentation shows EOG's 2016 Wolfcamp oil wells produced more than 200,000 barrels equivalent on average in the first 180 days. That's a 17% increase in 180-day cumulative oil production over wells in our 2015 program. More importantly, it shows a 45% uplift over a typical 750 MBoe well, which is the gross per well EUR given our last Wolfcamp update.
Finally, it's worth noting that the data in this chart is normalized to 4,500-foot laterals, meaning EOG's 4,500-foot laterals in the Delaware Basin are as good or better than 10,000-foot laterals in the Midland Basin. In addition to productivity gains, longer laterals in the Delaware Basin are another way we've added premium locations to the Wolfcamp as well as the other 2 parties. Innovations made to wellbore design in the last 6 months allow us to drill longer, but still applying high-density completions so that we do not sacrifice long-term reserves. The new design will allow us to maintain higher recovery rates on the longer laterals while lowering costs and increasing returns. 16 gross Wolfcamp oil and combo wells were brought online in the second quarter with an average 30-day rate of more than 2,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day and an average lateral length of 6,500 feet. These are industry-leading Wolfcamp results regardless of operator or basin as shown on Slide 8 of our investor presentation. EOG expects to complete 70 Wolfcamp wells in 2016.
While the effort in the last couple of years had clearly been focused on the Wolfcamp, we have been able to collect a tremendous amount of data on all of the shallower targets such as the Second Bone Spring and the Leonard Shale. Despite limited drilling this year, results in the Second Bone Spring have also been impressive. 90-day cumulative production has increased 27% over 2015 wells and 60% better than a typical 500 MBoe well. The Second Bone Spring tends to be more stratigraphically  complex, so additional data we collect from drilling Wolfcamp wells has aided in much better targeting in longer laterals and more premium wells. We expect similar or better uplift to our Leonard shale result on a go-forward basis.
In the Rockies, we've had great success in the Powder River Basin and Wyoming DJ Basin. As announced in our press release yesterday, we drilled 3 Turner wells last quarter that averaged almost 2,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and clear well costs which include drilling, completion and unleashed facilities averaged $5.4 million for a 6,500-foot laterals down from $6.5 million in 2015. These Turner wells are incredibly economic at $40 oil. We plan to drill a total of 20 net wells in the Turner this year. When we conducted our first count of premium inventory in December of last year, the DJ Basin Codell in Wyoming was slightly below the premium threshold. 
Due to sustainable cost reductions and better targeting, we added 200 premium locations in this play. Currently, Codell wells cost $5.9 million for a 9,400-foot lateral. As noted in our press release yesterday, our latest Codell well produced approximately 1,400 barrels of oil equivalent in first 30 days. We expect cost and well improvements to continue and are working to expand gas take away options in Wyoming. The DJ Basin Codell will become a larger part of our premium drilling program in the near future.
In East Irish Sea, I'm happy to report that Conway is currently producing approximately 10,000 barrels of oil per day. During the second quarter, Conway was down due to issues on the Douglas production platform. While Conway wells were initially tested at daily rate over more than 20,000 barrels of oil, results from recent production testing indicate the optimal level production is 10,000 barrels of oil per day. For the remainder of the year, we expect to average about 4,000 to 8,000 barrels of oil per day to accommodate further tests and potential downtime.
Here's Tim Driggers."

Even though oil prices have been volatile, our yield supply demand fundamentals has not changed. We believe $40 oil will not provide enough cash flow or investment return to overcome the combined effect of production decline and demand growth worldwide. While EOG can deliver healthy growth within cash flow at $50 oil, we continue to believe the U.S. horizontal oil industry as a whole needs a sustained $60 oil price and extended lead time to deliver a moderate level of growth. As we discussed last quarter, the sustainable reduction in capital -- the substantial reduction in capital investments by the industry since 2014 is causing oil supply to decline in many producing regions worldwide. As production continues to decline, the inventory overhang will slowly work off. The consensus view here is the market will balance during 2017.
For 2016, given the uncertainty of the current commodity environment, we are maintaining our CapEx guidance at $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion. However, as a result of cost savings, we are increasing our well count to 250 drilled wells and 350 completed wells. This is an additional 50 wells drilled and 80 completions above our original plan for the same CapEx.
In summary, I would like to leave you with the following important takeaways from this call. Number one, we continue to reduce operating costs. We believe these reductions are sustainable, and we have additional efforts underway to reduce future operational costs. Number two, our shift to premium is achieving what we believe are the strongest investment returns at $40 oil in the U.S. Number three, our shift to premium is permanent. We are confident we can grow premium quality inventory much faster than we drill it. Number four, we continue to exceed our U.S. production targets by increasing capital efficiency. We believe these efficiency gains are sustainable and give EOG a significant advantage as we enter the next recovery. And number five, we are maintaining our strong balance sheet through disciplined spending.
I'll close this call with our view of EOG's future through 2020. There are 4 goals we plan to achieve. The first goal is to be the U.S. leader in the rate of return on capital investments, the second goal is to be the low-cost U.S. producer and, therefore, competitive in the global oil market, our third goal is to be the leader in lower 48 absolute oil growth through 2020, and our fourth goal is to maintain a strong balance sheet through disciplined spending. By achieving these 4 goals, we will accomplish our ultimate goal of creating long-term shareholder value, producing growth by consistently outstanding and drilling uneconomic wells is not an EOG's vocabulary. We firmly believe that growth should be the result of strong returns and disciplined spending. EOG's unwavering commitment to our long-term shareholders is the focus on returns first. The company is uniquely positioned to produce strong returns and resume high-return growth as commodity prices improve. Thanks for listening. And now we go to Q&A."

But at one day, we would be able to get our capital efficiency to a point where we could actually grow oil at $40, and we're working towards that goal. We're not there quite at the moment, but we're going to continue to focus on that. But our focus, of course, first has always been on returns and capital discipline and keeping the company healthy in that regard."

And that is yes through just all the primary efficiencies I've mentioned earlier, with us having the top rigs. And you will note too that we had quite a number of our rigs in 2016 under contract placed couple of years ago, higher rates at just $26,000 to $27,000 a rig. Now those are rolling off, and we're going to be able to replace those. About half of those rigs with rigs that are in the $13,000 to $15,000 per day rate. So that allows drilling costs to be down about 20% to 25%. Our [indiscernible] , we depleted our inventory here early 2017. And with the arrangements we have in place, they'll allow those costs to go down in the 20% to 25%. With our sand, as I mentioned earlier, we've reduced our production costs, optimized the transportation, just all of those sorts of things would allow us to reduce sand cost by about 15%. Sae with rigs, we have many of our frac fleets under long-term contract. Half of those are going away, which allows us, again, to bring in the lower frac rates. We continue to improve those completion efficiency with faster completions, wireline downtimes, just our stage arrangements. The water infrastructure is continuing to be enhanced, and it allow us to reduce our water cost. Our wellhead inventory, it's somewhat depleted and that will allow us to raise those costs in the 25% range. So all of this -- and that probably accounts to 50% to 60% of our well costs, allows us to further reduce well costs here going into 2017. Yes, we are still pleased with the vendor help service providers. They had -- we've got the top rigs, top frac equipment. It's a fast-changing technology, so we're glad not to have ownership, but just to work and partner with these service providers to have outstanding service at competitive prices. They're not always the same providers, but they are the best and the most cost-effective in our arena. And the other thing is that our rig efficiency has improved such that yes, we will not have to have the number of rigs we had back in 2013 and '15. As a matter of fact, when we look at our 10% growth and our 20% growth, we think we'll be able to provide this sort of growth running somewhere between 25 to 35 rigs. The number of frac fleets, then required with the efficiency we're seeing are going to be in the 15 to 20 frac fleets running for us. And that's only compound average growth with increased rates. By the time we get to 2020, we're talking, yes, that's the 35 rigs on the 20% growth. So yes, the downturn has allowed EOG just to enhance our overall operations. Our divisions are performing, especially oil, continuing to lower our costs. And during the ramp up, we would expect the same because if we look back and see what has been done by EOG in the period that we were growing volumes 30% to 40%, we were continually lowering our well costs and improving our efficiencies. Now we expect our divisions to continue to do the same, especially with all the ideas we had now for further reduction."

269660,369549211,1028290,"EOG Resources, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2016",2016-08-05,"Earnings Calls","EOG Resources, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone. EOG's goal during this downturn has been squarely focused on resetting the company to be successful in a low commodity price environment. We are focused on lowering operational cost and achieving a strong return on cap",931,"Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone. EOG's goal during this downturn has been squarely focused on resetting the company to be successful in a low commodity price environment. We are focused on lowering operational cost and achieving a strong return on capital invested in a $40 oil environment. Our goal is to continue to be the leader -- U.S. leader in investment returns and be competitive with the lowest-cost producers in the global oil market.
On this call this morning, we have important updates that highlight significant progress towards reaching our goals.
First, per-unit lease operating cost decreased by 27% in the first half of 2016 versus 2015, and per-unit cash operating cost in the first half are down 15% compared to full year 2015 and 30% below 2014 levels. 
Second, with outstanding capital efficiency gains, we exceeded the high end of our second quarter U.S. oil production target and we are increasing our full year U.S. oil forecast by 2% without increasing CapEx guidance. 
Third, we have increased our premium inventory by 34% and increased our premium reserve potential by a whopping 75%. 
And fourth, we closed on $425 million of noncore property sales this year. Along with maintaining our strong balance sheet, we are upgrading our portfolio by investing in high-return premium assets.
As a reminder, our premium well is defined by an after-tax direct rate of return of at least 30% at $40 oil. We believe this metric makes EOG unique in the U.S. when it comes to quality of inventory and investment returns. There are few additional points regarding this definition of premium that I want to be sure are very clear. Number one, 30% is a minimum return. This means the average return for our premium drilling inventory is clearly higher. Number two, 30% was selected as a minimum so that the fully-loaded investment, including all indirect costs, generates a healthy all-in corporate rate of return. Number three, 30% at $40 oil is the premium benchmark regardless of what the prevailing market price for oil is. Meaning, if oil goes to $50 or $60, the returns quickly move into the triple digit range. Finally, premium inventory is a return-based metric. It can be achieved by cost reductions or productivity increases or a combination of both. Because our technical and efficiency gains are sustainable, we are confident that a large majority of our remaining inventory will be converted to premium over time.
EOG shift to premium is a new chapter for the company. Premium drilling establishes a higher permanent standard for capital allocation and, therefore, will significantly increase capital productivity over time. This shift enables EOG to deliver high return, robust growth using far less capital at a far lower oil price, which leads me to another highlight from the yesterday's press release; the 2020 growth outlook we provided. Due to the sustainable gains in well productivity and costs, we can grow oil production at a 10% compound annual growth rate at $50 oil.
At $60 oil, our compound annual growth rate jumps to 20%. And most importantly, we can deliver that oil production growth while covering our capital expenditures and our dividend with cash flow, enabling us to meet our goal of maintaining a strong balance sheet. As prices improve, we expect to incrementally reduce the net debt-to-capital ratio to our historical norm of 30% or less by generating free cash flow and, to a lesser extent, through noncore property sales. While the shift to premium drilling has tremendous impact on EOG's returns, growth and capital productivity, the question remains, is this shift really permanent? In other words, can EOG continue to replace its premium inventory? And the answer is yes. The 3 ways we add premium inventory are conversion, exploration and acquisition. The first and most immediate way is through conversion. Conversion locations that were on the edge of the 30% total rate is the source of the 1,100 new premium locations we announced yesterday. Furthermore, we have much more inventory on the merger conversion. By including well productivity, our lowering costs in most cases, both, we expect much of our current nonpremium inventory in the top basins to be converted to premium over time. Improvements to the well productivity and cost savings are ongoing and never-ending. In a moment, Billy Helms and David Trice will talk more about how productivity improvements, cost reductions and longer laterals will add to premium inventory.
The second way we add premium inventory is through exploration. EOG is a leader in organic exploration growth, because in our core, we are an exploration-driven company. In this lower commodity price environment, we have not stopped looking. With EOG's decentralized structure, we have 6 experienced exploration teams in the U.S., generating new ideas, acquiring leases and developing new plays. EOG is a prospect-generating machine and our shift to premium has not slowed that effort down. In fact, it has enhanced the return hurdle by which new plays are evaluated.
The third way we expect to add premium inventory is through targeted bolt-on acquisitions. Due to the current low commodity price environment, we are actively pursuing opportunities to capture top-tier acreage. We were successful on 4 such transactions in the Delaware Basin last year and are optimistic we can execute on more through this down cycle. And I'm confident we can replace premium-level drilling end year to conversions, exploration and acquisitions. And as I said last quarter, this shift to premium drilling is a permanent and it's a game-changing event for EOG. 
Now I'll turn it over to Billy Helms to discuss Eagle Ford."
269660,369549211,1028290,"EOG Resources, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2016",2016-08-05,"Earnings Calls","EOG Resources, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bill. As highlighted in the press release yesterday, we added 390 net locations to our Eagle Ford premium inventory. That's a 25% increase to our original estimate 6 months ago and takes the total premium well count in the Eagle Ford to almost 2,0",565,"Thanks, Bill. As highlighted in the press release yesterday, we added 390 net locations to our Eagle Ford premium inventory. That's a 25% increase to our original estimate 6 months ago and takes the total premium well count in the Eagle Ford to almost 2,000 locations. 10,000 locations represents 10 years of premium high-return drilling. 
What's more, there are at least 2,000 more Eagle Ford locations that are on the verge of premium designation. To convert these locations, we only need to reduce current well cost by 10% or improve the EURs by 10%. Slide 11 of our investor presentation illustrates this. By making small, very attainable improvements, we can add another 10 years of premium high-return Eagle Ford inventory from our existing acreage. I'm confident we will make this conversion over time. 
One of the ways we convert locations to premium is by drilling longer laterals. Our success in the Western Eagle Ford, as illustrated on Slide 9, is a good example. The trick with longer laterals is to maintain or preferably enhance productivity per foot of lateral. Due to engineering breakthroughs and EOG's completion design, we have gone out as far as 2 miles with no degradation in productivity per foot.
While longer laterals would be one source of future premium inventory, 2 more significant sources will be EOG's focus on performance improvement through advancing our technical understanding and lowering cost. On the technical side, geological and geophysical advancements enable us to refine our precision targeting efforts. For example, we are determining where there may be multiple lower Eagle Ford targets to support drilling a W pattern. We are also working to understand where the upper Eagle Ford is prospective. While the prospective area for the upper Eagle Ford is geographically limited, there are some sweet spots that would -- may contribute premium well locations.
Finally, as we discussed last quarter, we will be completing 7 additional Austin Chalk wells and continue to delineate the play and understand its full potential.
On the cost side, we are finding creative ways to drive cost down further. We are drilling more wells per pad with more efficient rigs designed for pad drilling. The rig design allows for simultaneous operations such as conducting drilling and cementing operations on multiple wells at the same time, reducing both time and cost. 
On the completion side, we continue to optimize proppant schedules and stage lengths, reduce cost for items like sand and chemicals, while maintaining the EOG high-density completion process. Our continuing focus on every facet of our operations has allowed us to drop Eagle Ford total well cost another 11% year-to-date to $5.1 million. Also, we continue to be encouraged with our enhanced oil recovery or EOR projects. As a reminder, the process is highly economic and provides another way to create premium inventory. It not only increases the recovery, but also provides a means to flatten the field production decline.
Finally, I'll draw your attention to Slide 23. We added another line to the chart representing 2016 year-to-date cumulative production. Year-after-year, we improve our well productivity in the Eagle Ford. Much of this year's increase can be attributed to our shift to premium drilling. However, as Slide 5 illustrates, just 60% of our 2016 drilling program is premium, so we expect to see this chart show improvement for many years to come.
Now here is David Trice."
269660,369549211,1028290,"EOG Resources, Inc., Q2 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 05, 2016",2016-08-05,"Earnings Calls","EOG Resources, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Billy. Like the Eagle Ford, the Delaware Basin also added to its premium drilling inventory. 520 net locations were added across all 3 plays, the Wolfcamp, Second Bone Spring and Leonard. The new premium total now stands at more than 1,700 locatio",734,"Thanks, Billy. Like the Eagle Ford, the Delaware Basin also added to its premium drilling inventory. 520 net locations were added across all 3 plays, the Wolfcamp, Second Bone Spring and Leonard. The new premium total now stands at more than 1,700 locations. That's almost 20 years of premium high-return drilling. 
In the Delaware Basin, the main driver of premium additions was improvement in well productivity through better targeting and completions. For example, Slide 7 of the investor presentation shows EOG's 2016 Wolfcamp oil wells produced more than 200,000 barrels equivalent on average in the first 180 days. That's a 17% increase in 180-day cumulative oil production over wells in our 2015 program. More importantly, it shows a 45% uplift over a typical 750 MBoe well, which is the gross per well EUR given our last Wolfcamp update.
Finally, it's worth noting that the data in this chart is normalized to 4,500-foot laterals, meaning EOG's 4,500-foot laterals in the Delaware Basin are as good or better than 10,000-foot laterals in the Midland Basin. In addition to productivity gains, longer laterals in the Delaware Basin are another way we've added premium locations to the Wolfcamp as well as the other 2 parties. Innovations made to wellbore design in the last 6 months allow us to drill longer, but still applying high-density completions so that we do not sacrifice long-term reserves. The new design will allow us to maintain higher recovery rates on the longer laterals while lowering costs and increasing returns. 16 gross Wolfcamp oil and combo wells were brought online in the second quarter with an average 30-day rate of more than 2,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day and an average lateral length of 6,500 feet. These are industry-leading Wolfcamp results regardless of operator or basin as shown on Slide 8 of our investor presentation. EOG expects to complete 70 Wolfcamp wells in 2016.
While the effort in the last couple of years had clearly been focused on the Wolfcamp, we have been able to collect a tremendous amount of data on all of the shallower targets such as the Second Bone Spring and the Leonard Shale. Despite limited drilling this year, results in the Second Bone Spring have also been impressive. 90-day cumulative production has increased 27% over 2015 wells and 60% better than a typical 500 MBoe well. The Second Bone Spring tends to be more stratigraphically  complex, so additional data we collect from drilling Wolfcamp wells has aided in much better targeting in longer laterals and more premium wells. We expect similar or better uplift to our Leonard shale result on a go-forward basis.
In the Rockies, we've had great success in the Powder River Basin and Wyoming DJ Basin. As announced in our press release yesterday, we drilled 3 Turner wells last quarter that averaged almost 2,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day and clear well costs which include drilling, completion and unleashed facilities averaged $5.4 million for a 6,500-foot laterals down from $6.5 million in 2015. These Turner wells are incredibly economic at $40 oil. We plan to drill a total of 20 net wells in the Turner this year. When we conducted our first count of premium inventory in December of last year, the DJ Basin Codell in Wyoming was slightly below the premium threshold. 
Due to sustainable cost reductions and better targeting, we added 200 premium locations in this play. Currently, Codell wells cost $5.9 million for a 9,400-foot lateral. As noted in our press release yesterday, our latest Codell well produced approximately 1,400 barrels of oil equivalent in first 30 days. We expect cost and well improvements to continue and are working to expand gas take away options in Wyoming. The DJ Basin Codell will become a larger part of our premium drilling program in the near future.
In East Irish Sea, I'm happy to report that Conway is currently producing approximately 10,000 barrels of oil per day. During the second quarter, Conway was down due to issues on the Douglas production platform. While Conway wells were initially tested at daily rate over more than 20,000 barrels of oil, results from recent production testing indicate the optimal level production is 10,000 barrels of oil per day. For the remainder of the year, we expect to average about 4,000 to 8,000 barrels of oil per day to accommodate further tests and potential downtime.
Here's Tim Driggers."

Even though oil prices have been volatile, our yield supply demand fundamentals has not changed. We believe $40 oil will not provide enough cash flow or investment return to overcome the combined effect of production decline and demand growth worldwide. While EOG can deliver healthy growth within cash flow at $50 oil, we continue to believe the U.S. horizontal oil industry as a whole needs a sustained $60 oil price and extended lead time to deliver a moderate level of growth. As we discussed last quarter, the sustainable reduction in capital -- the substantial reduction in capital investments by the industry since 2014 is causing oil supply to decline in many producing regions worldwide. As production continues to decline, the inventory overhang will slowly work off. The consensus view here is the market will balance during 2017.
For 2016, given the uncertainty of the current commodity environment, we are maintaining our CapEx guidance at $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion. However, as a result of cost savings, we are increasing our well count to 250 drilled wells and 350 completed wells. This is an additional 50 wells drilled and 80 completions above our original plan for the same CapEx.
In summary, I would like to leave you with the following important takeaways from this call. Number one, we continue to reduce operating costs. We believe these reductions are sustainable, and we have additional efforts underway to reduce future operational costs. Number two, our shift to premium is achieving what we believe are the strongest investment returns at $40 oil in the U.S. Number three, our shift to premium is permanent. We are confident we can grow premium quality inventory much faster than we drill it. Number four, we continue to exceed our U.S. production targets by increasing capital efficiency. We believe these efficiency gains are sustainable and give EOG a significant advantage as we enter the next recovery. And number five, we are maintaining our strong balance sheet through disciplined spending.
I'll close this call with our view of EOG's future through 2020. There are 4 goals we plan to achieve. The first goal is to be the U.S. leader in the rate of return on capital investments, the second goal is to be the low-cost U.S. producer and, therefore, competitive in the global oil market, our third goal is to be the leader in lower 48 absolute oil growth through 2020, and our fourth goal is to maintain a strong balance sheet through disciplined spending. By achieving these 4 goals, we will accomplish our ultimate goal of creating long-term shareholder value, producing growth by consistently outstanding and drilling uneconomic wells is not an EOG's vocabulary. We firmly believe that growth should be the result of strong returns and disciplined spending. EOG's unwavering commitment to our long-term shareholders is the focus on returns first.

And that is yes through just all the primary efficiencies I've mentioned earlier, with us having the top rigs. And you will note too that we had quite a number of our rigs in 2016 under contract placed couple of years ago, higher rates at just $26,000 to $27,000 a rig. Now those are rolling off, and we're going to be able to replace those. About half of those rigs with rigs that are in the $13,000 to $15,000 per day rate. So that allows drilling costs to be down about 20% to 25%. Our [indiscernible] , we depleted our inventory here early 2017. And with the arrangements we have in place, they'll allow those costs to go down in the 20% to 25%. With our sand, as I mentioned earlier, we've reduced our production costs, optimized the transportation, just all of those sorts of things would allow us to reduce sand cost by about 15%. Same with rigs, we have many of our frac fleets under long-term contract. Half of those are going away, which allows us, again, to bring in the lower frac rates. We continue to improve those completion efficiency with faster completions, wireline downtimes, just our stage arrangements. The water infrastructure is continuing to be enhanced, and it allow us to reduce our water cost. Our wellhead inventory, it's somewhat depleted and that will allow us to raise those costs in the 25% range. So all of this -- and that probably accounts to 50% to 60% of our well costs, allows us to further reduce well costs here going into 2017. Yes, we are still pleased with the vendor help service providers. They had -- we've got the top rigs, top frac equipment. It's a fast-changing technology, so we're glad not to have ownership, but just to work and partner with these service providers to have outstanding service at competitive prices. They're not always the same providers, but they are the best and the most cost-effective in our arena. And the other thing is that our rig efficiency has improved such that yes, we will not have to have the number of rigs we had back in 2013 and '15. As a matter of fact, when we look at our 10% growth and our 20% growth, we think we'll be able to provide this sort of growth running somewhere between 25 to 35 rigs. The number of frac fleets, then required with the efficiency we're seeing are going to be in the 15 to 20 frac fleets running for us. And that's only compound average growth with increased rates. By the time we get to 2020, we're talking, yes, that's the 35 rigs on the 20% growth. So yes, the downturn has allowed EOG just to enhance our overall operations. Our divisions are performing, especially oil, continuing to lower our costs. And during the ramp up, we would expect the same because if we look back and see what has been done by EOG in the period that we were growing volumes 30% to 40%, we were continually lowering our well costs and improving our efficiencies. Now we expect our divisions to continue to do the same, especially with all the ideas we had now for further reduction."

In 2016, we increased well productivity and lowered well and operating cost at a record pace. The company projects our all-in return on the 26 [ph] capital program will have a company record and we achieved this in one of the lowest commodity price environments we've experienced in a long time. Our tremendous success improving capital return this year combined with the addition of the Yates acreage [indiscernible] the company resource potential in both size and quality at a record pace. As a result, we reset the company to deliver high return oil growth within cash flow in a $50 oil environment. This lead us as unique to the industry. In this price environment, our ability to generate higher capital rates of return and achieve strong double-digit oil growth with a balanced CapEx to cash flow program sets EOG apart as the industry leader in capital efficiency. In early 2016, the talented teams working each play across EOG identified 3,200 locations representing 2 billion barrels of oil equivalent reserve potential. That net and new rate of return standard we designated premium. To meet the premium standard, a well has to earn a minimum of 30% direct after-tax rate of return at $40 oil. The process of first defining premium, and second, identifying inventory, was to ensure that during 2016, year 2 of the downturn, we did not spend a single dollar drilling uneconomic wells. What we didn't anticipate about the new premium standard is the fire it would light under each of the teams working EOG's plays across the company. Since it's early [ph] 2016, we've converted more than 1,000 additional locations to premium on our existing acreage. The Yates merger added another 1,700 premium locations. Our premium resource potential now totals more than 5 billion [ph] barrels of oil equivalent in 6,000 locations. That's more than double the resource potential and almost double the locations from the start of 2016. More impressively, when you do the math of those numbers, you see that net reserve per well in our premium inventory went from 625 MBoe at the start of the year to 850 [ph] MBoe today. We're not only adding more premium inventory, but productivity of that inventory is growing. 
Another important factor in improving capital efficiency has been the 29% of reduction in cash operating unit cost and over $1 billion in annual operating savings compared to 2014. For the third quarter in a row, we have lowered our operating expense forecast for the year. Over the last number of years, EOG has consistently added locations faster than we drill them. Over the next number of years, we fully expect to do the same with our premium locations. We stated at the beginning of the year that EOG's shift to premium was permanent. Our performance this year should leave little doubt about EOG's ability to execute that shift. 
Before I hand it over to Billy Helms to review the Delaware Basin, I want to discuss the other big news in the press release last night, our updated 2020 outlook. We' introduced 2017 through 2020 outlook last quarter of 10% compounded annual growth rate at $50 oil, increasing the 20% at $60 oil. We provided this long-term framework for the reasons I just mentioned. Our premium inventory is growing in size and quality, and we expect to replace it faster than we drill it. With continued capital efficiency gains, we're increasing our 2017 to 2020 CAGR outlook by 5%. At $50 to $60 oil, we are now capable of growing a compounded 15% to 25% annually. Given the size of our base production today, that growth is remarkable. Also remarkable is that we can deliver that growth and the dividend within cash flow. It's important to note that our 2020 outlook excludes growth throughout our large high quality diversified portfolio of place. As discussed in the opening remarks, our organizational structure and cutting-edge culture are driving new technology advancements, cost reductions and exploration efforts across the company at a record pace. Our 2020 outlook envisions high return growth from the Eagle Ford, Rockies, Bakken and Permian. Additionally, we continue to work on other emerging exploration plays and expect it will become a material part of our future. EOG is a resilient company. Our unique culture continues to produce sustainable gains in capital productivity and generate years of high-quality drilling potential. We are a leader in capturing high-quality acreage in the best horizontal oil plays in the U.S. And the Yates transaction is just the latest example of EOG's ability to add high return growth potential. 
Now I will turn it over to Billy Helms to update the Delaware Basin results."
269660,404423810,1073992,"EOG Resources, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2016",2016-11-04,"Earnings Calls","EOG Resources, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bill. 2016 is turning out to be a tremendous year for EOG the Delaware Basin that can be highlighted in a couple of ways.

As illust",868,"Thanks, Bill. 2016 is turning out to be a tremendous year for EOG the Delaware Basin that can be highlighted in a couple of ways. First, our Permian teams progressed, delivering increased well performance and cost reduction has been outstanding. As illustrated on Slide 11, EOG continues to deliver exceptional industry-leading well productivity. This outperformance was accomplished in multiple ways, which I will discuss in more detail in a moment. 
Second, with the combination of technology gains, cost reductions and the Yates transaction, we increased the Delaware Basin's resource potential by 155%, bringing the new total to a massive 6 billion barrels of oil equivalent from 6,300 net drilling locations. The increase is 3.7 billion barrels of oil equivalent larger than our total announced just 1 year ago on the third quarter call. Now as the resource potential has been further defined, our efforts will focus on converting the identified locations to premium. Approximately 55% of the 6,300 locations are currently premium, and we are confident that the majority of the nonpremium locations will be converted over time. 
There are 2 ways to convert the inventory. One is by increasing well productivity through technology. This is our precision targeting process and improved completion techniques. Two is through lowering cost, both capital cost as well as operating expenses. Just like the Eagle Ford, we are confident that our premium inventory and the Delaware Basin will continue to increase over time. 
As we have discussed in the past, the Delaware Basin is a large, very complex geological basin. Our first step entering new play is to focus our exploration team with understanding the details of the rock characteristics and then acquire our acreage position in areas that exhibit high quality rock potential. The majority of the acreage acquired in the Yates transaction demonstrates strong geologic characteristics and complements EOG's existing acreage position. The added acreage inventory will allow us to trade and block up acreage to provide opportunities for longer laterals and more efficient use of infrastructure. Blocking up acreage will, over time, continue to drive down operating costs and convert the existing location inventory to premium status. Most of the increase in the resource estimate is from the Wolfcamp. Our new estimate of total resource potential is 2.9 billion [ph] barrels of oil equivalent. This represents 123% increase to the previous estimate of 1.3 billion barrels. The well inventory increased by 500 locations, but more impressively, the average lateral length increased by 60% over 7,000 feet. We are steadily increasing the last the length of our laterals but more importantly, maintaining our focus on targeting and completion effectiveness do not diminish the productivityper, foot of lateral. We have previously subdivided the Wolfcamp into an oil window, where the production is more than 50% oil; and a Combo play, where the production is a balanced mix of oil, natural gas and NGLs. 
In addition, we have tested multiple targeted goals within each zone. The resource estimate uses the confirmed test results from the different test of intervals in both the oil window and the Combo play, but in general, can be summarized as including at least 1 productive interval across our acreage with well spacing averaging 660 feet between wells in the oil window and 880 feet between wells in the Combo play. 
A few highlights in the third quarter are from 2 660-foot spacing patterns, one with 2 wells and the other with 4 wells, both in the upper Wolfcamp. The 2 well pattern have average 30-day production over 3,000 BOEs per day with 2,100 barrels of oil per day per well. Both were drilled using short laterals averaging 4,500 feet. The 4-well pattern had average 30-day production over 2,800 BOEs per day with 1,900 barrels of oil per day per well. These wells were drilled using about 3,900-foot laterals. Similar to the other resource plays, we continue to test pattern spacing and evaluate the optimal development plan for each area. 
In the Second Bone Spring, we updated our research potential estimate from 500 million barrels of oil equivalent to 1.4 billion barrels, another massive increase that is almost 3x our estimate from a year ago. The H acreage added about-- half the increase, with the remainder due to targeting and technology driving tremendous efficiencies. While the Leonard, also known as the Avalon, is the most material of our Delaware Basin plays. We have had minimal activity in 2016. Based on longer-term production performance and a detailed assessment of drilling locations, we now estimate that the Leonard resource potential is 1.7 billion barrels of oil equivalent as compared to our previous estimate of 550 million barrels. 
Finally, we do not expect to convert the majority -- we not only expect to convert the majority of the existing 6,300 locations to premium. We anticipate discovering new sources of premium drilling as we test additional areas and identify new target intervals within this geologically complex basin. We are still in the early innings of the Delaware Basin and are excited about the future. EOG's Delaware Basin potential is rapidly improving in both size and productivity and adds to EOG's portfolio of U.S. unconventional assets and unique drill story.

In the third quarter, we drilled and completed 4,700 wells for a remarkable $4.6 million [ph] per well. Well costs are being driven lower for all the reasons we mentioned on our last call. More efficient rig operations are driving drilling days down to less than 6 days a well. Completions are also getting more efficient. In 2014, we were completing 600 feet of laterals per day. During this downturn, we've taken a harder look at completion operations and logistics and are now completing wells 66% faster at almost 1,000 feet per day. At the same time, we continue to enhance the effectiveness of our completions as shown on Slide 28. 
Additionally, Eagle Ford well performance continues to grow even as we push wells closer together. During the third quarter, we completed a set of 5 infill wells, down spaced to 200 feet that were some of our best performing wells for the quarter. The core unit 10H through 14H averaged over 2,000 barrels of oil per day per well for the first 30 days on production. We have been drilling the Eagle Ford going on 7 years and we still have so much to learn in this world-class play. Also in the Eagle Ford, our enhanced oil recovery projects or EOR is progressing on schedule. We competed the initial phase of the 32-well pilot, our largest to date. We look forward to having results to share with you sometime in 2017. 
In the Rockies, we continue to get excellent results from the Turner Sand in the Powder River Basin. Our drilling program there is delivering consistent premium level returns and we're looking forward to expanding activity there next year. The 9 wells we drilled in the third quarter are producing on average almost 1,600 BOEs per day for the first 30 days or drilled in under 6 days and have a total well cost of just $4.9 million normalized to a 6,500-foot lateral. In addition, the decline in rates are relatively low so on average, the wells produced almost 100,000 BOE per well in 90 days. The average lateral length in the third quarter was short at just 4,100 feet. We expect to move to a longer 2-mile wells, particularly now that the Yates transaction blocks up much of our existing acreage in the sweet spot of the play. Longer laterals will enhance economics similar to what we realized in other plays and is particularly helpful with respect to surface permitting efficiencies in the Powder River Basin. Precision targeting has allowed us to convert the Turner into a premium play. We use advanced techniques to identify, map and steer our wells in the narrow 15-foot window. We are able to accomplish this even while we continue to push the envelope on drilling speed. We plan to complete a total of 35 net wells in the Turner this year. 
Here's Gary Thomas."

EOG's operational performance in 2016 in terms of cost and efficiency gains has been one of the best in company history.

EOG's operational performance in 2016 in terms of cost and efficiency gains has been one of the best in company history. In addition to making huge improvements in well productivity, we have driven so much cost and time out of our operations that we significantly increased the number of wells we are drilling and completing. EOG will now drill approximately 90 [ph] more wells and complete 80 [ph] more wells than was originally forecasted for 2016, while only increasing our development capital by $200 million. As a result, our fourth quarter domestic oil production before the addition of Yates is forecasted to be 36,000 barrels of oil per day above our forecast at the start of the year. That's an amazing accomplishment and a testament to the tremendous capital efficiency gains we've made this year. When we add Yates and international volumes, we expect that EOG's oil exit rate will be near the company's all-time high set in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
Now let's talk about cost reduction and efficiency gains. Since 2014, EOG's drilling days and total well cost in our large Eagle Ford, Bakken and Wolfcamp plays are down 25% to 45%. Another measure of our drilling efficiency is the number of wells drilled per rig per year, which increased 40% in our top 3 plays. For example, in the Eagle Ford, we we're drilling 32 wells per rig year. On the operating side, we've reduced cash unit costs 29%, and 2016 LOE alone has come down almost $0.5 billion compared to 2014. While the major driver of cost reductions has been efficiency gains, we're also benefiting from approximately half of our high-cost drilling and completion contracts being replaced with rates that are 40% lower. In addition, tubular and wellhead costs will come down 25% with our 2017 arrangements. 
The market is speculating about service cost increases and how they will impact the industry. For EOG, due to our integrated operations, current arrangements and continued efficiency gains, we're well insulated. At the minimum, we expect to at least [indiscernible] well cost flat in 2017. Our teams continue to make significant efficiency gains. EOG's rate of return culture and our large-scale sweet spot positions in the best North American reserve play facilities continual improvement across all cost categories. 
And now for a word on DUCs. Our cost savings and additional $200 million of capital will allow EOG to complete almost all the DUCs we have in inventory at the beginning of the year. The rate of return on additional capital is very strong, and as I noted earlier, it allows us to exit the year with oil production on an upswing at near record rates and will get EOG off to a great start in 2017. We will end 2016 with approximately 140 uncompleted wells, a normal level of working inventory. 
EOG thrives during downturns due to our strength as a low-cost operator. Our strategy of low debt, living within cash flow and focusing on returns has allowed us to be one of the few companies that has preserved our balance sheet without diluting our shareholders by raising equity to pay down debt. Furthermore, we are in the best cost in inventory position I've seen in my near 40 years with the company. Our 2020 outlook is testament to that. We accomplished this through our permanent shift to premium drilling and a widespread focus on cost control. We are all familiar with our extensive inventory of premium locations. However, as COO, I am most proud of the highly integrated efforts of our team to deliver sustainable cost reduction. They're doing an outstanding job. We are committed to maintaining this focus, and we are uniquely positioned for the future.

Over the long term, we believe oil in the 40s [ph] will not sustain enough production to meet demand worldwide. While EOG can deliver strong growth within cash flow with $50 oil, we believe the U.S. industry as a whole needs sustained $60 oil prices and extended lead time to provide a moderate level of growth. The worldwide decline rates are slowing -- slowly reducing supply, and the consensus view is the current large inventory overhang could return to normal levels by late 2017. We plan to issue official guidance for 2017 along with our year-end results early next year. Our overarching goal in 2017 is to build momentum off the foundation of premium inventory EOG established in 2016. As Gary explained, we are completing 180 more wells than previously forecasted, so we are exiting 2016 with strong oil production, and we will complete a higher percentage of premium wells in 2017 versus 2016. After 2 years of this downcycle, we are more than ready to resume high return oil growth. 
EOG's vision for 2017 through 2020 can be summed up with 4 goals: Be the leader in return on capital employed; be the U.S. leader in oil growth; be one of the lowest-cost producers in global oil markets; and remain committed to safety in the environment.

And by drilling it first, it also allows us to take a look at the shallower objectives as we drill down through those. So it gives us a better idea of long-term potential and how the drilling program in those place will develop. In the future, the second part of your question is about pad drilling. We are continuing to develop pad drilling as we develop the field now, and that will continue as we add the shallower zones as well.

269660,404423810,1074337,"EOG Resources, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2016",2016-11-04,"Earnings Calls","EOG Resources, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone. EOG has responded to the downturn in oil prices with an unrelenting focus on capital returns. In 2016, we increased well productivity and lowered well and operating costs at a record pace. The company projects our all-",795,"Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone. EOG has responded to the downturn in oil prices with an unrelenting focus on capital returns. In 2016, we increased well productivity and lowered well and operating costs at a record pace. The company projects our all-in return on the 26th capital program will set a company record, and we achieved this in one of the lowest commodity price environments we've experienced in a long time. Our tremendous success improving capital return this year combined with the addition of the Yates acreage increased the company resource potential in both size and quality at a record pace. As a result, we reset the company to deliver high-return oil growth within cash flow in a $50 oil environment. We believes this is unique to the industry. In this price environment, our ability to generate higher capital rates of return and achieve strong double-digit oil growth with a balanced CapEx to cash flow program sets EOG apart as the industry leader in capital efficiency. 
In early 2016, the talented teams working each play across EOG identified 3,200 locations, representing 2 billion barrels of oil equivalent reserve potential. That met a new rate of return standard we designated premium. To meet the premium standard, a well has to earn a minimum of 30% direct aftertax rate of return at $40 oil. The process of, first, defining premium, and, second, identifying inventory was to ensure that during 2016, year 2 of the downturn, we did not spend a single dollar drilling uneconomic wells. What we didn't anticipate about the new premium standard is the fire it would light under each of the teams working EOG's plays across the company. Since this early 2016, we've converted more than 1,000 additional locations to premium on our existing acreage. The Yates merger added another 1,700 premium locations. Our premium resource potential now totals more than 5 billion barrels of oil equivalent in 6,000 locations. That's more than double the resource potential and almost double the locations from the start of 2016. More impressively, when you do the math on those numbers, you see that net reserve per well of our premium inventory went from 625 MBoe at the start of the year to 850 MBoe today. We're not only adding more premium inventory, but productivity of that inventory is growing. 
Another important factor in improving capital efficiency has been the 29% of reduction in cash operating unit cost and over $1 billion in annual operating savings compared to 2014. For the third quarter in a row, we have lowered our operating expense forecast for the year. Over the last number of years, EOG has consistently added locations faster than we drill them. Over the next number of years, we fully expect to do the same with our premium locations. We stated at the beginning of the year that EOG's shift to premium was permanent. Our performance this year should leave little doubt of EOG's ability to execute that shift. 
Before I hand it over to Billy Helms to review the Delaware Basin, I want to discuss the other big news in the press release last night, our updated 2020 outlook. We introduced 2017 through 2020 outlook last quarter of 10% compounded annual growth rate at $50 oil, increasing the 20% at $60 oil. We provided this long-term framework for the reasons I just mentioned. Our premium inventory is growing in size and quality, and we expect to replace it faster than we drill it. 
With continued capital efficiency gains, we're increasing our 2017 to 2020 CAGR outlook by 5%. At $50 to $60 oil, we are now capable of growing a compounded 15% to 25% annually. Given the size of our base production today, that growth is remarkable. Also remarkable is that we can deliver that growth and the dividend within cash flow. It's important to note that our 2020 outlook includes growth throughout our large high quality, diversified portfolio of plays. As discussed in the opening remarks, our organizational structure and cutting-edge culture are driving new technology advancements, cost reductions and exploration efforts across the company at a record pace. Our 2020 outlook envisions high-return growth from the Eagle Ford, Rockies, Bakken and Permian. Additionally, we continue to work on other emerging exploration plays and expect they will become a material part of our future. 
EOG is a resilient company. Our unique culture continues to produce sustainable gains in capital productivity and generate years of high-quality drilling potential. We are a leader in capturing high-quality acreage in the best horizontal oil plays in the U.S. And the Yates transaction is just the latest example of EOG's ability to add high-return growth potential. 
Now I will turn it over to Billy Helms to update the Delaware Basin results."
269660,404423810,1074337,"EOG Resources, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2016",2016-11-04,"Earnings Calls","EOG Resources, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bill. 2016 is turning out to be a tremendous year for EOG in the Delaware Basin that can be highlighted in a couple of ways. First, our Permian teams' progress, delivering increased well performance and cost reduction, has been outstanding. As ill",867,"Thanks, Bill. 2016 is turning out to be a tremendous year for EOG in the Delaware Basin that can be highlighted in a couple of ways. First, our Permian teams' progress, delivering increased well performance and cost reduction, has been outstanding. As illustrated on Slide 11, EOG continues to deliver exceptional industry-leading well productivity. This outperformance was accomplished in multiple ways, which I will discuss in more detail in a moment. 
Second, with the combination of technology gains, cost reductions and the Yates transaction, we increased the Delaware Basin's resource potential by 155%, bringing the new total to a massive 6 billion barrels of oil equivalent from 6,300 net drilling locations. The increase is 3.7 billion barrels of oil equivalent larger than our total announced just 1 year ago on the third quarter call. 
Now that the resource potential has been further defined, our efforts will focus on converting the identified locations to premium. Approximately 55% of the 6,300 locations are currently premium, and we are confident that the majority of the nonpremium locations will be converted over time. 
There are 2 ways to convert the inventory. One is by increasing well productivity through technology. This is our precision targeting process and improved completion techniques. Two is through lowering cost, both capital cost as well as operating expenses. Just like the Eagle Ford, we are confident that our premium inventory and the Delaware Basin will continue to increase over time. 
As we have discussed in the past, the Delaware Basin is a large, very complex geological basin. Our first step entering E play is to focus our exploration team on understanding the details of the rock characteristics and then acquire our acreage position in areas that exhibit high quality rock potential. The majority of the acreage acquired in the Yates transaction demonstrates strong geologic characteristics and complements EOG's existing acreage position. The added acreage inventory will allow us to trade and block up acreage to provide opportunities for longer laterals and more efficient use of infrastructure. Blocking up acreage will, over time, continue to drive down operating cost and convert the existing location inventory to premium status. 
Most of the increase in the resource estimate is from the Wolfcamp. Our new estimate of total resource potential is 2.9 billion barrels of oil equivalent. This represents 123% increase to the previous estimate of 1.3 billion barrels. The well inventory increased by 500 locations, but more impressively, the average lateral length increased by 60% over 7,000 feet. We are steadily increasing the length of our laterals but more importantly, maintaining our focus on targeting and completion effectiveness and not diminish the productivity per foot of lateral. We have previously subdivided the Wolfcamp into an oil window, where the production is more than 50% oil; and at Combo play, where the production is a balanced mix of oil, natural gas and NGLs. 
In addition, we have tested multiple targeted goals within each zone. The resource estimate uses the confirmed test results from the different test of intervals in both the oil window and the Combo play, but in general, can be summarized as including at least 1 productive interval across our acreage, with well spacing averaging 660 feet between wells in the oil window and 880 feet between wells in the Combo play. 
A few highlights in the third quarter are from 2 660-foot spacing patterns, one with 2 wells and the other with 4 wells, both in the upper Wolfcamp. The 2-well pattern had average 30-day production over 3,000 BOEs per day, with 2,100 barrels of oil per day per well. Both were drilled using short laterals averaging 4,500 feet. The 4-well pattern had average 30-day production over 2,800 BOEs per day, with 1,900 barrels of oil per day per well. These wells were drilled using about 3,900-foot laterals. Similar to the other resource plays, we continue to test tighter spacing and evaluate the optimal development plan for each area. 
In the Second Bone Spring, we updated our research potential estimate from 500 million barrels of oil equivalent to 1.4 billion barrels, another massive increase that is almost 3x our estimate from a year ago. The Yates acreage added about half the increase, with the remainder due to targeting and technology, driving tremendous efficiencies. While the Leonard, also known as the Avalon, is the most material of our Delaware Basin plays, we have had minimal activity in 2016. Based on longer-term production performance and a detailed assessment of drilling locations, we now estimate that the Leonard resource potential is 1.7 billion barrels of oil equivalent as compared to our previous estimate of 550 million barrels. 
Finally, we do not expect to convert the majority -- we not only expect to convert the majority of the existing 6,300 locations to premium, we anticipate discovering new sources of premium drilling as we test additional areas and identify new target intervals within this geologically complex basin. We are still in the early innings of the Delaware Basin and are excited about the future. EOG's Delaware Basin potential is rapidly improving in both size and productivity and adds to EOG's deep portfolio of U.S. unconventional asset and unique drill story.

In the Eagle Ford, we continue to make tremendous progress on cost. In the third quarter, we drilled and completed 4,700 wells for a remarkable $4.6 million per well. Well costs are being driven lower for all the reasons we mentioned on our",493,"Thanks, Billy. In the Eagle Ford, we continue to make tremendous progress on cost. In the third quarter, we drilled and completed 4,700 wells for a remarkable $4.6 million per well. Well costs are being driven lower for all the reasons we mentioned on our last call. More efficient rig operations are driving drilling days down to less than 6 days a well. Completions are also getting more efficient. In 2014, we were completing 600 feet of laterals per day. During this downturn, we've taken a harder look at completion operations and logistics and are now completing wells 66% faster at almost 1,000 feet per day. At the same time, we continue to enhance the effectiveness of our completions as shown on Slide 28. 
Additionally, Eagle Ford well performance continues to grow even as we push wells closer together. During the third quarter, we completed a set of 5 infill wells, downspaced to 200 feet that were some of our best performing wells for the quarter. The core unit 10H through 14H averaged over 2,000 barrels of oil per day per well for the first 30 days on production. We have been drilling the Eagle Ford going on 7 years, and we still have so much to learn in this world-class play. Also in the Eagle Ford, our enhanced oil recovery project, or EOR, is progressing on schedule. We competed the initial phase of the 32-well pilot, our largest to date. We look forward to having results to share with you sometime in 2017. 
In the Rockies, we continue to get excellent results from the Turner Sand in the Powder River Basin. Our drilling program there is delivering consistent premium level returns, and we are looking forward to expanding activity there next year. The 9 wells we drilled in the third quarter are producing, on average, almost 1,600 BOEs per day for the first 30 days or drilled in under 6 days and have a total well cost of just $4.9 million normalized to a 6,500-foot lateral. In addition, the decline rates are relatively low, so on average, the wells produced almost 100,000 BOE per well in 90 days. The average lateral length in the third quarter was short at just 4,100 feet. We expect to move to longer 2-mile wells, particularly now that the Yates transaction blocks up much of our existing acreage in the sweet spot of the play. Longer laterals will enhance economics similar to what we realized in other plays and is particularly helpful with respect to surface permitting efficiencies in the Powder River Basin. 
Precision targeting has allowed us to convert the Turner into a premium play. We use advanced techniques to identify, map and steer our wells in the narrow 15-foot window. We are able to accomplish this even while we continue to push the envelope on drilling speed. We plan to complete a total of 35 net wells in the Turner this year.

EOG's operational performance in 2016 in terms of cost and efficiency gains has been one of the best in company history. In addition to making huge improvements in well productivity, we have driven so much cost and time out of our operation",623,"Thanks, David. EOG's operational performance in 2016 in terms of cost and efficiency gains has been one of the best in company history. In addition to making huge improvements in well productivity, we have driven so much cost and time out of our operations that we significantly increased the number of wells we are drilling and completing. EOG will now drill approximately 90 more wells and complete 80 more wells than were originally forecasted for 2016, while only increasing our development capital by $200 million. As a result, our fourth quarter domestic oil production before the addition of Yates is forecasted to be 36,000 barrels of oil per day, above our forecast at the start of the year. That's an amazing accomplishment and a testament to the tremendous capital efficiency gains we have made this year. When we add Yates and international volumes, we expect that EOG's oil exit rate will be near the company's all-time high set in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
Now let's talk about cost reduction and efficiency gains. Since 2014, EOG's drilling days and total well cost in our large Eagle Ford, Bakken and Wolfcamp plays are down 25% to 45%. Another measure of our drilling efficiency is the number of wells drilled per rig per year, which increased 40% in our top 3 plays. For example, in the Eagle Ford, we're drilling 32 wells per rig year. 
On the operating side, we reduced cash unit costs 29%, and 2016 LOE alone has come down almost $0.5 billion compared to 2014. While the major driver of cost reductions has been efficiency gains, we're also benefiting from approximately half of our high-cost drilling and completion contracts being replaced with rates that are 40% lower. In addition, tubular and wellhead costs will come down 25% with our 2017 arrangements. 
The market is speculating about service cost increases and how they will impact the industry. For EOG, due to our integrated operations, current arrangements and continued efficiency gains, we're well insulated. At the minimum, we expect to at least total well cost flat in 2017. Our teams continue to make significant efficiency gains. EOG's rate of return culture and our large-scale sweet spot positions in the best North American reserve plays facilitate continued improvement across all cost categories. 
And now for a word on DUCs. Our cost savings and additional $200 million of capital will allow EOG to complete almost all the DUCs we had in inventory at the beginning of the year. The rate of return on additional capital is very strong, and as I noted earlier, it allows us to exit the year with oil production on an upswing at near record rates and will get EOG off to a great start in 2017. We will end 2016 with approximately 140 uncompleted wells, a normal level of working inventory. 
EOG thrives during downturns due to our strength as a low-cost operator. Our strategy of low debt, living within cash flow and focusing on returns has allowed us to be one of the few companies that has preserved our balance sheet without diluting our shareholders by raising equity to pay down debt. Furthermore, we are in the best cost and inventory position I've seen in my near 40 years with the company. Our 2020 outlook is testament to that. We accomplished this through our permanent shift to premium drilling and a widespread focus on cost control. You are all familiar with our extensive inventory of premium locations. However, as COO, I am most proud of the highly integrated efforts of our teams to deliver sustainable cost reduction. They're doing an outstanding job. We are committed to maintaining this focus, and we are uniquely positioned for the future. 
Here's Tim Driggers."

We are increasing full year capital expenditure guidance to $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion. 
At the end of September 2016, total debt outstanding was $7 billion and the debt to total capitalization ratio was 37%. At September 30, we had more than $1 billion of cash on hand, giving us non-GAAP net debt of $5.9 billion or a net debt to total cap ratio of 33%. Year-to-date, we have sold assets generating approximately $625 million of proceeds and associated production of 80 million cubic feet per day of natural gas, 3,400 barrels of oil per day and 4,290 barrels per day of NGLs. Assets sold include Midland Basin, Colorado DJ Basin and Haynesville properties. The effective tax rate for the third quarter was 30%, and the deferred tax ratio was 132%.

Over the long term, we believe oil in the 40s will not sustain enough production to meet demands worldwide. While EOG can deliver strong oil growth within cash flow with $50 oil, we believe the U.S. industry as a whole needs sustained $60 oil prices and extended lead time to provide a moderate level of growth. The worldwide base decline rates are slowing -- slowly reducing supply, and the consensus view is that current large inventory overhang could return to normal levels by late 2017. 
We plan to issue official guidance on 2017 along with our year-end results early next year. Our overarching goal in 2017 is to build momentum off the foundation of premium inventory EOG established in 2016. As Gary explained, we are completing 180 more wells than previously forecasted, so we are exiting 2016 with strong oil production, and we will complete a higher percentage of premium wells in 2017 versus 2016. After 2 years of this down cycle, we are more than ready to resume high-return oil growth. 
EOG's vision for 2017 through 2020 can be summed up with 4 goals: be the leader in return on capital employed; be the U.S. leader in oil growth; be one of the lowest-cost producers in the global oil market; and remain committed to safety in the environment. EOG's long-term forecast has not wavered during the downturn. Our purpose is to create significant long-term shareholder value. And as we enter our recovery, our unique and resilient culture has positioned the company to achieve strong results for years to come.

Just to reiterate, all 3 plays are considered premium today, and we're excited about the potential. We're further along in our development at the Wolfcamp, and so for that reason, we'll continue to add it. It's an excellent volume growth generator, extremely high rate of return play. And by drilling it first, it also allows us to take a look at the shallower objectives as we drill down through those. So it gives us a better idea of long-term potential and how the drilling program in those plays will develop. In the future -- the second part of your question there about pad drilling. We are continuing to develop pad drilling as we develop the field now, and that will continue as we add the shallower zones as well. The good thing about that is we put in the infrastructure once for all those wells to share in the future.

269660,404423810,1074876,"EOG Resources, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2016",2016-11-04,"Earnings Calls","EOG Resources, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone. EOG has responded to the downturn in oil prices with an unrelenting focus on capital returns. In 2016, we increased well productivity and lowered well and operating costs at a record pace. The company projects our all-",795,"Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone. EOG has responded to the downturn in oil prices with an unrelenting focus on capital returns. In 2016, we increased well productivity and lowered well and operating costs at a record pace. The company projects our all-in return on the 26th capital program will set a company record, and we achieved this in one of the lowest commodity price environments we've experienced in a long time. Our tremendous success improving capital return this year combined with the addition of the Yates acreage increased the company resource potential in both size and quality at a record pace. As a result, we reset the company to deliver high-return oil growth within cash flow in a $50 oil environment. We believes this is unique to the industry. In this price environment, our ability to generate higher capital rates of return and achieve strong double-digit oil growth with a balanced CapEx to cash flow program sets EOG apart as the industry leader in capital efficiency. 
In early 2016, the talented teams working each play across EOG identified 3,200 locations, representing 2 billion barrels of oil equivalent reserve potential. That met a new rate of return standard we designated premium. To meet the premium standard, a well has to earn a minimum of 30% direct after-tax rate of return at $40 oil. The process of, first, defining premium, and, second, identifying inventory was to ensure that during 2016, year 2 of the downturn, we did not spend a single dollar drilling uneconomic wells. What we didn't anticipate about the new premium standard is the fire it would light under each of the teams working EOG's plays across the company. Since this early 2016, we've converted more than 1,000 additional locations to premium on our existing acreage. The Yates merger added another 1,700 premium locations. Our premium resource potential now totals more than 5 billion barrels of oil equivalent in 6,000 locations. That's more than double the resource potential and almost double the locations from the start of 2016. More impressively, when you do the math on those numbers, you see that net reserve per well of our premium inventory went from 625 MBoe at the start of the year to 850 MBoe today. We're not only adding more premium inventory, but productivity of that inventory is growing. 
Another important factor in improving capital efficiency has been the 29% of reduction in cash operating unit cost and over $1 billion in annual operating savings compared to 2014. For the third quarter in a row, we have lowered our operating expense forecast for the year. Over the last number of years, EOG has consistently added locations faster than we drill them. Over the next number of years, we fully expect to do the same with our premium locations. We stated at the beginning of the year that EOG's shift to premium was permanent. Our performance this year should leave little doubt of EOG's ability to execute that shift. 
Before I hand it over to Billy Helms to review the Delaware Basin, I want to discuss the other big news in the press release last night, our updated 2020 outlook. We introduced 2017 through 2020 outlook last quarter of 10% compounded annual growth rate at $50 oil, increasing the 20% at $60 oil. We provided this long-term framework for the reasons I just mentioned. Our premium inventory is growing in size and quality, and we expect to replace it faster than we drill it. 
With continued capital efficiency gains, we're increasing our 2017 to 2020 CAGR outlook by 5%. At $50 to $60 oil, we are now capable of growing a compounded 15% to 25% annually. Given the size of our base production today, that growth is remarkable. Also remarkable is that we can deliver that growth and the dividend within cash flow. It's important to note that our 2020 outlook includes growth throughout our large high quality, diversified portfolio of plays. As discussed in the opening remarks, our organizational structure and cutting-edge culture are driving new technology advancements, cost reductions and exploration efforts across the company at a record pace. Our 2020 outlook envisions high-return growth from the Eagle Ford, Rockies, Bakken and Permian. Additionally, we continue to work on other emerging exploration plays and expect they will become a material part of our future. 
EOG is a resilient company. Our unique culture continues to produce sustainable gains in capital productivity and generate years of high-quality drilling potential. We are a leader in capturing high-quality acreage in the best horizontal oil plays in the U.S. And the Yates transaction is just the latest example of EOG's ability to add high-return growth potential. 
Now I will turn it over to Billy Helms to update the Delaware Basin results."
269660,404423810,1074876,"EOG Resources, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2016",2016-11-04,"Earnings Calls","EOG Resources, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bill. 2016 is turning out to be a tremendous year for EOG in the Delaware Basin that can be highlighted in a couple of ways. First, our Permian teams' progress, delivering increased well performance and cost reduction, has been outstanding. As ill",867,"Thanks, Bill. 2016 is turning out to be a tremendous year for EOG in the Delaware Basin that can be highlighted in a couple of ways. First, our Permian teams' progress, delivering increased well performance and cost reduction, has been outstanding. As illustrated on Slide 11, EOG continues to deliver exceptional industry-leading well productivity. This outperformance was accomplished in multiple ways, which I will discuss in more detail in a moment. 
Second, with the combination of technology gains, cost reductions and the Yates transaction, we increased the Delaware Basin's resource potential by 155%, bringing the new total to a massive 6 billion barrels of oil equivalent from 6,300 net drilling locations. The increase is 3.7 billion barrels of oil equivalent larger than our total announced just 1 year ago on the third quarter call. 
Now that the resource potential has been further defined, our efforts will focus on converting the identified locations to premium. Approximately 55% of the 6,300 locations are currently premium, and we are confident that the majority of the nonpremium locations will be converted over time. 
There are 2 ways to convert the inventory. One is by increasing well productivity through technology. This is our precision targeting process and improved completion techniques. Two is through lowering cost, both capital cost as well as operating expenses. Just like the Eagle Ford, we are confident that our premium inventory and the Delaware Basin will continue to increase over time. 
As we have discussed in the past, the Delaware Basin is a large, very complex geological basin. Our first step entering E play is to focus our exploration team on understanding the details of the rock characteristics and then acquire our acreage position in areas that exhibit high quality rock potential. The majority of the acreage acquired in the Yates transaction demonstrates strong geologic characteristics and complements EOG's existing acreage position. The added acreage inventory will allow us to trade and block up acreage to provide opportunities for longer laterals and more efficient use of infrastructure. Blocking up acreage will, over time, continue to drive down operating cost and convert the existing location inventory to premium status. 
Most of the increase in the resource estimate is from the Wolfcamp. Our new estimate of total resource potential is 2.9 billion barrels of oil equivalent. This represents 123% increase to the previous estimate of 1.3 billion barrels. The well inventory increased by 500 locations, but more impressively, the average lateral length increased by 60% over 7,000 feet. We are steadily increasing the length of our laterals but more importantly, maintaining our focus on targeting and completion effectiveness and not diminish the productivity per foot of lateral. We have previously subdivided the Wolfcamp into an oil window, where the production is more than 50% oil; and a Combo play, where the production is a balanced mix of oil, natural gas and NGLs. 
In addition, we have tested multiple targeted goals within each zone. The resource estimate uses the confirmed test results from the different test of intervals in both the oil window and the Combo play, but in general, can be summarized as including at least 1 productive interval across our acreage, with well spacing averaging 660 feet between wells in the oil window and 880 feet between wells in the Combo play. 
A few highlights in the third quarter are from 2 660-foot spacing patterns, one with 2 wells and the other with 4 wells, both in the upper Wolfcamp. The 2-well pattern had average 30-day production over 3,000 BOEs per day, with 2,100 barrels of oil per day per well. Both were drilled using short laterals averaging 4,500 feet. The 4-well pattern had average 30-day production over 2,800 BOEs per day, with 1,900 barrels of oil per day per well. These wells were drilled using about 4,900-foot laterals. Similar to the other resource plays, we continue to test tighter spacing and evaluate the optimal development plan for each area. 
In the Second Bone Springs, we updated our research potential estimate from 500 million barrels of oil equivalent to 1.4 billion barrels, another massive increase that is almost 3x our estimate from a year ago. The Yates acreage added about half the increase, with the remainder due to targeting and technology, driving tremendous efficiencies. While the Leonard, also known as the Avalon, is the most material of our Delaware Basin plays, we have had minimal activity in 2016. Based on longer-term production performance and a detailed assessment of drilling locations, we now estimate that the Leonard resource potential is 1.7 billion barrels of oil equivalent as compared to our previous estimate of 550 million barrels. 
Finally, we do not expect to convert the majority -- we not only expect to convert the majority of the existing 6,300 locations to premium, we anticipate discovering new sources of premium drilling as we test additional areas and identify new target intervals within this geologically complex basin. We are still in the early innings of the Delaware Basin and are excited about the future. EOG's Delaware Basin potential is rapidly improving in both size and productivity and adds to EOG's deep portfolio of U.S. unconventional asset and unique drill story.

In the Eagle Ford, we continue to make tremendous progress on cost. In the third quarter, we drilled and completed 47 wells for a remarkable $4.6 million per well.

In the third quarter, we drilled and completed 47 wells for a remarkable $4.6 million per well. Well costs are being driven lower for all the reasons we mentioned on our last call. More efficient rig operations are driving drilling days down to less than 6 days a well. Completions are also getting more efficient. In 2014, we were completing 600 feet of laterals per day. During this downturn, we've taken a harder look at completion operations and logistics and are now completing wells 66% faster at almost 1,000 feet per day. At the same time, we continue to enhance the effectiveness of our completions as shown on Slide 28. 
Additionally, Eagle Ford well performance continues to grow even as we push wells closer together. During the third quarter, we completed a set of 5 infill wells, downspaced to 200 feet that were some of our best performing wells for the quarter. The core unit 10H through 14H averaged over 2,000 barrels of oil per day per well for the first 30 days on production. We have been drilling the Eagle Ford going on 7 years, and we still have so much to learn in this world-class play. Also in the Eagle Ford, our enhanced oil recovery project, or EOR, is progressing on schedule. We competed the initial phase of the 32-well pilot, our largest to date. We look forward to having results to share with you sometime in 2017. 
In the Rockies, we continue to get excellent results from the Turner Sand in the Powder River Basin. Our drilling program there is delivering consistent premium level returns, and we are looking forward to expanding activity there next year. The 9 wells we drilled in the third quarter are producing, on average, almost 1,600 BOEs per day for the first 30 days or drilled in under 6 days and have a total well cost of just $4.9 million normalized to a 6,500-foot lateral. In addition, the decline rates are relatively low, so on average, the wells produced almost 100,000 BOE per well in 90 days. The average lateral length in the third quarter was short at just 4,100 feet. We expect to move to longer 2-mile wells, particularly now that the Yates transaction blocks up much of our existing acreage in the sweet spot of the play. Longer laterals will enhance economics similar to what we realized in other plays and is particularly helpful with respect to surface permitting efficiencies in the Powder River Basin. 
Precision targeting has allowed us to convert the Turner into a premium play. We use advanced techniques to identify, map and steer our wells in the narrow 15-foot window. We are able to accomplish this even while we continue to push the envelope on drilling speeds. We plan to complete a total of 25 net wells in the Turner this year. 
Here's Gary Thomas."
269660,404423810,1074876,"EOG Resources, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2016",2016-11-04,"Earnings Calls","EOG Resources, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, David.

In addition to making huge improvements in well productivity, we have driven so much cost and time out of our operation",623,"Thanks, David. EOG's operational performance in 2016 in terms of cost and efficiency gains has been one of the best in company history. In addition to making huge improvements in well productivity, we have driven so much cost and time out of our operations that we significantly increased the number of wells we are drilling and completing. EOG will now drill approximately 90 more wells and complete 80 more wells than were originally forecasted for 2016, while only increasing our development capital by $200 million. As a result, our fourth quarter domestic oil production before the addition of Yates is forecasted to be 36,000 barrels of oil per day, above our forecast at the start of the year. That's an amazing accomplishment and a testament to the tremendous capital efficiency gains we have made this year. When we add Yates and international volumes, we expect that EOG's oil exit rate will be near the company's all-time high set in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
Now let's talk about cost reduction and efficiency gains. Since 2014, EOG's drilling days and total well cost in our large Eagle Ford, Bakken and Wolfcamp plays are down 25% to 45%. Another measure of our drilling efficiency is the number of wells drilled per rig per year, which increased 40% in our top 3 plays. For example, in the Eagle Ford, we're drilling 32 wells per rig year. 
On the operating side, we reduced cash unit costs 29%, and 2016 LOE alone has come down almost $0.5 billion compared to 2014. While the major driver of cost reductions has been efficiency gains, we're also benefiting from approximately half of our high-cost drilling and completion contracts being replaced with rates that are 40% lower. In addition, tubular and wellhead costs will come down 25% with our 2017 arrangements. 
The market is speculating about service cost increases and how they will impact the industry. For EOG, due to our integrated operations, current arrangements and continued efficiency gains, we're well insulated. At a minimum, we expect to at least hold well cost flat in 2017. Our teams continue to make significant efficiency gains. EOG's rate of return culture and our large-scale sweet spot positions in the best North American reserve plays facilitate continually improvement across all cost categories. 
And now for a word on DUCs. Our cost savings and additional $200 million of capital will allow EOG to complete almost all the DUCs we had in inventory at the beginning of the year. The rate of return on additional capital is very strong, and as I noted earlier, it allows us to exit the year with oil production on an upswing at near record rates and will get EOG off to a great start in 2017. We will end 2016 with approximately 140 uncompleted wells, a normal level of working inventory. 
EOG thrives during downturns due to our strength as a low-cost operator. Our strategy of low debt, living within cash flow and focusing on returns has allowed us to be one of the few companies that has preserved our balance sheet without diluting our shareholders by raising equity to pay down debt. Furthermore, we are in the best cost and inventory position I've seen in my near 40 years with the company. Our 2020 outlook is testament to that. We accomplished this through our permanent shift to premium drilling and a widespread focus on cost control. You are all familiar with our extensive inventory of premium locations. However, as COO, I am most proud of the highly integrated efforts of our teams to deliver sustainable cost reduction. They're doing an outstanding job. We are committed to maintaining this focus, and we are uniquely positioned for the future.

Over the long term, we believe oil in the 40s will not sustain enough production to meet demands worldwide. While EOG can deliver strong oil growth within cash flow with $50 oil, we believe the U.S. industry as a whole needs sustained $60 oil prices and extended lead time to provide a moderate level of growth. The worldwide base decline rates are slowing -- slowly reducing supply, and the consensus view is that current large inventory overhang could return to normal levels by late 2017. 
We plan to issue official guidance on 2017 along with our year-end results early next year. Our overarching goal in 2017 is to build momentum off the foundation of premium inventory EOG established in 2016. As Gary explained, we are completing 180 more wells than previously forecasted, so we are exiting 2016 with strong oil production, and we will complete a higher percentage of premium wells in 2017 versus 2016. After 2 years of this down cycle, we are more than ready to resume high-return oil growth. 
EOG's vision for 2017 through 2020 can be summed up with 4 goals: be the leader in return on capital employed; be the U.S. leader in oil growth; be one of the lowest-cost producers in the global oil market; and remain committed to safety in the environment. EOG's long-term forecast has not wavered during the downturn. Our purpose is to create significant long-term shareholder value. And as we enter our recovery, our unique and resilient culture has positioned the company to achieve strong results for years to come.

We're further along in our development at the Wolfcamp, and so for that reason, we'll continue to add it. It's an excellent volume growth generator, extremely high rate of return play. And by drilling it first, it also allows us to take a look at the shallower objectives as we drill down through those. So it gives us a better idea of long-term potential and how the drilling program in those plays will develop. In the future -- the second part of your question there about pad drilling. We are continuing to develop pad drilling as we develop the field now, and that will continue as we add the shallower zones as well.

In some places, we do have 2 good targets in the lower Eagle Ford, so it -- so we're certainly doing that there. But I think over time,  we'll continue to see that improve as we dial the targets in a little bit better and we work on the completions. But again, it's not applicable to all areas because some areas are -- we have really just 1 target. So really, throughout the play, we're looking at anywhere from 200-foot spacing to 300 or 350, depending on the area."

269660,404423810,1077078,"EOG Resources, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2016",2016-11-04,"Earnings Calls","EOG Resources, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone. EOG has responded to the downturn in oil prices with an unrelenting focus on capital returns. In 2016, we increased well productivity and lowered well and operating costs at a record pace. The company projects our all-",795,"Thanks, Tim. Good morning, everyone. EOG has responded to the downturn in oil prices with an unrelenting focus on capital returns. In 2016, we increased well productivity and lowered well and operating costs at a record pace. The company projects our all-in return on the 26th capital program will set a company record, and we achieved this in one of the lowest commodity price environments we've experienced in a long time. Our tremendous success improving capital return this year combined with the addition of the Yates acreage increased the company resource potential in both size and quality at a record pace. As a result, we reset the company to deliver high-return oil growth within cash flow in a $50 oil environment. We believe this is unique to the industry. In this price environment, our ability to generate higher capital rates of return and achieve strong double-digit oil growth with a balanced CapEx to cash flow program sets EOG apart as the industry leader in capital efficiency. 
In early 2016, the talented teams working each play across EOG identified 3,200 locations, representing 2 billion barrels of oil equivalent reserve potential. That met a new rate of return standard we designated premium. To meet the premium standard, a well has to earn a minimum of 30% direct after-tax rate of return at $40 oil. The process of, first, defining premium, and, second, identifying inventory was to ensure that during 2016, year 2 of the downturn, we did not spend a single dollar drilling uneconomic wells. What we didn't anticipate about the new premium standard is the fire it would light under each of the teams working EOG's plays across the company. Since this early 2016, we've converted more than 1,000 additional locations to premium on our existing acreage. The Yates merger added another 1,700 premium locations. Our premium resource potential now totals more than 5 billion barrels of oil equivalent in 6,000 locations. That's more than double the resource potential and almost double the locations from the start of 2016. More impressively, when you do the math on those numbers, you see that net reserve per well of our premium inventory went from 625 MBoe at the start of the year to 850 MBoe today. We're not only adding more premium inventory, but productivity of that inventory is growing. 
Another important factor in improving capital efficiency has been the 29% of reduction in cash operating unit cost and over $1 billion in annual operating savings compared to 2014. For the third quarter in a row, we have lowered our operating expense forecast for the year. Over the last number of years, EOG has consistently added locations faster than we drill them. Over the next number of years, we fully expect to do the same with our premium locations. We stated at the beginning of the year that EOG's shift to premium was permanent. Our performance this year should leave little doubt of EOG's ability to execute that shift. 
Before I hand it over to Billy Helms to review the Delaware Basin, I want to discuss the other big news in the press release last night, our updated 2020 outlook. We introduced 2017 through 2020 outlook last quarter of 10% compounded annual growth rate at $50 oil, increasing the 20% at $60 oil. We provided this long-term framework for the reasons I just mentioned. Our premium inventory is growing in size and quality, and we expect to replace it faster than we drill it. 
With continued capital efficiency gains, we're increasing our 2017 to 2020 CAGR outlook by 5%. At $50 to $60 oil, we are now capable of growing a compounded 15% to 25% annually. Given the size of our base production today, that growth is remarkable. Also remarkable is that we can deliver that growth and the dividend within cash flow. It's important to note that our 2020 outlook includes growth throughout our large high quality, diversified portfolio of plays. As discussed in the opening remarks, our organizational structure and cutting-edge culture are driving new technology advancements, cost reductions and exploration efforts across the company at a record pace. Our 2020 outlook envisions high-return growth from the Eagle Ford, Rockies, Bakken and Permian. Additionally, we continue to work on other emerging exploration plays and expect they will become a material part of our future. 
EOG is a resilient company. Our unique culture continues to produce sustainable gains in capital productivity and generate years of high-quality drilling potential. We are a leader in capturing high-quality acreage in the best horizontal oil plays in the U.S. And the Yates transaction is just the latest example of EOG's ability to add high-return growth potential. 
Now I will turn it over to Billy Helms to update the Delaware Basin results."
269660,404423810,1077078,"EOG Resources, Inc., Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 04, 2016",2016-11-04,"Earnings Calls","EOG Resources, Inc.","Executives","Thanks, Bill. 2016 is turning out to be a tremendous year for EOG in the Delaware Basin that can be highlighted in a couple of ways. First, our Permian teams' progress, delivering increased well performance and cost reduction, has been outstanding. As ill",867,"Thanks, Bill. 2016 is turning out to be a tremendous year for EOG in the Delaware Basin that can be highlighted in a couple of ways. First, our Permian teams' progress, delivering increased well performance and cost reduction, has been outstanding. As illustrated on Slide 11, EOG continues to deliver exceptional industry-leading well productivity. This outperformance was accomplished in multiple ways, which I will discuss in more detail in a moment. 
Second, with the combination of technology gains, cost reductions and the Yates transaction, we increased the Delaware Basin's resource potential by 155%, bringing the new total to a massive 6 billion barrels of oil equivalent from 6,300 net drilling locations. The increase is 3.7 billion barrels of oil equivalent larger than our total announced just 1 year ago on the third quarter call. 
Now that the resource potential has been further defined, our efforts will focus on converting the identified locations to premium. Approximately 55% of the 6,300 locations are currently premium, and we are confident that the majority of the nonpremium locations will be converted over time. 
There are 2 ways to convert the inventory. One is by increasing well productivity through technology. This is our precision targeting process and improved completion techniques. Two is through lowering cost, both capital cost as well as operating expenses. Just like the Eagle Ford, we are confident that our premium inventory and the Delaware Basin will continue to increase over time. 
As we have discussed in the past, the Delaware Basin is a large, very complex geological basin. Our first step entering E play is to focus our exploration team on understanding the details of the rock characteristics and then acquire our acreage position in areas that exhibit high quality rock potential. The majority of the acreage acquired in the Yates transaction demonstrates strong geologic characteristics and complements EOG's existing acreage position. The added acreage inventory will allow us to trade and block up acreage to provide opportunities for longer laterals and more efficient use of infrastructure. Blocking up acreage will, over time, continue to drive down operating cost and convert the existing location inventory to premium status. 
Most of the increase in the resource estimate is from the Wolfcamp. Our new estimate of total resource potential is 2.9 billion barrels of oil equivalent. This represents 123% increase to the previous estimate of 1.3 billion barrels. The well inventory increased by 500 locations, but more impressively, the average lateral length increased by 60% over 7,000 feet. We are steadily increasing the length of our laterals but more importantly, maintaining our focus on targeting and completion effectiveness and not diminish the productivity per foot of lateral. We have previously subdivided the Wolfcamp into an oil window, where the production is more than 50% oil; and a Combo play, where the production is a balanced mix of oil, natural gas and NGLs. 
In addition, we have tested multiple targeted goals within each zone. The resource estimate uses the confirmed test results from the different test of intervals in both the oil window and the Combo play, but in general, can be summarized as including at least 1 productive interval across our acreage, with well spacing averaging 660 feet between wells in the oil window and 880 feet between wells in the Combo play. 
A few highlights in the third quarter are from 2 660-foot spacing patterns, one with 2 wells and the other with 4 wells, both in the upper Wolfcamp. The 2-well pattern had average 30-day production over 3,000 BOEs per day, with 2,100 barrels of oil per day per well. Both were drilled using short laterals averaging 4,500 feet. The 4-well pattern had average 30-day production over 2,800 BOEs per day, with 1,900 barrels of oil per day per well. These wells were drilled using about 4,900-foot laterals. Similar to the other resource plays, we continue to test tighter spacing and evaluate the optimal development plan for each area. 
In the Second Bone Springs, we updated our research potential estimate from 500 million barrels of oil equivalent to 1.4 billion barrels, another massive increase that is almost 3x our estimate from a year ago. The Yates acreage added about half the increase, with the remainder due to targeting and technology, driving tremendous efficiencies. While the Leonard, also known as the Avalon, is the most material of our Delaware Basin plays, we have had minimal activity in 2016. Based on longer-term production performance and a detailed assessment of drilling locations, we now estimate that the Leonard resource potential is 1.7 billion barrels of oil equivalent as compared to our previous estimate of 550 million barrels. 
Finally, we do not expect to convert the majority -- we not only expect to convert the majority of the existing 6,300 locations to premium, we anticipate discovering new sources of premium drilling as we test additional areas and identify new target intervals within this geologically complex basin. We are still in the early innings of the Delaware Basin and are excited about the future. EOG's Delaware Basin potential is rapidly improving in both size and productivity and adds to EOG's deep portfolio of U.S. unconventional asset and unique drill story. 
Here's David Trice."

In the third quarter, we drilled and completed 47 wells for a remarkable $4.6 million per well. Well costs are being driven lower for all the reasons we mentioned on our last call. More efficient rig operations are driving drilling days down to less than 6 days a well. Completions are also getting more efficient. In 2014, we were completing 600 feet of laterals per day. During this downturn, we've taken a harder look at completion operations and logistics and are now completing wells 66% faster at almost 1,000 feet per day. At the same time, we continue to enhance the effectiveness of our completions as shown on Slide 28. 
Additionally, Eagle Ford well performance continues to grow even as we push wells closer together. During the third quarter, we completed a set of 5 infill wells, downspaced to 200 feet that were some of our best performing wells for the quarter. The core unit 10H through 14H averaged over 2,000 barrels of oil per day per well for the first 30 days on production. We have been drilling the Eagle Ford going on 7 years, and we still have so much to learn in this world-class play. Also in the Eagle Ford, our enhanced oil recovery project, or EOR, is progressing on schedule. We competed the initial phase of the 32-well pilot, our largest to date. We look forward to having results to share with you sometime in 2017. 
In the Rockies, we continue to get excellent results from the Turner Sand in the Powder River Basin. Our drilling program there is delivering consistent premium level returns, and we are looking forward to expanding activity there next year. The 9 wells we drilled in the third quarter are producing, on average, almost 1,600 BOEs per day for the first 30 days or drilled in under 6 days and have a total well cost of just $4.9 million normalized to a 6,500-foot lateral. In addition, the decline rates are relatively low, so on average, the wells produced almost 100,000 BOE per well in 90 days. The average lateral length in the third quarter was short at just 4,100 feet. We expect to move to longer 2-mile wells, particularly now that the Yates transaction blocks up much of our existing acreage in the sweet spot of the play. Longer laterals will enhance economics similar to what we realized in other plays and is particularly helpful with respect to surface permitting efficiencies in the Powder River Basin. 
Precision targeting has allowed us to convert the Turner into a premium play. We use advanced techniques to identify, map and steer our wells in the narrow 15-foot window. We are able to accomplish this even while we continue to push the envelope on drilling speeds. We plan to complete a total of 25 net wells in the Turner this year. 
Here's Gary Thomas."

EOG's operational performance in 2016 in terms of cost and efficiency gains has been one of the best in company history. In addition to making huge improvements in well productivity, we have driven so much cost and time out of our operation",623,"Thanks, David. EOG's operational performance in 2016 in terms of cost and efficiency gains has been one of the best in company history. In addition to making huge improvements in well productivity, we have driven so much cost and time out of our operations that we significantly increased the number of wells we are drilling and completing. EOG will now drill approximately 90 more wells and complete 80 more wells than were originally forecasted for 2016, while only increasing our development capital by $200 million. As a result, our fourth quarter domestic oil production before the addition of Yates is forecasted to be 36,000 barrels of oil per day, above our forecast at the start of the year. That's an amazing accomplishment and a testament to the tremendous capital efficiency gains we have made this year. When we add Yates and international volumes, we expect that EOG's oil exit rate will be near the company's all-time high set in the fourth quarter of 2014. 
Now let's talk about cost reduction and efficiency gains. Since 2014, EOG's drilling days and total well cost in our large Eagle Ford, Bakken and Wolfcamp plays are down 25% to 45%. Another measure of our drilling efficiency is the number of wells drilled per rig per year, which increased 40% in our top 3 plays. For example, in the Eagle Ford, we're drilling 32 wells per rig year. 
On the operating side, we reduced cash unit costs 29%, and 2016 LOE alone has come down almost $0.5 billion compared to 2014. While the major driver of cost reductions has been efficiency gains, we're also benefiting from approximately half of our high-cost drilling and completion contracts being replaced with rates that are 40% lower. In addition, tubular and wellhead costs will come down 25% with our 2017 arrangements. 
The market is speculating about service cost increases and how they will impact the industry. For EOG, due to our integrated operations, current arrangements and continued efficiency gains, we're well insulated. At a minimum, we expect to at least hold well cost flat in 2017. Our teams continue to make significant efficiency gains. EOG's rate of return culture and our large-scale sweet spot positions in the best North American reserve plays facilitate continually improvement across all cost categories. 
And now for a word on DUCs. Our cost savings and additional $200 million of capital will allow EOG to complete almost all the DUCs we had in inventory at the beginning of the year. The rate of return on additional capital is very strong, and as I noted earlier, it allows us to exit the year with oil production on an upswing at near record rates and will get EOG off to a great start in 2017. We will end 2016 with approximately 140 uncompleted wells, a normal level of working inventory. 
EOG thrives during downturns due to our strength as a low-cost operator. Our strategy of low debt, living within cash flow and focusing on returns has allowed us to be one of the few companies that has preserved our balance sheet without diluting our shareholders by raising equity to pay down debt. Furthermore, we are in the best cost and inventory position I've seen in my near 40 years with the company. Our 2020 outlook is testament to that. We accomplished this through our permanent shift to premium drilling and a widespread focus on cost control. You are all familiar with our extensive inventory of premium locations. However, as COO, I am most proud of the highly integrated efforts of our teams to deliver sustainable cost reduction. They're doing an outstanding job. We are committed to maintaining this focus, and we are uniquely positioned for the future. 
Here's Tim Driggers."

Capitalized interest for the third quarter 2016 was $8 million. Exploration and development expenditures were $660 million, excluding property acquisitions, which is 32% less as compared to third quarter 2015, while our total production volumes decreased by just 3%. In addition, expenditures for gathering systems, processing plants and other property plant and equipment were $16 million. We are increasing full year capital expenditure guidance to $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion. 
At the end of September 2016, total debt outstanding was $7 billion and the debt to total capitalization ratio was 37%. At September 30, we had more than $1 billion of cash on hand, giving us non-GAAP net debt of $5.9 billion or a net debt to total cap ratio of 33%. Year-to-date, we have sold assets generating approximately $625 million of proceeds and associated production of 80 million cubic feet per day of natural gas, 3,400 barrels of oil per day and 4,290 barrels per day of NGLs. Assets sold include Midland Basin, Colorado DJ Basin and Haynesville properties. The effective tax rate for the third quarter was 30%, and the deferred tax ratio was 132%.

Over the long term, we believe oil in the 40s will not sustain enough production to meet demands worldwide. While EOG can deliver strong oil growth within cash flow with $50 oil, we believe the U.S. industry as a whole needs sustained $60 oil prices and extended lead time to provide a moderate level of growth. The worldwide base decline rates are slowing -- slowly reducing supply, and the consensus view is that current large inventory overhang could return to normal levels by late 2017. 
We plan to issue official guidance on 2017 along with our year-end results early next year. Our overarching goal in 2017 is to build momentum off the foundation of premium inventory EOG established in 2016. As Gary explained, we are completing 180 more wells than previously forecasted, so we are exiting 2016 with strong oil production, and we will complete a higher percentage of premium wells in 2017 versus 2016. After 2 years of this down cycle, we are more than ready to resume high-return oil growth. 
EOG's vision for 2017 through 2020 can be summed up with 4 goals: be the leader in return on capital employed; be the U.S. leader in oil growth; be one of the lowest-cost producers in the global oil market; and remain committed to safety in the environment. EOG's long-term forecast has not wavered during the downturn. Our purpose is to create significant long-term shareholder value. And as we enter our recovery, our unique and resilient culture has positioned the company to achieve strong results for years to come. 
Thank you for listening. Now we'll go to Q&A."

Just to reiterate, all 3 plays are considered premium today, and we're excited about the potential. We're further along in our development at the Wolfcamp, and so for that reason, we'll continue to add it. It's an excellent volume growth generator, extremely high rate of return play. And by drilling it first, it also allows us to take a look at the shallower objectives as we drill down through those. So it gives us a better idea of long-term potential and how the drilling program in those plays will develop. In the future -- the second part of your question there about pad drilling. We are continuing to develop pad drilling as we develop the field now, and that will continue as we add the shallower zones as well.
