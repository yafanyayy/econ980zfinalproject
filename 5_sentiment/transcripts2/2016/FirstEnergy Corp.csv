Good morning, everyone. I'm glad you're able to join us. I'm excited to share the results from an important and productive year for FirstEnergy. In 2015, we made tremendous progress on major initiatives across our company. We put a number of obstacles behind us and completed critical work necessary to implement our regulated growth strategy going forward. At the same time, we consistently met our financial commitments to you. Last night, we reported operating earnings of $0.58 per share for the fourth quarter and $2.71 per share for the year. These results, which reflect improved operations and our competitive business as well as growth in our transmission business, are above our initial guidance range for 2015 and in line with the revised estimates that we provided during our third quarter call, despite the mild weather we experienced in the fourth quarter.
For the first quarter of 2016, we have provided operating earnings guidance of $0.75 to $0.85 per share. As we will discuss later, we intend to provide additional guidance once we have an outcome in our Ohio Electric Security Plan.  Before we move to Jim's financial review, I'll take a few minutes to discuss the key events from 2015.
First, we removed the regulatory uncertainty and important steps to position our regulated utilities for growth, with the conclusion of rate cases in West Virginia, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Resolving these cases allows us to plan for additional infrastructure and reliability investments at these utilities.
In Pennsylvania, we took that next step by following long-term infrastructure improvement plans for each of our 4 operating companies in October. These plans, which were approved by the Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission last week, outlined a projected increase in capital investment of nearly $245 million over 5 years to help strengthen, upgrade and modernize our Pennsylvania distribution systems.  Yesterday, we filed for approval to implement a distribution system improvement charge at each of the 4 operating companies, which will allow us to recover quarterly costs associated with the capital projects approved in the LTIPs.
In Ohio, we achieved an important milestone for our latest Electric Security Plan by reaching a settlement agreement with the staff of the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio and 16 other parties including , an energy management solutions provider; Ohio Partners for Affordable Energy, a low income customer advocacy group; and IGS Energy, an independent energy supplier. The agreement outlines the ambitious steps to safeguard Ohio customers against retail price increases and volatility in future years, deploying new energy efficiency programs and providing clear path to cleaner, energy future by reducing carbon emissions. Our settlement includes an 8-year retail rate stability rider associated with the proposed purchase power agreement. This provision will help protect the customers against rising retail prices and market volatility, while helping preserve vital baseload power plants that serve Ohio customers and provide thousands of jobs in the state. The PPA includes the plant in Stratton, Ohio; the nuclear power station in , Ohio, which recently received approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for a 20-year license; and a portion of the output of 2 plants.  The procedural schedule for our Ohio case is nearly complete with hearings concluded, initial briefs and reply briefs due next Friday. A decision from the PUCO is expected in March.
Clearly, there's a lot of talk about the PPA as all interested parties seek to have their voices heard. We firmly believe that our plan serves the best interest of Ohio customers and Ohio communities while supporting competitive markets in the state and PJM. This generation will continue to be offered in PJM's energy and capacity markets, and the PPA will have no impact on our standard service offer or customers' ability to shop for the retail electric supply. In fact, we expect that the output from these plants would be treated no differently than the 20% of regulated generation that currently clears in the PJM markets. And that 20% does not include imports into PJM, which from ISO would be primarily regulated generation.
I'm sure you'll have lots of questions about the legal and regulatory process, and Leila is standing by to share our perspective during the Q&A. We believe our plan is the right one for Ohio, and we remain very optimistic in the outcome, both in Ohio and at FERC.
Let's turn to our transmission business. We just passed the halfway point of the first phase of our Energizing the Future transformation investment initiative to meet the reliability needs of our customers and communities. We remain on track to meet our target of $4.2 billion in spending during the 2014 through 2017 time frame. Consistent with our plan, we spent $2.4 billion in 2014 and 2015, including $986 million last year on projects to address service reliability, grid modernization and growth. We completed major initiatives to address last year's Northeast Ohio plant deactivations and brought online critical new infrastructure to support midstream gas operations in our region. Work in 2016 is expected to include $1 billion in investments on projects such as synchronous condensers of our Eastlake plant; newline construction project in West Virginia and New Jersey; static bar compensator projects in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and West Virginia; and several new substations, line rebuilds and reconductoring projects.  While expansion in the shell markets has cooled, we expect investments over the next several years of about $150 million for work that is already in the pipeline.
We also addressed several matters in 2015 that support future investment in this important long-term growth platform. During the fourth quarter, FERC approved our settlement for a forward-looking formula rate structure in our ATSI subsidiary, which permits more timely recovery of our investments. In addition in June, we filed to create a new subsidiary named Mid-Atlantic Interstate Transmission or MAIT. This subsidiary will hold the transmission assets of Met-Ed, and JCP&L and facilitate NEW investments that can improve service reliability for those customers. Our proposal is on FERC's agenda for tomorrow. And we are seeking approval from both the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission and the New Jersey Bureau of Public Utilities by the middle of the year.  The structural changes are important steps to ensure timely recovery of our investments and set the stage for continued growth through our Energizing the Future transmission initiative.
Turning to our competitive operations. The PJM capacity market reforms approved by FERC have already begun to have a positive impact on the capacity auction process, although the markets continued to fall well short of being on baseload generation units. Our revised competitive strategy focusing on stabilizing the business by reducing risks also produced positive results. In 2015, we sold 75 million megawatt-hours while significantly reducing our exposure to weather-sensitive load and executing a rigorous commitment to economically dispatching our units. As a result, we mitigated the impact of severe weather in the first quarter of 2015 and achieved adjusted EBITDA of $949 million. This is in line with the revised guidance that we provided in October and reflects solid operational results as well as the impact of our Cash Flow Improvement Project.
We are holding off on providing adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2017 and 2018 until our analyst meeting following the PUCO decision in Ohio. However, we are reaffirming both our 2016 adjusted EBITDA guidance range for the competitive business of $950 million to $1.05 billion and our expectation that the business will be cash flow positive each year through at least 2018.
Before I move from our competitive segment, I'll mention that given the significant decline in the global core markets, we impaired our investment in the Signal Peak mine, resulting in a $362 million pretax noncash charge, which Jim will cover in more detail.
Finally, I will spend a few moments discussing our cash flow improvements plan and other financial matters. We took a very important step to improve our financial metrics and balance sheet in 2015 through the launch of the Cash Flow Improvement Project. This initiative began in the spring with a goal to capture meaningful and sustainable savings opportunities and process improvements across the company, while continuing to fully meet the needs of our customers, our organization and our employees. I'm very pleased with the results of this effort to date. We are on track to capture $155 million in savings this year and $240 million annually by 2017, up from our initial goal of $200 million over the time frame.  The results from this initiative will allow us to essentially hold our own through 2017. 
We put a lot of risk behind us in 2015 including key initiatives that provide our company with greater strength and flexibility as we pursue our regulated growth plans. I'm also gratified by the response from the rating agencies. In December, citing our shift in the strategy and more credit-friendly business risk profile, Fitch revised its outlook from stable to positive. Days later, Moody's affirmed its Baa3 rating with a stable outlook for FirstEnergy Corp., FPS and Allegheny Energy Supply, citing our Ohio ESP settlement. 
Over the past year, I've gotten to know many of you and I've shared my leadership philosophy, including my commitment to make our company more transparent. I hope you've seen that in action over the past year.
I'm told you one of our primary objectives is to improve the quality of our earnings. This year, 2 significant noncash adjustments got in the way. The annual market market for pension and OPEB will remain an annual adjustment, either up or down. And the impairment of the Single coal mine is required, given the current market for coal and the fact that this isn't a core asset for us. Outside of these 2 items, earnings quality in 2015 was very solid and supported with operational cash flows that showed a $700 million improvement over 2014. We are making solid progress. And once we have an outcome in our Ohio ESP, we should be in a position to provide 2016 full year earnings expectations and shed more light in the next couple of years, including our regulated growth projections and any future equity needs to support our growth initiatives.
It remains our priority to continue strengthening our balance sheet and further derisk our competitive business. These steps will help ensure we are well positioned to pursue the next period of regulated growth and success benefiting our 6 million customers and the local economies we serve, our investors and our employees.
Now I'll turn the call over to Jim for a brief review of the quarter. As always, we reserve plenty of time for your questions before the end of the hour."

As always, I will remind you that detailed information about the quarter can be found on the consolidated report that was posted to our website yesterday evening. We also welcome your questions during the Q&A following the call.
Our fourth quarter operating earnings of $0.58 per share compares to $0.80 per share in the fourth quarter 2014. On a GAAP basis, we reported a loss of $0.53 per share for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to a loss of $0.73 per share during the same period last year. 
2015 fourth quarter GAAP results include special items totaling $1.11 per share. I'll spend a few moments on 2 of those items before moving to the review of operating results. 
The first of these is the impairment charge related to our investment in the Signal Peak mine. As Chuck mentioned earlier on the call, given the weak market for coal global, in the fourth quarter we wrote off our investment in the Global Holding, the parent company of Signal Peak, resulting in a noncash pretax charge of $362 million or $0.56 per share, which reduced the value of this investment to 0. As some of you may remember, back in 2011, FirstEnergy sold a portion of its ownership interest in Signal Peak, receiving $258 million in cash proceeds and recognizing a $370 million after-tax gain, which included a sizable step up in the 1/3 interest we retained. Presently, the mine remains operational, and FirstEnergy continues to provide a full guarantee on Global Holdings' $300 million term loan. Since this investment is no longer a strategic fit for FirstEnergy, we have moved the earnings associated with Signal Peak from our competitive segment to corporate other for all periods.
The second special item is a $0.35 per share annual pension and OPEB mark-to-market adjustment, another noncash item. As discussed in our third quarter call, we anticipate a discharge given the plan's investment performance, which was partially offset by a 25 basis points increase in the discount rate. I will note that for 2016, we have $381 million in required minimum pension funding, with $160 million already contributed to the plan last month.
Let's spend some time walking through the fourth quarter drivers by business units followed by a brief review of the full year. In our distribution business, total deliveries decreased 6% in the quarter or 2% on a weather-adjusted basis. Residential sales decreased 10.6% and commercial sales decreased 3.4% compared to the fourth quarter 2014. Our region saw the mildest fourth quarter temperatures in at least 35 years with heating degree days that were nearly 30% below both last year and normal. The decrease in customer use also reflects the adoption of energy-efficient lighting and the impact of other energy efficiency measures. We continue to analyze these efficiency trends, and we plan to discuss the expected impact on our load forecast over the next few years when we hold our analyst meeting.
Sales to industrial customers decreased 3.9% in the quarter as a result of lower usage from our steel, mining, chemical, electric, coal equipment and manufacturing customers, partially offset by increased usage from the shale gas and automotive sectors. Distribution results were also impacted by higher operating expenses, which included planned reliability spend in the quarter, primarily at JCP&L. 
In our transmission business, fourth quarter operating earnings increased as a result of high revenue associated with a higher rate base and ATSI's forward-looking rate structure, which become effective in January 2015, partially offset by a lower return on equity at ATSI as part of its comprehensive settlement that was approved by FERC in October.
In our competitive business, we recorded strong fourth quarter operating earnings as higher commodity margin was offset with higher operating expenses.  The impact of lower contract sales was offset by higher capacity revenues, lower purchase power, fuel and transmission expenses and increased sales to the wholesale market, reflecting our more open position.
Operating costs for the competitive business were higher in the fourth quarter 2015, primarily due to expenses related to the nuclear refueling outage at JCP&L coal value unit 2.  Finally, at corporate, a higher effective income tax rate and higher interest and operating expenses reduced operating earnings by $0.08, in line with our expectations.
Now I'll take a couple minutes to discuss full year results and review the key earnings drivers for 2015. Operating earnings were $2.71 per share compared to $2.56 in 2014. GAAP earnings were $1.37 per share in 2015 compared to $0.71 in the prior year. 
On our Regulated Distribution utilities, 2015 operating earnings were in line with our guidance. The net benefit of resolved rate case and generally favorable weather was offset primarily by higher operating expenses associated with planned reliability maintenance.  Total distribution deliveries decreased about 1% compared to 2014.  In the industrial segment, sales declined primarily due to decreased steel and mining production. Sales to residential and commercial customers were essentially flat compared to the prior year. 
In the Regulated Transmission segment, operating earnings increased primarily as a result of a higher rate base and a forward-looking rate structure at ATSI in the company's Regulated Transmission business. In our competitive business, operating earnings increased significantly, primarily due to improved commodity margin related to higher capacity prices. Adjusted EBITDA was $949 million, in line with our expectations. 
You'll recall that we began the effort to reposition our sales portfolio in the second quarter of 2014. Our total retail customer count at the end of 2015 was 1.6 million, a decrease of 445,000 from December 31, 2014.
We sold about 75 million megawatt-hours in 2015, including 68 million megawatt-hours of contract sales and an additional 7 million megawatt-hours of wholesale. We currently have about 61 million megawatt-hours committed for 2016. And for 2017, about 38 million megawatt-hours are committed or about half of our expected generation resources. The Ohio PPA would add approximately 23 million megawatt-hours on an annual basis, which would essentially close our sales positions through the first half of 2017.
In the corporate segment, 2015 operating earnings were consistent with our guidance, reflecting higher interest and operating expenses as well as a more normal effective income tax rate. 
2015 should be recognized as a pivotal year for our company. We were able to raise the operating earnings guidance that we provided, reduce risks and build a solid platform for regulated growth. We're confident that our efforts will help us reach our goal of creating long-term value for FirstEnergy shareholders.
Now I'd like to open the call up to your questions."

And my view is the best investments we can make are the ones that customers are willing to pay for and that invest in. So the opportunity is there for us to make these kind of investments for a long time. The ability to add on an annual basis to that is a little bit challenged by the availability of transmission construction workforce in our country. So I wouldn't expect that you would see a huge increase on an annual basis, but you could extrapolate out quite a bit into the future how long we can continue to execute this program."

There hasn't been a lot of change. That means that the Ohio commission is still, in order to approve the PPA, would have to find that the ESP is better than the MRO. They would still be protecting customers. So if you look at this kind of things, again I don't think that it's something that the FERC should rescind, if you would. But if they had to do that, what would happen, they would likely apply the rule. So you can look at the different provisions how they look at that point. There's several ways to comply with the rule, and one of them looks at nonprice terms and conditions. So we would be looking at a hearing, dealing with our PPA on I think, there are a lot of things that could be said around and long-term pricing conditions that would allow the pricing to stand as well."

So if you think about the parade of horribles that others highlighted in their complaint with FERC, they talked about if you let these generating units look regulated, have an effect what they call an out-of-market subsidy, that would crash the marketplace. Well, if you think about PJM, as Chuck alluded to earlier, 20% of PJM is already regulated and that doesn't even include the entities. And if you think about what they were talking about, the bidding aspect of this, it's public information that prior to capacity performance, 3/4 or 75% of the megawatts in the PJM capacity auction bid at 0. So they bid at price takers. And after a CP, it is about roughly half. But if you think about it with the new penalty, that the associated with that penalty should be kind of your new 0.

In 2015, we made tremendous progress on major initiatives across our company. We put a number of obstacles behind us and completed critical work necessary to implement our regulated growth strategy going forward. At the same time, we consistently met our financial commitments to you. Last night, we reported operating earnings of $0.58 per share for the fourth quarter and $2.71 per share for the year. These results, which reflect improved operations at our competitive business as well as growth in our transmission business, are above our initial guidance range for 2015 and in line with the revised estimates that we provided during our third quarter call, despite the mild weather we experienced in the fourth quarter.
For the first quarter of 2016, we have provided operating earnings guidance of $0.75 to $0.85 per share. As we will discuss later, we intend to provide additional guidance once we have an outcome in our Ohio Electric Security Plan. Before we move to Jim's financial review, I'll take a few minutes to discuss the key events from 2015.
First, we removed the regulatory uncertainty and important steps to position our regulated utilities for growth with the conclusion of rate cases in West Virginia, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Resolving these cases allows us to plan for additional infrastructure and reliability investments at those utilities.
In Pennsylvania, we took that next step by following long-term infrastructure improvement plans for each of our 4 operating companies in October. These plans, which were approved by the Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission last week, outlined a projected increase in capital investment of nearly $245 million over 5 years to help strengthen, upgrade and modernize our Pennsylvania distribution systems. Yesterday, we filed for approval to implement a distribution system improvement charge at each of the 4 operating companies, which will allow us to recover quarterly costs associated with the capital projects approved in the LTIPs.
In Ohio, we achieved an important milestone for our latest Electric Security Plan by reaching a settlement agreement with the staff of the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio and 16 other parties, including EnerNOC, an energy management solutions provider; Ohio Partners for Affordable Energy, a low-income customer advocacy group; and IGS Energy, an independent energy supplier. The agreement outlines the ambitious steps to safeguard Ohio customers against retail price increases and volatility in future years, deploying new energy efficiency programs and providing clear path to a cleaner, energy future by reducing carbon emissions. Our settlement includes an 8-year retail rate stability rider associated with the proposed purchase power agreement. This provision will help protect the customers against rising retail prices and market volatility, while helping preserve vital baseload power plants that serve Ohio customers and provide thousands of jobs in the state. The PPA includes the Sammis plant in Stratton, Ohio; the Davis-Besse nuclear power station in Oak Harbor, Ohio, which recently received approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for a 20-year license extension; and a portion of the output of 2 OVEC plants. The procedural schedule for our Ohio case is nearly complete with hearings concluded, initial briefs filed and reply briefs due next Friday. A decision from the PUCO is expected in March.
Clearly, there's a lot of talk about the PPA as all interested parties seek to have their voices heard. We firmly believe that our plan serves the best interest of Ohio customers and Ohio communities, while supporting competitive markets in the state and PJM. This generation will continue to be offered into PJM's energy and capacity markets, and the PPA will have no impact on our standard service offer or customers' ability to shop for their retail electric supply. In fact, we expect that the output from these plants would be treated no differently than the 20% of regulated generation that currently clears in the PJM markets. And that 20% does not include imports into PJM, which, from MISO, would be primarily regulated generation.
I'm sure you'll have lots of questions about the legal and regulatory process, and Leila is standing by to share our perspective during the Q&A. We believe our plan is the right one for Ohio, and we remain very optimistic in the outcome, both in Ohio and at FERC.
Let's turn to our transmission business. We just passed the halfway point of the first phase of our Energizing the Future transmission investment initiative to meet the reliability needs of our customers and communities. We remain on track to meet our target of $4.2 billion in spending during the 2014 through 2017 time frame. Consistent with our plan, we spent $2.4 billion in 2014 and 2015, including $986 million last year on projects to address service reliability, grid modernization and growth. We completed major initiatives to address last year's Northeast Ohio plant deactivations and brought online critical new infrastructure to support midstream gas operations in our region. 
Work in 2016 is expected to include $1 billion in investments on projects such as synchronous condensers at our Eastlake plant; newline construction project in West Virginia and New Jersey; static bar compensator projects in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and West Virginia; and several new substations, line rebuilds and re-conductoring projects. While expansion in the shell market has cooled, we expect investments over the next several years of about $150 million for work that is already in the pipeline.
We also addressed several matters in 2015 that support future investment in this important long-term growth platform. During the fourth quarter, FERC approved our settlement for a forward-looking formula rate structure at our ATSI subsidiary, which permits more timely recovery of our investments. In addition, in June, we filed to create a new subsidiary named Mid-Atlantic Interstate Transmission or MAIT. This subsidiary would hold the transmission assets of Met-Ed, Penelec and JCP&L and facilitate new investments that can improve service reliability for those customers. Our proposal is on FERC's agenda for tomorrow, and we are seeking approval from both the Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission and the New Jersey Bureau of Public Utilities by the middle of the year. These structural changes are important steps to ensure timely recovery of our investments and set the stage for continued growth through our Energizing the Future transmission initiative.
Turning to our competitive operations. The PJM capacity market reforms approved by FERC have already begun to have a positive impact on the capacity auction process, although the markets continued to fall well short of being comprehensive baseload generation units. Our revised competitive strategy focusing on stabilizing the business by reducing risks also produced positive results. In 2015, we sold 75 million megawatt-hours while significantly reducing our exposure to weather-sensitive load and executing a rigorous commitment to economically dispatching our units. As a result, we mitigated the impact of severe weather in the first quarter of 2015 and achieved adjusted EBITDA of $949 million. This is in line with the revised guidance that we provided in October and reflects solid operational results as well as the impact of our Cash Flow Improvement Project.
We're holding off on providing adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2017 and 2018 until our Analyst Meeting, following the PUCO decision in Ohio. However, we are reaffirming both our 2016 adjusted EBITDA guidance range for the competitive business of $950 million to $1.05 billion and our expectation that the business will be cash flow positive each year through at least 2018.
Before I move from our competitive segment, I'll mention that, given the significant decline in the global core market, we impaired our investment in the Signal Peak mine, resulting in a $362 million pretax noncash charge, which Jim will cover in more detail.
Finally, I will spend a few moments discussing our cash flow improvement plan and other financial matters. We took a very important step to improve our financial metrics and balance sheet in 2015 through the launch of the Cash Flow Improvement Project. This initiative began in the spring with a goal to capture meaningful and sustainable savings opportunities and process improvements across the company, while continuing to fully meet the needs of our customers, our organization and our employees. I'm very pleased with the results of this effort to date. We are on track to capture $155 million in savings this year and $240 million annually by 2017, up from our initial goal of $200 million over the time frame. The results from this initiative will allow us to essentially hold our own [indiscernible] through 2017. 
We put a lot of risk behind us in 2015, including key initiatives that provide our company with greater strength and flexibility as we pursue our regulated growth plans. I'm also gratified by the response from the rating agencies. In December, citing our shift in the strategy and more credit-friendly business risk profile, Fitch revised its outlook from stable to positive. Days later, Moody's affirmed its Baa3 rating with a stable outlook for FirstEnergy Corp., FES and Allegheny Energy Supply, citing our Ohio ESP settlement. 
Over the past year, I've gotten to know many of you, and I've shared my leadership philosophy, including my commitment to make our company more transparent. I hope you've seen that in action over the past year.
I've told you one of our primary objectives is to improve the quality of our earnings. This year, 2 significant noncash adjustments got in the way. The annual mark-to-market for pension and OPEB will remain an annual adjustment, either up or down, and the impairment of the Signal Peak coal mine is required, given the current market for coal and the fact that this isn't a core asset for us. Outside of these 2 items, earnings quality in 2015 was very solid and supported with operational cash flows that showed a $700 million improvement over 2014. We are making solid progress. And once we have an outcome in our Ohio ESP, we should be in a position to provide 2016 full year earnings expectations and shed more light on the next couple of years, including our regulated growth projections and any future equity needs to support our growth initiatives.
It remains our priority to continue strengthening our balance sheet and further derisk our competitive business. These steps will help ensure we are well positioned to pursue the next period of regulated growth and success benefiting our 6 million customers and the local economies we serve, our investors and our employees.
Now I'll turn the call over to Jim for a brief review of the quarter. As always, we reserve plenty of time for your questions before the end of the hour."

As always, I will remind you that detailed information about the quarter can be found on the consolidated report that was posted to our website yesterday evening. We also welcome your questions during the Q&A or following the call.
Our fourth quarter operating earnings of $0.58 per share compares to $0.80 per share in the fourth quarter of 2014. On a GAAP basis, we reported a loss of $0.53 per share for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to a loss of $0.73 per share during the same period last year. 
2015 fourth quarter GAAP results include special items totaling $1.11 per share. I'll spend a few moments on 2 of those items before moving to the review of operating results. 
The first of these is the impairment charge related to our investment in the Signal Peak mine. As Chuck mentioned earlier on the call, given the weak market for coal globally in the fourth quarter, we wrote off our investment in Global Holding, the parent company of Signal Peak, resulting in a noncash pretax charge of $362 million or $0.56 per share, which reduced the value of this investment to 0. As some of you may remember, back in 2011, FirstEnergy sold a portion of its ownership interest in Signal Peak, receiving $258 million in cash proceeds and recognizing a $370 million after-tax gain, which included a sizable step-up in the 1/3 interest we retained. Presently, the mine remains operational, and FirstEnergy continues to provide a full guarantee on Global Holding's $300 million term loan. Since this investment is no longer a strategic fit for FirstEnergy, we have moved the earnings associated with Signal Peak from our competitive segment to corporate other for all periods.
The second special item is a $0.35 per share annual pension and OPEB mark-to-market adjustment, another noncash item. As discussed in our third quarter call, we anticipate a discharge given the plan's investment performance, which was partially offset by a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate. I will note that, for 2016, we have $381 million in required minimum pension funding with $160 million already contributed to the plan last month.
Let's spend some time walking through the fourth quarter drivers by business units, followed by a brief review of the full year. In our distribution business, total deliveries decreased 6% in the quarter or 2% on a weather-adjusted basis. Residential sales decreased 10.6% and commercial sales decreased 3.4% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. Our region saw the mildest fourth quarter temperatures in at least 35 years with heating degree days that were nearly 30% below, both last year and normal. The decrease in customer use also reflects the adoption of energy-efficient lighting and the impact of other energy efficiency measures. We continue to analyze these efficiency trends, and we plan to discuss the expected impact on our load forecast over the next few years when we hold our Analyst Meeting.
Sales to industrial customers decreased 3.9% in the quarter as a result of lower usage from our steel, mining, chemical, electrical equipment and manufacturing customers, partially offset by increased usage from the shale gas and automotive sectors. Distribution results were also impacted by higher operating expenses, which included planned reliability spend in the quarter, primarily at JCP&L. 
In our transmission business, fourth quarter operating earnings increased as a result of high revenue associated with a higher rate base and ATSI's forward-looking rate structure, which became effective in January 2015, partially offset by a lower return on equity at ATSI as part of its comprehensive settlement that was approved by FERC in October.
In our competitive business, we recorded strong fourth quarter operating earnings as higher commodity margin was offset with higher operating expenses. The impact of lower contract sales was offset by higher capacity revenues, lower purchase power, fuel and transmission expenses and increased sales to the wholesale market, reflecting our more open position.
Operating costs for the competitive business were higher in the fourth quarter of 2015, primarily due to expenses related to the nuclear refueling outage at Beaver Valley Unit 2.  Finally, at corporate, a higher effective income tax rate and higher interest and operating expenses reduced operating earnings by $0.08, in line with our expectations.
Now I'll take a couple minutes to discuss full year results and review the key earnings drivers for 2015. Operating earnings were $2.71 per share compared to $2.56 in 2014. GAAP earnings were $1.37 per share in 2015 compared to $0.71 in the prior year. 
At our regulated distribution utilities, 2015 operating earnings were in line with our guidance. The net benefit of resolved rate cases and generally favorable weather was offset, primarily by higher operating expenses associated with planned reliability maintenance. Total distribution deliveries decreased about 1% compared to 2014. In the industrial segment, sales declined, primarily due to decreased steel and mining production. Sales to residential and commercial customers were essentially flat compared to the prior year. 
In the regulated transmission segment, operating earnings increased, primarily as a result of a higher rate base and a forward-looking rate structure at ATSI in the company's regulated transmission business. In our competitive business, operating earnings increased significantly, primarily due to improved commodity margin related to higher capacity prices. Adjusted EBITDA was $949 million, in line with our expectations. 
You'll recall that we began the effort to reposition our sales portfolio in the second quarter of 2014. Our total retail customer count at the end of 2015 was 1.6 million, a decrease of 445,000 from December 31, 2014.
We sold about 75 million megawatt-hours in 2015, including 68 million megawatt-hours of contract sales and an additional 7 million megawatt-hours of wholesale. We currently have about 61 million megawatt-hours committed for 2016. And for 2017, about 38 million megawatt-hours are committed or about half of our expected generation resources. The Ohio PPA would add approximately 23 million megawatt-hours on an annual basis, which would essentially close our sales positions through the first half of 2017.
In the corporate segment, 2015 operating earnings were consistent with our guidance, reflecting higher interest and operating expenses as well as a more normal effective income tax rate. 
2015 should be recognized as a pivotal year for our company. We were able to raise the operating earnings guidance that we provided, reduce risk and build a solid platform for regulated growth. We're confident that our efforts will help us reach our goal of creating long-term value for FirstEnergy shareholders.
Now I'd like to open the call up to your questions."

And what we do with those projects is we prioritize them in the best way to drive benefits for customers, and my view is that the best investments we can make are the ones that customers are willing to pay for and that you are willing to invest in. So the opportunity is there for us to make these kind of investments for a long time. The ability to add on an annual basis to that is a little bit challenged by the availability of transmission construction workforce in our country. So I wouldn't expect that you would see a huge increase on an annual basis, but you could extrapolate out quite a bit into the future how long we can continue to execute this program."

So right now, we have an affiliate labor and the basis upon which it was granted provided have not changed. If you think about it, Ohio is still -- the customers are not captive. They can shop. There hasn't been a lot of change. That means that the Ohio commission is still -- in order to approve the PPA, would have to find that the ESP is better than the MRO. They would still be protecting customers. So if you look at those kind of things, again, I don't think that it's something that the FERC should rescind, if you would. But if they were to do that, what would happen, they would likely apply the aggra rule. So you could look at the different provisions of how they look at that. There are several ways to comply with the aggra rule, and one of them looks at non-price terms and conditions. So we would be looking at a hearing, dealing with our PPA on -- I think, there are a lot of things that could be said around the long-term pricing conditions that would allow the pricing to stand as well."

So if you think about the parade of horribles that others highlighted in their complaint with FERC, they talked about if you let these generating units look regulated, have an effect what they call an out-of-market subsidy, that would crash the marketplace. Well, if you think about PJM, as Chuck alluded to earlier, 20% of PJM is already regulated and that doesn't even include the FRR entities. And if you think about what they were talking about, the bidding aspect of this, it's public information that prior to capacity performance, 3/4 or 75% of the megawatts in the PJM capacity auction bid at 0. So they bid at price takers. And after CP, it was about roughly half. But if you think about it with the new penalty, that the -- what you associated with that penalty should kind of be your new 0. So I would suggest that the new price takers is actually even higher than 50%.

In 2015, we made tremendous progress on major initiatives across our company. We put a number of obstacles behind us and completed critical work necessary to implement our regulated growth strategy going forward. At the same time, we consistently met our financial commitments to you. Last night, we reported operating earnings of $0.58 per share for the fourth quarter and $2.71 per share for the year. These results, which reflect improved operations at our competitive business as well as growth in our transmission business are above our initial guidance range for 2015 and in line with the revised estimates that we provided during our third quarter call, despite the mild weather we experienced in the fourth quarter.
For the first quarter of 2016, we have provided operating earnings guidance of $0.75 to $0.85 per share. As we will discuss later, we intend to provide additional guidance once we have an outcome in our Ohio Electric Security Plan. Before we move to Jim's financial review, I'll take a few minutes to discuss the key events from 2015.
First, we removed regulatory uncertainty and important steps to position our regulated utilities for growth with the conclusion of rate cases in West Virginia, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. Resolving these cases allows us to plan for additional infrastructure and reliability investments at those utilities.
In Pennsylvania, we took that next step by following long-term infrastructure improvement plans for each of our 4 operating companies in October. These plans, which were approved by the Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission last week, outline a projected increase in capital investment of nearly $245 million over 5 years to help strengthen, upgrade and modernize our Pennsylvania distribution systems. Yesterday, we filed for approval to implement a distribution system improvement charge at each of the 4 operating companies, which will allow us to recover quarterly costs associated with the capital projects approved in the LTIPs.
In Ohio, we achieved an important milestone for our latest Electric Security Plan by reaching a settlement agreement with the staff of the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio and 16 other parties, including EnerNOC, an energy management solutions provider; Ohio Partners for Affordable Energy, a low-income customer advocacy group; and IGS Energy, an independent energy supplier. The agreement outlines the ambitious steps to safeguard Ohio customers against retail price increases and volatility in future years, deploy new energy efficiency programs and provide a clear path to a cleaner energy future by reducing carbon emissions. Our settlement includes an 8-year retail rate stability rider associated with the proposed purchase power agreement. This provision will help protect the customers against rising retail prices and market volatility while helping preserve vital baseload power plants that serve Ohio customers and provide thousands of jobs in the state. The PPA includes the Sammis plant in Stratton, Ohio; the Davis-Besse nuclear power station in Oak Harbor, Ohio, which recently received approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for a 20-year license extension; and a portion of the output of 2 OVEC plants. The procedural schedule for our Ohio case is nearly complete, with hearings concluded, initial briefs filed and reply briefs due next Friday. A decision from the PUCO is expected in March.
Clearly, there's a lot of talk about the PPA as all interested parties seek to have their voices heard. We firmly believe that our plan serves the best interest of Ohio customers and Ohio communities while supporting competitive markets in the state and PJM. This generation will continue to be offered into PJM's energy and capacity markets, and the PPA will have no impact on our standard service offer or customers' ability to shop for their retail electric supply. In fact, we expect that the output from these plants will be treated no differently than the 20% of regulated generation that currently clears in the PJM markets. And that 20% does not include imports into PJM, which, from MISO, would be primarily regulated generation.
I'm sure you'll have lots of questions about the legal and regulatory process, and Leila is standing by to share our perspective during the Q&A. We believe our plan is the right one for Ohio, and we remain very optimistic in the outcome, both in Ohio and at FERC.
Let's turn to our transmission business. We just passed the halfway point of the first phase of our Energizing the Future transmission investment initiative to meet the reliability needs of our customers and communities. We remain on track to meet our target of $4.2 billion in spending during the 2014 through 2017 time frame. Consistent with our plan, we spent $2.4 billion in 2014 and 2015, including $986 million last year on projects to address service reliability, grid modernization and growth. We completed major initiatives to address last year's Northeast Ohio plant deactivations and brought online critical new infrastructure to support midstream gas operations in our region. 
Work in 2016 is expected to include $1 billion in investments on projects such as synchronous condensers at our Eastlake plant; newline construction projects in West Virginia and New Jersey; static bar compensator projects in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and West Virginia; and several new substations, line rebuilds and re-conductoring projects. While expansion in the shale markets has cooled, we expect investments over the next several years of about $150 million for work that is already in the pipeline.
We also addressed several matters in 2015 that support future investment in this important long-term growth platform. During the fourth quarter, FERC approved our settlement for a forward-looking formula rate structure at our ATSI subsidiary, which permits more timely recovery of our investments. In addition, in June, we filed to create a new subsidiary named Mid-Atlantic Interstate Transmission, or MAIT. This subsidiary would hold the transmission assets of Met-Ed, Penelec and JCP&L and facilitate new investments that can improve service reliability for those customers. Our proposal is on FERC's agenda for tomorrow, and we are seeking approval from both the Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission and the New Jersey Bureau of Public Utilities by the middle of the year. These structural changes are important steps to ensure timely recovery of our investments and set the stage for continued growth through our Energizing the Future transmission initiative.
Turning to our competitive operations. The PJM capacity market reforms approved by FERC have already begun to have a positive impact on the capacity auction process, although the markets continue to fall well short of being [indiscernible] baseload generation units. Our revised competitive strategy focusing on stabilizing the business by reducing risks also produced positive results. In 2015, we sold 75 million megawatt-hours while significantly reducing our exposure to weather-sensitive load and executing a rigorous commitment to economically dispatching our units. As a result, we mitigated the impact of severe weather in the first quarter of 2015 and achieved adjusted EBITDA of $949 million. This is in line with the revised guidance that we provided in October and reflects solid operational results as well as the impact of our Cash Flow Improvement Project.
We're holding off on providing adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2017 and 2018 until our Analyst Meeting, following the PUCO decision in Ohio. However, we are reaffirming both our 2016 adjusted EBITDA guidance range for the competitive business of $950 million to $1.05 billion and our expectation that the business will be cash flow positive each year through at least 2018.
Before I move from our competitive segment, I'll mention that, given the significant decline in the global core market, we impaired our investment in the Signal Peak mine, resulting in a $362 million pretax noncash charge, which Jim will cover in more detail.
Finally, I will spend a few moments discussing our cash flow improvement plan and other financial matters. We took a very important step to improve our financial metrics and balance sheet in 2015 through the launch of the Cash Flow Improvement Project. This initiative began in the spring with a goal to capture meaningful and sustainable savings opportunities and process improvements across the company, while continuing to fully meet the needs of our customers, our organization and our employees. I'm very pleased with the results of this effort to date. We are on track to capture $155 million in savings this year and $240 million annually by 2017, up from our initial goal of $200 million over the time frame. The results from this initiative will allow us to essentially hold our own and flat [ph] through 2017. 
We put a lot of risk behind us in 2015, including key initiatives that provide our company with greater strength and flexibility as we pursue our regulated growth plans. I'm also gratified by the response from the rating agencies. In December, citing our shift in strategy and more credit-friendly business risk profile, Fitch revised its outlook from stable to positive. Days later, Moody's affirmed its Baa3 rating with a stable outlook for FirstEnergy Corp., FES and Allegheny Energy Supply, citing our Ohio ESP settlement. 
Over the past year, I've gotten to know many of you, and I've shared my leadership philosophy, including my commitment to make our company more transparent. I hope you've seen that in action over the past year.
I've told you one of our primary objectives is to improve the quality of our earnings. This year, 2 significant noncash adjustments got in the way. The annual mark-to-market for pension and OPEB will remain an annual adjustment, either up or down, and the impairment of the Signal Peak coal mine is required, given the current market for coal and the fact that this isn't a core asset for us. Outside of these 2 items, earnings quality in 2015 was very solid and supported with operational cash flows that showed a $700 million improvement over 2014. We are making solid progress. And once we have an outcome in our Ohio ESP, we should be in a position to provide 2016 full year earnings expectations and shed more light on the next couple of years, including our regulated growth projections and any future equity needs to support our growth initiatives.
It remains our priority to continue strengthening our balance sheet and further derisk our competitive business. These steps will help ensure we are well positioned to pursue the next period of regulated growth and success benefiting our 6 million customers and the local economies we serve, our investors and our employees.
Now I'll turn the call over to Jim for a brief review of the quarter. As always, we reserve plenty of time for your questions before the end of the hour."

As always, I will remind you that detailed information about the quarter can be found on the consolidated report that was posted to our website yesterday evening. We also welcome your questions during the Q&A or following the call.
Our fourth quarter operating earnings of $0.58 per share compares to $0.80 per share in the fourth quarter of 2014. On a GAAP basis, we reported a loss of $0.53 per share for the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to a loss of $0.73 per share during the same period last year. 
2015 fourth quarter GAAP results include special items totaling $1.11 per share. I'll spend a few moments on 2 of those items before moving to the review of operating results. 
The first of these is the impairment charge related to our investment in the Signal Peak mine. As Chuck mentioned earlier on the call, given the weak market for coal globally, in the fourth quarter, we wrote off our investment in Global Holding, the parent company of Signal Peak, resulting in a noncash pretax charge of $362 million or $0.56 per share, which reduced the value of this investment to 0. As some of you may remember, back in 2011, FirstEnergy sold a portion of its ownership interest in Signal Peak, receiving $258 million in cash proceeds and recognizing a $370 million after-tax gain, which included a sizable step-up in the 1/3 interest we retained. Presently, the mine remains operational, and FirstEnergy continues to provide a full guarantee on Global Holding's $300 million term loan. Since this investment is no longer a strategic fit for FirstEnergy, we have moved the earnings associated with Signal Peak from our competitive segment to corporate other for all periods.
The second special item is a $0.35 per share annual pension and OPEB mark-to-market adjustment, another noncash item. As discussed in our third quarter call, we anticipated this charge, given the plan's investment performance, which was partially offset by a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate. I will note that, for 2016, we have $381 million in required minimum pension funding, with $160 million already contributed to the plan last month.
Let's spend some time walking through the fourth quarter drivers by business units, followed by a brief review of the full year. In our distribution business, total deliveries decreased 6% in the quarter or 2% on a weather-adjusted basis. Residential sales decreased 10.6%, and commercial sales decreased 3.4% compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. Our region saw the mildest fourth quarter temperatures in at least 35 years, with heating degree days that were nearly 30% below both last year and normal. The decrease in customer use also reflects the adoption of energy-efficient lighting and the impact of other energy efficiency measures. We continue to analyze these efficiency trends, and we plan to discuss the expected impact on our load forecast over the next few years when we hold our Analyst Meeting.
Sales to industrial customers decreased 3.9% in the quarter as a result of lower usage from our steel, mining, chemical, electrical equipment and manufacturing customers, partially offset by increased usage from the shale gas and automotive sectors. Distribution results were also impacted by higher operating expenses, which included planned reliability spend in the quarter, primarily at JCP&L. 
In our transmission business, fourth quarter operating earnings increased as a result of higher revenue associated with a higher rate base and ATSI's forward-looking rate structure, which became effective in January 2015, partially offset by a lower return on equity at ATSI as part of its comprehensive settlement that was approved by FERC in October.
In our competitive business, we recorded strong fourth quarter operating earnings as higher commodity margin was offset with higher operating expenses. The impact of lower contract sales was offset by higher capacity revenues, lower purchase power, fuel and transmission expenses and increased sales to the wholesale market, reflecting our more open position.
Operating costs for the competitive business were higher in the fourth quarter of 2015, primarily due to expenses related to the nuclear refueling outage at Beaver Valley Unit 2.  Finally, at corporate, a higher effective income tax rate and higher interest and operating expenses reduced operating earnings by $0.08, in line with our expectations.
Now I'll take a couple of minutes to discuss full year results and review the key earnings drivers for 2015. Operating earnings were $2.71 per share compared to $2.56 in 2014. GAAP earnings were $1.37 per share in 2015 compared to $0.71 in the prior year. 
At our regulated distribution utilities, 2015 operating earnings were in line with our guidance. The net benefit of resolved rate cases and generally favorable weather was offset primarily by higher operating expenses associated with planned reliability maintenance. Total distribution deliveries decreased about 1% compared to 2014. In the industrial segment, sales declined, primarily due to decreased steel and mining production. Sales to residential and commercial customers were essentially flat compared to the prior year. 
In the regulated transmission segment, operating earnings increased, primarily as a result of a higher rate base and a forward-looking rate structure at ATSI in the company's regulated transmission business. In our competitive business, operating earnings increased significantly, primarily due to improved commodity margin related to higher capacity prices. Adjusted EBITDA was $949 million, in line with our expectations. 
You'll recall that we began the effort to reposition our sales portfolio in the second quarter of 2014. Our total retail customer count at the end of 2015 was 1.6 million, a decrease of 445,000 from December 31, 2014.
We sold about 75 million megawatt-hours in 2015, including 68 million megawatt-hours of contract sales and an additional 7 million megawatt-hours of wholesale. We currently have about 61 million megawatt-hours committed for 2016. And for 2017, about 38 million megawatt-hours are committed, or about half of our expected generation resources. The Ohio PPA would add approximately 23 million megawatt-hours on an annual basis, which would essentially close our sales positions through the first half of 2017.
In the corporate segment, 2015 operating earnings were consistent with our guidance, reflecting higher interest and operating expenses as well as a more normal effective income tax rate. 
2015 should be recognized as a pivotal year for our company. We were able to raise the operating earnings guidance that we provided, reduce risk and build a solid platform for regulated growth. We're confident that our efforts will help us reach our goal of creating long-term value for FirstEnergy shareholders.
Now I'd like to open the call up to your questions."

So the opportunity is there for us to make these kind of investments for a long time. The ability to add on an annual basis to that is a little bit challenged by the availability of transmission construction workforce in our country.

There hasn't been a law change. That means that the Ohio commission is still -- in order to approve the PPA, would have to find that the ESP is better than the MRO. They would still be protecting customers. So if you look at those kind of things, again, I don't think that it's something that the FERC should rescind, if you would. But if they were to do that, what would happen, they would likely apply the Edgar rule. So you could look at the different provisions of how they look at that. There are several ways to comply with the Edgar rule, and one of them looks at non-price terms and conditions. So we would be looking at a hearing dealing with our PPA, and I think there are a lot of things that could be said around the long-term [ph] price and conditions that would allow the pricing to stand as well."

Thanks for joining us. We're off to a strong start in 2016 and I'm pleased to share this update with you today. Yesterday afternoon, we reported solid operating earnings of $0.80 per share, which is at the midpoint",1948,"Thanks, Meghan. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. We're off to a strong start in 2016 and I'm pleased to share this update with you today. Yesterday afternoon, we reported solid operating earnings of $0.80 per share, which is at the midpoint of our first quarter guidance. On a GAAP basis, earnings were $0.78 per share. While Jim will review our financial results in more detail, I want to quickly mention that we've produced quality results and met our operating earnings guidance despite the impact of an unseasonably mild winter and low power prices. The successful implementation of our economic dispatch strategy was key to that outcome because the fuel savings that resulted from idling some units when market prices did not support them, helped to offset the other impacts of mild temperatures across the company, particularly in our distribution business. 
In addition to meeting our financial commitments to you, we continue to implement our regulated growth strategies. We have several positive developments on that front and we will provide more detail today on our next steps to ensure continued service reliability for our customers with appropriate recovery of our investments. Let's start in Ohio where the Public Utilities Commission completed a comprehensive, nearly two-year review of our Powering Ohio's progress electric security plan and unanimously approved the plan with certain modifications. The PUCO concluded that the approved plan promotes rate stability and retail competition and adds value for Ohio customers, communities and the environment. I would both like to complement and thank our Public Utilities commissioners and staff for their leadership in handling a very complex regulatory matter. I am proud of this ESP and of the entire team that worked on it. The plan helped safeguard customers against rising energy prices in future years while preserving key power plants that serve Ohio customers, ensuring fuel diversity and maintaining Ohio jobs. In addition, it outlines steps to support low income customers, reinstates energy efficiency programs, evaluate smart grid technologies and includes the goal to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. It truly fulfills the principles of the Ohio legislature outlined for the electric security plans when they move the state toward retail competition. Clearly, it's been a long and contentious process to get to this point and while PUCO approval is a critical milestone, there are still challenges at FERC. Our opponents have also expressed their intent to bring court challenges. I will quickly review our position on these issues and Leila can address your additional questions during unit. First, we believe FERC should have firm the waiver that is already in place. You recall that FES was granted from FERC to conduct certain transactions with our Ohio utilities in 2008. Our purchase power agreement is one of those transactions. It was carefully constructed from the beginning to comply with existing FERC rules that promote customer shopping for retail energy supply and it will not hinder the PGM market's ability to function and foster competition. A separate complaint ask for it to enclose a price floor for the EPA units for May 2016, PGM, RPM capacity auction. We don't believe there's any reason for our PPA units to be treated differently than any of the other regulated generation in PJM. It's no secret that a significant amount of generation, both regulated and merchant, has been offered into prior PJM options with price taking behavior. Some of these complainants are likely in that group of suppliers. What they are asking FERC to do is essentially have FirstEnergy protect them from themselves. We have filed a strong answer demonstrating that the price floor is not needed and challenging the economic theory behind the opposition's price for methodology and we do not expect that FERC will impose a price floor on the EPA units in the upcoming option. With regards to the other potential challenges, we believe that PUCO's decision is well within the commissions authority and we expect it will withstand subsequent challenges. Furthermore, the notion of non-by passable charges on Ohio utility bills is not new as charges for programs such as energy efficiency, economic development and low-income support, as well as cost to support the bulk transmission system have been in place for years. Given that FERC could make an announcement on the issues before there very soon, we're holding off on providing a second quarter operating earnings guidance. Once we do have additional clarity from FERC, we expect to have a better picture of our full-year 2016 outlook and we will offer you further details and guidance. I know this decision may seem inconsistent with our stated objective to improve transparency and disclosures. We remain committed to giving you the information you need to evaluate our company when we know it. [indiscernible] is simply too significant to speculate on its outcome. While we do anticipate filing for rehearing on the ESP floor by May 2, to address a few items of clarification, we are moving forward to implement the PPA that was entered into on April 1. As you know, our regulated generation group has experience selling to output for month powers regulated units at Fort Martin and Harrison into PJM. They're using that experience and retained a leading industry consultant to help prepare strategies and offer formation for the Davis-Besse and Sammis plants in advance of the May PJM capacity auction. The regulated team plans to sell the output from Davis-Besse and Sammis into PJM as of June 1. We're also laying the groundwork to meet the positions outlined in the terms of the ESP floor. In late they February, we submitted our grid modernization business plan which outlined a menu of options for the PUCO. We also filed our energy efficiency plan with the commission earlier this month and by November 1, we will file a carbon reduction report that outlines our fuel diversification and carbon reduction strategies. In ESP, we proposed CO2 reduction goal of at least 90% below 2005 levels by 2045, building on the 25% reduction of CO2 emissions already achieved across our footprint. This goal represents a potential reduction of more than 80 million tons of CO2 emissions and is among the most aggressive targets in the utility industry. 
In support of our commitment to a cleaner energy future, we launched a branding campaign in February called The Switch is On. This campaign highlights our environment will achievements, transition to a cleaner energy sources and our green electricity options. Earlier this month, we entered into a unique green energy pact with the Cleveland Indians to provide progressive field with 100% green certified wind energy from FirstEnergy Solutions. We also introduced on Earth Day promotion, inviting Ohio and Pennsylvania residents to sign up for 100% wind energy at the same price as the standard energy offer. 
Turning to other regulatory matters. Our proposed mid-Atlantic interstate transmission subsidiary known as MAIT received FERC approval in late February. As we have discussed, this subsidiary will hold the transmission assets of Met-Ed, Penelec and JCP&L and facilitate new investments that can improve service reliability for these customers. Earlier this month, the Pennsylvania ALJs issued an initial decision, approving a settlement filed by the parties resolving all issues in this case. We anticipate final approval from the Pennsylvania PUC by midyear. And last week, we made a supplemental filing in New Jersey seeking to transfer certain JCP&L's distribution assets into MAIT which we believe should satisfy the concerns regarding public utility status that were addressed by the BPU in February. We will continue to work with the BPU because we believe transferring these assets to MAIT is the right thing to do for New Jersey customers. 
As we mentioned in February, we are past the halfway point of the first phase of our Energizing the Future transmission investment program, with $2.4 billion invested through 2015 on projects designed to make our system more robust, secure and resistant to extreme weather events. This program remains on track and we continue to view the transmission business as our primary growth platform for many years to come. Over the past 2 years, we've been focused on removing regulatory uncertainty and positioning our regulated businesses for growth. Tomorrow, we plan to file rate case for JCP&L and our 4 Pennsylvania utilities that are consistent with our goals of enhancing customer service and reliability, strengthening the distribution system, improving security and adding resiliency and operating flexibility to our infrastructure while providing stability and growth for the company. In Pennsylvania, our 4 utilities will file rate plans with the Public Utilities Commission aimed at extending the service reliability improvement efforts that have yielded significant results for more than 2 million customers. Since 2011, the number of power outage impacting our Pennsylvania customers has decreased by an average of about 27% while restoration times have improved by an average of about 14% in that same period. In total, our request will result in an expected revenue increase totaling $430 million across 4 Pennsylvania utilities and we've broken down the impact by operating company in the Appendix of our slide presentation. These changes will bring the average monthly bills in line with the typical residential bills for the other 3 major electric utilities in the state while benefiting customers by modernizing the grid with smart technologies, increased vegetation management activities and continuing customer service enhancements. Pending PUC approval, we anticipate the new rates will take effect in January of 2017. The new base rates at the Pennsylvania utilities will also include recovery of costs associated with our long-term infrastructure improvement plans, which included a projected increase in capital investments of $245 million over 5 years to help strengthened upgrade and modernize our Pennsylvania distribution systems. We expect to begin recovering the cost of those programs in July through the distribution system improvement charges that are currently pending Pennsylvania PUC approval. We also plan to file a rate plan with the New Jersey BPU that supports and builds on a significant service reliability improvements made by JCP&L in recent years. The planned $142 million rate request seeks to improve progress and benefit customers by supporting equipment maintenance, vegetation management and inspection of lines, poles and substations while also compensating for other business and operating expenses. The JCP&L plan is to designed to extend the service reliability improvements to help the utility achieve its best service road reliability record in more than a decade last year. While JCP&L's rates have remained stable and even declined over the past decade, our operating expenses have continued to increase. Since July 2012, JCP&L has invested $612 million in service related enhancement projects and even with the proposed 6% overall rate increase for the average residential customer, JCP&L would continue to offer the lowest residential electric rates among the 4 regulated electric distribution companies in New Jersey. You will remember that our last rate case in New Jersey which was based on a 2011 test year, was complicated due to storm recovery expansion issues and other items. In the upcoming proceeding which satisfies the BPU requirement that we file a new rate case by April of 2017, we hope for a reasonable time line and recognition of the significant investments we have made. Allowing for a thorough review of our filing, we will request the new rates to go into effect in January of 2017. We remain focused on continuing to position our company for growth and success to best serve our customers, communities, investors and employees. Now, I would turn the call over to Jim for his review of the quarter and as always, we will have plenty of time for your questions at the end of his remarks."

I will remind you that detailed information about the quarter can be found in the consolidated report that was posted to our website yesterday evening and as always, we welcome your questions during the Q&A or following the call. I'm sure you've also noticed that we did not publish a full FactBook this quarter. We hope to have greater clarity regarding the PPA shortly, which would hopefully allows us to hold a analyst meeting and provide full guidance for 2016. In place of the FactBook, we have included an Appendix to the slides for today's call, with certain regulatory and financial updates we would normally published each quarter. 
Our first quarter offering and earnings of $0.80 per share compares to $0.62 per share in the first quarter of 2015. On a GAAP basis, we recorded earnings of $0.78 per share for the first quarter of 2016 compared to $0.53 per basic share during the same period last year. 2016 first quarter GAAP results include special items totaling $0.02 per share, which includes regulatory charges primarily related to economic development and energy efficiency programs associated with the Ohio ESP commitments, offset by mark-to-market gains on commodity contracts. A full listing of special items can be found on page 2 of the consolidated report. 
In our distribution business, results were impacted primarily by mild temperatures on distribution deliveries and lower rates in New Jersey that went into effect in 2015, partially offset by the benefit of Pennsylvania rates that were also implemented last year. Total distribution deliveries decreased 7.8% compared to the first quarter of 2015 with a 13.4% decrease in residential sales and a 5.1% decrease in commercial sales, reflecting heating degree days that were 25% below last year and 11% below normal. On a weather adjusted basis, residential deliveries were essentially flat while commercial deliveries decreased 1.6%. Sales to industrial customers decreased 2.8%. We do continue to see growth in shale gas sector but the rate has slowed dramatically in the past 2 years and is not enough to offset lower usage from steel and coal mining activity. First quarter industrial load was off nearly 110 gigawatt hours as a result of reduced operations at Republic Steel which then announced an indefinite shutdown on April 1 and the permanent closure of Warren Steel. Overall, our sales are following the national trend that was noted by the Energy Information Association earlier this year. Weather adjusted residential and commercial sales are each down more than 1% over the past 4 quarters, while industrial load is down 3% in that timeframe. Drivers include the impact of more efficient lighting, appliances and equipment and slowing and shifting economic growth. 
In our transmission business, operating earnings increased as a result of the higher rate base at ATSI, partially offset by the lower return on equity that was part of ATSI's comprehensive settlement approved by FERC last fall. In our competitive business, strong first quarter earnings reflect an increase in commodity margin which primarily benefited from higher capacity revenues driven by increased capacity prices, as well as lower purchase power expense, higher wholesale sales and lower fossil fuel expense. These factors offset lower contract sales volume which decreased in line with our hedging strategy. A decrease in fossil fuel expense relates to lower fuel rates and as Chuck indicated earlier, it also reflects the benefits of our economic dispatch strategy which kept the Bruce Mansfield plant offline for part of February and March. This strategy is the right approach at this time, and we will continue to deploy it if markets don't support plant operations. Clearly, this remains a very challenging business environment for our competitive units as prices continued to drop. Although we are not updating our CES adjusted EBITDA guidance at this time, we note that a reduction of about $3 per megawatt hour in the round-the-clock prices since the beginning of this year translates into a reduction of more than $50 million in wholesale revenues. 
Our committed sales are about 62 million-megawatt hours for 2016 with an additional 12 million-megawatt-hours as part of the Ohio PPA. In 2017, we have 42 million megawatt-hours committed with an additional 20 megawatt-hours for the Ohio PPA. We are reaffirming our expectation that the competitive business will be cash flow positive each year through at least 2018. And finally, at corporate, a higher consolidated income tax rate and other expenses reduced operating earnings by $0.02 per share compared to the first quarter of 2015. As Chuck said, we are off to a very solid start in 2016 and we are very encouraged by the developments in Ohio and remain committed to providing customer focused growth and creating long-term value for our shareholders. Now, I'd like open the call up for your questions."

First off, we're going to have an increase in our rate base. So that will be part of it. We'll also have increased depreciation expense associated with our investments. We're also rolling in the DISC writer as part of this increase. We have smart meters and also there's been a decrease in sales. So that's going to be part of the driver there. So those are primarily the major drivers. As I would say that there was not a defined ROE last year in the Pennsylvania case. So it's hard to say if we're tracking to that but overall, I'd say our earnings in Pennsylvania are doing well but because of these significant investments as well as the decrease in sales and the DISC writer, now that is leading to the increase.

Given the high profile, I guess, my view on this would be they'd looking at both these cases before the residual auction just to give clarity. From the way I view the world, if you think about the affiliate waiver case, if I'm the Chairman, he looks at things from a legalistic standpoint. I kind of view things the same way and so I have a case in front of me where [indiscernible] Presidents not to look behind the screen, if you would to what the states are doing. He has, in the initial 2008 waiver there was a claim by [indiscernible] that charges should be looked at and should cause them to say that not all of the customers -- that they're all captive customers. They chose not to make that finding, so they go against us and grant the complaint. He would you have to go against legal precedence. I don't see him doing that and don't want to get that out of the way and that's tied to most of the complaint because some of them are kind of looking to address the same issues and if you look at the most of the complaints, there are a lot of parties that weigh in with a lot of different potential remedies and I don't think they're going to fall prey to the hyperbole especially out there by [indiscernible]. There's a burning platform, that there's imminent danger, that they're going to want to act and give clarity and take their time and look at this. So from my standpoint, I think they're going to want to act on the waiver. I think they're going to deny the complaint because I think it's to do otherwise would be inconsistent with past precedence. They can take care of the issues supposedly involved in that complaint, and in most of the complaints, they can do so in a very thoughtful way by addressing it through the stakeholder process where they're use to dealing with it and taking care of it in the next -- for the next auction in 2017.

We've got 2 more years of that program at about $1 billion a year. I don't see any equity needed to fund that transmission growth. Going forward, if we plan to expand our transmission investment program or expand significantly what we're doing in the distribution then any equity needs will be associated with increased investment in T&D.

When I look at New Jersey, it's primarily driven by a significant amount of investment that we've made since the last test year in New Jersey and that was 2011 and as we said in our remarks, since July of 2012, we've had a significant amount of capital investment and why we say partway through 2012 because in the test year in New Jersey, you're allowed to claim in-service amounts for 6 months after the in-service state.

Thanks for joining us. We're off to a strong start in 2016, and I'm pleased to share this update with you today. Yesterday afternoon, we reported solid operating earnings of $0.80 per share, which is at the midpoint",1949,"Thanks, Meghan. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. We're off to a strong start in 2016, and I'm pleased to share this update with you today. Yesterday afternoon, we reported solid operating earnings of $0.80 per share, which is at the midpoint of our first quarter guidance. On a GAAP basis, earnings were $0.78 per share. 
While Jim will review our financial results in more detail, I want to quickly mention that we've produced quality results and met our operating earnings guidance despite the impact of an unseasonably mild winter and low power prices. The successful implementation of our economic dispatch strategy was key to that outcome because the fuel savings that resulted from idling some units, when market prices did not support them, helped to offset the other impacts of mild temperatures across the company, particularly in our distribution business. 
In addition to meeting our financial commitments to you, we continue to implement our regulated growth strategies. We have several positive developments on that front and we will provide more detail today on our next steps to ensure continued service reliability for our customers, with appropriate recovery of our investments. Let's start in Ohio where the Public Utilities Commission completed a comprehensive, nearly 2-year review of our Powering Ohio's Progress electric security plan and unanimously approved the plan with certain modifications. 
The PUCO concluded that the approved plan promotes rate stability and retail competition and adds value for Ohio customers, communities and the environment. I would both like to complement and thank our public utilities commissioners and staff for their leadership in handling a very complex regulatory matter. I am proud of this ESP and of the entire team that worked on it. The plan helps safeguard customers against rising energy prices in future years while preserving key power plants that serve Ohio customers, ensuring fuel diversity and maintaining Ohio jobs. 
In addition, it outlines steps to support low income customers, reinstates energy efficiency programs, evaluate smart grid technologies and includes the goal to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. It truly fulfills the principles that the Ohio legislature outlined for the electric security plans when they moved the state toward retail competition. 
Clearly, it's been a long and conscientious process to get to this point, and while PUCO approval is a critical milestone, there are still challenges at FERC. Our opponents have also expressed their intent to bring court challenges. I will quickly review our position on these issues, and Leila can address your additional questions during the Q&A. 
First, we believe FERC should have affirm the waiver that is already in place. You recall that FES was granted authorization from FERC to conduct certain transactions with our Ohio utilities in 2008. Our purchase power agreement is one of those transactions. It was carefully constructed from the beginning to comply with existing FERC rules that promote customer shopping for retail energy supply and it will not hinder the PJM market's ability to function and foster competition. 
A separate complaint asked FERC to enclose a price floor on the PPA units for the May 2016, PJM RPM capacity auction. We don't believe there's any reason for our PPA units to be treated differently than any of the other regulated generation in PJM. It's no secret that a significant amount of generation, both regulated and merchant, has been offered in the prior PJM options with price-taking behavior. Some of these complainants are likely in that group of suppliers. What they are asking FERC to do is essentially have FirstEnergy protect them from themselves. We have filed a strong answer, demonstrating that the price floor is not needed and challenging the economic theory behind the opposition's price floor methodology, and we do not expect that FERC will impose a price floor on the PPA units for the upcoming option. 
With regards to the other potential challenges, we believe that PUCO's decision is well within the commissions authority and we expect it will withstand subsequent challenges. Furthermore, the notion of non-bypass-able charges on Ohio utility bills is not new as charges for programs such as energy efficiency, economic development and low-income support as well as cost to support the bulk transmission system have been in place for years. 
Given that FERC could make an announcement on the issues before there very soon, we're holding off on providing a second quarter operating earnings guidance. Once we do have additional clarity from FERC, we expect to have a better picture of our full-year 2016 outlook and we will offer you further details and guidance. I know this decision may seem inconsistent with our stated objective to improve transparency and disclosures. We remain committed to giving you the information you need to evaluate our company when we know it. ESP is simply too significant to speculate on its outcome. 
While we do anticipate filing for rehearing on the ESP floor by May 2, to address a few items of clarification, we are moving forward to implement the PPA that was entered into on April 1. As you know, our regulated generation group has experienced selling the output for Mon Power's regulated units at Fort Martin and Harrison into PJM. They're using that experience and have retained a leading industry consultant to help prepare strategies and offer formation for the Davis-Besse and Sammis plants in advance of the May PJM capacity option. 
The regulated team plans to sell the output from Davis-Besse and Sammis into PJM as of June 1. We're also laying the groundwork to meet the provisions outlined in the terms of the ESP floor. In late February, we submitted our grid modernization business plan, which outlined a menu of options for the PUCO. We also filed our energy efficiency plan with the commission earlier this month, and by November 1, we will file a carbon reduction report that outlines our fuel diversification and carbon reduction strategies. 
In ESP, we proposed CO2 reduction goal of at least 90% below 2005 levels by 2045, building on the 25% reduction of CO2 emissions already achieved across our footprint. This goal represents a potential reduction of more than 80 million tons of CO2 emissions and is among the most aggressive targets in the utility industry. 
In support of our commitment to a cleaner energy future, we launched a branding campaign in February called The Switch is On. This campaign highlights our environmental achievements, transition to a cleaner energy sources and our green electricity options. Earlier this month, we entered into a unique green energy pact with the Cleveland Indians to provide Progressive Field with 100% Green-e certified wind energy from FirstEnergy Solutions. 
We also introduced an Earth Day promotion, inviting Ohio and Pennsylvania residents to sign up for 100% wind energy at the same price as the standard energy offer. 
Turning to other regulatory matters. Our proposed mid-Atlantic interstate transmission subsidiary, known as MAIT, received FERC approval in late February. As we have discussed, this subsidiary would hold the transmission assets of Met-Ed, Penelec and JCP&L and facilitate new investments that can improve service reliability for these customers. 
Earlier this month, the Pennsylvania ALJs issued an initial decision, approving a settlement filed by the parties resolving all issues in this case. We anticipate final approval from the Pennsylvania PUC by midyear. And last week, we made a supplemental filing in New Jersey seeking to transfer certain JCP&L distribution assets into MAIT, which we believe should satisfy the concerns regarding public utility status that were addressed by the BPU in February. We will continue to work with the BPU because we believe transferring these assets to MAIT is the right thing to do for our New Jersey customers. 
As we mentioned in February, we are past the halfway point of the first phase of our Energizing the Future transmission investment program, with $2.4 billion invested through 2015 on projects designed to make our system more robust, secure and resistant to extreme weather events. This program remains on track and we continue to view the transmission business as our primary growth platform for many years to come. Over the past 2 years, we have been focused on removing regulatory uncertainty and positioning our regulated businesses for growth. Tomorrow, we plan to file rate cases for JCP&L and our 4 Pennsylvania utilities that are consistent with our goals of enhancing customer service and reliability, strengthening the distribution system, improving security and adding resiliency and operating flexibility to our infrastructure while providing stability and growth for the company. 
In Pennsylvania, our 4 utilities will file rate plans with the Public Utilities Commission, aimed at extending the service reliability improvement efforts that have yielded significant results for more than 2 million customers. Since 2011, the number of power outage impacting our Pennsylvania customers has decreased by an average of about 27% while restoration times have improved by an average of about 14% in that same period. In total, our request will result in an expected revenue increase totaling $430 million across 4 Pennsylvania utilities and we've broken down the impact by operating company in the Appendix of our slide presentation. 
These changes would bring the average monthly bills in line with the typical residential bills for the other 3 major electric utilities in the state while benefiting customers by modernizing the grid with smart technologies, increased vegetation management activities and continuing customer service enhancements. 
Pending PUC approval, we anticipate that the new rates will take effect in January of 2017. The new base rates at the Pennsylvania utilities will also include recovery of costs associated with our long-term infrastructure improvement plans, which include a projected increase in capital investments of $245 million over 5 years to help strengthened upgrade and modernize our Pennsylvania distribution systems. We expect to begin recovering the cost of those programs in July through the distribution system improvement charges that are currently pending Pennsylvania PUC approval. 
We also plan to file a rate plan with the New Jersey BPU that supports and builds on a significant service reliability improvements made by JCP&L in recent years. The planned $142 million rate request seeks to improve service and benefit customers by supporting equipment maintenance, vegetation management and inspection of lines, poles and substations while also compensating for other business and operating expenses. The JCP&L plan is to designed to extend the service reliability improvements to help the utility achieve its best service reliability record in more than a decade last year. While JCP&L's rates have remained stable and even declined over the past decade, our operating expenses have continued to increase. Since July 2012, JCP&L has invested $612 million in service-related enhancement projects. And even with the proposed 6% overall rate increase for the average residential customer, JCP&L would continue to offer the lowest residential electric rates among the 4 regulated electric distribution companies in New Jersey. 
You will remember that our last rate case in New Jersey, which was based on a 2011 test year, was complicated due to storm recovery expense issues and other items. In the upcoming proceeding, which satisfies the BPU requirement that we file a new rate case by April of 2017, we hope for a reasonable time line and recognition of the significant investments we have made. Allowing for a thorough review of our filing, we will request the new rates to go into effect in January of 2017. 
We remain focused on continuing to position our company for growth and success to best serve our customers, communities, investors and employees. 
Now, I would turn the call over to Jim for his review of the quarter and as always, we will have plenty of time for your questions at the end of his remarks."

I will remind you that detailed information about the quarter can be found in the consolidated report that was posted to our website yesterday evening and as always, we welcome your questions during the Q&A or following the call. 
I'm sure you've also noticed that we did not publish a full FactBook this quarter. We hope to have greater clarity regarding the PPA shortly, which would hopefully allow us to have an analyst meeting and provide full guidance for 2016. In place of the FactBook, we have included an Appendix to the slides for today's call, with certain regulatory and financial updates we would normally published each quarter. 
Our first quarter operating earnings of $0.80 per share compares to $0.62 per share in the first quarter of 2015. On a GAAP basis, we recorded earnings of $0.78 per share for the first quarter of 2016 compared to $0.53 per basic share during the same period last year. 2016 first quarter GAAP results include special items totaling $0.02 per share, which includes regulatory charges primarily related to economic development and energy efficiency programs associated with the Ohio ESP commitments, offset by mark-to-market gains on commodity contracts. A full listing of special items can be found on Page 2 of the consolidated report. 
In our distribution business, results were impacted primarily by mild temperatures on distribution deliveries and lower rates in New Jersey that went into effect in 2015, partially offset by the benefit of Pennsylvania rates that were also implemented last year. Total distribution deliveries decreased 7.8% compared to the first quarter of 2015, with a 13.4% decrease in residential sales and a 5.1% decrease in commercial sales, reflecting heating degree days that were 25% below last year and 11% below normal. 
On a weather-adjusted basis, residential deliveries were essentially flat while commercial deliveries decreased 1.6%. Sales to industrial customers decreased 2.8%. We do continue to see growth in shale gas sector, but the rate has slowed dramatically in the past 2 years and is not enough to offset lower usage from steel and coal mining activity. 
First quarter industrial load was off nearly 110 gigawatt hours as a result of reduced operations at Republic Steel, which then announced an indefinite shutdown on April 1 and the permanent closure of Warren Steel. Overall, our sales are following the national trend that was noted by the Energy Information Association earlier this year. Weather-adjusted residential and commercial sales are each down more than 1% over the past 4 quarters while industrial load is down 3% in that time frame. Drivers include the impact of more efficient lighting, appliances and equipment and slowing and shifting economic growth. 
In our transmission business, operating earnings increased as a result of the higher rate base at ATSI, partially offset by the lower return on equity that was part of ATSI's comprehensive settlement approved by FERC last fall. 
In our competitive business, strong first quarter earnings reflect an increase in commodity margin, which primarily benefited from higher capacity revenues driven by increased capacity prices, as well as lower purchase power expense, higher wholesale sales and lower fossil fuel expense. These factors offset lower contract sales volume, which decreased in line with our hedging strategy. A decrease in fossil fuel expense relates to lower fuel rates. And as Chuck indicated earlier, it also reflects the benefits of our economic dispatch strategy, which kept the Bruce Mansfield Plant offline for part of February and March. This strategy is the right approach at this time, and we will continue to deploy it if markets don't support plant operations. Clearly, this remains a very challenging business environment for our competitive units as prices continued to drop. 
Although we are not updating our CES-adjusted EBITDA guidance at this time, we note that a reduction of about $3 per megawatt hour in the round-the-clock prices, since the beginning of this year, translates into a reduction of more than $50 million in wholesale revenues. 
Our committed sales are about 62 million-megawatt hours for 2016, with an additional 12 million-megawatt-hours as part of the Ohio PPA. In 2017, we have 42 million megawatt-hours committed, with an additional 20 megawatt-hours for the Ohio PPA. We are reaffirming our expectation that the competitive business will be cash flow positive each year through at least 2018. 
And finally, at corporate, a higher consolidated income tax rate and other expenses reduced operating earnings by $0.02 per share compared to the first quarter of 2015. As Chuck said, we are off to a very solid start in 2016 and we are very encouraged by the developments in Ohio and remain committed to providing customer focused growth and creating long-term value for our shareholders.

Given the high profile, I guess, my view on this would be that they would be looking at both these cases before the base residual auction just to give clarity. From the way I view the world, if you think about the affiliate waiver case, if I'm the chairman, he looks at things from a legalistic standpoint. I kind of view things that same way. And so I have a case in front of me where there are strong precedents not to look behind the screen, if you would, to what the states are doing. He has, in the initial 2008 waiver, there was a claim by NOPEC that non-bypass-able charges should be looked at and should cause them to say that they're not -- not all the customers -- that they are captive customers. They chose not to make that finding, so they go against us and grant the complaint. He would have to go against legal precedent. I don't see him doing that and I think he would want to get that out of the way, and that's tied to most of complaint because, fundamentally, they're kind of looking to address ""the same issue."" And if you look at the Moser [ph] complaints, there are a lot of parties with -- that wade in with a lot of different potential remedies. And I don't think they're going to fall prey to the hyperbole especially out there by Dargy [ph], that there's a burning platform, that there's imminent danger, that they're going to want to act and give clarity and take their time and look at this. So from my standpoint, I think they're going to want to act on the waiver. I think they're going to deny the complaint because I think it's -- and to do otherwise would be inconsistent with past precedent. They can take care of the issues supposedly involved in that complaint, in the Moser [ph] complaints. I think they can do so in a very thoughtful way by addressing it through the stakeholder process, what they're used to dealing with it and taking care of it in the next -- for the next BRA auction in 2017. Because I wanted to give clarity to the market in that regard."

In fact, if you look at one of the footnotes, they go into a long, detailed description of the traditional bilateral contract, which mirrors directly our PPAs. So from a structure standpoint, if you think about it, through that footnote, they signaled that the structure that the PPA is something that is out for the market and that they feel comfortable with. So structurally, I think it is -- it meets the test. And then if you go back to the EPSA case, albeit they made a statement that insulating retail customers from price fluctuations is something that falls under state authority.

Going forward, if we plan to expand our transmission investment program or expand significantly what we're doing in the distribution, then any equity needs would be associated with increased investment in T&D. So I answered the same way. We're not prepared to say what that amount is, but I don't think you need to be worried about Energizing the Future being taken off-track in any case."

So that's primarily what's driving that in Pennsylvania. You're also able to file on a forward-looking test year. When I look at New Jersey, it's primarily driven by a significant amount of investment that we've made since the last test year in New Jersey, and that was 2011. And as we said in our remarks, since July of 2012, we've had a significant amount of capital investment and why we say partway through 2012 because in the test year in New Jersey, you're allowed to claim in-service amounts for 6 months after the in-service state. So we've had a significant amount of investment in New Jersey. So that's what's driving that. Again, as far as our overall return on equity within each of the states, I would say that we're probably tracking right around where we should based on the last rate proceeding.

Thanks for joining us. We're off to a strong start in 2016, and I'm pleased to share this update with you today.

We're off to a strong start in 2016, and I'm pleased to share this update with you today. Yesterday afternoon, we reported solid operating earnings of $0.80 per share, which is at the midpoint of our first quarter guidance. On a GAAP basis, earnings were $0.78 per share. 
While Jim will review our financial results in more detail, I want to quickly mention that we've produced quality results and met our operating earnings guidance despite the impact of an unseasonably mild winter and low power prices. The successful implementation of our economic dispatch strategy was key to that outcome because the fuel savings that resulted from idling some units, when market prices did not support them, helped to offset the other impacts of mild temperatures across the company, particularly in our distribution business. 
In addition to meeting our financial commitments to you, we continue to implement our regulated growth strategies. We have several positive developments on that front and we will provide more detail today on our next steps to ensure continued service reliability for our customers, with appropriate recovery of our investments. Let's start in Ohio where the Public Utilities Commission completed a comprehensive, nearly 2-year review of our Powering Ohio's Progress electric security plan and unanimously approved the plan with certain modifications. 
The PUCO concluded that the approved plan promotes rate stability and retail competition and adds value for Ohio customers, communities and the environment. I would both like to complement and thank our public utilities commissioners and staff for their leadership in handling a very complex regulatory matter. I am proud of this ESP and of the entire team that worked on it. The plan helps safeguard customers against rising energy prices in future years while preserving key power plants that serve Ohio customers, ensuring fuel diversity and maintaining Ohio jobs. 
In addition, it outlines steps to support low income customers, reinstates energy efficiency programs, evaluate smart grid technologies and includes the goal to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. It truly fulfills the principles that the Ohio legislature outlined for the electric security plans when they moved the state toward retail competition. 
Clearly, it's been a long and conscientious process to get to this point, and while PUCO approval is a critical milestone, there are still challenges at FERC. Our opponents have also expressed their intent to bring court challenges. I will quickly review our position on these issues, and Leila can address your additional questions during the Q&A. 
First, we believe FERC should have affirm the waiver that is already in place. You recall that FES was granted authorization from FERC to conduct certain transactions with their Ohio utilities in 2008. Our purchase power agreement is one of those transactions. It was carefully constructed from the beginning to comply with existing FERC rules that promote customer shopping for retail energy supply, and it will not hinder the PJM market's ability to function and foster competition. 
A separate complaint asked FERC to enclose a price floor on the PPA units for the May 2016, PJM RPM capacity auction. We don't believe there is any reason for our PPA units to be treated differently than any of the other regulated generation in PJM. It's no secret that a significant amount of generation, both regulated and merchant, has been offered in the prior PJM options with price-taking behavior. Some of these complainants are likely in that group of suppliers. What they are asking FERC to do is essentially have FirstEnergy protect them from themselves. We have filed a strong answer, demonstrating that the price floor is not needed and challenging the economic theory behind the opposition's price floor methodology, and we do not expect that FERC will impose a price floor on the PPA units for the upcoming option. 
With regards to the other potential challenges, we believe that PUCO's decision is well within the commission's authority and we expect it will withstand subsequent challenges. Furthermore, the notion of non-bypassable charges on Ohio utility bills is not new as charges for programs such as energy efficiency, economic development and low-income support as well as cost to support the bulk transmission system have been in place for years. 
Given that FERC could make an announcement on the issues before them very soon, we are holding off on providing a second quarter operating earnings guidance. Once we do have additional clarity from FERC, we expect to have a better picture of our full-year 2016 outlook and we will offer you further details and guidance. I know this decision may seem inconsistent with our stated objective to improve transparency and disclosures. We remain committed to giving you the information you need to evaluate our company when we know it. The ESP is simply too significant to speculate on its outcome. 
While we do anticipate filing for rehearing on the ESP floor by May 2, to address a few items of clarification, we are moving forward to implement the PPA that was entered into on April 1. As you know, our regulated generation group has experienced selling the output for Mon Power's regulated units at Fort Martin and Harrison into PJM. They're using that experience and have retained a leading industry consultant to help prepare strategies and offer formation for the Davis-Besse and Sammis plants in advance of the May PJM capacity option. 
The regulated team plans to sell the output from Davis-Besse and Sammis into PJM as of June 1. We're also laying the groundwork to meet the provisions outlined in the terms of the ESP floor. In late February, we submitted our grid modernization business plan, which outlined a menu of options for the PUCO. We also filed our energy efficiency plan with the commission earlier this month, and by November 1, we will file a carbon reduction report that outlines our fuel diversification and carbon reduction strategies. 
In ESP, we proposed a CO2 reduction goal of at least 90% below 2005 levels by 2045, building on the 25% reduction of CO2 emissions already achieved across our footprint. This goal represents a potential reduction of more than 80 million tons of CO2 emissions and is among the most aggressive targets in the utility industry. 
In support of our commitment to a cleaner energy future, we launched a branding campaign in February called The Switch is On. This campaign highlights our environmental achievements, transition to a cleaner energy sources and our green electricity options. Earlier this month, we entered into a unique green energy pact with the Cleveland Indians to provide Progressive Field with 100% Green-e certified wind energy from FirstEnergy Solutions. 
We also introduced an Earth Day promotion, inviting Ohio and Pennsylvania residents to sign up for 100% wind energy at the same price as the standard energy offer. 
Turning to other regulatory matters. Our proposed Mid-Atlantic Interstate Transmission subsidiary, known as MAIT, received FERC approval in late February. As we have discussed, this subsidiary would hold the transmission assets of Met-Ed, Penelec and JCP&L and facilitate new investments that can improve service reliability for these customers. 
Earlier this month, the Pennsylvania ALJs issued an initial decision, approving a settlement filed by the parties resolving all issues in this case. We anticipate final approval from the Pennsylvania PUC by midyear. And last week, we made a supplemental filing in New Jersey seeking to transfer certain JCP&L distribution assets into MAIT, which we believe should satisfy the concerns regarding public utility status that were addressed by the BPU in February. We will continue to work with the BPU because we believe transferring these assets to MAIT is the right thing to do for our New Jersey customers. 
As we mentioned in February, we have past the halfway point of the first phase of our Energizing the Future transmission investment program, with $2.4 billion invested through 2015 on projects designed to make our system more robust, secure and resistant to extreme weather events. This program remains on track and we continue to view the transmission business as our primary growth platform for many years to come. Over the past 2 years, we have been focused on removing regulatory uncertainty and positioning our regulated businesses for growth. Tomorrow, we plan to file rate cases for JCP&L and our 4 Pennsylvania utilities that are consistent with our goals of enhancing customer service and reliability, strengthening the distribution system, improving security and adding resiliency and operating flexibility to our infrastructure while providing stability and growth for the company. 
In Pennsylvania, our 4 utilities will file rate plans with the Public Utilities Commission, aimed at extending the service reliability improvement efforts that have yielded significant results for more than 2 million customers. Since 2011, the number of power outage impacting our Pennsylvania customers has decreased by an average of about 27% while restoration times have improved by an average of about 14% in that same period. In total, our request would result in an expected revenue increase totaling $430 million across 4 Pennsylvania utilities and we've broken down the impact by operating company in the Appendix of our slide presentation. 
These changes would bring the average monthly bills in line with the typical residential bills for the other 3 major electric utilities in the state while benefiting customers by modernizing the grid with smart technologies, increased vegetation management activities and continuing customer service enhancements. 
Pending PUC approval, we anticipate that the new rates will take effect in January of 2017. The new base rates at the Pennsylvania utilities will also include recovery of costs associated with our long-term infrastructure improvement plans, which include a projected increase in capital investments of $245 million over 5 years to help strengthen, upgrade and modernize our Pennsylvania distribution systems. We expect to begin recovering the cost of those programs in July through the distribution system improvement charges that are currently pending Pennsylvania PUC approval. 
We also plan to file a rate plan with the New Jersey BPU that supports and builds on the significant service reliability improvements made by JCP&L in recent years. The planned $142 million rate request seeks to improve service and benefit customers by supporting equipment maintenance, vegetation management and inspections of lines, poles and substations while also compensating for other business and operating expenses. The JCP&L plan is to designed to extend the service reliability improvements to help the utility achieve its best service reliability record in more than a decade last year. While JCP&L's rates have remained stable and even declined over the past decade, our operating expenses have continued to increase. Since July 2012, JCP&L has invested $612 million in service-related enhancement projects. And even with the proposed 6% overall rate increase for the average residential customer, JCP&L would continue to offer the lowest residential electric rates among the 4 regulated electric distribution companies in New Jersey. 
You will remember that our last rate case in New Jersey, which was based on a 2011 test year, was complicated due to storm recovery expense issues and other items. In the upcoming proceeding, which satisfies the BPU requirement that we file a new rate case by April of 2017, we hope for a reasonable time line and recognition of the significant investments we have made. Allowing for a thorough review of our filing, we will request the new rates to go into effect in January of 2017. 
We remain focused on continuing to position our company for growth and success to best serve our customers, communities, investors and employees. 
Now, I would turn the call over to Jim for his review of the quarter and as always, we will have plenty of time for your questions at the end of his remarks."

I will remind you that detailed information about the quarter can be found in the consolidated report that was posted to our website yesterday evening and as always, we welcome your questions during the Q&A or following the call. 
I'm sure you've also noticed that we did not publish a full FactBook this quarter. We hope to have greater clarity regarding the PPA shortly, which would hopefully allow us to have an analyst meeting and provide full guidance for 2016. In place of the FactBook, we have included an Appendix to the slides for today's call, with certain regulatory and financial updates we would normally publish each quarter. 
Our first quarter operating earnings of $0.80 per share compares to $0.62 per share in the first quarter of 2015. On a GAAP basis, we recorded earnings of $0.78 per share for the first quarter of 2016 compared to $0.53 per basic share during the same period last year. 2016 first quarter GAAP results include special items totaling $0.02 per share, which includes regulatory charges primarily related to economic development and energy efficiency programs associated with the Ohio ESP commitments, offset by mark-to-market gains on commodity contracts. A full listing of the special items can be found on Page 2 of the consolidated report. 
In our distribution business, results were impacted primarily by mild temperatures on distribution deliveries and lower rates in New Jersey that went into effect in 2015, partially offset by the benefit of Pennsylvania rates that were also implemented last year. Total distribution deliveries decreased 7.8% compared to the first quarter of 2015, with a 13.4% decrease in residential sales and a 5.1% decrease in commercial sales, reflecting heating degree days that were 25% below last year and 11% below normal. 
On a weather-adjusted basis, residential deliveries were essentially flat while commercial deliveries decreased 1.6%. Sales to industrial customers decreased 2.8%. We do continue to see growth in shale gas sector, but the rate has slowed dramatically in the past 2 years and is not enough to offset lower usage from steel and coal mining activity. 
First quarter industrial load was off nearly 110 gigawatt hours as a result of reduced operations at Republic Steel, which then announced an indefinite shutdown on April 1 and the permanent closure of Warren Steel. Overall, our sales are following the national trend that was noted by the Energy Information Association earlier this year. Weather-adjusted residential and commercial sales are each down more than 1% over the past 4 quarters while industrial load is down 3% in that time frame. Drivers include the impact of more efficient lighting, appliances and equipment and slowing and shifting economic growth. 
In our transmission business, operating earnings increased as a result of the higher rate base at ATSI, partially offset by the lower return on equity that was part of ATSI's comprehensive settlement approved by FERC last fall. 
In our competitive business, strong first quarter earnings reflect an increase in commodity margin, which primarily benefited from higher capacity revenues driven by increased capacity prices, as well as lower purchase power expense, higher wholesale sales and lower fossil fuel expense. These factors offset lower contract sales volume, which decreased in line with our hedging strategy. A decrease in fossil fuel expense relates to lower fuel rates. And as Chuck indicated earlier, it also reflects the benefits of our economic dispatch strategy, which kept the Bruce Mansfield Plant offline for part of February and March. This strategy is the right approach at this time, and we will continue to deploy it if markets don't support plant operations. Clearly, this remains a very challenging business environment for our competitive units as prices continued to drop. 
Although we are not updating our CES-adjusted EBITDA guidance at this time, we note that a reduction of about $3 per megawatt hour in the round-the-clock prices, since the beginning of this year, translates into a reduction of more than $50 million in wholesale revenues. 
Our committed sales are about 62 million-megawatt hours for 2016, with an additional 12 million-megawatt-hours as part of the Ohio PPA. In 2017, we have 42 million megawatt-hours committed, with an additional 20 megawatt-hours for the Ohio PPA. We are reaffirming our expectation that the competitive business will be cash flow positive each year through at least 2018. 
And finally, at corporate, a higher consolidated income tax rate and other expenses reduced operating earnings by $0.02 per share compared to the first quarter of 2015. As Chuck said, we are off to a very solid start in 2016 and we are very encouraged by the developments in Ohio and remain committed to providing customer focused growth and creating long-term value for our shareholders.

We're also rolling in the DISC rider as part of this increase. We have smart meters and also there's been a decrease in sales. So that's going to be part of the driver there. So those are primarily the major drivers. As I would say that there was not a defined ROE last year in the Pennsylvania case. So it's hard to say if we're tracking to that. But overall, I'd say our earnings in Pennsylvania are doing well, but because of these significant investments as well as the decrease in sales and the DISC rider, now that is leading to the increase. And Leila, I don't know if you have anything to add to that?"

Given the high profile, I guess, my view on this would be that they would be looking at both these cases before the base residual auction just to give clarity. From the way I view the world, if you think about the affiliate waiver case, if I'm the chairman, he looks at things from a legalistic standpoint. I kind of view things that same way. And so I have a case in front of me where there are strong precedents not to look behind the screen, if you would, to what the states are doing. He has, in the initial 2008 waiver, there was a claim by NOPEC that non-bypassable charges should be looked at and should cause them to say that they're not -- not all the customers -- that they are captive customers. They chose not to make that finding. So to go against this and grant the complaint, he would have to go against legal precedent. I don't see him doing that and I think he would want to get that out of the way, and that's tied to the Moser [ph] complaint because, fundamentally, they're kind of looking to address ""the same issues."" And if you look at the Moser [ph] complaints, there are a lot of parties with -- that weighed in with a lot of different potential remedies. And I don't think they're going to fall prey to the hyperbole especially out there by Dynegy, that there's a burning platform, that there's imminent danger, that they're going to want to act and give clarity and take their time and look at this. So from my standpoint, I think they're going to want to act on the waiver. I think they're going to deny the complaint because I think it's -- and to do otherwise would be inconsistent with past precedent. They can take care of the issues supposedly involved in that complaint, in the Moser [ph] complaints. I think they can do so in a very thoughtful way by addressing it through the stakeholder process, what they're used to dealing with it and taking care of it in the next -- for the next BRA auction in 2017. Because I wanted to give clarity to the market in that regard."

In fact, if you look at one of the footnotes, they go into a long, detailed description of the traditional bilateral contract, which mirrors directly our PPAs. So from a structure standpoint, if you think about it, through that footnote, they signaled that the structure that the PPA is something that is out for the market and that they feel comfortable with. So structurally, I think it is -- it meets the test. And then if you go back to the EPSA case, albeit DCTA [ph], they made a statement that insulating retail customers from price fluctuations is something that fell under state authority.

We've got 2 more years of that program at about $1 billion a year. I don't see any equity needed to fund that transmission growth. Going forward, if we plan to expand our transmission investment program or expand significantly what we're doing in the distribution, then any equity needs would be associated with increased investment in T&D. So I answer it the same way. We're not prepared to say what that amount is, but I don't think you'd need to be worried about Energizing the Future being taken off-track in any case."

So that's primarily what's driving that in Pennsylvania. You're also able to file on a forward-looking test year. When I look at New Jersey, it's primarily driven by a significant amount of investment that we've made since the last test year in New Jersey, and that was 2011. And as we said in our remarks, since July of 2012, we've had a significant amount of capital investment and why we say partway through 2012 because in the test year in New Jersey, you're allowed to claim in-service amounts for 6 months after the in-service state. So we've had a significant amount of investment in New Jersey. So that's what's driving that.

Thanks for joining us. Since our call in April, we have continued to take aggressive steps to position FirstEnergy for stable, predictable and customer service oriented growth that will benefit our customers, employees and shareholders. We are making steady progress on our strategic initiatives and our regulated businesses and we've had to make difficult but necessary decisions to address the effects of challenging market dynamics on our competitive business. Today, Jim and I will discuss these developments, our second quarter earnings and the 2016 guidance that we published last night. We have a full agenda and we want to ensure there's plenty of time for your questions at the end of the call. So let's get started. Yesterday afternoon, we reported a second quarter GAAP loss of $2.56 per share, primarily reflecting asset impairments and plant exit costs of $2.99 per share at our competitive business segment, which I will discuss in a moment. On an operating earnings basis, our results for the second quarter were a solid $0.56 per share, which is in line with our expectations. Jim will provide more detail on our financial results. 
Looking at the full-year, as you know, we had hope to provide 2016 guidance that would include the final impact of our regulatory outcome in Ohio. However, given the Ohio procedural schedule, we decided to provide guidance now that excludes any potential impact of that case. This is consistent with our desire for transparent communications and also provides our employees with clear financial goals for the remainder of the year. On a GAAP basis, we expect a loss for the full year of 2016 in the range of negative $0.75 to negative $0.55 per share. Our operating earnings guidance range for 2016 is $2.40 to $2.60 per share, which includes up to $500 million in additional equity this year. This range is in line with current consensus estimates that exclude any impact from Ohio. Again, the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP primarily reflects the second quarter charges at our competitive business. Jim will provide more details on our 2016 expectations for each business segment, including adjusted EBITDA for our competitive business. 
In our Ohio ESP4 case, we expect to complete hearings next week. The remaining schedule is expected to provide for a potential final order from the PUCO in the September or October timeframe. The hearing is focused on the modified writer RRS proposal that we filed in May, as well as the PUCO staff testimony which proposed a distribution modernization writer. Neither of these alternatives include a purchase power agreement tied to Davis-Besse, Sammis or any other plant in our fleet. 
Moving to other regulatory matters, you'll recall that in April, we filed new rate requests for our 4 utilities in Pennsylvania and for JCP&L in New Jersey. We've received a procedural schedule for the Pennsylvania case with hearing starting on September 6. As always, we look forward to beginning settlement discussions on the Pennsylvania cases. In New Jersey, our rate request has moved to the Office of the Administrative Law and we are waiving the procedural schedule. In our transmission business, we continue to make progress on our Energizing the Future initiatives and we were pleased last week to receive Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approval to move our Met-Ed and Penelec transmission assets into our new affiliate company, Mid-Atlantic Interstate Transition or MAIT. These new standalone transmission subsidiary is structured to help facilitate investments that can improve service reliability for these utility customers. In New Jersey, we are also making progress to bring certain JCP&L assets into that subsidiary. A procedural schedule was recently issued with hearings beginning in late October or early November. 
Finally, we continue to review the competitiveness of our generation fleet in light of weak power prices. The low capacity auction outcome in May and an anemic demand forecasts. As you know, last Friday, we announced our intent to either sell or deactivate the 136 megawatt Bay Shore plant by October of 2020 and to deactivate units 1 through 4 of the Sammis plant in May of 2020. This resulted in a pretax impairment charge of $640 million, as well as coal contract termination and settlement cost of $58 million associated with retired and deactivated units. In addition, based on the low results of the most recent PJM capacity auction for the 2019, 2020 planning year, as well as our updated long-term fundamental pricing model, we recognized an $800 million pretax goodwill impairment charge, which represents the total amount of goodwill at our competitive segment. We also recognized valuation allowances of $159 million against state and local NOLs or net operating loss carryforwards given our current projections and statutory limitations on the utilization of NOLs at the state and local level. No valuation allowances were necessary for our federal NOLs. Our country has completed the deactivation of more than 40,000 megawatts of coal-fired generating capacity in the last 6 years with about 40 plants scheduled to close this year alone. Since last fall, the industry has announced the planned retirement of 7 U.S. nuclear stations, totaling nearly 8,000 megawatts of generating capacity, with most of these units closing within the next 3 years. We believe it is critical for our country to maintain baseload generation especially the euro mission nuclear and even coal which we believe offers greater fuel security than natural gas. And we plan to continue to advocate for competitive reforms that ensure wholesale markets accurately value existing baseload generation. At this time, however, we do not see any short-term solutions to the current challenging market situation. Longer-term, we do not believe competitive generation is a good fit for FirstEnergy and our focus on regulated operations and we cannot put investors and our company at risk as we wait for the country and PJM to address the issues with the current construct. We will continue to seek opportunities both within the competitive realm and the states to further de-risk the business and convert megawatts from competitive markets to a regulated or regulated-like construct. In particular, we will monitor legislative efforts to maintain important baseload generation in various states including Ohio and New York. We'll also plan to work with the West Virginia Public Service Commission when they ready to address the generation shortfall included in Powers integrated resource plant. I continue to believe that those companies that own generation, transmission and distribution either vertically integrated or other type of fully regulated model are best situated to provide reliable and affordable service to customers now and in the future. And one of our goals has been to keep as much of our current generation fleet viable. But given the market conditions, we will look at all alternatives that are constructed from our balance sheet and cash perspective including the possible sale or deactivation of additional units. As we stated many times, FirstEnergy's earnings are now more than 80% regulated and our long-term goal is to operate as a fully regulated utility company. We continue to expect our competitive segment to be cash flow positive each year through 2018 and our generation team continues to look for cost-savings given the current environment. They have already identified an additional $80 million of fossil fleet cost reductions each year in 2017 and 2018 beyond those identified as part of last year's cash flow improvement project. These savings will help offset the further erosion in power prices. In addition, we plan to delay the Beaver Valley Unit 2 steam generator placement from 2020 to 2023 given the solid condition of the existing steam generator. Our competitive business will continue to invest in its nuclear units in order to maintain safe and reliable operations and improve overall performance. At the fossil fleet, market conditions will influence our capital investments with current conditions favoring limited investments. We do not intend to infuse additional equity into our competitive business in order to support credit ratings. 
As you know, following our announcement of the asset impairments and plant exit cost last Friday, S&P put FirstEnergy Solutions, outgaining energy supply and generating company on Credit Watch. We held constructive meetings with both S&P and Moody's earlier this week. We expect both agencies to review our competitive entities at committee meetings in the near future which may result in non-investment grade credit ratings for those entities. This could result in potential collateral calls of up to $300 million. However, our available liquidity of about $3 billion would be more than adequate to cover such calls. We remain committed to maintaining investment grade ratings at all of our regulated businesses and to improving FirstEnergy course metrics in line with our earlier disclosures. And we remain firmly focus on positioning our company for success through a customer focused strategy that is designed to provide continuous service reliability and timely recovery of our investments. We believe the actions we have outlined today will build a stronger FirstEnergy for our employees, customers and investors. Now, I'll turn the call over to Jim."

I will remind you that a detailed information about the quarter can be found in the consolidated report that was posted to our website yesterday evening and as always, we welcome your questions during the Q&A or",1041,"Thanks, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. I will remind you that a detailed information about the quarter can be found in the consolidated report that was posted to our website yesterday evening and as always, we welcome your questions during the Q&A or following the call. As Chuck mentioned, asset impairments and plant exit cost of $2.99 per share drove our second quarter GAAP loss of $2.56 per share. Chuck also indicated that our pretax impairment charge for the closure or deactivation of units 1 through 4 at Sammis and the Bay Shore plant were $640 million. That number is actually, $647 million. A full listing of the special items can be found on page one of the consolidated report. On an operating earnings basis, our results were $0.56 per share, a solid second quarter and in line with our expectations across all 3 segments. Earnings in our distribution business decreased as a result of higher retirement benefit cost and lower distribution deliveries associated with a decline in average customer usage. These factors were partially offset by the effect of rate increases in Pennsylvania that were implemented in May 2015. Total distribution deliveries decreased 1.7% compared to the second quarter of 2015 with a 1.5% decrease in residential sales and less than a 1% decrease in commercial sales. Weather related usage was essentially flat compared to last year. Sales to industrial customers decreased 2.7%. Similar to last quarter, continued growth in the shale gas sector was more than offset by lower usage from steel and coal mining activity. However, this quarter also reflects a number of temporary shutdowns from industrial customers that should come back online later this year based on our discussions with several large customers. And our transmission business, earnings decreased due to ATSI's and TrAIL's annual true up to their formula rate reflecting an adjustment the true up revenue based on estimated recoverable cost to actual cost, a lower ROE at ATSI that went into effect this past January and lower capitalized financing cost. These factors were partially offset by higher rate base at both ATSI and TrAIL. In our competitive business, solid second quarter operating earnings reflect an increase in commodity margins which primarily benefited from lower purchase power expense, higher wholesale sales related to a larger open position, higher capacity revenues driven by increased capacity prices, lower transmission charges and lower fossil fuel expense. Contract sales volume decreased consistent with our hedging strategy. 
Let's now move on to some details surrounding our 2016 operating earnings guidance of $2.40 to $2.60 per share. This reflects 6 months of actual results and assumes normal weather for the remainder of the year, although July has been quite warm across most of our service territory. First, we like to point out that consensus estimates of have a very wide range of 2016 of more than $0.50. Several analysts still include the benefit of a PPA along with varying amounts of equity. When you adjust for these disparities, our 2016 operating earnings guidance is in line with consensus. At the regulated utility business, we are expecting 2016 operating earnings of $1.74 to $1.82 per share with a midpoint of $1.78, which is slightly higher than 2015 weather normalized operating earnings of $1.76 per share. We expect share dilution of $0.04 at the distribution segment related to approximately $600 million of total equity this year, including about $100 million din our annual program related to employee benefits and our stock investment program. Ongoing expenses such as pension, OPEB, depreciation and taxes and the full-year impact of the New Jersey rate case resolved last year, are offset by the impact of Pennsylvania rates that went to effect in May of 2015 and higher revenues resulting from the increase in the Ohio DCR. Residential and commercial sales are expected to decrease this year as customer growth is offset by lower use per customer, driven predominantly by the adoption of energy-efficient technologies, most notably LED lighting. Likewise, the industrial sector is expected to be flat to slightly down this year as growth from the shale sector is offset by steel and related industry slowdowns. The earnings guidance materials published to our website last night include more details on our expectations for load by state and by sector. 
At our transmission segment, we expect a slight uplift over 2015 due to the favorable impact of higher revenues associated with increased rate base at ATSI, up $2.1 billion versus $1.7 billion in 2015. This is partially offset by at these lower return on equity a 10.38% compared to 10.3% in the first half and 11.06% in the second half of 2015. In the competitive business, we have essentially closed or 2016 targeted forward sales with $64 million-megawatt hours of committed sales. 8 million megawatt-hours will remain open the marketplaces from the remainder of the year. Our 2016 adjusted EBITDA for the competitive business is it hundred $50 million to $950 million. Positive drivers include 1 less nuclear outage and the benefit of the cash flow improvement program. Lower capacity revenues associated with lower auction clearing prices beginning in June 2016 will reduce commodity margin year-over-year and increase pension cost and depreciation due to a higher asset base are the main negative drivers. At corporate, an increase in the effective tax rate to 38% in 2016 compared to 36% in 2015 combined with higher interest expense from higher rates on the FirstEnergy revolver in term loan are the primary drivers. 
Finally, we remain focused on efforts that complement FirstEnergy Corp's. balance sheet so that we can continue our Energizing the Future transmission program which is in its third year with nearly $3 billion spent so far. After we have an order in Ohio, we hope to be in a position to provide an update on our business outlook at EEI that would include capital plans for our Energizing the Future program as well as our distribution and generation businesses. We also hope to be in a position to provide 2017 guidance and a financing plan. As Chuck said, we had a productive and solid first half and we remain committed to creating long-term value for our shareholders. Now, I'd like to open the call up for your questions"

I think since last January, we've been talking about FirstEnergy's focus in regulated operations and I've talked that competitive business as obviously, we own a merchant generation business. We've been trying to situate it to run it more utility like,  if you will, and I think that's paying off this year. We had a very hot period in June and while we're not here today to talk about third quarter results, very hot July, and the strategy where we're keeping some reserve margin in that generation to protect us against rising loads is working. I think we're running it very reliably and we're making it such that it's a fairly predictable business for us even in the market that it's in. Unfortunately, the predictability is such that it's going to continue to decline in terms of the contribution it makes to the company as a whole, both in the capacity market and in the energy market and is it frustrating that we're shutting down tens of thousands of megawatts of generation in our country that's got life left in it because of the way this market is working and that we are ignoring the fact that we have to build more transmission in order to allow the grid to work the right way when we replace it with natural gas generation that is what I call being built as energy conversion factories not being built to serve customers? That is very frustrating to me. But nonetheless, we need to do the things we need to do as a company to make FirstEnergy strong even with the current merchant business that we have today. I said in my remarks that we will look at every option that's available to us that is positive from a cash and credit perspective to move out of that business over time and that's our goal and That's kind of always been where we've been at."

Thanks for joining us. Since our call in April, we have continued to take aggressive steps to position FirstEnergy for stable, predictable and customer service-oriented growth that will benefit our customers, employees and shareholders. We are making steady progress on our strategic initiatives in our regulated businesses and we've had to make difficult but necessary decisions to address the effects of challenging market dynamics on our competitive business. Today, Jim and I will discuss these developments, our second quarter earnings and the 2016 guidance that we published last night. We have a full agenda, and we want to ensure there's plenty of time for your questions at the end of the call. So let's get started. 
Yesterday afternoon, we reported a second quarter GAAP loss of $2.56 per share, primarily reflecting asset impairments and plant exit costs of $2.99 per share at our competitive business segment, which I will discuss in a moment. On an operating earnings basis, our results for the second quarter were a solid $0.56 per share, which is in line with our expectations. Jim will provide more detail on our financial results. 
Looking at the full year. As you know, we had hope to provide 2016 guidance that would include the final impact of our regulatory outcome in Ohio. However, given the Ohio procedural schedule, we decided to provide guidance now that excludes any potential impact of that case. This is consistent with our desire for transparent communications and also provides our employees with clear financial goals for the remainder of the year. 
On a GAAP basis, we expect a loss for the full year of 2016 in the range of negative $0.75 to negative $0.55 per share. Our operating earnings guidance range for 2016 is $2.40 to $2.60 per share, which includes up to $500 million in additional equity this year. This range is in line with current consensus estimates that exclude any impact from Ohio. Again, the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP primarily reflects the second quarter charges at our competitive business. Jim will provide more details on our 2016 expectations for each business segment, including adjusted EBITDA for our competitive business. 
In our Ohio ESP IV case, we expect to complete hearings next week. The remaining schedule is expected to provide for a potential final order from the PUCO in the September or October timeframe. The hearing is focused on the modified Rider RRS proposal that we filed in May as well as the PUCO staff testimony, which proposed a Distribution Modernization Rider. Neither of these alternatives include a purchase power agreement tied to Davis-Besse, Sammis or any other plant in our fleet. 
Moving to other regulatory matters. You'll recall that in April, we filed new rate requests for our 4 utilities in Pennsylvania and for JCP&L in New Jersey. We received a procedural schedule for the Pennsylvania case with hearing starting on September 6. As always, we'll look forward to beginning settlement discussions on the Pennsylvania cases. In New Jersey, our rate request has moved to the Office of Administrative Law and we are awaiting the procedural schedule. 
In our transmission business, we continue to make progress on our Energizing the Future initiatives. And we were pleased last week to receive Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approval to move our Met-Ed and Penelec transmission assets into our new affiliate company, Mid-Atlantic Interstate Transmission or MAIT. This new stand-alone transmission subsidiary is structured to help facilitate investments that can improve service reliability for these utility customers. In New Jersey, we are also making progress to bring certain JCP&L assets into that subsidiary. A procedural schedule was recently issued with hearings beginning in late October or early November. 
Finally, we continue to review the competitiveness of our generation fleet in light of weak power prices, the low capacity auction outcome in May and an anemic demand forecast. As you know, last Friday, we announced our intent to either sell or deactivate the 136 megawatt Bay Shore plant by October of 2020 and to deactivate Units 1 through 4 of the Sammis plant in May of 2020. This resulted in a pretax impairment charge of $640 million as well as coal contract termination and settlement costs of $58 million associated with retired and deactivated units. 
In addition, based on the low results of the most recent PJM capacity auction for the 2019, 2020 planning year as well as our updated long-term fundamental pricing model, we recognized an $800 million pretax goodwill impairment charge, which represents the total amount of goodwill at our competitive segment. We also recognized valuation allowances of $159 million against state and local NOLs or net operating loss carryforwards, given our current projections and statutory limitations on the utilization of NOLs at the state and local level. No valuation allowances were necessary for our federal NOLs. 
Our country has completed the deactivation of more than 40,000 megawatts of coal-fired generating capacity in the last 6 years with about 40 plants scheduled to close this year alone. Since last fall, the industry has announced the planned retirement of 7 U.S. nuclear stations, totaling nearly 8,000 megawatts of generating capacity with most of these units closing within the next 3 years. We believe it is critical for our country to maintain baseload generation, especially zero-emission nuclear and even coal, which we believe offers greater fuel security than natural gas. And we plan to continue to advocate for competitive reforms that ensure wholesale markets adequately value existing baseload generation. 
At this time, however, we do not see any short-term solutions to the current challenging market situation. Longer-term, we do not believe competitive generation is a good fit for FirstEnergy and our focus on regulated operations. And we cannot put investors and our company at risk as we wait for the country and PJM to address the issues with the current construct. We will continue to seek opportunities both within the competitive realm and the states to further derisk the business and convert megawatts from competitive markets to a regulated or regulated-like construct. 
In particular, we will monitor legislative efforts to maintain important baseload generation in various states, including Ohio and New York. We also plan to work with the West Virginia Public Service Commission when they ready to address the generation shortfall included in Mon Power's integrated resource plan. I continue to believe that those companies that own generation, transmission and distribution in a vertically integrated or other type of fully regulated model are best situated to provide reliable and affordable service to customers now and in the future. And one of our goals has been to keep as much of our current generation fleet viable. But given the market conditions, we will look at all alternatives that are constructed from a balance sheet and cash perspective, including the possible sale or deactivation of additional units. 
As I've stated many times, FirstEnergy's earnings are now more than 80% regulated. And our long-term goal is to operate as a fully regulated utility company. We continue to expect our competitive segment to be cash flow-positive each year through 2018 and our generation team continues to look for cost savings, given the current environment. They have already identified an additional $80 million of fossil fleet cost reductions each year in 2017 and 2018 beyond those identified as part of last year's cash flow improvement project. These savings will help to offset the further erosion in power prices. 
In addition, we plan to delay the Beaver Valley Unit 2 steam generator replacement from 2020 to 2023, given the solid condition of the existing steam generator. Our competitive business will continue to invest in its nuclear units in order to maintain safe and reliable operations and improve overall performance. At the fossil fleet, market conditions will influence our capital investments with current conditions favoring limited investments. We do not intend to infuse additional equity into our competitive business in order to support credit ratings. 
As you know, following our announcement of the asset impairments and plant exit costs last Friday, S&P put FirstEnergy Solutions, Allegheny Energy Supply and Allegheny Generating Company on CreditWatch. We held constructive meetings with both S&P and Moody's earlier this week. We expect both agencies to review our competitive entities at committee meetings in the near future, which may result in non-investment-grade credit ratings for those entities. This could result in potential collateral calls of up to $300 million. However, our available liquidity of about $3 billion would be more than adequate to cover such calls. 
We remain committed to maintaining investment-grade ratings at all of our regulated businesses and to improving FirstEnergy Corp.'s metrics in line with our earlier disclosures. And we remain firmly focus on positioning our company for success through a customer-focused strategy that is designed to provide continuous service reliability and timely recovery of our investments. We believe the actions we have outlined today will build a stronger FirstEnergy for our employees, customers and investors. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Jim."

I will remind you the detailed information about the quarter can be found in the consolidated report that was posted to our website yesterday evening. And as always, we welcome your questions during the Q&A or following the call. 
As Chuck mentioned, asset impairments and plant exit costs of $2.99 per share drove our second quarter GAAP loss of $2.56 per share. Chuck also indicated that our pretax impairment charge for the closure or deactivation of Units 1 through 4 at Sammis and the Bay Shore plant were $640 million. That number is actually $647 million. A full listing of the special items can be found on Page 1 of the consolidated report. 
On an operating earnings basis, our results were $0.56 per share, a solid second quarter and in line with our expectations across all 3 segments. Earnings in our distribution business decreased as a result of higher retirement benefit costs and lower distribution deliveries associated with a decline in average customer usage. These factors were partially offset by the effect of rate increases in Pennsylvania that were implemented in May 2015. 
Total distribution deliveries decreased 1.7% compared to the second quarter of 2015 with a 1.5% decrease in residential sales and less than a 1% decrease in commercial sales. Weather-related usage was essentially flat compared to last year. Sales to industrial customers decreased 2.7%. Similar to last quarter, continued growth in the shale gas sector was more than offset by lower usage from steel and coal mining activity. However, this quarter also reflects a number of temporary shutdowns from industrial customers that should come back online later this year based on our discussions with several large customers. 
In our transmission business, earnings decreased due to ATSI's and TrAIL's annual true-up to their formula rates, reflecting an adjustment to true-up revenue based on estimated recoverable cost to actual cost; a lower ROE at ATSI that went into effect this past January; and lower capitalized financing costs. These factors were partially offset by higher rate base at both ATSI and TrAIL. 
In our competitive business, solid second quarter operating earnings reflect an increase in commodity margin, which primarily benefited from lower purchase power expense, higher wholesale sales related to a larger open position, higher capacity revenues driven by increased capacity prices, lower transmission charges and lower fossil fuel expense. Contract sales volume decreased consistent with our hedging strategy. 
Let's now move on to some details surrounding our 2016 operating earnings guidance of $2.40 to $2.60 per share. This reflects 6 months of actual results and assumes normal weather for the remainder of the year, although July has been quite warm across most of our service territory. First, we'd like to point out that consensus estimates have a very wide range in 2016 of more than $0.50. Several analysts still include the benefit of a PPA, along with varying amounts of equity. When you adjust for these disparities, our 2016 operating earnings guidance is in line with consensus. 
At the regulated utility business, we are expecting 2016 operating earnings of $1.74 to $1.82 per share with a midpoint of $1.78, which is slightly higher than 2015 weather normalized operating earnings of $1.76 per share. We expect share dilution of $0.04 at the distribution segment related to approximately $600 million of total equity this year, including about $100 million in our annual program related to employee benefits and our stock investment program. Ongoing expenses, such as pension, OPEB, depreciation and taxes and the full year impact of the New Jersey rate case resolved last year, are offset by the impact of Pennsylvania rates that went to effect May of 2015 and higher revenues resulting from the increase in the Ohio DCR. 
Residential and commercial sales are expected to decrease this year as customer growth is offset by lower use per customer, driven predominantly by the adoption of energy-efficient technologies, most notably LED lighting. Likewise, the industrial sector is expected to be flat to slightly down this year as growth from the shale sector is offset by steel and related industry slowdowns. The earnings guidance materials published to our website last night include more details on our expectations for load by state and by sector. 
At our transmission segment, we expect a slight uplift over 2015 due to the favorable impact of higher revenues associated with increased rate base at ATSI of $2.1 billion versus $1.7 billion in 2015. This is partially offset by ATSI's lower return on equity of 10.38% compared to 12.38% in the first half and 11.06% in the second half of 2015. 
In the competitive business, we have essentially closed our 2016 targeted forward sales with 64 million megawatt hours of committed sales. 8 million megawatt hours will remain open to market prices for the remainder of the year. Our 2016 adjusted EBITDA for the competitive business is $850 million to $950 million. Positive drivers include one less nuclear outage and the benefit of the cash flow improvement program. Lower capacity revenues associated with lower auction clearing prices beginning in June 2016 will reduce commodity margin year-over-year and increase pension cost and depreciation due to a higher asset base are the main negative drivers. At corporate, an increase in the effective tax rate to 38% in 2016 compared to 36% in 2015, combined with higher interest expense from higher rates on the FirstEnergy revolver and term loan, are the primary drivers. 
Finally, we remain focused on efforts that complement FirstEnergy Corp.'s balance sheet so that we can continue our Energizing the Future transmission program, which is in its third year with nearly $3 billion spent so far. After we have an order in Ohio, we hope to be in a position to provide an update on our business outlook at EEI that would include capital plans for our Energizing the Future program as well as our distribution and generation businesses. We also hope to be in a position to provide 2017 guidance and our financing plan. As Chuck said, we've had a productive and solid first half and we remain committed to creating long-term value for our shareholders. 
Now I'd like to open the call for your questions."

I think since last January, we've been talking about FirstEnergy's focus on regulated operations. And I've talked about that competitive business as obviously we own a merchant generation business. We've been trying to situate it to run it more utility-like,  if you will. And I think that's paying off this year. We had a very hot period in June. And while we're not here today to talk about third quarter results, very hot July, and the strategy where we're keeping some reserve margin in that generation to protect us against rising loads is working. I think we're running it very reliably and we're making it such that it's a fairly predictable business for us even in the market that it's in. Unfortunately, the predictability is such that it's going to continue to decline in terms of the contribution it makes to the company as a whole, both in the capacity market and in the energy market. And is it frustrating that we're shutting down tens of thousands of megawatts of generation in our country that's got life left in it because of the way this market is working and that we're ignoring the fact that we have to build more transmission in order to allow the grid to work the right way when we replace it with natural gas generation that is what I call being built as energy conversion factories, not being built to serve customers? That is very frustrating to me. But nonetheless, I think we are doing the things we need to do as a company to make FirstEnergy strong even with the current merchant business that we have today. I said in my remarks that we will look at every option that's available to us that is positive from a cash and credit perspective to move out of that business over time.

Thanks for joining us. Since our call in April, we have continued to take aggressive steps to position FirstEnergy for stable, predictable and customer service-oriented growth that will benefit our customers, employees and shareholders. We are making steady progress on our strategic initiatives in our regulated businesses and we've had to make difficult but necessary decisions to address the effects of challenging market dynamics on our competitive business. Today, Jim and I will discuss these developments, our second quarter earnings and the 2016 guidance that we published last night. We have a full agenda, and we want to ensure there's plenty of time for your questions at the end of the call. So let's get started. 
Yesterday afternoon, we reported a second quarter GAAP loss of $2.56 per share, primarily reflecting asset impairments and plant exit costs of $2.99 per share at our competitive business segment, which I will discuss in a moment. On an operating earnings basis, our results for the second quarter were a solid $0.56 per share, which is in line with our expectations. Jim will provide more detail on our financial results. 
Looking at the full year. As you know, we had hoped to provide 2016 guidance that would include the final impact of our regulatory outcome in Ohio. However, given the Ohio procedural schedule, we decided to provide guidance now that excludes any potential impact of that case. This is consistent with our desire for transparent communications and also provides our employees with clear financial goals for the remainder of the year. 
On a GAAP basis, we expect a loss for the full year of 2016 in the range of negative $0.75 to negative $0.55 per share. Our operating earnings guidance range for 2016 is $2.40 to $2.60 per share, which includes up to $500 million in additional equity this year. This range is in line with current consensus estimates that exclude any impact from Ohio. Again, the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP primarily reflects the second quarter charges at our competitive business. Jim will provide more details on our 2016 expectations for each business segment, including adjusted EBITDA for our competitive business. 
In our Ohio ESP IV case, we expect to complete hearings next week. The remaining schedule is expected to provide for a potential final order from the PUCO in the September or October timeframe. The hearing is focused on the modified Rider RRS proposal that we filed in May as well as the PUCO staff testimony, which proposed a Distribution Modernization Rider. Neither of these alternatives include a purchase power agreement tied to Davis-Besse, Sammis or any other plant in our fleet. 
Moving to other regulatory matters. You'll recall that in April, we filed new rate requests for our 4 utilities in Pennsylvania and for JCP&L in New Jersey. We received a procedural schedule for the Pennsylvania case with hearing starting on September 6. As always, we'll look forward to beginning settlement discussions on the Pennsylvania cases. In New Jersey, our rate request has moved to the Office of Administrative Law and we are awaiting the procedural schedule. 
In our transmission business, we continue to make progress on our Energizing the Future initiatives. And we were pleased last week to receive Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approval to move our Met-Ed and Penelec transmission assets into our new affiliate company, Mid-Atlantic Interstate Transmission or MAIT. This new stand-alone transmission subsidiary is structured to help facilitate investments that can improve service reliability for these utility customers. In New Jersey, we are also making progress to bring certain JCP&L assets into that subsidiary. A procedural schedule was recently issued with hearings beginning in late October or early November. 
Finally, we continue to review the competitiveness of our generation fleet in light of weak power prices, the low capacity auction outcome in May and an anemic demand forecast. As you know, last Friday, we announced our intent to either sell or deactivate the 136 megawatt Bay Shore plant by October of 2020 and to deactivate Units 1 through 4 of the Sammis plant in May of 2020. This resulted in a pretax impairment charge of $640 million as well as coal contract termination and settlement costs of $58 million associated with retired and deactivated units. 
In addition, based on the low results of the most recent PJM capacity auction for the 2019, 2020 planning year as well as our updated long-term fundamental pricing model, we recognized an $800 million pretax goodwill impairment charge, which represents the total amount of goodwill at our competitive segment. We also recognized valuation allowances of $159 million against state and local NOLs or net operating loss carryforwards, given our current projections and statutory limitations on the utilization of NOLs at the state and local level. No valuation allowances were necessary for our federal NOLs. 
Our country has completed the deactivation of more than 40,000 megawatts of coal-fired generating capacity in the last 6 years with about 40 plants scheduled to close this year alone. Since last fall, the industry has announced the planned retirement of 7 U.S. nuclear stations, totaling nearly 8,000 megawatts of generating capacity with most of these units closing within the next 3 years. We believe it is critical for our country to maintain baseload generation, especially zero-emission nuclear and even coal, which we believe offers greater fuel security than natural gas. And we plan to continue to advocate for competitive reforms that ensure wholesale markets adequately value existing baseload generation. 
At this time, however, we do not see any short-term solutions to the current challenging market situation. Longer-term, we do not believe competitive generation is a good fit for FirstEnergy and our focus on regulated operations. And we cannot put investors and our company at risk as we wait for the country and PJM to address the issues with the current construct. We will continue to seek opportunities both within the competitive realm and the states to further derisk the business and convert megawatts from competitive markets to a regulated or regulated-like construct. 
In particular, we will monitor legislative efforts to maintain important baseload generation in various states, including Ohio and New York. We also plan to work with the West Virginia Public Service Commission when they are ready to address the generation shortfall included in Mon Power's integrated resource plan. I continue to believe that those companies that own generation, transmission and distribution in a vertically integrated or other type of fully regulated model are best situated to provide reliable and affordable service to customers now and in the future. And one of our goals has been to keep as much of our current generation fleet viable. But given the market conditions, we will look at all alternatives that are constructed from a balance sheet and cash perspective, including the possible sale or deactivation of additional units. 
As I've stated many times, FirstEnergy's earnings are now more than 80% regulated. And our long-term goal is to operate as a fully regulated utility company. We continue to expect our competitive segment to be cash flow-positive each year through 2018 and our generation team continues to look for cost savings, given the current environment. They have already identified an additional $80 million of fossil fleet cost reductions each year in 2017 and 2018 beyond those identified as part of last year's cash flow improvement project. These savings will help offset the further erosion in power prices. 
In addition, we plan to delay the Beaver Valley Unit 2 steam generator replacement from 2020 to 2023, given the solid condition of the existing steam generator. Our competitive business will continue to invest in its nuclear units in order to maintain safe and reliable operations and improve overall performance. At the fossil fleet, market conditions will influence our capital investments with current conditions favoring limited investments. We do not intend to infuse additional equity into our competitive business in order to support credit ratings. 
As you know, following our announcement of the asset impairments and plant exit costs last Friday, S&P put FirstEnergy Solutions, Allegheny Energy Supply and Allegheny Generating Company on CreditWatch. We held constructive meetings with both S&P and Moody's earlier this week. We expect both agencies to review our competitive entities at committee meetings in the near future, which may result in non-investment-grade credit ratings for those entities. This could result in potential collateral calls of up to $300 million. However, our available liquidity of about $3 billion would be more than adequate to cover such calls. 
We remain committed to maintaining investment-grade ratings at all of our regulated businesses and to improving FirstEnergy Corp.'s metrics in line with our earlier disclosures. And we remain firmly focus on positioning our company for success through a customer-focused strategy that is designed to provide continuous service reliability and timely recovery of our investments. We believe the actions we have outlined today will build a stronger FirstEnergy for our employees, customers and investors. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Jim."

I will remind you the detailed information about the quarter can be found in the consolidated report that was posted to our website yesterday evening. And as always, we welcome your questions during the Q&A or following the call. 
As Chuck mentioned, asset impairments and plant exit costs of $2.99 per share drove our second quarter GAAP loss of $2.56 per share. Chuck also indicated that our pretax impairment charge for the closure or deactivation of Units 1 through 4 at Sammis and the Bay Shore plant were $640 million. That number is actually $647 million. A full listing of the special items can be found on Page 1 of the consolidated report. 
On an operating earnings basis, our results were $0.56 per share, a solid second quarter and in line with our expectations across all 3 segments. Earnings in our distribution business decreased as a result of higher retirement benefit costs and lower distribution deliveries associated with a decline in average customer usage. These factors were partially offset by the effect of rate increases in Pennsylvania that were implemented in May 2015. 
Total distribution deliveries decreased 1.7% compared to the second quarter of 2015 with a 1.5% decrease in residential sales and less than a 1% decrease in commercial sales. Weather-related usage was essentially flat compared to last year. Sales to industrial customers decreased 2.7%. Similar to last quarter, continued growth in the shale gas sector was more than offset by lower usage from steel and coal mining activity. However, this quarter also reflects a number of temporary shutdowns from industrial customers that should come back online later this year based on our discussions with several large customers. 
In our transmission business, earnings decreased due to ATSI's and TrAIL's annual true-up to their formula rates, reflecting an adjustment to true-up revenue based on estimated recoverable cost to actual cost; a lower ROE at ATSI that went into effect this past January; and lower capitalized financing costs. These factors were partially offset by higher rate base at both ATSI and TrAIL. 
In our competitive business, solid second quarter operating earnings reflect an increase in commodity margin, which primarily benefited from lower purchase power expense, higher wholesale sales related to a larger open position, higher capacity revenues driven by increased capacity prices, lower transmission charges and lower fossil fuel expense. Contract sales volume decreased consistent with our hedging strategy. 
Let's now move on to some details surrounding our 2016 operating earnings guidance of $2.40 to $2.60 per share. This reflects 6 months of actual results and assumes normal weather for the remainder of the year, although July has been quite warm across most of our service territory. First, we'd like to point out that consensus estimates have a very wide range in 2016 of more than $0.50. Several analysts still include the benefit of a PPA, along with varying amounts of equity. When you adjust for these disparities, our 2016 operating earnings guidance is in line with consensus. 
At the regulated utility business, we are expecting 2016 operating earnings of $1.74 to $1.82 per share with a midpoint of $1.78, which is slightly higher than 2015 weather normalized operating earnings of $1.76 per share. We expect share dilution of $0.04 at the distribution segment related to approximately $600 million of total equity this year, including about $100 million in our annual program related to employee benefits and our stock investment program. Ongoing expenses, such as pension, OPEB, depreciation and taxes and the full year impact of the New Jersey rate case resolved last year, are offset by the impact of Pennsylvania rates that went to effect May of 2015 and higher revenues resulting from the increase in the Ohio DCR. 
Residential and commercial sales are expected to decrease this year as customer growth is offset by lower use per customer, driven predominantly by the adoption of energy-efficient technologies, most notably LED lighting. Likewise, the industrial sector is expected to be flat to slightly down this year as growth from the shale sector is offset by steel and related industry slowdowns. The earnings guidance materials published to our website last night include more details on our expectations for load by state and by sector. 
At our transmission segment, we expect a slight uplift over 2015 due to the favorable impact of higher revenues associated with increased rate base at ATSI of $2.1 billion versus $1.7 billion in 2015. This is partially offset by ATSI's lower return on equity of 10.38% compared to 12.38% in the first half and 11.06% in the second half of 2015. 
In the competitive business, we have essentially closed our 2016 targeted forward sales with 64 million megawatt hours of committed sales. 8 million megawatt hours will remain open to market prices for the remainder of the year. Our 2016 adjusted EBITDA for the competitive business is $850 million to $950 million. Positive drivers include one less nuclear outage and the benefit of the cash flow improvement program. Lower capacity revenues associated with lower auction clearing prices beginning in June 2016 will reduce commodity margin year-over-year and increase pension cost and depreciation due to a higher asset base are the main negative drivers. At corporate, an increase in the effective tax rate to 38% in 2016 compared to 36% in 2015, combined with higher interest expense from higher rates on the FirstEnergy revolver and term loan, are the primary drivers. 
Finally, we remain focused on efforts that complement FirstEnergy Corp.'s balance sheet so that we can continue our Energizing the Future transmission program, which is in its third year with nearly $3 billion spent so far. After we have an order in Ohio, we hope to be in a position to provide an update on our business outlook at EEI that would include capital plans for our Energizing the Future program as well as our distribution and generation businesses. We also hope to be in a position to provide 2017 guidance and our financing plan. As Chuck said, we've had a productive and solid first half and we remain committed to creating long-term value for our shareholders. 
Now I'd like to open the call for your questions."

And obviously, you could tell from your tone that frustration has gone to a peak level here. I guess the first question is around the assets, is there other assets that you can sort of highlight that could be potentially rationalized? And then is there a point in time where you sort of capitulate with this business, either move it to non-core or even discontinued operations at this point?"

I think since last January, we've been talking about FirstEnergy's focus on regulated operations. And I've talked about that competitive business as obviously we own a merchant generation business. We've been trying to situate it to run it more utility-like,  if you will. And I think that's paying off this year. We had a very hot period in June. And while we're not here today to talk about third quarter results, very hot in July, and the strategy where we're keeping some reserve margin in that generation to protect us against rising loads is working. I think we're running it very reliably and we're making it such that it's a fairly predictable business for us even in the market that it's in. Unfortunately, the predictability is such that it's going to continue to decline in terms of the contribution it makes to the company as a whole, both in the capacity market and in the energy market. And is it frustrating that we're shutting down tens of thousands of megawatts of generation in our country that's got life left in it because of the way this market is working and that we're ignoring the fact that we have to build more transmission in order to allow the grid to work the right way when we replace it with natural gas generation that is what I call being built as energy conversion factories, not being built to serve customers? That is very frustrating to me. But nonetheless, I think we are doing the things we need to do as a company to make FirstEnergy strong even with the current merchant business that we have today. I said in my remarks that we will look at every option that's available to us that is positive from a cash and credit perspective to move out of that business over time. And that's our goal and that's kind of always been where we've been at."

So we've got another couple of months to get through this case in Ohio. We've been waiting patiently for 2 years and 3 months to get to an outcome here. And with only a couple of months left, I'm not going to start guessing at what the outcome is. We're going to get the outcome.

And the last thing, any limitations aside from that guarantee from legally separating FES via some sort of a sale?"

Thanks for joining us. Since our call in April, we have continued to take aggressive steps to position FirstEnergy for stable, predictable and customer service-oriented growth that will benefit our customers, employees and shareholders. We are making steady progress on our strategic initiatives in our regulated businesses and we've had to make difficult but necessary decisions to address the effects of challenging market dynamics on our competitive business. Today, Jim and I will discuss these developments, our second quarter earnings and the 2016 guidance that we published last night. We have a full agenda, and we want to ensure there's plenty of time for your questions at the end of the call. So let's get started. 
Yesterday afternoon, we reported a second quarter GAAP loss of $2.56 per share, primarily reflecting asset impairments and plant exit costs of $2.99 per share at our competitive business segment, which I will discuss in a moment. On an operating earnings basis, our results for the second quarter were a solid $0.56 per share, which is in line with our expectations. Jim will provide more detail on our financial results. 
Looking at the full year. As you know, we had hoped to provide 2016 guidance that would include the final impact of our regulatory outcome in Ohio. However, given the Ohio procedural schedule, we decided to provide guidance now that excludes any potential impact of that case. This is consistent with our desire for transparent communications and also provides our employees with clear financial goals for the remainder of the year. 
On a GAAP basis, we expect a loss for the full year of 2016 in the range of negative $0.75 to negative $0.55 per share. Our operating earnings guidance range for 2016 is $2.40 to $2.60 per share, which includes up to $500 million in additional equity this year. This range is in line with current consensus estimates that exclude any impact from Ohio. Again, the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP primarily reflects the second quarter charges at our competitive business. Jim will provide more details on our 2016 expectations for each business segment, including adjusted EBITDA for our competitive business. 
In our Ohio ESP IV case, we expect to complete hearings next week. The remaining schedule is expected to provide for a potential final order from the PUCO in the September or October timeframe. The hearing is focused on the modified Rider RRS proposal that we filed in May as well as the PUCO staff testimony, which proposed a Distribution Modernization Rider. Neither of these alternatives include a purchase power agreement tied to Davis-Besse, Sammis or any other plant in our fleet. 
Moving to other regulatory matters. You'll recall that in April, we filed new rate requests for our 4 utilities in Pennsylvania and for JCP&L in New Jersey. We received a procedural schedule for the Pennsylvania case with hearing starting on September 6. As always, we'll look forward to beginning settlement discussions on the Pennsylvania cases. In New Jersey, our rate request has moved to the Office of Administrative Law and we are awaiting the procedural schedule. 
In our transmission business, we continue to make progress on our Energizing the Future initiatives. And we were pleased last week to receive Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approval to move our Met-Ed and Penelec transmission assets into our new affiliate company, Mid-Atlantic Interstate Transmission or MAIT. This new stand-alone transmission subsidiary is structured to help facilitate investments that can improve service reliability for these utility customers. In New Jersey, we are also making progress to bring certain JCP&L assets into that subsidiary. A procedural schedule was recently issued with hearings beginning in late October or early November. 
Finally, we continue to review the competitiveness of our generation fleet in light of weak power prices, the low capacity auction outcome in May and an anemic demand forecast. As you know, last Friday, we announced our intent to either sell or deactivate the 136 megawatt Bay Shore plant by October of 2020 and to deactivate Units 1 through 4 of the Sammis plant in May of 2020. This resulted in a pretax impairment charge of $640 million as well as coal contract termination and settlement costs of $58 million associated with retired and deactivated units. 
In addition, based on the low results of the most recent PJM capacity auction for the 2019, 2020 planning year as well as our updated long-term fundamental pricing model, we recognized an $800 million pretax goodwill impairment charge, which represents the total amount of goodwill at our competitive segment. We also recognized valuation allowances of $159 million against state and local NOLs or net operating loss carryforwards, given our current projections and statutory limitations on the utilization of NOLs at the state and local level. No valuation allowances were necessary for our federal NOLs. 
Our country has completed the deactivation of more than 40,000 megawatts of coal-fired generating capacity in the last 6 years with about 40 plants scheduled to close this year alone. Since last fall, the industry has announced the planned retirement of 7 U.S. nuclear stations, totaling nearly 8,000 megawatts of generating capacity with most of these units closing within the next 3 years. We believe it is critical for our country to maintain baseload generation, especially zero-emission nuclear and even coal, which we believe offers greater fuel security than natural gas. And we plan to continue to advocate for competitive reforms that ensure wholesale markets adequately value existing baseload generation. 
At this time, however, we do not see any short-term solutions to the current challenging market situation. Longer-term, we do not believe competitive generation is a good fit for FirstEnergy and our focus on regulated operations. And we cannot put investors and our company at risk as we wait for the country and PJM to address the issues with the current construct. We will continue to seek opportunities both within the competitive realm and the states to further derisk the business and convert megawatts from competitive markets to a regulated or regulated-like construct. 
In particular, we will monitor legislative efforts to maintain important baseload generation in various states, including Ohio and New York. We also plan to work with the West Virginia Public Service Commission when they are ready to address the generation shortfall included in Mon Power's integrated resource plan. I continue to believe that those companies that own generation, transmission and distribution in a vertically integrated or other type of fully regulated model are best situated to provide reliable and affordable service to customers now and in the future. And one of our goals has been to keep as much of our current generation fleet viable. But given the market conditions, we will look at all alternatives that are constructed from a balance sheet and cash perspective, including the possible sale or deactivation of additional units. 
As I've stated many times, FirstEnergy's earnings are now more than 80% regulated. And our long-term goal is to operate as a fully regulated utility company. We continue to expect our competitive segment to be cash flow-positive each year through 2018 and our generation team continues to look for cost savings, given the current environment. They have already identified an additional $80 million of fossil fleet cost reductions each year in 2017 and 2018 beyond those identified as part of last year's cash flow improvement project. These savings will help offset the further erosion in power prices. 
In addition, we plan to delay the Beaver Valley Unit 2 steam generator replacement from 2020 to 2023, given the solid condition of the existing steam generator. Our competitive business will continue to invest in its nuclear units in order to maintain safe and reliable operations and improve overall performance. At the fossil fleet, market conditions will influence our capital investments with current conditions favoring limited investments. We do not intend to infuse additional equity into our competitive business in order to support credit ratings. 
As you know, following our announcement of the asset impairments and plant exit costs last Friday, S&P put FirstEnergy Solutions, Allegheny Energy Supply and Allegheny Generating Company on CreditWatch. We held constructive meetings with both S&P and Moody's earlier this week. We expect both agencies to review our competitive entities at committee meetings in the near future, which may result in non-investment-grade credit ratings for those entities. This could result in potential collateral calls of up to $300 million. However, our available liquidity of about $3 billion would be more than adequate to cover such calls. 
We remain committed to maintaining investment-grade ratings at all of our regulated businesses and to improving FirstEnergy Corp.'s metrics in line with our earlier disclosures. And we remain firmly focus on positioning our company for success through a customer-focused strategy that is designed to provide continuous service reliability and timely recovery of our investments. We believe the actions we have outlined today will build a stronger FirstEnergy for our employees, customers and investors. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Jim."

I will remind you the detailed information about the quarter can be found in the consolidated report that was posted to our website yesterday evening. And as always, we welcome your questions during the Q&A or following the call. 
As Chuck mentioned, asset impairments and plant exit costs of $2.99 per share drove our second quarter GAAP loss of $2.56 per share. Chuck also indicated that our pretax impairment charge for the closure or deactivation of Units 1 through 4 at Sammis and the Bay Shore plant were $640 million. That number is actually $647 million. A full listing of the special items can be found on Page 1 of the consolidated report. 
On an operating earnings basis, our results were $0.56 per share, a solid second quarter and in line with our expectations across all 3 segments. Earnings in our distribution business decreased as a result of higher retirement benefit costs and lower distribution deliveries associated with a decline in average customer usage. These factors were partially offset by the effect of rate increases in Pennsylvania that were implemented in May 2015. 
Total distribution deliveries decreased 1.7% compared to the second quarter of 2015 with a 1.5% decrease in residential sales and less than a 1% decrease in commercial sales. Weather-related usage was essentially flat compared to last year. Sales to industrial customers decreased 2.7%. Similar to last quarter, continued growth in the shale gas sector was more than offset by lower usage from steel and coal mining activity. However, this quarter also reflects a number of temporary shutdowns from industrial customers that should come back online later this year based on our discussions with several large customers. 
In our transmission business, earnings decreased due to ATSI's and TrAIL's annual true-up to their formula rates, reflecting an adjustment to true-up revenue based on estimated recoverable cost to actual cost; a lower ROE at ATSI that went into effect this past January; and lower capitalized financing costs. These factors were partially offset by higher rate base at both ATSI and TrAIL. 
In our competitive business, solid second quarter operating earnings reflect an increase in commodity margin, which primarily benefited from lower purchase power expense, higher wholesale sales related to a larger open position, higher capacity revenues driven by increased capacity prices, lower transmission charges and lower fossil fuel expense. Contract sales volume decreased consistent with our hedging strategy. 
Let's now move on to some details surrounding our 2016 operating earnings guidance of $2.40 to $2.60 per share. This reflects 6 months of actual results and assumes normal weather for the remainder of the year, although July has been quite warm across most of our service territory. First, we'd like to point out that consensus estimates have a very wide range in 2016 of more than $0.50. Several analysts still include the benefit of a PPA, along with varying amounts of equity. When you adjust for these disparities, our 2016 operating earnings guidance is in line with consensus. 
At the regulated utility business, we are expecting 2016 operating earnings of $1.74 to $1.82 per share with a midpoint of $1.78, which is slightly higher than 2015 weather normalized operating earnings of $1.76 per share. We expect share dilution of $0.04 at the distribution segment related to approximately $600 million of total equity this year, including about $100 million in our annual program related to employee benefits and our stock investment program. Ongoing expenses, such as pension, OPEB, depreciation and taxes and the full year impact of the New Jersey rate case resolved last year, are offset by the impact of Pennsylvania rates that went to effect May of 2015 and higher revenues resulting from the increase in the Ohio DCR. 
Residential and commercial sales are expected to decrease this year as customer growth is offset by lower use per customer, driven predominantly by the adoption of energy-efficient technologies, most notably LED lighting. Likewise, the industrial sector is expected to be flat to slightly down this year as growth from the shale sector is offset by steel and related industry slowdowns. The earnings guidance materials published to our website last night include more details on our expectations for load by state and by sector. 
At our transmission segment, we expect a slight uplift over 2015 due to the favorable impact of higher revenues associated with increased rate base at ATSI of $2.1 billion versus $1.7 billion in 2015. This is partially offset by ATSI's lower return on equity of 10.38% compared to 12.38% in the first half and 11.06% in the second half of 2015. 
In the competitive business, we have essentially closed our 2016 targeted forward sales with 64 million megawatt hours of committed sales. 8 million megawatt hours will remain open to market prices for the remainder of the year. Our 2016 adjusted EBITDA for the competitive business is $850 million to $950 million. Positive drivers include one less nuclear outage and the benefit of the cash flow improvement program. Lower capacity revenues associated with lower auction clearing prices beginning in June 2016 will reduce commodity margin year-over-year and increase pension cost and depreciation due to a higher asset base are the main negative drivers. At corporate, an increase in the effective tax rate to 38% in 2016 compared to 36% in 2015, combined with higher interest expense from higher rates on the FirstEnergy revolver and term loan, are the primary drivers. 
Finally, we remain focused on efforts that complement FirstEnergy Corp.'s balance sheet so that we can continue our Energizing the Future transmission program, which is in its third year with nearly $3 billion spent so far. After we have an order in Ohio, we hope to be in a position to provide an update on our business outlook at EEI that would include capital plans for our Energizing the Future program as well as our distribution and generation businesses. We also hope to be in a position to provide 2017 guidance and our financing plan. As Chuck said, we've had a productive and solid first half and we remain committed to creating long-term value for our shareholders. 
Now I'd like to open the call for your questions."

I think since last January, we've been talking about FirstEnergy's focus on regulated operations. And I've talked about that competitive business as obviously we own a merchant generation business. We've been trying to situate it to run it more utility-like, if you will. And I think that's paying off this year. We had a very hot period in June. And while we're not here today to talk about third quarter results, very hot in July, and the strategy where we're keeping some reserve margin in that generation to protect us against rising loads is working. I think we're running it very reliably and we're making it such that it's a fairly predictable business for us even in the market that it's in. Unfortunately, the predictability is such that it's going to continue to decline in terms of the contribution it makes to the company as a whole, both in the capacity market and in the energy market. And is it frustrating that we're shutting down tens of thousands of megawatts of generation in our country that's got life left in it because of the way this market is working and that we're ignoring the fact that we have to build more transmission in order to allow the grid to work the right way when we replace it with natural gas generation that is what I call being built as energy conversion factories, not being built to serve customers? That is very frustrating to me. But nonetheless, I think we are doing the things we need to do as a company to make FirstEnergy strong even with the current merchant business that we have today. I said in my remarks that we will look at every option that's available to us that is positive from a cash and credit perspective to move out of that business over time.

And we just had the filing in West Virginia a little over a year ago. And Maryland, we're seeing some load growth there. So I would say we're earning right in line with all of our ROEs."

Thanks for joining us. This morning, we reported strong results for the third quarter and increased our operating earnings guidance for the year.

This morning, we reported strong results for the third quarter and increased our operating earnings guidance for the year. During our call today, Jim and I will review our financial results and key strategic developments while leaving ample time for your questions at the conclusion of our prepared remarks. 
Our third quarter GAAP earnings were $0.89 per share while operating earnings were $0.90 per share. These results beat the top of our third quarter operating earnings guidance range by $0.15 due to the favorable impact of record summer temperatures, as well as strong operational results across all 3 of our business segments. For the full year, we are revising our forecasted GAAP results to a loss range of $1.30 to $0.90 per share which primarily reflects the impairments we took in the second quarter, along with this quarter's estimate for the annual pension and OPEB mark-to-market adjustment. In addition, we are raising and narrowing our 2016 operating earnings guidance to a range of $2.60 to $2.70 per share, reflecting the strong third quarter results. In addition to these results, we made solid progress on our regulatory initiatives including reaching a positive settlement with the parties in our Pennsylvania rate cases. The settlements, which have been filed with the Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission, allow for incremental revenue of approximately $291 million across our 4 utilities. The terms of the settlement will provide us with the necessary resources and technology to continue improving our infrastructure and help ensure continued safe and reliable electric service for our 2 million utility customers in Pennsylvania. We expect the Public Utilities Commission to issue its final orders on the settlements before January 26, 2017 and the new rates are expected to take effect on January 27. 
Turning to New Jersey, we are very pleased to announce that we have achieved an agreement in principle with the parties in our rate case, including rate counsel [ph] and the BPU staff, that would provide an $80 million annual revenue increase beginning January 1. The terms of the agreement must still be finalized, filed and approved by the BPU. JCP&L remains committed to providing customers with strong reliability with some of the lowest rates in the state. 
And in Ohio, the Ohio Public Utilities Commission authorized a distribution, modernization writer that will allow our Ohio utilities to collect $204 million per year including the gross up for [ph] taxes through 2019 with a possible 2-year extension. 
Moving to our transmission business. Last week, both our new MAIT subsidiary and JCP&L filed forward-looking formula rates with FERC. These rates will replace stated rates that have been in place since 1998 at JCP&L, Penelec and Met-Ed. The filings will support 2017 transmission investments of more than $170 million in New Jersey and more than $260 million in our Met-Ed and Penelec service areas. In both cases, we have requested the new rates to take effect on January 1, 2017. 
On balance, it was a terrific quarter, and Jim will provide much more detail on our financial results in a few minutes. I'm going to devote the rest of my time discussing the topic I think you really want to hear about, our strategic plans for our competitive generation business. 
As we said on our last earnings call, we do not believe competitive generation is a good fit for FirstEnergy and our regulated growth strategy, but one of my goals since becoming CEO has been to keep as many of our generating units running as possible. We believe that a vertically integrated or regulated-like construct is the best way to provide reliable and affordable electric service to our customers both now and in the future. And of course, preserving these units would also benefit our communities and the employees who have dedicated their careers to keeping the units operating safely and efficiently. We have worked for meaningful market reforms and our team has had tremendous success reducing the cost structure of our generation business. While we have delayed investments where possible at our fossil fleet, we remain committed to making all appropriate investments in our nuclear units in order to maintain safe and reliable operations, and we will not compromise our obligations to the industry, our communities and employees to operate our nuclear fleet with excellence. 
But competitive market conditions continue to deteriorate, punctuated by weak power prices, insufficient results from recent capacity auctions and anemic demand forecasts. The fact is competitive generation is weighing down the rest of our company, and while we have fought hard, we cannot continue to wait for an upturn. Instead, a strategic review of our competitive business is underway and we are pursuing options to thoughtfully, yet expeditiously, move away from competitive markets. We will be assessing several different alternatives in the near term with the goal to implement these strategic options over the next 12 to 18 months. 
First, after the election is over next week, we plan to begin legislative and regulatory efforts designed to preserve our remaining generation assets. We are looking to convert competitive generation to a regulated or regulated-like construct in Ohio while seeking a solution for nuclear units in Ohio and Pennsylvania that recognizes the environmental benefits of these established baseload-generating resources. 
And at West Virginia, Mon Power plans to issue an RFP to address its generation shortfall by the end of this year. We expect that Allegheny energy supply would likely offer the Pleasants plant into that process. We will work diligently with legislators and regulators in each of these states to assess the appetite for solutions that can benefit customers and communities, but not at the expense of extending our transition to becoming fully regulated. 
We're also open to exploring the sale of any or all of these assets, particularly the gas and hydro units at Allegheny Energy Supply. If we find that one or more of these options are not viable, we'll also consider deactivating additional competitive generating units similar to the ones we announced this summer at Sammis units 1-4 and Bay Shore. Again, we will act quickly to assess these alternatives. We believe an accelerated timeframe is necessary so that we can remove lingering uncertainty, especially for our employees, and ensure that our company is singularly focused on the transition to becoming a fully regulated company. As we aggressively pursue these options, we will continue to operate our competitive segment to remain free cash flow positive each year in both 2017 and 2018 and we do not intend to provide equity contributions to the business from FirstEnergy Corporation. 
We met last week with all 3 of the rating agencies to outline our transition to becoming a fully regulated utility and we expect to see announcements from them shortly. Further downgrades of FirstEnergy Solutions by the rating agencies could require posting additional collateral of $355 million, which FirstEnergy Solutions could address through a combination of cash on hand, borrowing under the unregulated money pool or proceeds from asset sales. However, the continued viability of FirstEnergy Solutions is also pressured by some additional risks over the near-term. These risks, which include an inability to implement our strategic alternatives in a timely manner, an adverse outcome related to a coal transportation contract dispute at FirstEnergy Solutions or the inability for FirstEnergy Solutions to extend or refinance debt maturities of $515 million in 2018, could cost FirstEnergy Solutions to take additional actions including restructuring its debt and other financial obligations or seeking bankruptcy protection. We've received a number of questions about FirstEnergy Corporation obligations to the competitive side of the business. Let me take a minute to discuss these questions. 
First, I want to stress that one single qualified pension plan covers all FirstEnergy employees, so the $921 million pension obligation to employees of our competitive business would remain a FirstEnergy obligation. Further, a list of guaranteed amounts can be found in the 10-Q we are filing today. These guaranteed items total $168 million related to CES and include energy contracts, certain generation related matters and that businesses is a portion of [ph] deferred compensation benefits that FirstEnergy guarantees for all affiliate employee participants. Any additional exposure of FirstEnergy Corporation to our competitive business will be considered as part of the strategic review. 
Also note that as we make this transition, we are planning to move forward to bringing on independent board members at FirstEnergy Solutions. Again, we are optimistic that solutions can be found during this strategic review to keep as many of our generating units running as possible. Closing plants is an extremely difficult step, both for me personally and for our company, because keeping them viable is in the best interest of our electric customers, the states, the communities where the plants are located and our employees. But we believe these actions are the right ones for our future. They are consistent with both our goal to operate as a fully regulated utility company and our goal to position the company for stable, predictable and customer service oriented growth that will benefit customers, employees and shareholders. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jim for a review of the quarter."

As always, detailed information about the quarter can be found in the consolidated report which was posted to our website this morning, and we welcome your questions during the Q&A or following the call. As Chu",752,"Thanks, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. As always, detailed information about the quarter can be found in the consolidated report which was posted to our website this morning, and we welcome your questions during the Q&A or following the call. 
As Chuck mentioned, we reported strong GAAP earnings of $0.89 per share and $0.90 per share on an operating earnings basis. These solid results exceeded our expectations due to the impact of record summer temperatures on our distribution business and strong generation plant performance. 
Third quarter cooling degree days were 28% higher than the same period in 2015 and 46% higher than normal, a record in the 38 years that we have been tracking the impact of weather. This drove a 6.9% increase in total distribution deliveries compared to the third quarter of 2015 with a 12.8% increase in residential sales and 4.7% increase in commercial sales. 
In the industrial sector, sales increased 2.4% in the quarter. This is the first increased in industrial deliveries since the first quarter of 2015. The improvement was driven by stronger demand from the shale coal mining and steel industries as well as the chemical and auto sectors. Over the last 1.5 years, we have seen a drop in steel and coal customer sales but both have leveled off. Looking ahead, we expect industrial sales to increase primarily due to the strong growth in the shale-related sector. We will be watching these positive developments very closely in the fourth quarter and into next year. 
Looking at the trends on a year-over-year basis, residential and commercial weather normalized sales are flat and are expected to be flat in the near term. On a positive note, recent residential customer growth has been the highest since early 2007. This trend of approximately 1.5% has been seen across our footprint with the highest growth in the Eastern part of our territory. 
Turning to our transmissions business. Third quarter earnings increased by $0.01 per share due to higher revenues in ATSI and trail which offset higher depreciation and general taxes. Additionally, in the fourth quarter, we will be reclassifying $0.07 per share from our regulated distribution segment to our regulated transmission segment related to a small portion of transmission assets that will be recovered through the formula rates at MAIT and JCP&L. These assets were always under a transmission rate but were included as part of our distribution segment. This change will impact full-year guidance for 2016 between the 2 segments with no impact on our consolidated earnings guidance and it will be reflected in the 2017 earnings guidance that we will post on our website later today. 
In our competitive business, our plants performed well this summer, driving results that were stronger than our internal forecast. This partially offset the expected commodity margin decrease due to lower contract sales volume which is consistent with our hedging strategy and lower capacity revenues reflecting the capacity prices that went into effect in June. Commodity margin also benefited from lower capacity expense, few [ph] on purchase power expense and higher wholesale sales related to a larger open position. As a result of the impact of a hot summer combined with strong operational performance at our generating units, we are narrowing our 2016 adjusted EBITDA to the top end of our previous range at $920 million to $950 million from $850 million to $950 million. We have essentially closed our 2016 targeted forward sales with 67 million-megawatt hours of committed sales and 3 million megawatt-hours remaining open to market prices. 
Finally, at corporate, lower operating expenses were more than offset by higher consolidated effective income tax rate and higher interest expenses. 
As Chuck said, we are revising our forecasted GAAP results to a loss of $1.30 to $0.90 per share and raising and [ph] narrowing our 2016 operating guidance to $2.60 to $2.70 per share. And later this afternoon, we will post to our website a comprehensive packet with our EEI presentation and supplemental materials. This will include our 2016 and 2017 guidance with segment details, a five-year capital expenditure forecast for transmission, a three-year capital expenditure forecast for our utilities and corporate, 2017 and 2018 capital and adjusted EBITDA for the competitive businesses, long-term growth targets for our regulated business as well as our financing plan. We are making these materials available today so that you will have plenty of time to review them in advance of our meetings at the EEI conference. Now I'd like to open the call for your questions"

Thanks for joining us. This morning, we reported strong results for the third quarter and increased our operating earnings guidance for the year.

This morning, we reported strong results for the third quarter and increased our operating earnings guidance for the year. During our call today, Jim and I will review our financial results and key strategic developments while leaving ample time for your questions at the conclusion of our prepared remarks. 
Our third quarter GAAP earnings were $0.89 per share while operating earnings were $0.90 per share. These results beat the top of our third quarter operating earnings guidance range by $0.15 due to the favorable impact of record summer temperatures, as well as strong operational results across all 3 of our business segments. For the full year, we are revising our forecasted GAAP results to a loss range of $1.30 to $0.90 per share which primarily reflects the impairments we took in the second quarter, along with this quarter's estimate for the annual pension and OPEB mark-to-market adjustment. In addition, we are raising and narrowing our 2016 operating earnings guidance to a range of $2.60 to $2.70 per share, reflecting the strong third quarter results. In addition to these results, we made solid progress on our regulatory initiatives including reaching a positive settlement with the parties in our Pennsylvania rate cases. The settlements, which have been filed with the Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission, allow for incremental revenue of approximately $291 million across our 4 utilities. The terms of the settlement will provide us with the necessary resources and technology to continue improving our infrastructure and help ensure continued safe and reliable electric service for our 2 million utility customers in Pennsylvania. We expect the Public Utilities Commission to issue its final orders on the settlements before January 26, 2017 and the new rates are expected to take effect on January 27. 
Turning to New Jersey, we are very pleased to announce that we have achieved an agreement in principle with the parties in our rate case, including rate counsel and the BPU staff, that would provide an $80 million annual revenue increase beginning January 1. The terms of the agreement must still be finalized, filed and approved by the BPU. JCP&L remains committed to providing customers with strong reliability with some of the lowest rates in the state. 
And in Ohio, the Ohio Public Utilities Commission authorized a distribution, modernization writer that will allow our Ohio utilities to collect $204 million per year including the gross up for taxes through 2019 with a possible 2-year extension. 
Moving to our transmission business. Last week, both our new MAIT subsidiary and JCP&L filed forward-looking formula rates with FERC. These rates will replace stated rates that have been in place since 1998 at JCP&L, Penelec and Met-Ed. The filings will support 2017 transmission investments of more than $170 million in New Jersey and more than $260 million in our Met-Ed and Penelec service areas. In both cases, we have requested the new rates to take effect on January 1, 2017. 
On balance, it was a terrific quarter, and Jim will provide much more detail on our financial results in a few minutes. I'm going to devote the rest of my time discussing the topic I think you really want to hear about, our strategic plans for our competitive generation business. 
As we said on our last earnings call, we do not believe competitive generation is a good fit for FirstEnergy and our regulated growth strategy, but one of my goals since becoming CEO has been to keep as many of our generating units running as possible. We believe that a vertically integrated or regulated-like construct is the best way to provide reliable and affordable electric service to our customers both now and in the future. And of course, preserving these units would also benefit our communities and the employees who have dedicated their careers to keeping the units operating safely and efficiently. We have worked for meaningful market reforms and our team has had tremendous success reducing the cost structure of our generation business. While we have delayed investments where possible at our fossil fleet, we remain committed to making all appropriate investments in our nuclear units in order to maintain safe and reliable operations, and we will not compromise our obligations to the industry, our communities and employees to operate our nuclear fleet with excellence. 
But competitive market conditions continue to deteriorate, punctuated by weak power prices, insufficient results from recent capacity auctions and anemic demand forecasts. The fact is competitive generation is weighing down the rest of our company, and while we have fought hard, we cannot continue to wait for an upturn. Instead, a strategic review of our competitive business is underway and we are pursuing options to thoughtfully, yet expeditiously, move away from competitive markets. We will be assessing several different alternatives in the near term with the goal to implement these strategic options over the next 12 to 18 months. 
First, after the election is over next week, we plan to begin legislative and regulatory efforts designed to preserve our remaining generation assets. We are looking to convert competitive generation to a regulated or regulated-like construct in Ohio while seeking a solution for nuclear units in Ohio and Pennsylvania that recognizes the environmental benefits of these established baseload-generating resources. 
And at West Virginia, Mon Power plans to issue an RFP to address its generation shortfall by the end of this year. We expect that Allegheny energy supply would likely offer the Pleasants plant into that process. We will work diligently with legislators and regulators in each of these states to assess the appetite for solutions that can benefit customers and communities, but not at the expense of extending our transition to becoming fully regulated. 
We're also open to exploring the sale of any or all of these assets, particularly the gas and hydro units at Allegheny Energy Supply. If we find that one or more of these options are not viable, we'll also consider deactivating additional competitive generating units similar to the ones we announced this summer at Sammis units 1-4 and Bay Shore. Again, we will act quickly to assess these alternatives. We believe an accelerated timeframe is necessary so that we can remove lingering uncertainty, especially for our employees, and ensure that our company is singularly focused on the transition to becoming a fully regulated company. As we aggressively pursue these options, we will continue to operate our competitive segment to remain free cash flow positive each year in both 2017 and 2018 and we do not intend to provide equity contributions to the business from FirstEnergy Corporation. 
We met last week with all 3 of the rating agencies to outline our transition to becoming a fully regulated utility and we expect to see announcements from them shortly. Further downgrades of FirstEnergy Solutions by the rating agencies could require posting additional collateral of $355 million, which FirstEnergy Solutions could address through a combination of cash on hand, borrowing under the unregulated money pool or proceeds from asset sales. However, the continued viability of FirstEnergy Solutions is also pressured by some additional risks over the near-term. These risks, which include an inability to implement our strategic alternatives in a timely manner, an adverse outcome related to a coal transportation contract dispute at FirstEnergy Solutions or the inability for FirstEnergy Solutions to extend or refinance debt maturities of $515 million in 2018, could cost FirstEnergy Solutions to take additional actions including restructuring its debt and other financial obligations or seeking bankruptcy protection. We've received a number of questions about FirstEnergy Corporation obligations to the competitive side of the business. Let me take a minute to discuss these questions. 
First, I want to stress that one single qualified pension plan covers all FirstEnergy employees, so the $921 million pension obligation to employees of our competitive business would remain a FirstEnergy obligation. Further, a list of guaranteed amounts can be found in the 10-Q we are filing today. These guaranteed items total $168 million related to CES and include energy contracts, certain generation-related matters, and that businesses is portion of deferred compensation benefits that FirstEnergy guarantees for all affiliate employee participants. Any additional exposure of FirstEnergy Corporation to our competitive business will be considered as part of the strategic review. 
Also note that as we make this transition, we are planning to move forward to bringing on independent board members at FirstEnergy Solutions. Again, we are optimistic that solutions can be found during this strategic review to keep as many of our generating units running as possible. Closing plants is an extremely difficult step, both for me personally and for our company, because keeping them viable is in the best interest of our electric customers, the states, the communities where the plants are located and our employees. But we believe these actions are the right ones for our future. They are consistent with both our goal to operate as a fully regulated utility company and our goal to position the company for stable, predictable and customer service oriented growth that will benefit customers, employees and shareholders. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jim for a review of the quarter."

As Chu",750,"Thanks, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. As always, detailed information about the quarter can be found in the consolidated report which was posted to our website this morning, and we welcome your questions during the Q&A or following the call. 
As Chuck mentioned, we reported strong GAAP earnings of $0.89 per share and $0.90 per share on an operating earnings basis. These solid results exceeded our expectations due to the impact of record summer temperatures on our distribution business and strong generation plant performance. 
Third quarter cooling degree days were 28% higher than the same period in 2015 and 46% higher than normal, a record in the 38 years that we have been tracking the impact of weather. This drove a 6.9% increase in total distribution deliveries compared to the third quarter of 2015 with a 12.8% increase in residential sales and 4.7% increase in commercial sales. 
In the industrial sector, sales increased 2.4% in the quarter. This is the first increased in industrial deliveries since the first quarter of 2015. The improvement was driven by stronger demand from the shale coal mining and steel industries as well as the chemical and auto sectors. Over the last 1.5 years, we have seen a drop in steel and coal customer sales but both have leveled off. Looking ahead, we expect industrial sales to increase primarily due to the strong growth in the shale-related sector. We will be watching these positive developments very closely in the fourth quarter and into next year. 
Looking at the trends on a year-over-year basis, residential and commercial weather normalized sales are flat and are expected to be flat in the near term. On a positive note, recent residential customer growth has been the highest since early 2007. This trend of approximately 1.5% has been seen across our footprint with the highest growth in the Eastern part of our territory. 
Turning to our transmissions business. Third quarter earnings increased by $0.01 per share due to higher revenues in ATSI and trail which offset higher depreciation and general taxes. Additionally, in the fourth quarter, we will be reclassifying $0.07 per share from our regulated distribution segment to our regulated transmission segment related to a small portion of transmission assets that will be recovered through the formula rates at MAIT and JCP&L. These assets were always under a transmission rate but were included as part of our distribution segment. This change will impact full-year guidance for 2016 between the 2 segments with no impact on our consolidated earnings guidance and it will be reflected in the 2017 earnings guidance that we will post on our website later today. 
In our competitive business, our plants performed well this summer, driving results that were stronger than our internal forecast. This partially offset the expected commodity margin decrease due to lower contract sales volume which is consistent with our hedging strategy and lower capacity revenues reflecting the capacity prices that went into effect in June. Commodity margin also benefited from lower capacity expense, fuel and purchased power expense and higher wholesale sales related to a larger open position. As a result of the impact of a hot summer combined with strong operational performance at our generating units, we are narrowing our 2016 adjusted EBITDA to the top end of our previous range at $920 million to $950 million from $850 million to $950 million. We have essentially closed our 2016 targeted forward sales with 67 million-megawatt hours of committed sales and 3 million megawatt-hours remaining open to market prices. 
Finally, at corporate, lower operating expenses were more than offset by higher consolidated effective income tax rate and higher interest expenses. 
As Chuck said, we are revising our forecasted GAAP results to a loss of $1.30 to $0.90 per share and raising and  narrowing our 2016 operating guidance to $2.60 to $2.70 per share. And later this afternoon, we will post to our website a comprehensive packet with our EEI presentation and supplemental materials. This will include our 2016 and 2017 guidance with segment details, a 5-year capital expenditure forecast for transmission, a 3-year capital expenditure forecast for our utilities and corporate, 2017 and 2018 capital and adjusted EBITDA for the competitive businesses, long-term growth targets for our regulated business as well as our financing plan. We are making these materials available today so that you will have plenty of time to review them in advance of our meetings at the EEI conference.

Thanks for joining us. This morning, we reported strong results for the third quarter and increased our operating earnings guidance for the year.

This morning, we reported strong results for the third quarter and increased our operating earnings guidance for the year. During our call today, Jim and I will review our financial results and key strategic developments while leaving ample time for your questions at the conclusion of our prepared remarks. 
Our third quarter GAAP earnings were $0.89 per share while operating earnings were $0.90 per share. These results beat the top of our third quarter operating earnings guidance range by $0.15 due to the favorable impact of record summer temperatures, as well as strong operational results across all 3 of our business segments. 
For the full year, we are revising our forecasted GAAP results to a loss range of $1.30 to $0.90 per share which primarily reflects the impairments we took in the second quarter, along with this quarter's estimate for the annual pension and OPEB mark-to-market adjustment. In addition, we are raising and narrowing our 2016 operating earnings guidance to a range of $2.60 to $2.70 per share, reflecting the strong third quarter results. 
In addition to these results, we made solid progress on our regulatory initiatives including reaching a positive settlement with the parties in our Pennsylvania rate cases. The settlements, which have been filed with the Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission, allow for incremental revenue of approximately $291 million across our 4 utilities. 
The terms of the settlement will provide us with the necessary resources and technology to continue improving our infrastructure and help ensure continued safe and reliable electric service for our 2 million utility customers in Pennsylvania. We expect the Public Utilities Commission to issue its final orders on the settlements before January 26, 2017 and the new rates are expected to take effect on January 27. 
Turning to New Jersey, we are very pleased to announce that we have achieved an agreement in principle with the parties in our rate case, including rate counsel and the BPU staff, that would provide an $80 million annual revenue increase beginning January 1. The terms of the agreement must still be finalized, filed and approved by the BPU. JCP&L remains committed to providing customers with strong reliability with some of the lowest rates in the state. 
And in Ohio, the Ohio Public Utilities Commission authorized a Distribution Modernization Rider that will allow our Ohio utilities to collect $204 million per year including the gross up for taxes through 2019 with a possible 2-year extension. 
Moving to our transmission business. Last week, both our new MAIT subsidiary and JCP&L filed forward-looking formula rates with FERC. These rates will replace stated rates that have been in place since 1998 at JCP&L, Penelec and Met-Ed. The filings will support 2017 transmission investments of more than $170 million in New Jersey and more than $260 million in our Met-Ed and Penelec service areas. In both cases, we have requested the new rates to take effect on January 1, 2017. 
On balance, it was a terrific quarter, and Jim will provide much more detail on our financial results in a few minutes. I'm going to devote the rest of my time discussing the topic I think you really want to hear about, our strategic plans for our competitive generation business. 
As we said on our last earnings call, we do not believe competitive generation is a good fit for FirstEnergy and our regulated growth strategy, but one of my goals since becoming CEO has been to keep as many of our generating units running as possible. We believe that a vertically integrated or regulated-like construct is the best way to provide reliable and affordable electric service to our customers both now and in the future. And of course, preserving these units would also benefit our communities and the employees who have dedicated their careers to keeping the units operating safely and efficiently. 
We have worked for meaningful market reforms and our team has had tremendous success reducing the cost structure of our generation business. While we have delayed investments where possible at our fossil fleet, we remain committed to making all appropriate investments in our nuclear units in order to maintain safe and reliable operations, and we will not compromise our obligations to the industry, our communities and employees to operate our nuclear fleet with excellence. 
But competitive market conditions continue to deteriorate, punctuated by weak power prices, insufficient results from recent capacity auctions and anemic demand forecasts. The fact is competitive generation is weighing down the rest of our company, and while we have fought hard, we cannot continue to wait for an upturn. Instead, a strategic review of our competitive business is underway and we are pursuing options to thoughtfully, yet expeditiously, move away from competitive markets. We will be assessing several different alternatives in the near term with the goal to implement these strategic options over the next 12 to 18 months. 
First, after the election is over next week, we plan to begin legislative and regulatory efforts designed to preserve our remaining generation assets. We are looking to convert competitive generation to a regulated or regulated-like construct in Ohio while seeking a solution for nuclear units in Ohio and Pennsylvania that recognizes the environmental benefits of these established baseload-generating resources. 
And at West Virginia, Mon Power plans to issue an RFP to address its generation shortfall by the end of this year. We expect that Allegheny energy supply would likely offer the Pleasants plant into that process. We will work diligently with legislators and regulators in each of these states to assess the appetite for solutions that can benefit customers and communities, but not at the expense of extending our transition to becoming fully regulated. 
We're also open to exploring the sale of any or all of these assets, particularly the gas and hydro units at Allegheny Energy Supply. If we find that one or more of these options are not viable, we'll also consider deactivating additional competitive generating units similar to the ones we announced this summer at Sammis units 1-4 and Bay Shore. 
Again, we will act quickly to assess these alternatives. We believe an accelerated time frame is necessary so that we can remove lingering uncertainty, especially for our employees, and ensure that our company is singularly focused on the transition to becoming a fully regulated company. As we aggressively pursue these options, we will continue to operate our competitive segment to remain free cash flow positive each year in both 2017 and 2018 and we do not intend to provide equity contributions to the business from FirstEnergy Corporation. 
We met last week with all 3 of the rating agencies to outline our transition to becoming a fully regulated utility and we expect to see announcements from them shortly. Further downgrades of FirstEnergy Solutions by the rating agencies could require posting additional collateral of $355 million, which FirstEnergy Solutions could address through a combination of cash on hand, borrowing under the unregulated money pool or proceeds from asset sales. 
However, the continued viability of FirstEnergy Solutions is also pressured by some additional risks over the near-term. These risks, which include an inability to implement our strategic alternatives in a timely manner, an adverse outcome related to a coal transportation contract dispute at FirstEnergy Solutions or the inability for FirstEnergy Solutions to extend or refinance debt maturities of $515 million in 2018, could cause FirstEnergy Solutions to take additional actions including restructuring its debt and other financial obligations or seeking bankruptcy protection. 
We've received a number of questions about FirstEnergy Corporation obligations to the competitive side of the business. Let me take a minute to discuss these questions. 
First, I want to stress that one single qualified pension plan covers all FirstEnergy employees, so the $921 million pension obligation to employees of our competitive business would remain a FirstEnergy obligation. Further, a list of guaranteed amounts can be found in the 10-Q we are filing today. These guaranteed items total $168 million related to CES and include energy contracts, certain generation-related matters, and that business's portion of deferred compensation benefits that FirstEnergy guarantees for all affiliate employee participants. Any additional exposure of FirstEnergy Corporation to our competitive business will be considered as part of the strategic review. 
Also note that as we make this transition, we are planning to move forward to bringing on independent board members at FirstEnergy Solutions. Again, we are optimistic that solutions can be found during this strategic review to keep as many of our generating units running as possible. 
Closing plants is an extremely difficult step, both for me personally and for our company, because keeping them viable is in the best interest of our electric customers, the states, the communities where the plants are located and our employees. But we believe these actions are the right ones for our future. They are consistent with both our goal to operate as a fully regulated utility company and our goal to position the company for stable, predictable and customer service oriented growth that will benefit customers, employees and shareholders. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jim for a review of the quarter."

As Chu",750,"Thanks, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. As always, detailed information about the quarter can be found in the consolidated report which was posted to our website this morning, and we welcome your questions during the Q&A or following the call. 
As Chuck mentioned, we reported strong GAAP earnings of $0.89 per share and $0.90 per share on an operating earnings basis. These solid results exceeded our expectations due to the impact of record summer temperatures on our distribution business and strong generation plant performance. 
Third quarter cooling degree days were 28% higher than the same period in 2015 and 46% higher than normal, a record in the 38 years that we have been tracking the impact of weather. This drove a 6.9% increase in total distribution deliveries compared to the third quarter of 2015 with a 12.8% increase in residential sales and 4.7% increase in commercial sales. 
In the industrial sector, sales increased 2.4% in the quarter. This is the first increased in industrial deliveries since the first quarter of 2015. The improvement was driven by stronger demand from the shale, coal mining and steel industries as well as the chemical and auto sectors. Over the last 1.5 years, we have seen a drop in steel and coal customer sales but both have leveled off. Looking ahead, we expect industrial sales to increase primarily due to the strong growth in the shale-related sector. We will be watching these positive developments very closely in the fourth quarter and into next year. 
Looking at the trends on a year-over-year basis, residential and commercial weather normalized sales are flat and are expected to be flat in the near term. On a positive note, recent residential customer growth has been the highest since early 2007. This trend of approximately 1.5% has been seen across our footprint with the highest growth in the Eastern part of our territory. 
Turning to our transmissions business. Third quarter earnings increased by $0.01 per share due to higher revenues in ATSI and TrAIL which offset higher depreciation and general taxes. Additionally, in the fourth quarter, we will be reclassifying $0.07 per share from our regulated distribution segment to our regulated transmission segment related to a small portion of transmission assets that will be recovered through the formula rates at MAIT and JCP&L. These assets were always under a transmission rate but were included as part of our distribution segment. This change will impact full-year guidance for 2016 between the 2 segments with no impact on our consolidated earnings guidance and it will be reflected in the 2017 earnings guidance that we will post on our website later today. 
In our competitive business, our plants performed well this summer, driving results that were stronger than our internal forecast. This partially offset the expected commodity margin decrease due to lower contract sales volume which is consistent with our hedging strategy and lower capacity revenues reflecting the capacity prices that went into effect in June. 
Commodity margin also benefited from lower capacity expense, fuel and purchased power expense and higher wholesale sales related to a larger open position. As a result of the impact of a hot summer combined with strong operational performance at our generating units, we are narrowing our 2016 adjusted EBITDA to the top end of our previous range at $920 million to $950 million from $850 million to $950 million. We have essentially closed our 2016 targeted forward sales with 67 million-megawatt hours of committed sales and 3 million megawatt-hours remaining open to market prices. 
Finally, at corporate, lower operating expenses were more than offset by higher consolidated effective income tax rate and higher interest expenses. 
As Chuck said, we are revising our forecasted GAAP results to a loss of $1.30 to $0.90 per share and raising and narrowing our 2016 operating guidance to $2.60 to $2.70 per share. And later this afternoon, we will post to our website a comprehensive packet with our EEI presentation and supplemental materials. This will include our 2016 and 2017 guidance with segment details; a 5-year capital expenditure forecast for transmission; a 3-year capital expenditure forecast for our utilities and corporate; 2017 and 2018 capital and adjusted EBITDA for the competitive businesses; long-term growth targets for our regulated business as well as our financing plan. We are making these materials available today so that you will have plenty of time to review them in advance of our meetings at the EEI conference.

Thanks for joining us. This morning, we reported strong results for the third quarter and increased our operating earnings guidance for the year.

This morning, we reported strong results for the third quarter and increased our operating earnings guidance for the year. During our call today, Jim and I will review our financial results and key strategic developments while leaving ample time for your questions at the conclusion of our prepared remarks. 
Our third quarter GAAP earnings were $0.89 per share while operating earnings were $0.90 per share. These results beat the top of our third quarter operating earnings guidance range by $0.15 due to the favorable impact of record summer temperatures, as well as strong operational results across all 3 of our business segments. 
For the full year, we are revising our forecasted GAAP results to a loss range of $1.30 to $0.90 per share which primarily reflects the impairments we took in the second quarter, along with this quarter's estimate for the annual pension and OPEB mark-to-market adjustment. In addition, we are raising and narrowing our 2016 operating earnings guidance to a range of $2.60 to $2.70 per share, reflecting the strong third quarter results. 
In addition to these results, we made solid progress on our regulatory initiatives including reaching a positive settlement with the parties in our Pennsylvania rate cases. The settlements, which have been filed with the Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission, allow for incremental revenue of approximately $291 million across our 4 utilities. 
The terms of the settlement will provide us with the necessary resources and technology to continue improving our infrastructure and help ensure continued safe and reliable electric service for our 2 million utility customers in Pennsylvania. We expect the Public Utilities Commission to issue its final orders on the settlements before January 26, 2017 and the new rates are expected to take effect on January 27. 
Turning to New Jersey, we are very pleased to announce that we have achieved an agreement in principle with the parties in our rate case, including rate counsel and the BPU staff, that would provide an $80 million annual revenue increase beginning January 1. The terms of the agreement must still be finalized, filed and approved by the BPU. JCP&L remains committed to providing customers with strong reliability with some of the lowest rates in the state. 
And in Ohio, the Ohio Public Utilities Commission authorized a Distribution Modernization Rider that will allow our Ohio utilities to collect $204 million per year including the gross up for taxes through 2019 with a possible 2-year extension. 
Moving to our transmission business. Last week, both our new MAIT subsidiary and JCP&L filed forward-looking formula rates with FERC. These rates will replace stated rates that have been in place since 1998 at JCP&L, Penelec and Met-Ed. The filings will support 2017 transmission investments of more than $170 million in New Jersey and more than $260 million in our Met-Ed and Penelec service areas. In both cases, we have requested the new rates to take effect on January 1, 2017. 
On balance, it was a terrific quarter, and Jim will provide much more detail on our financial results in a few minutes. I'm going to devote the rest of my time discussing the topic I think you really want to hear about, our strategic plans for our competitive generation business. 
As we said on our last earnings call, we do not believe competitive generation is a good fit for FirstEnergy and our regulated growth strategy, but one of my goals since becoming CEO has been to keep as many of our generating units running as possible. We believe that a vertically integrated or regulated-like construct is the best way to provide reliable and affordable electric service to our customers both now and in the future. And of course, preserving these units would also benefit our communities and the employees who have dedicated their careers to keeping the units operating safely and efficiently. 
We have worked for meaningful market reforms and our team has had tremendous success reducing the cost structure of our generation business. While we have delayed investments where possible at our fossil fleet, we remain committed to making all appropriate investments in our nuclear units in order to maintain safe and reliable operations, and we will not compromise our obligations to the industry, our communities and employees to operate our nuclear fleet with excellence. 
But competitive market conditions continue to deteriorate, punctuated by weak power prices, insufficient results from recent capacity auctions and anemic demand forecasts. The fact is competitive generation is weighing down the rest of our company, and while we have fought hard, we cannot continue to wait for an upturn. Instead, a strategic review of our competitive business is underway and we are pursuing options to thoughtfully, yet expeditiously, move away from competitive markets. We will be assessing several different alternatives in the near term with the goal to implement these strategic options over the next 12 to 18 months. 
First, after the election is over next week, we plan to begin legislative and regulatory efforts designed to preserve our remaining generation assets. We are looking to convert competitive generation to a regulated or regulated-like construct in Ohio while seeking a solution for nuclear units in Ohio and Pennsylvania that recognizes the environmental benefits of these established baseload-generating resources. 
And at West Virginia, Mon Power plans to issue an RFP to address its generation shortfall by the end of this year. We expect that Allegheny energy supply would likely offer the Pleasants plant into that process. We will work diligently with legislators and regulators in each of these states to assess the appetite for solutions that can benefit customers and communities, but not at the expense of extending our transition to becoming fully regulated. 
We're also open to exploring the sale of any or all of these assets, particularly the gas and hydro units at Allegheny Energy Supply. If we find that one or more of these options are not viable, we'll also consider deactivating additional competitive generating units similar to the ones we announced this summer at Sammis units 1-4 and Bay Shore. 
Again, we will act quickly to assess these alternatives. We believe an accelerated time frame is necessary so that we can remove lingering uncertainty, especially for our employees, and ensure that our company is singularly focused on the transition to becoming a fully regulated company. As we aggressively pursue these options, we will continue to operate our competitive segment to remain free cash flow positive each year in both 2017 and 2018 and we do not intend to provide equity contributions to the business from FirstEnergy Corporation. 
We met last week with all 3 of the rating agencies to outline our transition to becoming a fully regulated utility and we expect to see announcements from them shortly. Further downgrades of FirstEnergy Solutions by the rating agencies could require posting additional collateral of $355 million, which FirstEnergy Solutions could address through a combination of cash on hand, borrowing under the unregulated money pool or proceeds from asset sales. 
However, the continued viability of FirstEnergy Solutions is also pressured by some additional risks over the near-term. These risks, which include an inability to implement our strategic alternatives in a timely manner, an adverse outcome related to a coal transportation contract dispute at FirstEnergy Solutions or the inability for FirstEnergy Solutions to extend or refinance debt maturities of $515 million in 2018, could cause FirstEnergy Solutions to take additional actions including restructuring its debt and other financial obligations or seeking bankruptcy protection. 
We've received a number of questions about FirstEnergy Corporation obligations to the competitive side of the business. Let me take a minute to discuss these questions. 
First, I want to stress that one single qualified pension plan covers all FirstEnergy employees, so the $921 million pension obligation to employees of our competitive business would remain a FirstEnergy obligation. Further, a list of guaranteed amounts can be found in the 10-Q we are filing today. These guaranteed items total $168 million related to CES and include energy contracts, certain generation-related matters, and that business's portion of deferred compensation benefits that FirstEnergy guarantees for all affiliate employee participants. Any additional exposure of FirstEnergy Corporation to our competitive business will be considered as part of the strategic review. 
Also note that as we make this transition, we are planning to move forward to bringing on independent board members at FirstEnergy Solutions. Again, we are optimistic that solutions can be found during this strategic review to keep as many of our generating units running as possible. 
Closing plants is an extremely difficult step, both for me personally and for our company, because keeping them viable is in the best interest of our electric customers, the states, the communities where the plants are located and our employees. But we believe these actions are the right ones for our future. They are consistent with both our goal to operate as a fully regulated utility company and our goal to position the company for stable, predictable and customer service oriented growth that will benefit customers, employees and shareholders. 
I'll now turn the call over to Jim for a review of the quarter."

As always, detailed information about the quarter can be found in the consolidated report which was posted to our website this morning, and we welcome your questions during the Q&A or following the call. As Chu",750,"Thanks, Chuck, and good morning, everyone. As always, detailed information about the quarter can be found in the consolidated report which was posted to our website this morning, and we welcome your questions during the Q&A or following the call. 
As Chuck mentioned, we reported strong GAAP earnings of $0.89 per share and $0.90 per share on an operating earnings basis. These solid results exceeded our expectations due to the impact of record summer temperatures on our distribution business and strong generation plant performance. 
Third quarter cooling degree days were 28% higher than the same period in 2015 and 46% higher than normal, a record in the 38 years that we have been tracking the impact of weather. This drove a 6.9% increase in total distribution deliveries compared to the third quarter of 2015 with a 12.8% increase in residential sales and 4.7% increase in commercial sales. 
In the industrial sector, sales increased 2.4% in the quarter. This is the first increased in industrial deliveries since the first quarter of 2015. The improvement was driven by stronger demand from the shale, coal mining and steel industries as well as the chemical and auto sectors. Over the last 1.5 years, we have seen a drop in steel and coal customer sales but both have leveled off. Looking ahead, we expect industrial sales to increase primarily due to the strong growth in the shale-related sector. We will be watching these positive developments very closely in the fourth quarter and into next year. 
Looking at the trends on a year-over-year basis, residential and commercial weather normalized sales are flat and are expected to be flat in the near term. On a positive note, recent residential customer growth has been the highest since early 2007. This trend of approximately 1.5% has been seen across our footprint with the highest growth in the Eastern part of our territory. 
Turning to our transmissions business. Third quarter earnings increased by $0.01 per share due to higher revenues in ATSI and TrAIL which offset higher depreciation and general taxes. Additionally, in the fourth quarter, we will be reclassifying $0.07 per share from our regulated distribution segment to our regulated transmission segment related to a small portion of transmission assets that will be recovered through the formula rates at MAIT and JCP&L. These assets were always under a transmission rate but were included as part of our distribution segment. This change will impact full-year guidance for 2016 between the 2 segments with no impact on our consolidated earnings guidance and it will be reflected in the 2017 earnings guidance that we will post on our website later today. 
In our competitive business, our plants performed well this summer, driving results that were stronger than our internal forecast. This partially offset the expected commodity margin decrease due to lower contract sales volume which is consistent with our hedging strategy and lower capacity revenues reflecting the capacity prices that went into effect in June. 
Commodity margin also benefited from lower capacity expense, fuel and purchased power expense and higher wholesale sales related to a larger open position. As a result of the impact of a hot summer combined with strong operational performance at our generating units, we are narrowing our 2016 adjusted EBITDA to the top end of our previous range at $920 million to $950 million from $850 million to $950 million. We have essentially closed our 2016 targeted forward sales with 67 million-megawatt hours of committed sales and 3 million megawatt-hours remaining open to market prices. 
Finally, at corporate, lower operating expenses were more than offset by higher consolidated effective income tax rate and higher interest expenses. 
As Chuck said, we are revising our forecasted GAAP results to a loss of $1.30 to $0.90 per share and raising and narrowing our 2016 operating guidance to $2.60 to $2.70 per share. And later this afternoon, we will post to our website a comprehensive packet with our EEI presentation and supplemental materials. This will include our 2016 and 2017 guidance with segment details; a 5-year capital expenditure forecast for transmission; a 3-year capital expenditure forecast for our utilities and corporate; 2017 and 2018 capital and adjusted EBITDA for the competitive businesses; long-term growth targets for our regulated business as well as our financing plan. We are making these materials available today so that you will have plenty of time to review them in advance of our meetings at the EEI conference.
