Joining me today is Judy Brown, Perrigo's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. 
Now here's the agenda for today's call. First, I will walk through some of the key financial highlights for calendar year 2015. Then I'll highlight the advantages of our focused strategy within our consumer-facing OTC global platform which, when, coupled with the earnings power of our Prescription Pharmaceutical business, creates a truly unique, diversified and sustainable business. After that, Judy will go through the details of the fourth quarter results and guidance for calendar 2016, and then we'll close and an opportunity for Q&A. 
Before starting on the call, I'd like to take a moment to highlight some changes in our Investor Relations group. As part of previously announced consolidation of certain functions in Ireland, Art Shannon will relocate to Ireland and will be assuming the role of Vice President of Global Corporate Affairs and European Investor Relationship. Art will continue to oversee both internal and external global communications and will continue to be the lead point of contact for media and government relations. In addition, he will now be responsible for establishing a global government relations based in Dublin and expanding Perrigo's shareholder-focused Investor Relations program in Europe. I hope you can join me congratulating both of them.
On Slide 5, you can see this was a record year for Perrigo across all key metrics and record net sales and record adjusted operating income. This highlights our continued growth from the combination of our durable Consumer Healthcare model to our diversified Rx portfolio and inorganic acquisition strategy. 
Overall, 2015 was another great year. Perrigo achieved record net sales for the year of $5.4 billion, a 28% increase with record adjusted operating margins. We expanded adjusted gross margin by 400 basis points to 48%, driven by strong business mix, including the addition of our new Branded Consumer Healthcare over Omega business. And of course, supply-chain efficiencies. 
Adjusted operating income increased 29% year-over-year to $1.5 billion. Finally, as you see here, our net operating cash flow for the full year increased to $1.05 billion, also another record for Perrigo. 
2015 included a number of key growth drivers. We introduced over 160 new products in key categories, including the store brand version of Mucinex D and the generic prescription version of Kovacs spray. We also expanded our business by completing 7 acquisitions, including 5 focused on building geographic scale and capabilities within our Consumer Healthcare platform. 
We created our pan-European platform with the acquisition of Omega. We added soft gel capabilities from the acquisition from [indiscernible] Mexico. We acquired a new portfolio of OTC -- leading OTC brands from GSK. We added the product line to our BCH portfolio, and we added our first U.S. Branded Consumer Healthcare product, ScarAway. 
I'd like to take a moment to thank the dedicated Perrigo employees, who amidst some uncertainty last year weathered a demanding year. Your unwavering commitment to affordable healthcare products to customers and patients across the globe was truly outstanding. And you did it all while delivering record financial performance for the year. Thank you for all your dedication and great work.
You can see on Slide 6 the operational achievements by segment on Slide 6. CHC experienced a 3% growth in net sales on a constant currency basis. Meanwhile, operating and manufacturing efficiencies enhanced adjusted operating margin which were a record in 2015. This equated to an impressive adjusted operating income for Consumer Healthcare, which represented a 22% increase from calendar 2014. 
Put this in context. Adjusted operating margins increased by 330 basis points. Our store brand business is doing great and without the benefit of a normal cough/cold/flu season. 
Another key highlight for Consumer Healthcare was the strength of our infant formula category. We have continued investment in this business, implementing key strategies increasing our direct-to-consumer and doctor marketing efforts. These and other efforts have led to infant nutrition business growing 6% in 2015. I am confident we can translate the earnings from this business to other areas of our global consumer-facing platform. Congratulations to the entire CHC team for another great record year of record earnings. 
The Perrigo Rx Pharmaceutical business had another great year, delivering net sales growth of 14% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. We continue to have the best Rx pipeline in our company's history and remain excited about the future of this segment. Thanks to the entire Rx team for a great performance they delivered this year. 
Further, you can see in our specialty segment net sales increased 12% compared to last year on a constant currency basis. 
Now let me turn to Branded Consumer Healthcare segment. This segment had a number of achievements in 2015. First, our top 20 brands grew 7% on a constant currency basis during 2015 since our ownership in April. Second, our new product launch, Bronchostop, became the fastest-growing cough/cold product in the U.K. Market. Third, we acquired the nicotine family of products from GlaxoSmithKline, which performed above our expectations as we relaunched these products in key markets to the Branded Consumer Healthcare platform. We had a great European platform in place which provides a broad distribution network, highlighted by unique access to the greater than $30 billion OTC European space, representing a great opportunity in a number of markets with high barriers to entry. 
Many of our branded products rank first or second in net sales in their respective markets. They are growing organically through line extensions and by launching existing products into other European markets. 
We also plan to continue growing inorganically through strategic product acquisitions in our European platform. Perrigo is in a unique position in the top 5 OTC company by revenue in Europe contributing to our geographic diversification within the global OTC marketplace. And due to the reasons outlined, we continue to expect that BCH OTC platform have a growth rate higher than the market average. 
Now notwithstanding these comments, the fourth quarter results in our BCH segments were below our expectations. Let me review a few factors that contributed to the underperformance. 
First, as you're likely aware, we did not get the benefits of a normal cough/cold/flu season in Europe. Second, the Branded Consumer Healthcare segment continues to experience lower net sales due to channel dynamics with the generic distribution that I discussed last quarter. These dynamics accounted for approximately 25% of the Branded Consumer Healthcare's net sales miss against our expectations. Third, and additionally, in December, the Branded Consumer Healthcare team met made considerable A&P investment, advertising and promotion investments, to grow certain branded lifestyle products, including a weight-loss product, which typically peak during summer months. They did so with the expectation of converting these products into a full year maintenance product. Unfortunately, these investments did not generate the desired sales in the quarter even though they may still prove useful for a longer-term perspective. In any event, it is clear that this large A&P investment adversely affected the adjusted operating margin this quarter. 
Finally, in certain end markets, we had some challenges, including most notably Spain and Germany, which accounted for nearly 60% of the sales miss to our internal expectations. We are taking actions to restructure our business in these locations. 
As outlined in this morning's release, we realized a pretax noncash impairment charge of approximately $185 million related to intangible assets acquired in conjunction with the $4.5 [ph] Omega acquisition or approximately 4% of the acquisition price. To be clear, we incurred this impairment because the fair value of certain acquired Branded Consumer Healthcare brands was below the carrying value. However, the fair value of other acquired intangibles improved. But these increases are not recognized under accounting rules. 
Let me now spend a few minutes to detail our plan to drive performance in BCH business. Overall, the plan will focus on improvements in organizational design or people, business processes and product resource allocation. First, from a people point of view, we are changing the management structure of the BCH segment by expanding the BCH Executive Committee. Also, we are putting Perrigo's matrix leadership model in place, which we believe will deliver better transparency and accountability and ensure continuing concentration on the return on investment. Also, in order to address these factors that certain geographies in fourth quarter results, we are going to take specific actions in select countries to right size the business, streamline and restructure sales organizations in the affected geographies, including Spain and Germany. 
As part of this leadership change, President John Hendrickson of Perrigo has joined the BCH executive team as part of their team. 
Second, from a process point of view, we are strengthening the alignment of connectivity and functional accountability of the BCH business with Perrigo standards. We're implementing 4 key process improvements: number one, sales inventory control and operation planning; number two, financial forecasting planning and analysis; number three, supply-chain agitation; and number four, an incentive-based compensation that is focused on adjusted operating income in return on invested capital similar to the existing Perrigo system. 
From a product standpoint, we have conducted a portfolio review and are taking actions in BCH to exit slower growing or underperforming brands such as sports drink product, which does not meet our internal return on investment hurdle, and this will allow us to reallocate these resources to higher growth products. 
The Branded Consumer Healthcare business results in the fourth quarter were a personal disappointment to me. I recognize my actions will speak louder than my words so I am committing a significant allocation of my time over the next 6 months to be in Europe while we actively work with the BCH executive team and country general managers that drive these initiatives forward. I am confident that all of these actions, when taken together, will accelerate the BCH segment growth. I again want to stress our commitment and conviction around the long-term prospects of the BCH business and the European OTC marketplace as a whole. 
Now with that said, let me step back and talk about and discuss our overall strategy within OTC and why we continue to be excited about building our Perrigo's position as a global OTC leader. In fact, it is clear that we are a top 5 player with approximately 70% of our sales delivered on a consumer OTC platform. 
Turning to Slide 11. You can see our strong market position in OTC healthcare will be driven by megatrends within global healthcare. The efficiency affordability of OTC products versus prescription pharmaceuticals appeal to the strong, growing, aging population and shift in healthcare trends. Further, new OTC and Rx OTC switches provide us with numerous opportunity to continually launch new products. All this contributes to our 2016 top line organic growth framework of approximately 5% to 10%. 
As you can see, Slide 12, in 2015 based on IRI data, the store brand OTC dollar growth rate was over 3%. As the data beginning to lap the impact from 2013 return of prominent natural brand competitor. In 2016, we believe the growth in store brand will accelerate highlighted by the store brand launches of Nasacort, Flonase and the entire Mucinex family of products. 
Slide 13 depicts the strength in our infant formula business. We have focused much attention on accelerating the growth of great performance we are now seeing in the results of solid execution. The infant formula category has a meaningful contributor to our overall growth with Perrigo realizing an even larger share of the category. We have implemented a number of key strategies over the years, including enhanced label and a refresh of the store brand packaging. And now, we're achieving their return on these evidenced by the increasing market penetration. We have done this by leveraging Perrigo's world-class operating model, building cross-functional leadership and investing in infrastructure marketing. 
As a result of these investments, we've been able to capture over 13% of the overall market. As we look ahead over the next 3 years, we see promising opportunities within our new product pipeline. We expect to launch greater than $1.2 billion in our new products by 2018 across all segments, and the majority of these will enhance our durable consumer-facing revenue stream with about 70% of these new product sales over the next 3 years being in the consumer-facing segment. 
Turning to Slide 14. Our Rx pipeline is strong, new product opportunities ahead equated to more than $5.5 billion in prescription brand sales over the next 3 years. In addition, we have 25 ANDA pending FDA approval, 5 Paragraph IV litigation and 6 projects in clinical studies. 
I also want to take a moment to highlight the record-breaking promotion that was executed by our Consumer Healthcare team, which led to the shipment of over 300 million tablets across the country to a single customer on Slide 15. This is a testament to our store brand team and the value of our partnerships with our retail customers. 
I want to pass along my congratulations to the team. Great job. 
Now let me turn it over to Judy."

As Joe previewed, we closed 2015 delivering record financial results in an extremely busy year. Every year since 2010, the team is hosted record consolidated calendar your net sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted margins. While this quite an accomplishment, it is also quite clear to this team: we did not meet our calendar 2015 guidance for adjusted earnings per share due to a few factors in BCH, which Joe has already discussed in detail. 
Looking ahead, the team has outlined a path forward for year-over-year adjusted earnings growth of 25% to 29% in 2016, and I'll discuss the details incorporated in the updated guidance later in the presentation. But first, as you can see on Slide 19, consolidated results for Q4 were driven by the strength of our durable business portfolio, highlighted by net sales growth of an impressive 34% year-over-year on a constant currency basis with record adjusted gross margin. 
Obviously, the year-over-year metrics for Q4 include the incremental contribution from BCH, which was not a part of our business this time last year. 
Turning to CHC on slide 20. In the quarter, net sales grew by 6% on a constant currency basis, led by strength in sales of allergy products, namely and Loratadine, our nicotine replacement benefiting from the year-over-year absence of a national brand competitor and continued store brand penetration within infant formula category, which Joe touched on earlier. In addition, we recognized $60 million in new product sales led by strong consumer demand for store brand versions of easily digestible infant formulas. This was offset by a net sales decline of $19 million in existing products, primarily in the diabetes category as well as the analgesics category, which was impacted by mild cough/cold season in the U.S. and the U.K. 
Greater sales of higher-margin products versus last year, high level of production volumes and plant efficiencies and improved commodity costs compared to the prior year led to record adjusted gross margin, which expanded 140 basis points year-over-year. 
On Slide 21, net sales in BCH were led by top 20 brands, which achieved 6% growth year-over-year growth on a constant currency basis. New products including the GSK portfolio and the Yokebe brand, both of which we acquired in 2015, collectively contributed $65 million to the BCH total net sales. 
Adjusted gross margin varied from our expectations due to several factors, including slightly unfavorable brand mix and the impact of cost associated with excess and obsolete inventory charges in the quarter. Additionally, as Joe noted, fourth quarter brand advertising and promotional investment to support certain sales initiatives were larger than anticipated. These were the primary factors in BCH which drove Perrigo's bottom line miss. 
Turning to Slide 22. The Rx segment sales were highlighted by new product sales of $25 million, consisting primarily of the launches of spray and the generic version of. These volume increases were offset by a decline in net sales of the generic version of AndroGel 1% as new competition entered the market. 
Turning to Slide 23. Specialty Sciences net sales were $84 million in the quarter, up 2% on a constant currency basis. 
Before I turn to the forecast, a quick comment on the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2015, total cash on the face of the balance sheet was $480 million, and total debt was $6 billion. While the process of our deleveraging plans slowed due to acquisitions and share repurchases in the fourth quarter, we are fully committed to delevering our balance sheet and to our mid-BBB investment-grade ratings. It is our intention to fund our share repurchase program out of ongoing cash flows and to the extent the use of those cash flows for share repurchase would impede our M&A strategy or our delevering goals, we would slow or suspend the program for a period of time. 
As a reminder, our share repurchase program is for 36 months until late calendar 2018. Quarterly, given our cash flows generated and our commitment to delever, we will evaluate cash available for M&A and/or share repurchases. 
Now turning to Slide 24. You can see our updated guidance for calendar 2016 of $9.50 to $9.80 per share. This guidance reflects EPS growth of approximately 25% to 29% compared to 2015 adjusted diluted EPS of $7.59 per share. 
As background, on October 22, 2015, we provided our original guidance for 2016. In January, we provided an update to this 2016 guidance. I'd like to point out that we are not changing the expected baseline performance of $9.50 adjusted diluted earnings per share or the expected EPS growth rate. What has changed however, and we're very open about this, is that we now believe the top end of the range is $9.80 adjusted diluted EPS. 
Let me explain. Our upside growth drivers remain unchanged. Over $400 million in new product launches, continued supply-chain efficiencies across segments, the contribution from the close acquisitions, including the most recent tretinoin family of products, and finally, the transformation of our supply-chain structure into our global Center of Excellence headquarters in Ireland. What has changed in our guidance, however, are the BCH dynamics previously discussed. 
It will take time to benefit from the people, process and product changes that Joe described earlier. While these items will reduce our ability to capture the upside originally expected in 2016 in BCH, we expect to continue to drive strong earnings growth for the entire company. 
Looking at the full P&L. We expect net sales in the range of $5.9 billion to $6.2 billion. Moving down the slide. We forecast adjusted DSG&A to be approximately 17.5% of net sales and R&D at around 3%. This leads to our expected adjusted operating margin for 2016 of between 29% and 30% which would represent solid expansion. Our adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 14%, which is a much lower rate in the P&L than just 3 short years ago. 
Please note that 2016 guidance does not include contributions from the VMS business, and we are actively marketing the sale of our India API business as well. Both of these operations are now classified as assets held for sale. 
For comparison purposes, please remove net sales of approximately $40 million per quarter for VMS from the Consumer Healthcare net sales line in 2015 from your models. In addition, we anticipate that approximately 40% of our adjusted EPS contribution will be weighted to the first half of 2016 and 60% to the second half of the year. 
Let me walk you through the key building blocks of this first half, second half dynamics. First, we expect our CHC business to experience a shift in product mix, due in part to the return of a branded competitor in the smoking cessation categories and in part to the previously announced suspension of sales of the 600-milligram ER product, which I will remind you is 100% owned by Perrigo. We expect this product to return to market in the second half of 2016. 
Looking to the rest of the Mucinex family. We expect volumes to grow so these products are at lower margins as they are partnered products. Second, we are now in the midst of a lackluster cough/cold season. However, as always, we are planning for a normal season next fall, and therefore, our cough/cold categories are more heavily weighted to the second half of the calendar year. 
Third, R&D investments are expected to be higher in our legacy CHC and Rx segment in the first half of 2016 compared to the prior year due to commitments to launching new products. And fourth, new products are expected to be sizable driver for the year with greater than $400 million of new product sales expected to phase in over the course of 2016. As an example, ProAir will launch late in the year, and given these dynamics, timing and new product launches are expected to have a more sizable impact on the 60% earnings weighting to the second half of the calendar year. 
In addition to the items just discussed, I'd like to make a few comments on the first quarter. First, I'd like to highlight the year-over-year inclusion of shares outstanding and interest expense for the Omega acquisition in the first quarter, which will impact the year-over-year EPS comparison. Second, due to seasonal sell in, BCH allocates approximately 27% to 30% of their annual advertising and promotion spending to the first quarter. The BCH team has been and will continue to be focused on ROI for A&P so the investments are not always linear with sales patterns. 
While we expect adjusted operating income to grow in the first quarter in the mid-teens with impact of interest in shares noted a moment ago, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to only grow in the low single digits in the first quarter of calendar 2016 compared to 2015. 
Turning to Slide 25. You can see we are providing segment guidance as an approximate percentage of total net sales with our consumer-facing businesses still expected to comprise approximately 70% of net sales in 2016. 
Slide 26 highlights our global OTC platform new product sales. We expect new product sales to be approximately 70% weighted towards OTC in 2016, including the launches of a store brand of Flonase in the U.S. and Bronchostop throughout the rest of the EU. 
Looking at Slide 27. Given the large number of Rx products pending FDA approval, recent and expected new product launches such as the generic version of ProAir in mid-December and continued positive momentum in the Rx base business, we expect this segment to drive greater than 20% of consolidated 2016 net sales. 
In summary, there are clear action items to deliver results in 2016. We're excited about the deep pipeline of new product launches and remain focused of solid execution and operating efficiency as the basis for our continued growth. We will continue to refine and improve our operating model across all segments of the business to drive consistent returns. At the same time, we will continue to leverage our core competitive advantages and seek the right opportunities for inorganic investments that create sustained growth and meet our stringent investment criteria while still maintaining in our investment-grade rating. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Joe."

Just looking at fourth quarter, it looks like there's about a 10% rate of decline in the base which may be seems a little bit higher than average, which kind of leads me into the part of my question here. It just seems like at the margin certain segments within the generic area are seeing more pricing erosion particularly dermatologics. I'm just kind of wondering how your thinking about potential headwind there in terms of accelerated price erosion in 2016. Obviously, it's been a very strong tailwind in the past couple of years."

As you know, we move to what I referred to as extended topicals. So those are things beyond certainly dermatology but respiratory, ophthalmic. And with those product categories for example, at the end of the year, we will launch our ProAir product in terms of the metered-dose inhaler for respiratory. Those are the things that are giving us the great strength in our Rx categories. And as we believe, that will give us a very high gross margin and operating margin certainly as we think about the 2016 and beyond. So we like what we see in terms of our ability to launch these new products and what they mean for gross margin and operating margins."

Now there's clearly -- you get some revenue numbers, but you don't get to the full bottom line of the consolidated income as a company until we closed out our full auditing process and look at everything. So it was really very late in the January time frame as we looked at full consolidated part of it.

Yes, it did. I mean, that it clearly use you through that time period, the latter half of 2015, we had strong business performance in our Rx team. We had strong business performance in our OTC or store brand business. As we are trying to put resources toward Branded Consumer Healthcare, there was some challenges, and I decided it's a personal disappointment, but it's clearly something we know we can fix, and we're going to take every effort that we can go forward to put the initiative that I outlined before by improving the sales and operation planning, improving the financial planning analysis, making the global supply chain, things that we know how to do because they fit into what Perrigo does really well. So we'll take that on and get that focus and get that right.

And clearly, that was why when I made my comments, it was partially on the people side, partially on the process side and clearly something on the products side. For example, there are some products that just do not meet our return on invested capital hurdles, and we're going to make some decisions about those particular products. Could we have tried to do this earlier? I'd say that the original business performance was very strong. We felt that it was moving in the right direction.

Some of those things just take a little bit longer in terms of time frame. Having said that, though, we continue to believe that from the product point of view, they're launching the nicotine, Branded Consumer Healthcare team is launching a number of imported products.

I made a comment about the first half, second half dynamics for the company. A portion of that is driven by investments in BCH ramping up and giving profitability returning to more of the high-teens level over the course of the year. So if you're looking at modeling the first half of the year, you would see softer operating income, adjusted operating income in the first half and then growing and then working to recover back to, as I said, adjusted operating margins at a higher level in the second half of the year. And that's the dynamic of combination timing on advertising, promotion spend and the restructuring activity that Joe mentioned earlier, taking hold and getting to see some additional profitability in the back half of the year."

I mean, on the question of is there some challenges we have with our Branded Consumer Healthcare business, the answer is yes, and that's something that I mentioned, Judy mentioned, and we're going to think that on, and we feel absolutely confident we will overcome those challenges, and clearly, we still believe this is a great business opportunity for us. As I said, it took us competing in 6 countries around the world to 39. We think that the expansion of geographic footprint is very, very important to us for the future. So on that question, yes, there's some challenges that we're going to walk our way through. But it's nothing we haven't experienced before, and the good news is that many of the things that we need to get improved are things that we think Perrigo does very well in terms of our world-class approach to the supply chain, a world-class approach to what we plan to do with just our sales optimization. Remember, we manage over somewhere around 20,000 SKUs from a sales and operation planning point of view and forecasting. So we believe that those things are things that we do very well. We'll put that into the Omega process, and we think we'll have once again a world-class branded OTC business based on some of the improvements. Make those mistake about it. Some of the marketing activities that Omega has done been absolutely delivering great returns. I believe thinking over the GSK brand, we've shown accelerated growth in the nicotine franchise from where they were before. So we're a -- we think we're in good shape with that portion of the business in terms of the plan. But we do have some challenges. I don't want to mix words there. On the rest of the business though, we're excited about it. If you think about what we talked about as the business in 2015, revenue up 28% operating income up 29%. Earnings per share up 21%. EBITDA, now at somewhere around $1.5 billion. I mean, there's a lot of great things that happened with this business in terms of even just within OTC. A significant -- our store brand OTC business, a significant margin expansion. So we're in good shape with our total business as we think about it. But I do take the comment that we've got some things to deal with on Branded Consumer Healthcare. On the question of the share repurchase or capital allocation, yes, that's something that Judy mentioned that we'll continue to look at that. As you know, we did a share repurchase in the fourth quarter. As we think about share repurchase in the future, we'll continue to look at that as Judy said, there is available free cash flow for us to do that. So that's something that we are contemplating. I will make a comment, though, just to reflect or magnify what Judy said is that we're going to look at that relative to not only the share repurchase but also the other M&A opportunities that we have as a company."

So let me first off, comment on the BCH question, new products. You are spot on that for the first time ever, there was a mixture in that comment. $65 million of new products, which included Yokebe and GSK products, it's an anomaly here because we have an acquisition in a period where we don't have a comparative old -- comparable to last year. So the acquired products were approximately half of that $65 million. And the new products that the BCH team that deemed as new in their calendar year in a normal kind of metrics that you would use here at the company is launching something within the first 12 months is the other half. So going forward on a like-for-like basis, we will pull out acquired products from GSK and Yokebe until they hit the 12-month acquisition anniversary, and the $400 million in total company new products does not include those 2. But you're right, that is a very good call out, Linda, because it's a -- we've really had an acquired a company with a new acquisition on top of that within that window. So going forward, $400 million no acquired products within that total. Rolling back to the October 22 announcement and the savings that we expected as a company to achieve overall, those are included in our 2016 plans still. You remember that a portion of that announcement related to structural cost savings within the company and for all intents and purposes, those activities are complete. The migration of our global supply chain center of excellence and headquarters in Ireland is actively underway as we speak. We mentioned Art will be moving. Many people are building up their competencies and getting the business up and running in Ireland. Those savings are going to be reflected in our 2016 numbers. And also made the comment that the sales process for our API location, API factory in India as well as our VMS business are actively underway and expect it to be close in the not-too-distant future. So you can consider the essentially the XLS implementation of the streamlining of our operating structure is built-in. We're not been necessarily calling those out on a line-by-line basis. But suffice it to say that we'll keep you posted on the sales process for VMS. We'll keep you posted on our ongoing build out within Ireland is more of our business is operated in our headquarters directly with Europe.

Is there -- how confident do you feel about the product introductions within the group as well as any competition in that price that could erode your product opportunities as the base business?"

It is correct. We didn't expect the generic Rx business to slow down. The reason we expect it to slowdown because at the end of 2014, we launched a very significant new product.

The reason we expect it to slowdown because at the end of 2014, we launched a very significant new product. It was the 1% AndroGel 1% or Testosterone 1% gel. That was a very important launch for us and one which did incredibly well. We were the only company out there with the generic equivalent to the 1%. So therefore, this is all things that we expected. We always knew the comp for the year-over-year was going to be significant for the fourth quarter, and so all of that has transpired exactly as what we had stated. I'll remind you that as Judy was talking about the opportunities in our Rx business, one of the things that we mentioned was the opportunity to launch a generic equivalent of ProAir. That generic equivalent is we think a very exciting opportunity. To our knowledge, no one has even challenged patent. So we challenged the patent, we prevailed and we're at a point where we think it's a very exciting launch for us that will represent a significant upside to us as in the later part of 2016. So we're very comfortable with that. As Judy had talked about in terms of we think about the margin opportunities both on the growth and the operating line, we do see calendar year '16 improving on both of the operating and the gross margins for that business as we continue to show very significant growth even without the equivalent of the Entocort and the generics."

Our plan for Rx is -- reflects excluding the acquired product, excluding the tretinoin family and the Entocort transaction is still at the high end of our 8% to 12% growth guidance that we provided in the past. So any slowing in Q4 relative to that type of our range reflects the fact to Joe's point, Q4 2014 was the highest Q4 on record. So relatively, that quarter was outside of our stated 8% to 12% range, but we are at the high end of that range within our 2016 guidance plan for next year."

Number one, I've had the pleasure of working with the Perrigo team for almost 10 years now. And I would say that through those 10 years, we've done 29, 30 different transactions. And do I accept that there's some challenges we have to work with on, on the Omega business? Yes, absolutely. But that's nothing different than every other acquisition we've been a part of. Some go faster, some volatile slower. There is -- the European market is one right now that is a little bit slower in terms of -- we don't take -- we don't blame them on it, but certainly, we knew that the FX was for the year was coming down I mean, there are a lot of things that were moving on it. But it makes no -- it makes me still believe that this is a phenomenal future opportunity for us from the point of view on giving us this geographic expansion opportunity, allowing us to move from 6 countries where we compete before Omega to 39 countries. So we are still very excited about what the Omega brings for us. On the question though that is part of your hypothesis, I want to make sure I'm very clear. We still believe that the Perrigo organic growth rate without any acquisition still in that 5% to 10% range. And I know that you know many different companies I think that you'll find that a 5% to 10% growth rate in a business that is 70% or 70% of our sales are in the consumer side is a very good consumer-facing business because you don't find many growing at that rate. So we feel very optimistic about our organic growth rate and the consumer-facing part of our business. Do I still believe, though, there is a chance to do with a growth rate that is about half of the business in organic growth rates and then half of the growth inorganic? I still believe that makes a lot of sense for us because there's so many more things we can put up the back of our truck that Perrigo going to these large retailers and/or in Europe that we're going to continue to look at them. And I've said it before to you that I think for us, we can continue to look to expand Animal Health, we can continue to expand ophthalmics, pet care, diabetes, adult nutrition. We do think there's some additional geographic expansion especially in Europe where we think we can bolt on some additional products to our current Omega infrastructure. So I don't think it changes my view at all. We think we still got tremendous opportunity with Omega and importantly, a good opportunities with M&A. Thank you."

We were not where we expected to be with earnings before tax in Europe, where our jurisdiction rates are relatively higher and therefore, you see the overall rate lower in Q4. Looking forward though, the approximately 14% of effective tax rate that we're targeting for the full year is a component of the mix of our businesses as well as the programs put in place that the announced in October 22, 2015, with respect to capturing better value and optimizing our tax line through the global supply chain initiative that have enormous operational activity behind them at the moment.

So we're going to look at those opportunities. Do I take the point that you're suggesting, though, that we need to continue to improve the Branded Consumer Healthcare business and put the focus on that? The answer is absolutely yes. There's no mistake about that some of the things we're working on. But I want to make sure the message comes across we think the branded consumer business is a great business. They've done some great things with new product launches, but there's same things that we think we can help them improve as we bring some of the Perrigo process to their business? Yes, we do think we're going to do that, and we will spend the time to do that. But we've got an organization that certainly a lot of opportunities to think about additional M&A. And we'll think about it. I don't want to suggest to anybody though that M&A is going to be -- we're going to do it just no matter what the cost. We're going to be smart about it and disciplined about it just like we have been in the past. Therefore, we have an alternative. We have a share repurchase opportunity work always going to trade the return on investment for doing A or doing B. So I think the essence of your question is are we going to look at it strategically and trade it off versus the share repurchase? Yes. We will do that. And I think Judy tried to capture that in her comments. But there may be some opportunities that we think are from a timing point of view or a strategy point of view may be very important to us, and we're going to look at those for the next 12 months.

You're right, we stepped back by giving very granular line-by-line segment margin analytics in our guidance. But suffice it to say in the Consumer Healthcare team, you have to give props to Jeff Needham and his entire organization. They have done a job in years where there have not been the enormous switch products coming in their portfolio by blocking and tackling, bringing dozens of new products to the market, positioning those products well, fighting the fight in the world of more challenging pricing dynamics out in today's market, taking advantage of good commodity buying and taking advantage, frankly, of the comments Joe has talked about the operating model of Perrigo and our lean manufacturing efficiencies that we continue to get over the years. That team has capitalized on that. So you've seen the margin expansion. If I think about 2015, we've gotten 37% gross margin, almost 38%. Yes, it was quote down to only 35% in the fourth quarter. But that -- we finished the year at just under 36% adjusted gross margin, which in the year without one giant blockbuster launched to point to I think is a phenomenal achievement and margin out next year and talk about their planning, they are still running in a low to mid-30s in their adjusted gross margin. It varies quarter by quarter with timing of product. And I'm also looking at working to maintain the types of adjusted operating margins you saw over the course of '15 as well. Remember in my comments around how to think about the year, the balance of the year is always a factor of timing on new products, investments that are coming through down below the line within selling in terms of promotional, et cetera. That's why I said second half of the year is slightly heavier because of the fact that you've got more launches in the back half. But you're still looking at the team working at maintaining those, I'll call it, 32% to 35% zone, that low 30% adjusted gross margin and very high teens or around 20% operating margin.

As we think about the future, there's no doubt that the new product that we plan to launch whether it be the ProAir products and also support the tretinoin product probably will help us from a gross margin point of view as we think about our 2016 Rx gross margin. So we continue to see some upside from where we are currently on the Rx gross margin as a result of new products and also the acquisition products."

We clearly know there is some things that need to get than other Branded Consumer Healthcare we're going to put focus on that, but importantly, we still think that's a great business for the long-term as we think about the future of our business continuing to grow our business both organically and through M&A.

Joining me today is Judy Brown, Perrigo's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. 
Now here's the agenda for today's call. First, I will walk through some of the key financial highlights for calendar 2015. Then I'll highlight the advantages of our focus strategy within our consumer-facing OTC global platform, which, when coupled with the earnings power of our Prescription Pharmaceutical business, creates a truly unique, diversified and sustainable business. After that, Judy will go through the details of the fourth quarter results and guidance for calendar 2016. Then we'll close and an opportunity for Q&A. 
Before starting into the call, I'd like to take a moment to highlight some changes in our Investor Relations group. As part of previously announced consolidation of certain functions in Ireland, Art Shannon will relocate to Ireland and will be assuming the role of Vice President of Global Corporate Affairs and European Investor Relationship. Art will continue to oversee both internal and external global communications and will continue to be the lead point of contact for media and government relations. In addition, he will now be responsible for establishing a global government relations based in Dublin and expanding Perrigo's shareholder-focused Investor Relation program in Europe. I hope you can join me and congratulate both of them.
On Slide 5, you can see this was a record year for Perrigo across all key metrics, from record net sales to record adjusted operating income. This highlights our continued growth from the combination of our durable Consumer Healthcare model through our diversified Rx portfolio and inorganic acquisition strategy. 
Overall, 2015 was another great year. Perrigo achieved record net sales for the year of $5.4 billion, a 28% increase with record adjusted operating margins. We expanded adjusted gross margin by 400 basis points to 48%, driven by strong business mix, including the addition of our new Branded Consumer Healthcare or Omega business and, of course, supply chain efficiencies. Adjusted operating income increased 29% year-over-year to $1.5 billion. 
Finally, as you see here, our net operating cash flow for the full year increased to $1.05 billion, also another record for Perrigo. 
2015 included a number of key growth drivers. We introduced over 160 new products in key categories, including the store brand version of Mucinex D and the generic prescription version of Clobex Spray. We also expanded our business by completing 7 acquisitions, including 5 focused on building geographic scale and capabilities within our Consumer Healthcare platform. 
We created our pan-European platform with the acquisition of Omega. We added soft gel capabilities from the acquisition from Patheon Mexico. We acquired a new portfolio of OTC -- leading OTC brands from GSK. We added the Yokebe product line to our BCH portfolio, and we added our first U.S. Branded Consumer Healthcare product, ScarAway. 
I'd like to take a moment to thank the dedicated Perrigo employees who, amidst some uncertainty last year, weathered a demanding year. Your unwavering commitment to delivering quality, affordable health care products to customers and patients across the globe was truly outstanding. And you did it all while delivering record financial performance for the year. Thank you for all your dedication and great work.
You can see on Slide 6 the operational achievements by segment on Slide 6. CHC experienced a 3% growth in net sales on a constant currency basis. Meanwhile, operating and manufacturing efficiencies enhanced adjusted operating margin, which were a record in 2015. This equated to an impressive adjusted operating income for Consumer Healthcare, which represented a 22% increase from calendar 2014. 
Put this in context, adjusted operating margins increased by 330 basis points. Our store brand business is doing great and without the benefit of a normal cough/cold/flu season. 
Another key highlight for Consumer Healthcare was the strength of our infant formula category. We have continued investment in this business, implementing key strategies, including increasing our direct-to-consumer and doctor marketing efforts. These and other efforts have led to infant nutrition business growing 6% in 2015. I am confident we can translate the earnings from this business to other areas of our global consumer-facing platform. Congratulations to the entire CHC team for another great year of record earnings. 
The Perrigo Rx Pharmaceutical business had another great year, delivering net sales growth of 14% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. We continue to have the best Rx pipeline in our company's history and remain excited about the future of this segment. Thanks to the entire Rx team for a great performance they delivered this year. 
Further, you can see in our specialty segment, net sales increased 12% compared to last year on a constant currency basis. 
Now let me turn to Branded Consumer Healthcare segment. This segment had a number of achievements in 2015. First, our top 20 brands grew 7% on a constant currency basis during 2015 since our ownership in April. Second, our new product launched, Bronchostop, became the fastest-growing cough/cold product in the U.K. market. Third, we acquired the NiQuitin family of products from GlaxoSmithKline, which performed above our expectations as we relaunched these products in key markets in the Branded Consumer Healthcare platform. 
We have a great European platform in place which provides a broad distribution network, highlighted by unique access to the greater than $30 billion OTC European space, representing a great opportunity in a number of markets with high barriers to entry. 
Many of our branded products rank first or second in net sales in their respective markets. They are growing organically through line extensions and by launching existing products into other European markets. 
We also plan to continue growing inorganically through strategic product acquisitions in our European platform. Perrigo is in a unique position of a top 5 OTC company by revenue in Europe, contributing to our geographic diversification within the global OTC marketplace. And due to the reasons outlined, we continue to expect that the BCH OTC platform has a growth rate higher than the market averages. 
Now notwithstanding these comments, the fourth quarter results in our BCH segment were below our expectations. Let me review a few factors that contributed to the underperformance. 
First, as you're likely aware, we did not get the benefits of a normal cough/cold/flu season in Europe. 
Second, the Branded Consumer Healthcare segment continues to experience lower net sales due to channel dynamics with the generic distribution that I discussed last quarter. These dynamics accounted for approximately 25% of the Branded Consumer Healthcare's net sales miss against our expectations. 
Third and additionally, in December, the Branded Consumer Healthcare team made considerable A&P investment, advertising and promotion investments, to grow certain branded lifestyle products, including a weight-loss product, which typically peak during summer months. They did so with the expectation of converting these products into a full year maintenance product. Unfortunately, these investments did not generate the desired sales in the quarter even though they may still prove useful for a longer-term perspective. In any event, it is clear that this large A&P investment adversely affected the adjusted operating margin this quarter. 
Finally, in certain end markets, we had some challenges, including most notably Spain and Germany, which accounted for nearly 60% of the sales miss to our internal expectations. We are taking actions to restructure our business in these locations. 
As outlined in this morning's release, we realized a pretax noncash impairment charge of approximately $185 million related to intangible assets acquired in conjunction with the $4.5 million [ph] Omega acquisition or approximately 4% of the acquisition price. To be clear, we incurred this impairment because the fair value of certain acquired Branded Consumer Healthcare brands was below the carrying value. However, the fair value of other acquired intangibles improved, but these increases are not recognized under accounting rules. 
Let me now spend a few minutes to detail our plan to drive performance in the BCH business. Overall, the plan will focus on improvements in organizational design or people, business processes and product resource allocation. First, from a people point of view, we are changing the management structure of the BCH segment by expanding the BCH Executive Committee. Also, we are putting Perrigo's matrix leadership model in place, which we believe will deliver better transparency and accountability and ensure continuing concentration on return on investment. Also, in order to address these factors at certain geographies in fourth quarter results, we are going to take specific actions in select countries to rightsize the business, streamline and restructure sales organizations in the affected geographies, including Spain and Germany. 
As part of this leadership change, President John Hendrickson of Perrigo has joined the BCH executive team as part of their team. 
Second, from a process point of view, we are strengthening the alignment of connectivity and functional accountability of the BCH business with Perrigo standards. We're implementing 4 key process improvements: number one, sales forecast and inventory control and operations planning; number two, financial forecasting, planning and analysis; number three, supply chain integration; and number four, an incentive-based compensation that is focused on adjusted operating income and return on invested capital similar to the existing Perrigo system. 
From a product standpoint, we have conducted a portfolio review and are taking actions in BCH to exit slower-growing or underperforming brands such as Etec [ph] sports drink product, which does not meet our internal return on investment hurdle, and this will allow us to reallocate these resources to higher-growth products. 
The Branded Consumer Healthcare business results in the fourth quarter were a personal disappointment to me. I recognize my actions will speak louder than my words, so I am committing a significant allocation of my time over the next 6 months to be in Europe while we actively work with the BCH executive team and country general managers to drive these initiatives forward. I am confident these -- that all these actions, when taken together, will accelerate the BCH segment growth. I again want to stress our commitment and conviction around the long-term prospects of the BCH business and the European OTC marketplace as a whole. 
Now with that said, let me step back and talk about and discuss our overall strategy within OTC and why we continue to be excited about our -- building our Perrigo's position as a global OTC leader. In fact, it is clear we are a top 5 player with approximately 70% of our sales delivered on the consumer OTC platform. 
Turning to Slide 11. You can see our strong market position in OTC health care will be driven by megatrends within global health care. The efficiency and affordability of OTC products versus prescription pharmaceuticals appeal to the strong, growing, aging population and shift in health care trends. Further, new OTC innovation and Rx OTC switches provide us with numerous opportunities to continually launch new products. All this contributes to our 2016 top line organic growth framework of approximately 5% to 10%. 
As you can see, Slide 12, in 2015 based on IRI MULO data, the store brand OTC dollar growth rate was over 3% as the data is beginning to lap the impact from 2013 return of a prominent national brand competitor. In 2016, we believe the growth in store brands will accelerate, highlighted by the store brand launches of Nasacort, Flonase and the entire Mucinex family of products. 
Slide 13 depicts the strength in our infant formula business. We have focused much attention on accelerating the growth in this category and the great performance we are now seeing as a result of solid execution. The infant formula category was a meaningful contributor to our overall growth, with Perrigo realizing an even larger share of the category. We have implemented a number of key strategies over the years, including enhanced label and a refresh of the store brand packaging. And now we're achieving the return on these investments evidenced by the increasing market penetration. We have done this by leveraging Perrigo's world-class operating model, building cross-functional leadership and investing in infrastructure and marketing. As a result of these investments, we have been able to capture over 13% of the overall market. 
As we look ahead over the next 3 years, we see promising opportunities within our new product pipeline. We expect to launch greater than $1.2 billion in our new products by 2018 across all segments, and the majority of these will enhance our durable consumer-facing revenue stream, with about 70% of these new product sales over the next 3 years being in the consumer-facing segment. 
Turning to Slide 14. Our Rx pipeline is strong, new product opportunities ahead, equating to greater than $5.5 billion in prescription brand sales over the next 3 years. In addition, we have 25 ANDA pending FDA approval, 5 Paragraph IV litigation and 6 projects in clinical studies. 
I also want to take a moment to highlight the record-breaking promotion that was executed by our Consumer Healthcare team, which led to a shipment of over 300 million tablets across the country to a single customer on Slide 15. This is a testament to our store brand team and the value of our partnerships with our retail customers. I want to pass along my congratulations to the team. Great job. 
Now let me turn it over to Judy."

Good morning, everyone. As Joe previewed, we closed 2015 delivering record financial results in an extremely busy year. Every year since 2010, the team has posted record consolidated calendar year net sales, adjusted operating income and ad",1732,"Thanks, Joe. Good morning, everyone. As Joe previewed, we closed 2015 delivering record financial results in an extremely busy year. 
Every year since 2010, the team has posted record consolidated calendar year net sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted margins. While this is quite an accomplishment, it is also quite clear to this team: we did not meet our calendar 2015 guidance for adjusted earnings per share due to a few factors in BCH, which Joe has already discussed in detail. 
Looking ahead, the team has outlined a path forward for year-over-year adjusted earnings growth of 25% to 29% in 2016, and I'll discuss the details incorporated in the updated guidance later in the presentation. 
But first, as you can see on Slide 19, consolidated results for Q4 were driven by the strength of our durable business portfolio, highlighted by net sales growth of an impressive 34% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, with record adjusted gross margin. Obviously, the year-over-year metrics for Q4 include the incremental contribution from BCH, which was not a part of our business this time last year. 
Turning to CHC on Slide 20. In the quarter, net sales grew by 6% on a constant currency basis, led by strength in sales of allergy products, namely Cetirizine-D and Loratadine, our nicotine replacement franchise benefiting from the year-over-year absence of a national brand competitor and continued store brand penetration and contract sales within the infant formula category, which Joe touched on earlier. 
In addition, we recognized $60 million in new product sales led by strong consumer demand for store brand versions of easily digestible infant formulas. This was offset by a net sales decline of $19 million in existing products, primarily in the diabetes category as well as the analgesics category, which was impacted by the extremely mild cough/cold season in the U.S. and the U.K. 
Greater sales of higher-margin products versus last year, high level of production volumes and plant efficiencies and improved commodity costs compared to the prior year led to record adjusted gross margin, which expanded 140 basis points year-over-year. 
On Slide 21, net sales in BCH were led by top 20 brands, which achieved 6% growth year-over-year on a constant currency basis. New products, including the GSK portfolio and the Yokebe brand, both of which we acquired in 2015, collectively contributed $65 million to the BCH total net sales. 
Adjusted gross margin varied from our expectations due to several factors, including slightly unfavorable brand mix and the impact of costs associated with excess and obsolete inventory charges in the quarter. Additionally, as Joe noted, fourth quarter brand advertising and promotion investments to support certain sales initiatives were larger than anticipated. These were the primary factors in BCH, which drove Perrigo's bottom line miss. 
Turning to Slide 22. The Rx segment net sales were highlighted by new product sales of $25 million, consisting primarily of the launches of clobetasol spray and the generic version of Evoclin. These volume increases were offset by a decline in net sales of the generic version of AndroGel 1% as new competition entered the market. 
Turning to Slide 23. Specialty Sciences net sales were $84 million in the quarter, up 2% on a constant currency basis. 
Before I turn to the forecast, a quick comment on the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2015, total cash on the face of the balance sheet was $480 million, and total debt was $6 billion. While the process of our deleveraging plans slowed due to acquisitions and share repurchases in the fourth quarter, we are fully committed to delevering our balance sheet and to our mid-BBB investment-grade ratings. It is our intention to fund our share repurchase program out of ongoing cash flows, and to the extent the use of those cash flows for share repurchase would impede our M&A strategy or our delevering goals, we would slow or suspend the program for a period of time. 
As a reminder, our share repurchase program is for 36 months until late calendar 2018. Quarterly, given our cash flows generated and our commitment to delever, we will evaluate cash available for M&A and/or share repurchases. 
Now turning to Slide 24. You can see our updated guidance for calendar 2016 of $9.50 to $9.80 per share. This guidance reflects EPS growth of approximately 25% to 29% compared to 2015 adjusted diluted EPS of $7.59 per share. 
As background, on October 22, 2015, we provided our original guidance for 2016. In January, we provided an update to this 2016 guidance. I'd like to point out that we are not changing the expected baseline performance of $9.50 adjusted diluted earnings per share or the expected EPS growth rate. What has changed, however, and we're very open about this, is that we now believe the top end of the range is $9.80 adjusted diluted EPS. 
Let me explain. Our upside growth drivers remain unchanged: over $400 million in new product launches; continued supply chain efficiencies across segments; the contribution from the closed acquisitions, including the most recent tretinoin family of products; and finally, the transformation of our supply chain structure into our global center of excellence headquarters in Ireland. What has changed in our guidance, however, are the BCH dynamics previously discussed. 
It will take time to benefit from the people, process and product changes that Joe described earlier. While these items will reduce our ability to capture the upside originally expected in 2016 in BCH, we expect to continue to drive strong earnings growth for the entire company. 
Looking at the full P&L. We expect net sales in the range of $5.9 billion to $6.2 billion. 
Moving down the slide. We forecast adjusted DSG&A to be approximately 17.5% of net sales and R&D at around 3%. This leads to our expected adjusted operating margin for 2016 of between 29% and 30%, which would represent solid expansion. Our adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 14%, which is a much lower rate in the P&L than just 3 short years ago. 
Please note that 2016 guidance does not include contributions from the VMS business, and we are actively marketing the sale of our India API business as well. Both of these operations are now classified as assets held for sale. 
For comparison purposes, please remove net sales of approximately $40 million per quarter for VMS from the Consumer Healthcare net sales line in 2015 from your models. In addition, we anticipate that approximately 40% of our adjusted EPS contribution will be weighted to the first half of 2016 and 60% to the second half of the year. 
Let me walk you through the key building blocks of this first half/second half dynamics. First, we expect our CHC business to experience a shift in product mix due in part to the return of a branded competitor in the smoking cessation category and in part to the previously announced suspension of sales of the guaifenesin 600-milligram ER product, which I will remind you is 100% owned by Perrigo. We expect this product to return to market in the second half of 2016. 
Looking to the rest of the Mucinex family. We expect volumes to grow so these products are at lower margins as they are partnered products. 
Second, we are now in the midst of a lackluster cough/cold season. However, as always, we are planning for a normal season next fall, and therefore, our cough/cold categories are more heavily weighted to the second half of the calendar year. 
Third, R&D investments are expected to be higher in our legacy CHC and Rx segment in the first half of 2016 compared to the prior year due to commitments to launching new products. 
And fourth, new products are expected to be a sizable driver for the year, with greater than $400 million of new product sales expected to phase in over the course of 2016. As an example, ProAir will launch late in the year, and given these dynamics, timing and new product launches are expected to have a more sizable impact on the 60% earnings weighting to the second half of the calendar year. 
In addition to the items just discussed, I'd like to make a few comments on the first quarter. First, I'd like to highlight the year-over-year inclusion of shares outstanding and interest expense for the Omega acquisition in the first quarter, which will impact the year-over-year EPS comparison. Second, due to seasonal sell-in, BCH allocates approximately 27% to 30% of their annual advertising and promotion spending to the first quarter. The BCH team has been and will continue to be focused on ROI for A&P so the investments are not always linear with sales patterns. 
While we expect adjusted operating income to grow in the first quarter in the mid-teens with the impact of interest in shares noted a moment ago, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to only grow in the low single digits in the first quarter of calendar 2016 compared to 2015. 
Turning to Slide 25. You can see we are providing segment guidance as an approximate percentage of total net sales, with our consumer-facing businesses still expected to comprise approximately 70% of net sales in 2016. 
Slide 26 highlights our global OTC platform new product sales. We expect new product sales to be approximately 70% weighted towards OTC in 2016, including the launches of the store brand version of Flonase in the U.S. and Bronchostop throughout the rest of the EU. 
Looking at Slide 27. Given the large number of Rx products pending FDA approval, recent and expected new product launches such as the generic version of ProAir in mid-December and continued positive momentum in the Rx base business, we expect this segment to drive greater than 20% of consolidated 2016 net sales. 
In summary, there are clear action items to deliver results in 2016. We're excited about the deep pipeline of new product launches and remain focused on solid execution and operating efficiency as the basis for continued growth. We will continue to refine and improve our operating model across all segments of the business to drive consistent returns. At the same time, we will continue to leverage our core competitive advantages and seek the right opportunities for inorganic investments that create sustained growth and meet our stringent investment criteria while still maintaining our investment-grade rating. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Joe."

I'm just kind of wondering how you're thinking about potential headwinds there in terms of accelerated pricing erosion in 2016. And obviously, it's been a very strong tailwind the past couple of years."

Are there some incremental product competition that we're going to face? The answer is yes. However, what we've tried to do at the Perrigo Group is not just stay focused only on dermatology. As you know, we've moved into what I refer to as extended topicals. So those are things beyond just certainly dermatology but respiratory, nasal, ophthalmic. And with those product categories -- for example, at the end of the year, we'll launch our ProAir product in terms of a metered-dose inhaler for respiratory. Those are the things that are giving us great strength in our Rx category. And as we believe, that will give us a very high gross margin and operating margin certainly as we think about the 2016 and beyond. So we like what we see in terms of our ability to launch these new products and what they mean for gross margin and operating margins."

Yes, it did. I mean, clearly, you see, though, through that time period, the latter half of 2015, we had strong business performance in our Rx team. We had strong business performance in our OTC or store brand business. As we are trying to put resources toward Branded Consumer Healthcare, there were some challenges, and as I said, it's a personal disappointment. And -- but it's clearly something we know we can fix, and we're going to take the -- every effort that we can to go forward and put the initiatives that I outlined before by improving the sales and operation planning, improving the financial planning analysis, making the globalized supply chain, things that we know how to do because they fit right into what Perrigo does really well. So we'll take that on and get that focused and get that righted. But make no mistake, we still believe this is a great opportunity for us, an opportunity to move our business from competing in 6 countries around the world to 39 countries.

All those things are process things that we can do better. And clearly, that was why when I made my comments, it was partially on the people side, partially on the process side and clearly something on the product side. For example, there are some products that just do not meet our return on invested capital hurdles, and we're going to make some decisions about those particular products. Could we have tried to do this earlier? I'd say that the original business performance was very strong. We felt it was moving in the right direction.

I would say that the improvement on process is really, by definition, a longer time frame as you put in a new sales and operation planning process, as you put in a new financial planning and analysis process as you integrate the supply chain. Some of those things just take a little bit longer in terms of time frame. Having said that, though, we continue to believe that from the product point of view, they're launching -- the Omega team or Branded Consumer Healthcare team is launching a number of imported products.

Now think about adjusted operating margin and the expansion of growth on the bottom line, that does evolve. I made the comments about the first half, second half dynamics of the company. A portion of that is driven by investments in BCH ramping up and getting profitability, returning to more of the high-teens level over the course of the year. So if you're looking at modeling in the first half of the year, you would see softer operating income, adjusted operating income in the first half and then growing and working to recover back to, as I said, adjusted operating margins at a higher level in the second half of the year.

The answer is yes, and that's something that I mentioned, Judy mentioned. And we're going to take that on, and we feel absolutely confident we will overcome those challenges. And clearly, we still believe this is a great business opportunity for us. As I said, it took us competing in 6 countries around the world to 39. We think that expansion of geographic footprint is very, very important to us for the future. So on that question, yes, there's some challenges that we're going to walk our way through. But it's nothing that we haven't experienced before. And the good news is that many of the things that we need to get improved are things that we think Perrigo does very well in terms of our world-class approach to the supply chain, a world-class approach to what we plan to do with just our sales forecasting optimization. Remember, we manage over somewhere around 20,000 SKUs from a sales and operation planning point of view from forecasting. So we believe that those things are things that we do very well. We'll put that into the Omega process, and we think we'll have once again a world class-branded OTC business based on some of the improvements. Make no mistake about it. Some of the marketing activities that Omega has done have been absolutely delivering great returns. I believe taking over the GSK brand, we've shown accelerated growth in the nicotine franchise from where they were before. So we think we're in good shape with that portion of the business in terms of the plan. But we do have some challenges. I don't want to mix words there. On the rest of the business, though, we're excited about it. If you think about what we talked about as a business in 2015, revenue up 28%, operating income up 29%, earnings per share up 21%, EBITDA now at somewhere around $1.5 billion, I mean, there's a lot of great things that had happened with this business in terms of even just within OTC, a significant -- our store brand OTC business, a significant margin expansion. So we're in good shape with our total business as we think about it, but I do take the comment that we've got some things to deal with on Branded Consumer Healthcare. On the question of the share repurchase or capital allocation, yes, that's something that Judy mentioned. We'll continue to look at that. As you know, we did a share repurchase in the fourth quarter. As we think about share repurchase in the future, we'll continue to look at that, as Judy said, as there's available free cash flow for us to do that. So that's something that we are contemplating. I will make a comment, though, just to reflect or magnify what Judy said, is that we're going to look at that relative to not only the share repurchase, but also the other M&A opportunities that we have as a company."

So let me, first off, comment on the BCH question, new products. You are spot on that for the first time ever, there was a mixture in that comment, $65 million of new products, which included Yokebe and GSK, the acquired products. It's an anomaly here because we have an acquisition in a period where we don't have a comparable to last year. So the acquired products were approximately half of that $65 million. And the new products that the BCH team deemed as new in their calendar year in the normal kind of metrics that we would use here in the company is launching something within the first 12 months is the other half. So going forward on a like-for-like basis, we will pull out acquired products from GSK and Yokebe until they hit the 12-month acquisition anniversary, and the $400 million in total company new products does not include those 2. But you're right, that is a very good call-out, Linda, because it's a -- we've really had an acquired company with a new acquisition on top of that within that window. So going forward, $400 million no acquired products within that total. Rolling back to the October 22 announcement and the savings that we expected as a company to achieve overall, those are included in our 2016 plans still. You'll remember that a portion of that announcement related to structural cost savings within the company. And for all intents and purposes, those activities are complete. The migration of our global supply chain center of excellence to our corporate headquarters in Ireland is actively underway as we speak. We mentioned Art will be moving. Many people are building up their competencies and getting the business up and running in Ireland. So those savings are going to be reflected in our 2016 numbers. And we also made the comment that the sales process for our API location, API factory in India as well as our VMS business are actively underway and expect it to be close in the not-too-distant future. So you can consider the -- essentially the XLS implementation of streamlining of our operating structure is built-in. We're not been necessarily calling those out on a line-by-line basis, but suffice it to say we'll keep you posted on the sales process for VMS. We'll keep you posted on our ongoing buildout within Ireland as more and more of our business is operated in our corporate headquarters directly with Europe.

The reason we expect it to slowdown is because at the end of 2014, we launched a very significant new product. It was the 1% AndroGel, 1% or Testosterone 1% gel. That was a very important launch for us, and one which did incredibly well. We were the only company out there with a generic equivalent to the 1%. So therefore, this is all things that we expected. We always knew the comp for the year-over-year was going to be significant for the fourth quarter. And so all of that has transpired exactly as what we stated. I'll remind you that as Judy was talking about the opportunities in our Rx business, one of the things we've mentioned was the opportunity to launch a generic equivalent of ProAir. That generic equivalent is, we think, a very exciting opportunity. To our knowledge, no one else has even challenged the patent. So we've challenged the patent. We've prevailed, and we're at a point where we think it's a very exciting launch for us that will represent a significant upside to us as in the later part of 2016. So we're very comfortable with that. As Judy's talked about in terms of we think about the margin opportunities, both on the gross and operating line, we do see calendar year '16 improving on both of the operating and the gross margins for that business as we continue to show very significant growth even without the equivalent of the Entocort and the Retin-A generics."

So any ""slowing"" in Q4 relative to that type of a range reflects the fact to Joe's point that Q4 2014 was the highest Q4 on record.

Number one, so I've had the pleasure of working with the Perrigo team for almost 10 years now. And I would say that through those 10 years, we've done 29, 30 different transactions. And do I accept that there's some challenges we have to work with on, on the Omega business? Yes, absolutely, but that's nothing different than every other acquisition we've been a part of. Some go faster, some go slower. There is -- the European market is one right now that is a little bit slower in terms of -- we don't take -- we don't blame them hem on it, but certainly, we knew that the FX was -- for the year was coming down. I mean, there's a lot of things that are moving on it, but it makes no -- it makes me still believe, though, that this is a phenomenal future opportunity for us from the point of view of giving us this geographic expansion opportunity, allowing us to move from 6 countries, where we compete before Omega to 39 countries. So we are still very excited about what Omega brings to us. On the question, though, that are part of your hypothesis, I want to make sure I'm very clear. We still believe that the Perrigo organic growth rate without any acquisition's still in that 5% to 10% range. And I know you know many different companies I think that you'll find that a 5% to 10% growth rate in a business that is 70%, or 70% of our sales are in the consumer side, is a very good consumer-facing business because you don't find many there growing at that rate. So we feel very optimistic about our organic growth rate and the consumer-facing part of our business. Do I still believe, though, there's a chance to do a growth rate that is about half of the business in organic growth rates and then half of the growth being inorganic? I still believe that makes a lot of sense for us because there's so many more things we can put on the back of our truck that Perrigo today going to these large retailers and/or in Europe that we're going to continue to look at them. And I've said it before to you. I think that for us, we can continue to look to expand in Animal Health. We can continue to look to expand ophthalmics, pet care, diabetes, adult nutrition. We do think there's some additional geographic expansion, especially in Europe, where we think we can bolt on some additional products to our current Omega infrastructure. So I don't think it changes my view at all. We think we've still got tremendous opportunity with Omega and, importantly, good opportunities with M&A. Thank you."

We have been anticipating a rate more in the range of 16% zone in the quarter just ended December. There was a mixed shift from -- we were not where we expected to be with earnings before tax in Europe, where our jurisdiction rates are relatively higher. And therefore, you see the overall rate lower in Q4. Looking forward, though, the approximately 14% effective tax rate, adjusted effective tax rate that we're targeting for the full year is a component of jurisdiction on mix of our businesses as well as the programs put in place that we announced on October 22, 2015 with respect to capturing better value and optimizing our tax line through the global supply chain initiative that have enormous operational activity behind them at the moment. So those will contribute to an approximately 400-basis-point improvement in our tax rates versus our previous run rate tax rate in the past."

So I can never comment on jurisdictional mix changes if we do acquisitions or jurisdictional mix changes with a swing one country versus another in terms of new product timing. But the new run rate should be more mid-teens versus high teens because of these global supply chain initiatives. So those initiatives are not one-off. It's changing the way we do business. It's changing our operating model to truly make our global supply chain universal. So all of our operations being run from that one center of excellence, it doesn't revert back. It's not like a restructuring plan where you lose the year-over-year basis. It really is a change in the way the company operates.

So we're going to look at those opportunities. Do I take the point that you're suggesting, though, that we need to continue to improve the Branded Consumer Healthcare business and put a focus on that? The answer is absolutely yes. There's no mistake about that, some of the things that we're working on. But I want to make sure my message come across. We think the Branded Consumer Healthcare business is a great business. They've done some great things with new product launches, but is there some things that we think we can help them improve as we bring some of the Perrigo processes into their business? Yes, we do think we're going to do that, and we will spend the time to do that. But we've got an organization that has certainly a lot of opportunities to think about additional M&A. And we'll think about it. I don't want to suggest to anybody, though, that M&A is going to be -- we're going to do it just no matter what the cost. We're going to be smart about it and disciplined about it just like we have been in the past. Therefore, we have an alternative. We have a share repurchase opportunity. We're always going to trade the return on investment for doing A or doing B. So I think the essence of your question is, are we going to look at it strategically and trade it off versus share repurchase? Yes. We will do that. And I think Judy tried to capture that in her comments. But there may be some opportunities that we think are from a timing point of view or a strategy point of view may be very important to us. And we're going to look at those for the next 12 months. And we don't think putting an absolute moratorium makes sense. It would just simply be smart and disciplined, as we always have been."

Obviously, you don't provide guidance on gross margin parameters anymore. But specifically, with respect to Consumer Healthcare, we saw a very strong ramp in gross margin performance over the last couple of quarters and then a pretty significant step-down this period. And obviously, there's a lot of things that go into that in terms of mix and whatnot. I think you closed the year at around 34.5%. But how do we think about going forward whether the 36% plus rate we saw in the June, September quarters, are those kind of sort of high-end targets and not really a new baseline numbers, just to kind of get a sense of what you think the baseline is at this point? And then as a follow-up to that, another gross margin question on the generic business, how are the acquisitions of tretinoin and desonide going to impact the gross margin line?"

You're right, we stepped back from giving very granular line-by-line segment margin analytics in our guidance. But suffice it to say, in the Consumer Healthcare team, and you have to give props to Jeff Needham and his entire organization, they have done an old man's job in years when there have not been the enormous switch products coming in their portfolio by blocking and tackling, bringing dozens of new products to the market, positioning those products well, fighting the fight in a world of more challenging pricing dynamics out in today's market, taking advantage of good commodity buying and taking advantage, frankly, of the comments Joe has talked about the operating model of Perrigo and our lean manufacturing efficiencies that we've continued to get over the years. That team has capitalized on that. So you've seen the margin expansion. If I think about 2015, we've gotten 37% gross margin, almost 38%. Yes, it was quote down to only 35% in the fourth quarter. But that -- we finished the year at just under 36% adjusted gross margin, which in a year without one giant blockbuster launched to point to I think is a phenomenal achievement. And if they margined out next year and caught about their planning, they are still running in the low to mid-30s in their adjusted gross margin. It varies quarter-by-quarter with timing of product, and are also looking at working to maintain the types of adjusted operating margins you saw over the course of '15 as well. Remember in my comments around how to think about the year, the balance of the year is always a factor of timing on new products, investments that are coming through down below the line within selling in terms of promotional support, et cetera. That's why I said second half of the year is slightly heavier because of the fact that you've got more launches in the back half. But you're still looking at the team working at maintaining those, I'll call it, 32% to 35% zone, that low 30% adjusted gross margin and very high teens or around 20% operating margin. Just again, thinking of that baseline of 2015 into 2016."

As we think about the future, there's no doubt that the new product that we plan to launch, whether it be the ProAir product and also the Entecort, the tretinoin product that are new in our portfolio will help us from a gross margin point of view as we think about our 2016 Rx gross margin. So we continue to see some upside from where we are currently on the Rx gross margin as a result of new products and also the acquisition products."

First of all, thank you very much for your interest in the Perrigo Company.

We believe that the EPS will grow in that 25% to 29% in 2016. We think that the improvement that we've shown in our store brand business is very important to us if you think about how much the operating margin of the Consumer Healthcare moves from '14 to '15. And as we think about '16, we think there's still some slight upside for the operating margin in that business. So we're quite excited about it. We clearly know we've got some things to get done with our Branded Consumer Healthcare. We're going to put some focus on that. But importantly, we still think that's still a great business for us over the long term as we think about the future of our business and continuing to grow our business, both organically and through M&A.

Now here's the agenda for today's call. First, I will walk through some of the key financial highlights for calendar 2015. Then I'll highlight the advantages of our focused strategy within our consumer-facing OTC global platform, which, when coupled with the earnings power of our Prescription Pharmaceuticals business, creates a truly unique, diversified and sustainable business. After that, Judy will go through the details of the fourth quarter results and guidance for calendar 2016. Then we'll close and an opportunity for Q&A. 
Before starting into the call, I'd like to take a moment to highlight some changes in our Investor Relations group. As part of previously announced consolidation of certain functions in Ireland, Art Shannon will relocate to Ireland and will be assuming the role of Vice President of Global Corporate Affairs and European Investor Relationships. Art will continue to oversee both internal and external global communications and will continue to be the lead point of contact for media and government relations. In addition, he will now be responsible for establishing a global government relations base in Dublin and expanding Perrigo's shareholder-focused Investor Relation program in Europe. I hope you can join me and congratulate both of them.
On Slide 5, you can see this was a record year for Perrigo across all key metrics, from record net sales to record adjusted operating income. This highlights our continued growth from the combination of our durable Consumer Healthcare model to our diversified Rx portfolio and inorganic acquisition strategy. 
Overall, 2015 was another great year. Perrigo achieved record net sales for the year of $5.4 billion, a 28% increase with record adjusted operating margins. We expanded adjusted gross margin by 400 basis points to 48%, driven by strong business mix, including the addition of our new Branded Consumer Healthcare or Omega business and, of course, supply chain efficiencies. Adjusted operating income increased 29% year-over-year to $1.5 billion. 
Finally, as you see here, our net operating cash flow for the full year increased to $1.05 billion, also another record for Perrigo. 
2015 included a number of key growth drivers. We introduced over 160 new products in key categories, including the store brand version of Mucinex D and the generic prescription version of Clobex Spray. We also expanded our business by completing 7 acquisitions, including 5 focused on building geographic scale and capabilities within our Consumer Healthcare platform. 
We created our pan-European platform with the acquisition of Omega. We added soft gel capabilities from the acquisition from Patheon Mexico. We acquired a new portfolio of OTC -- leading OTC brands from GSK. We added the Yokebe product line to our BCH portfolio, and we added our first U.S. Branded Consumer Healthcare product, ScarAway. 
I'd like to take a moment to thank the dedicated Perrigo employees who, amidst some uncertainty last year, weathered a demanding year. Your unwavering commitment to delivering quality, affordable health care products to customers and patients across the globe was truly outstanding. And you did it all while delivering record financial performance for the year. Thank you for all your dedication and great work.
You can see on Slide 6 the operational achievements by segment on Slide 6. CHC experienced a 3% growth in net sales on a constant currency basis. Meanwhile, operating and manufacturing efficiencies enhanced adjusted operating margin, which were a record in 2015. This equated to an impressive adjusted operating income for Consumer Healthcare, which represented a 22% increase from calendar 2014. 
To put this in context, adjusted operating margins increased by 330 basis points. Our store brand business is doing great and without the benefit of a normal cough/cold/flu season. 
Another key highlight for Consumer Healthcare was the strength of our infant formula category. We have continued investment in this business, implementing key strategies, including increasing our direct-to-consumer and doctor marketing efforts. These and other efforts have led to infant nutrition business growing 6% in 2015. I am confident we can translate the earnings from this business to other areas of our global consumer-facing platform. Congratulations to the entire CHC team for another great year of record earnings. 
The Perrigo Rx Pharmaceutical business had another great year, delivering net sales growth of 14% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. We continue to have the best Rx pipeline in our company's history and remain excited about the future of this segment. Thanks to the entire Rx team for the great performance they delivered this year. 
Further, you can see in our Specialty segment, net sales increased 12% compared to last year on a constant currency basis. 
Now let me turn to Branded Consumer Healthcare segment. This segment had a number of achievements in 2015. First, our top 20 brands grew 7% on a constant currency basis during 2015 since our ownership in April. Second, our new product launch, Bronchostop, became the fastest-growing cough/cold product in the U.K. market. Third, we acquired the NiQuitin family of products from GlaxoSmithKline, which performed above our expectations as we relaunched these products in key markets in the Branded Consumer Healthcare platform. 
We have a great European platform in place which provides a broad distribution network, highlighted by unique access to the greater than $30 billion OTC European space, representing a great opportunity in a number of markets with high barriers to entry. 
Many of our branded products rank first or second in net sales in their respective markets. They are growing organically through line extensions and by launching existing products into other European markets. 
We also plan to continue growing inorganically through strategic product acquisitions in our European platform. Perrigo is in a unique position as a top 5 OTC company by revenue in Europe, contributing to our geographic diversification within the global OTC marketplace. And due to the reasons outlined, we continue to expect that the BCH OTC platform has a growth rate higher than the market averages. 
Now notwithstanding these comments, the fourth quarter results in our BCH segment were below our expectations. Let me review a few factors that contributed to the underperformance. 
First, as you're likely aware, we did not get the benefits of a normal cough/cold/flu season in Europe. 
Second, the Branded Consumer Healthcare segment continues to experience lower net sales due to channel dynamics with the generic distribution that I discussed last quarter. These dynamics accounted for approximately 25% of the Branded Consumer Healthcare's net sales miss against our expectations. 
Third and additionally, in December, the Branded Consumer Healthcare team made considerable A&P investment, advertising and promotion investments, to grow certain branded lifestyle products, including a weight-loss product, which typically peak during summer months. They did so with the expectation of converting these products into a full year maintenance product. Unfortunately, these investments did not generate the desired sales in the quarter, even though they may still prove useful from a longer-term perspective. In any event, it is clear that this large A&P investment adversely affected the adjusted operating margin this quarter. 
Finally, in certain end markets, we had some challenges, including most notably Spain and Germany, which accounted for nearly 60% of the sales miss to our internal expectations. We are taking actions to restructure our business in these locations. 
As outlined in this morning's release, we realized a pretax noncash impairment charge of approximately $185 million related to intangible assets acquired in conjunction with the $4.5 billion Omega acquisition or approximately 4% of the acquisition price. To be clear, we incurred this impairment because the fair value of certain acquired Branded Consumer Healthcare brands was below the carrying value. However, the fair value of other acquired intangibles improved, but these increases are not recognized under accounting rules. 
Let me now spend a few minutes to detail our plan to drive performance in the BCH business. Overall, the plan will focus on improvements in organizational design or people, business processes and product resource allocation. First, from a people point of view, we are changing the management structure of the BCH segment by expanding the BCH executive committee. Also, we are putting Perrigo's matrix leadership model in place, which we believe will deliver better transparency and accountability and ensure continuing concentration on return on investment. Also, in order to address these factors at certain geographies in fourth quarter results, we are going to take specific actions in select countries to rightsize the business, streamline and restructure sales organizations in the affected geographies, including Spain and Germany. 
As part of this leadership change, President John Hendrickson of Perrigo has joined the BCH executive team as part of their team. 
Second, from a process point of view, we are strengthening the alignment of connectivity and functional accountability of the BCH business with Perrigo standards. We're implementing 4 key process improvements: number one, sales forecasting, inventory control and operations planning; number two, financial forecasting, planning and analysis; number three, supply chain integration; and number four, an incentive-based compensation that is focused on adjusted operating income and return on invested capital, similar to the existing Perrigo system. 
From a product standpoint, we have conducted a portfolio review and are taking actions in BCH to exit slower-growing or underperforming brands such as Etixx sports drink product, which does not meet our internal return on investment hurdle, and this will allow us to reallocate these resources to higher-growth products. 
The Branded Consumer Healthcare business results in the fourth quarter were a personal disappointment to me. I recognize my actions will speak louder than my words, so I am committing a significant allocation of my time over the next 6 months to be in Europe while we actively work with the BCH executive team and country general managers to drive these initiatives forward. I am confident these -- that all these actions, when taken together, will accelerate the BCH segment growth. I again want to stress our commitment and conviction around the long-term prospects of the BCH business and the European OTC marketplace as a whole. 
Now with that said, let me step back and talk about and discuss our overall strategy within OTC and why we continue to be excited about our -- building our Perrigo's position as a global OTC leader. In fact, it is clear we are a top 5 player with approximately 70% of our sales delivered on the consumer OTC platform. 
Turning to Slide 11. You can see our strong market position in OTC health care will be driven by megatrends within global health care. The efficiency and affordability of OTC products versus prescription pharmaceuticals appeal to the strong, growing, aging population and shift in health care trends. Further, new OTC innovation and Rx OTC switches provide us with numerous opportunities to continually launch new products. All this contributes to our 2016 top line organic growth framework of approximately 5% to 10%. 
As you can see, Slide 12, in 2015 based on IRI MULO data, the store brand OTC dollar growth rate was over 3% as the data is beginning to lap the impact from a 2013 return of a prominent national brand competitor. In 2016, we believe the growth in store brands will accelerate, highlighted by the store brand launches of Nasacort, Flonase and the entire Mucinex family of products. 
Slide 13 depicts the strength in our infant formula business. We have focused much attention on accelerating the growth in this category and the great performance we are now seeing as a result of solid execution. The infant formula category was a meaningful contributor to our overall growth, with Perrigo realizing an even larger share of the category. We have implemented a number of key strategies over the years, including enhanced labels and a refresh of the store brand packaging. And now we're achieving the return on these investments evidenced by the increasing market penetration. We have done this by leveraging Perrigo's world-class operating model, building cross-functional leadership and investing in infrastructure and marketing. As a result of these investments, we have been able to capture over 13% of the overall market. 
As we look ahead over the next 3 years, we see promising opportunities within our new product pipeline. We expect to launch greater than $1.2 billion in our new products by 2018 across all segments, and the majority of these will enhance our durable consumer-facing revenue stream, with about 70% of these new product sales over the next 3 years being in the consumer-facing segment. 
Turning to Slide 14. Our Rx pipeline is strong, new product opportunities ahead, equating to greater than $5.5 billion in prescription brand sales over the next 3 years. In addition, we have 25 ANDAs pending FDA approval, 5 Paragraph IV litigations and 6 projects in clinical studies. 
I also want to take a moment to highlight the record-breaking promotion that was executed by our Consumer Healthcare team, which led to a shipment of over 300 million tablets across the country to a single customer, on Slide 15. This is a testament to our store brand team and the value of our partnerships with our retail customers. I want to pass along my congratulations to the team. Great job. 
Now let me turn it over to Judy."

Good morning, everyone. As Joe previewed, we closed 2015 delivering record financial results in an extremely busy year. Every year since 2010, the team has posted record consolidated calendar year net sales, adjusted operating income and ad",1732,"Thanks, Joe. Good morning, everyone. As Joe previewed, we closed 2015 delivering record financial results in an extremely busy year. 
Every year since 2010, the team has posted record consolidated calendar year net sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted margins. While this is quite an accomplishment, it is also quite clear to this team: we did not meet our calendar 2015 guidance for adjusted earnings per share due to a few factors in BCH, which Joe has already discussed in detail. 
Looking ahead, the team has outlined a path forward for year-over-year adjusted earnings growth of 25% to 29% in 2016, and I'll discuss the details incorporated in the updated guidance later in the presentation. 
But first, as you can see on Slide 19, consolidated results for Q4 were driven by the strength of our durable business portfolio, highlighted by net sales growth of an impressive 34% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, with record adjusted gross margin. Obviously, the year-over-year metrics for Q4 include the incremental contribution from BCH, which was not a part of our business this time last year. 
Turning to CHC on Slide 20. In the quarter, net sales grew by 6% on a constant currency basis, led by strength in sales of allergy products, namely Cetirizine-D and Loratadine, our nicotine replacement franchise benefiting from the year-over-year absence of a national brand competitor, and continued store brand penetration and contract sales within the infant formula category, which Joe touched on earlier. 
In addition, we recognized $60 million in new product sales led by strong consumer demand for store brand versions of easily digestible infant formulas. This was offset by a net sales decline of $19 million in existing products, primarily in the diabetes category as well as the analgesics category, which was impacted by the extremely mild cough/cold season in the U.S. and the U.K. 
Greater sales of higher-margin products versus last year, high level of production volumes and plant efficiencies and improved commodity costs compared to the prior year led to record adjusted gross margin, which expanded 140 basis points year-over-year. 
On Slide 21, net sales in BCH were led by top 20 brands, which achieved 6% growth year-over-year on a constant currency basis. New products, including the GSK portfolio and the Yokebe brand, both of which we acquired in 2015, collectively contributed $65 million to the BCH total net sales. 
Adjusted gross margin varied from our expectations due to several factors, including slightly unfavorable brand mix and the impact of costs associated with excess and obsolete inventory charges in the quarter. Additionally, as Joe noted, fourth quarter brand advertising and promotion investments to support certain sales initiatives were larger than anticipated. These were the primary factors in BCH, which drove Perrigo's bottom line miss. 
Turning to Slide 22. The Rx segment net sales were highlighted by new product sales of $25 million, consisting primarily of the launches of clobetasol spray and the generic version of BenzaClin. These volume increases were offset by a decline in net sales of the generic version of AndroGel 1% as new competition entered the market. 
Turning to Slide 23. Specialty Sciences net sales were $84 million in the quarter, up 2% on a constant currency basis. 
Before I turn to the forecast, a quick comment on the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2015, total cash on the face of the balance sheet was $418 million, and total debt was $6 billion. While the process of our deleveraging plans slowed due to acquisitions and share repurchases in the fourth quarter, we are fully committed to delevering our balance sheet and to our mid-BBB investment-grade ratings. It is our intention to fund our share repurchase program out of ongoing cash flows, and to the extent the use of those cash flows for share repurchases would impede our M&A strategy or our delevering goals, we would slow or suspend the program for a period of time. 
As a reminder, our share repurchase program is for 36 months until late calendar 2018. Quarterly, given our cash flows generated and our commitment to delever, we will evaluate cash available for M&A and/or share repurchases. 
Now turning to Slide 24. You can see our updated guidance for calendar 2016 of $9.50 to $9.80 per share. This guidance reflects EPS growth of approximately 25% to 29% compared to 2015 adjusted diluted EPS of $7.59 per share. 
As background, on October 22, 2015, we provided our original guidance for 2016. In January, we provided an update to this 2016 guidance. I'd like to point out that we are not changing the expected baseline performance of $9.50 adjusted diluted earnings per share or the expected EPS growth rate. What has changed, however, and we're very open about this, is that we now believe the top end of the range is $9.80 adjusted diluted EPS. 
Let me explain. Our upside growth drivers remain unchanged: over $400 million in new product launches; continued supply chain efficiencies across segments; the contribution from the closed acquisitions, including the most recent tretinoin family of products; and finally, the transformation of our supply chain structure into our global center of excellence headquarters in Ireland. What has changed in our guidance, however, are the BCH dynamics previously discussed. 
It will take time to benefit from the people, process and product changes that Joe described earlier. While these items will reduce our ability to capture the upside originally expected in 2016 in BCH, we expect to continue to drive strong earnings growth for the entire company. 
Looking at the full P&L. We expect net sales in the range of $5.9 billion to $6.2 billion. 
Moving down the slide. We forecast adjusted DSG&A to be approximately 17.5% of net sales and R&D at around 3%. This leads to our expected adjusted operating margin for 2016 of between 29% and 30%, which would represent solid expansion. Our adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 14%, which is a much lower rate in the P&L than just 3 short years ago. 
Please note that 2016 guidance does not include contributions from the VMS business, and we are actively marketing the sale of our India API business as well. Both of these operations are now classified as assets held for sale. 
For comparison purposes, please remove net sales of approximately $40 million per quarter for VMS from the Consumer Healthcare net sales line in 2015 from your models. In addition, we anticipate that approximately 40% of our adjusted EPS contribution will be weighted to the first half of 2016 and 60% to the second half of the year. 
Let me walk you through the key building blocks of this first half/second half dynamic. First, we expect our CHC business to experience a shift in product mix, due in part to the return of a branded competitor in the smoking cessation category and in part to the previously announced suspension of sales of the guaifenesin 600-milligram ER product, which I will remind you is 100% owned by Perrigo. We expect this product to return to market in the second half of 2016. 
Looking to the rest of the Mucinex family. We expect volumes to grow so these products are at lower margins, as they are partnered products. 
Second, we are now in the midst of a lackluster cough/cold season. However, as always, we are planning for a normal season next fall, and therefore, our cough/cold categories are more heavily weighted to the second half of the calendar year. 
Third, R&D investments are expected to be higher in our legacy CHC and Rx segments in the first half of 2016 compared to the prior year due to commitments to launching new products. 
And fourth, new products are expected to be a sizable driver for the year, with greater than $400 million of new product sales expected to phase in over the course of 2016. As an example, ProAir will launch late in the year, and given these dynamics, timing of new product launches are expected to have a more sizable impact on the 60% earnings weighting to the second half of the calendar year. 
In addition to the items just discussed, I'd like to make a few comments on the first quarter. First, I'd like to highlight the year-over-year inclusion of shares outstanding and interest expense for the Omega acquisition in the first quarter, which will impact the year-over-year EPS comparison. Second, due to seasonal sell-in, BCH allocates approximately 27% to 30% of their annual advertising and promotion spending to the first quarter. The BCH team has been and will continue to be focused on ROI for A&P, so the investments are not always linear with sales patterns. 
While we expect adjusted operating income to grow in the first quarter in the mid-teens, with the impact of interest and shares noted a moment ago, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to only grow in the low single digits in the first quarter of calendar 2016 compared to 2015. 
Turning to Slide 25. You can see we are providing segment guidance as an approximate percentage of total net sales, with our consumer-facing businesses still expected to comprise approximately 70% of net sales in 2016. 
Slide 26 highlights our global OTC platform new product sales. We expect new product sales to be approximately 70% weighted towards OTC in 2016, including the launches of the store brand version of Flonase in the U.S. and Bronchostop throughout the rest of the EU. 
Looking at Slide 27. Given the large number of Rx products pending FDA approval, recent and expected new product launches, such as the generic version of ProAir in mid-December and continued positive momentum in the Rx base business, we expect this segment to drive greater than 20% of consolidated 2016 net sales. 
In summary, there are clear action items to deliver results in 2016. We're excited about the deep pipeline of new product launches and remain focused on solid execution and operating efficiency as the basis for continued growth. We will continue to refine and improve our operating model across all segments of the business to drive consistent returns. At the same time, we will continue to leverage our core competitive advantages and seek the right opportunities for inorganic investments that create sustained growth and meet our stringent investment criteria while still maintaining our investment-grade rating. 
Now I'll turn the call back to Joe."

Slide 29. These are key growth drivers for 2016 and beyond. What are they? They're all about building our global Branded Consumer Healthcare platform. It's all about delivering $1.2 billion of new products over the next 3 years; and it's about M&A, taking a disciplined M&A strategy and focusing on adjacent OTC categories of ophthalmic, ped health, diabetes, adult nutrition, and looking at geographic expansion as opportunities in M&A; and finally, continuing to build moats around our durable business model, including the globalization of our supply chain in Ireland. 
In summary, we believe the Perrigo Company is a very unique asset. It's a top 5 global OTC player with an industry-leading growth rate. We are building off a record year with expected 2016 top line growth of 10% to 16% and expected 2016 bottom line growth of 25% to 29%, with over 70% of our net sales coming from the consumer products. 
I'll now open it up to Q&A, operator. So we'll take our first call."

Judy, if you have the numbers available, could you give us a sense of what the full year contribution was from new products versus decline in the base? Just looking at the fourth quarter, it looks like there was about a 10% rate of decline in the base, which maybe seems a little bit higher than average, which kind of leads me into the part of my question here. It just seems like at the margin, certain segments within the generic area are seeing more pricing erosion, particularly dermatologics. I'm just kind of wondering how you're thinking about potential headwinds there in terms of accelerated pricing erosion in 2016. And obviously, it's been a very strong tailwind the past couple of years."

As you know, we've moved into what I refer to as extended topicals. So those are things beyond just certainly dermatology, but respiratory, nasal, ophthalmic. And with those product categories -- for example, at the end of the year, we'll launch our ProAir product in terms of a metered-dose inhaler for respiratory. Those are the things that are giving us great strength in our Rx category. And as we believe, that will give us a very high gross margin and operating margin certainly as we think about the 2016 and beyond. So we like what we see in terms of our ability to launch these new products and what they mean for gross margin and operating margins."

Yes, it did. I mean, clearly, you see, though, through that time period, the latter half of 2015, we had strong business performance in our Rx team. We had strong business performance in our OTC or store brand business. As we were trying to put resources toward Branded Consumer Healthcare, there were some challenges, and as I said, it's a personal disappointment. And -- but it's clearly something we know we can fix, and we're going to take the -- every effort that we can to go forward and put the initiatives that I outlined before by improving the sales and operation planning, improving the financial planning analysis, making the globalized supply chain, things that we know how to do because they fit right into what Perrigo does really well.

All those things are process things that we can do better. And clearly, that was why when I made my comments, it was partially on the people side, partially on the process side and clearly something on the product side. For example, there are some products that just do not meet our return on invested capital hurdles, and we're going to make some decisions about those particular products. Could we have tried to do this earlier? I'd say that the original business performance was very strong. We felt it was moving in the right direction.

With any restructuring, it takes a certain amount of time to do that. I would say that the improvement on process is really, by definition, a longer time frame as you put in a new sales and operation planning process, as you put in a new financial planning and analysis process, as you integrate the supply chain. Some of those things just take a little bit longer in terms of time frame. Having said that, though, we continue to believe that from the product point of view, they're launching -- the Omega team or Branded Consumer Healthcare team is launching a number of imported products.

Now think about adjusted operating margin and the expansion of growth on the bottom line, that does evolve. I made the comments about the first half, second half dynamics of the company. A portion of that is driven by investments in BCH ramping up and getting profitability, returning to more of the high-teens level over the course of the year. So if you're looking at modeling the first half of the year, you would see softer operating income, adjusted operating income in the first half and then growing and working to recover back to, as I said, adjusted operating margins at a higher level in the second half of the year.

The answer is yes, and that's something that I mentioned, Judy mentioned. And we're going to take that on, and we feel absolutely confident we will overcome those challenges. And clearly, we still believe this is a great business opportunity for us. As I said, it took us from competing in 6 countries around the world to 39. We think that expansion of geographic footprint is very, very important to us for the future. So on that question, yes, there's some challenges that we're going to work our way through. But it's nothing that we haven't experienced before. And the good news is that many of the things that need to get improved are things that we think Perrigo does very well in terms of our world-class approach to the supply chain, a world-class approach to what we plan to do with just our sales forecasting and optimization. Remember, we manage over somewhere around 20,000 SKUs from a sales and operation planning point of view from forecasting. So we believe that those things are things that we do very well. We'll put that into the Omega process, and we think we'll have once again a world-class branded OTC business based on some of the improvements. Make no mistake about it. Some of the marketing activities that Omega has done have been absolutely delivering great returns. As we've taken over the GSK brands, we've shown accelerated growth in the nicotine franchise from where they were before. So we think we're in good shape with that portion of the business in terms of the plan. But we do have some challenges. I don't want to mix [ph] words there. On the rest of the business, though, we're excited about it. If you think about what we talked about as a business in 2015, revenue up 28%, operating income up 29%, earnings per share up 21%, EBITDA now at somewhere around $1.5 billion, I mean, there's a lot of great things that have happened with this business in terms of even just within OTC, a significant -- our store brand OTC business, a significant margin expansion. So we're in good shape with our total business as we think about it, but I do take the comment that we've got some things to deal with on Branded Consumer Healthcare. On the question of the share repurchase or capital allocation, yes, that's something that Judy mentioned. We'll continue to look at that. As you know, we did a share repurchase in the fourth quarter. As we think about share repurchase in the future, we'll continue to look at that, as Judy said, as there's available free cash flow for us to do that. So that's something that we are contemplating. I will make a comment, though, just to reflect or magnify what Judy said, is that we're going to look at that relative to not only the share repurchase, but also the other M&A opportunities that we have as a company."

So does the $400 million of new product sales for 2016 include acquisitions? So can you just clarify that? And then secondly, on a bigger picture, in terms of the restructuring and cost savings you had outlined when you were fighting the hostile takeover, my understanding was a lot of that was actually taking place in the U.S. business and that you had a specific targeted amount of savings for 2016. Can you remind us what all that is? Is that getting lost in the shuffle? Or are you still pursuing those savings? And will you be reporting on how much of those restructuring savings you'll be getting each quarter as we progress through 2016 so we can monitor progress?"

So let me, first off, comment on the BCH question, new products. You are spot on that for the first time ever, there was a mixture in that comment, $65 million of new products, which included Yokebe and GSK acquired products. It's an anomaly here because we have an acquisition in a period where we don't have a comparable to last year. So the acquired products were approximately half of that $65 million. And the new products that the BCH team deemed as new in their calendar year, in the normal kind of metrics that we would use here in the company is launching something within the first 12 months, is the other half. So going forward on a like-for-like basis, we will pull out acquired products from GSK and Yokebe until they hit the 12-month acquisition anniversary, and the $400 million in total company new products does not include those 2. But you're right, that is a very good call-out, Linda, because it's a -- we've rarely had an acquired company with a new acquisition on top of it within that window. So going forward, $400 million, no acquired products within that total. Rolling back to the October 22 announcement and the savings that we expected as a company to achieve overall, those are included in our 2016 plans still. You'll remember that a portion of that announcement related to structural cost savings within the company. And for all intents and purposes, those activities are complete. The migration of our global supply chain center of excellence to our corporate headquarters in Ireland is actively underway as we speak. We mentioned Art will be moving. Many people are building up their competencies and getting the business up and running in Ireland. So those savings are going to be reflected in our 2016 numbers. And we also made the comment that the sales process for our API location, API factory in India as well as our VMS business are actively underway and expected to be closed in the not-too-distant future. So you can consider the -- essentially the XLS implementation of streamlining of our operating structure is built in. We're not been necessarily calling those out on a line-by-line basis, but suffice it to say we'll keep you posted on the sales process for VMS. We'll keep you posted on our ongoing buildout within Ireland as more and more of our business is operated in our corporate headquarters directly with Europe. And we'll call out any incremental actions that can take place over the course of the year within BCH, specifically restructuring initiatives and the dollars related to those."

The reason we expect it to slowdown is because at the end of 2014, we launched a very significant new product. It was the 1% -- AndroGel 1% or Testosterone 1% gel. That was a very important launch for us, and one which did incredibly well. We were the only company out there with a generic equivalent to the 1%. So therefore, this is all things that we expected. We always knew the comp for the year-over-year was going to be significant for the fourth quarter. And so all of that has transpired exactly as what was stated. I'll remind you that, as Judy was talking about, the opportunities in our Rx business, one of the things we've mentioned was the opportunity to launch a generic equivalent of ProAir. That generic equivalent is, we think, a very exciting opportunity. To our knowledge, no one else has even challenged the patent. So we've challenged the patent. We've prevailed, and we're at a point where we think it's a very exciting launch for us that will represent a significant upside to us as -- in the later part of 2016. So we're very comfortable with that. As Judy's talked about in terms of we think about the margin opportunities, both on the gross and operating line, we do see calendar year '16 improving on both of the operating and the gross margins for that business as we continue to show very significant growth, even without the equivalent of the Entocort and the Retin-A generics."

Our plan for Rx is -- reflects excluding the acquired products, excluding the tretinoin family and the Entocort transaction, is still at the high end of our 8% to 12% growth guidance that we provided in the past. So any ""slowing"" in Q4 relative to that type of a range reflects the fact, to Joe's point, that Q4 2014 was the highest Q4 on record. So relatively, that quarter was outside of our stated 8% to 12% range, but we are at the high end of that range within our 2016 guidance plan for next year."

Number one, so I've had the pleasure of working with the Perrigo team for almost 10 years now. And I would say that through those 10 years, we've done 29, 30 different transactions. And do I accept that there's some challenges we have to work with on, on the Omega business? Yes, absolutely, but that's nothing different than every other acquisition we've been a part of. Some go faster, some go slower. There is -- the European market is one right now that is a little bit slower in terms of -- we don't take -- we don't blame it on it, but certainly, we knew that the FX was -- for the euro was coming down. I mean, there's a lot of things that are moving on it, but it makes no -- it makes me still believe, though, that this is a phenomenal future opportunity for us from the point of view of giving us this geographic expansion opportunity, allowing us to move from 6 countries, where we compete before Omega, to 39 countries. So we are still very excited about what Omega brings to us. On the question, though, that -- or part of your hypothesis, I want to make sure I'm very clear. We still believe that the Perrigo organic growth rate, without any acquisitions, is still in that 5% to 10% range. And I know you know many different companies. I think that you'll find that a 5% to 10% growth rate in a business that is 70% -- or 70% of our sales are in the consumer side, is a very good consumer-facing business because you don't find many that are growing at that rate. So we feel very optimistic about our organic growth rate in the consumer-facing part of our business. Do I still believe, though, there's a chance to do a growth rate that is about half of the business in organic growth rates and then half of the growth being inorganic? I still believe that makes a lot of sense for us because there's so many more things we can put on the back of our truck that Perrigo today, going to these large retailers and/or in Europe, that we're going to continue to look at them. And I've said it before to you. I think that for us, we can continue to look to expand in Animal Health. We can continue to look to expand ophthalmics, pet care, diabetes, adult nutrition. We do think there's some additional geographic expansion, especially in Europe, where we think we can bolt on some additional products to our current Omega infrastructure. So I don't think it changes my view at all. We think we've still got tremendous opportunity with Omega and, importantly, good opportunities with M&A. Thank you."

We had been anticipating a rate more in the 16% zone in the quarter just ended December. There was a mix shift. We were not where we expected to be with earnings before tax in Europe, where our jurisdictional rates are relatively higher. And therefore, you see the overall rate lower in Q4. Looking forward, though, the approximately 14% effective tax rate, adjusted effective tax rate that we're targeting for the full year is a component of jurisdictional mix of our businesses as well as the programs put in place that we announced on October 22, 2015, with respect to capturing better value and optimizing our tax line through the global supply chain initiatives that have enormous operational activity behind them at the moment. So those will contribute to an approximately 400 basis point improvement in our tax rates versus our previous run rate tax rate in the past."

So I can never comment on jurisdictional mix changes if we do acquisitions or jurisdictional mix changes with a swing one country versus another in terms of new product timing. But the new run rate should be more mid-teens versus high teens because of these global supply chain initiatives. So those initiatives are not one-offs. It's changing the way we do business. It's changing our operating model to truly make our global supply chain universal. So all of our operations being run from that one center of excellence, it doesn't revert back.

They've done some great things with new product launches, but is there some things that we think we can help them to improve as we bring some of the Perrigo processes into their business? Yes, we do think we're going to do that, and we will spend the time to do that. But we've got an organization that has certainly a lot of opportunities to think about additional M&A. And we'll think about it. I don't want to suggest to anybody, though, that M&A is going to be -- we're going to do it just no matter what the cost. We're going to be smart about it and disciplined about it, just like we have been in the past. Therefore, we have an alternative. We have a share repurchase opportunity. We're always going to trade the return on investment for doing A or doing B. So I think the essence of your question is, are we going to look at it strategically and trade it off versus share repurchase? Yes. We will do that. And I think Judy tried to capture that in her comments. But there may be some opportunities that we think are, from a timing point of view or a strategy point of view, may be very important to us. And we're going to look at those for the next 12 months. And we don't think putting an absolute moratorium makes sense. It would just simply be smart and disciplined, as we always have been."

The team that was running it is still the team that is currently running it, with the exception of one individual. Having said that, we think there's some things that we can strengthen. As I mentioned, in terms of a process point of view, we clearly believe there's things we can improve on relative to sales forecasting, sales operation planning, the financial planning analysis, the supply chain. Those are things that we already had in our mind. We just simply want to accelerate some of that as we get closer to the business and look at it, and also see some of the challenges that we saw in the fourth quarter. So it's things that we already know we're going to do. I think what I'm really saying is we're just going to accelerate some of these things faster based on, at least, what we think are opportunities to improve. But I don't think it's a -- there's any other structural or strategy issues other than the ones I've outlined for us to improve on.

It's just obviously the foreign exchange is different than when we acquired it, but that's something that we all face as a company. Operator, we have time for one more question."

Obviously, you don't provide guidance on gross margin parameters anymore. But specifically, with respect to Consumer Healthcare, we saw a very strong ramp in gross margin performance over the last couple of quarters, and then a pretty significant step-down this period. And obviously, there's a lot of things that go into that in terms of mix and whatnot. I think you closed the year at around 34.5%. But how do we think about going forward, whether the 36% plus rate we saw in the June, September quarters, are those kind of sort of high-end targets and not really a new baseline numbers? Trying to kind of get a sense of what you think the baseline is at this point. And then as a follow-up to that, another gross margin question on the generic business. How are the acquisitions of tretinoin and budesonide going to impact the gross margin line?"

You're right, we stepped back from giving very granular line-by-line segment margin analytics in our guidance. But suffice it to say, in the Consumer Healthcare team, you have to give props to Jeff Needham and his entire organization. They have done an yeoman's job in years when there have not been the enormous switch products coming in their portfolio, but blocking and tackling, bringing dozens of new products to the market, positioning those products well, fighting the fight in a world of more challenging pricing dynamics out in today's market, taking advantage of good commodity buying and taking advantage, frankly, of the comments -- Joe has talked about the operating model of Perrigo and our lean manufacturing efficiencies that we've continued to get over the years. That team has capitalized on that. So you've seen the margin expansion. If I think about 2015, we've gotten 37% gross margin, almost 38%. Yes, it was ""down"" to only 35% in the fourth quarter. But that -- we finished the year at just under 36% adjusted gross margin, which in a year without one giant blockbuster launch to point to, I think is a phenomenal achievement. And as they margined out next year and thought about their planning, they are still running in the low to mid-30s in their adjusted gross margin. It varies quarter-by-quarter with timing of product, and are also looking at working to maintain the types of adjusted operating margins you saw over the course of '15 as well. Remember in my comments around how to think about the year, the balance of the year is always a factor of timing on new products, investments that are coming through down below the line within selling in terms of promotional support, et cetera. That's why I said second half of the year is slightly heavier because of the fact that you've got more launches in the back half. But you're still looking at the team working at maintaining those, I'll call it, 32% to 35% zone, that low 30% adjusted gross margin and very high teens or around 20% operating margin. Just again, thinking off that baseline of 2015 into 2016."

As we think about the future, there's no doubt that the new products that we plan to launch, whether it be the ProAir product and also the Entocort, the tretinoin product that are new -- now part of our portfolio, will help us from a gross margin point of view as we think about our 2016 Rx gross margin. So we continue to see some upside from where we are currently on the Rx gross margin as a result of new products and also the acquisition products.
Operator, that concludes the call. I just want to make a couple of comments. First of all, thank you very much for your interest in the Perrigo Company. As I think about the business and we think about our guidance for the year, I remind you that we're looking at a revenue growth of 10% to 16%, we think dramatically driven by this concept of a durable business model. We believe that the EPS will grow in that 25% to 29% in 2016. We think that the improvement that we've shown in our store brand business is very important to us if you think about how much the operating margin of the Consumer Healthcare moved from '14 to '15. And as we think about '16, we think there's still some slight upside for the operating margin in that business. So we're excited about it. We clearly know we've got some things to get done with our Branded Consumer Healthcare. We're going to put some focus on that. But importantly, we still think that's still a great business for us over the long term as we think about the future of our business and continuing to grow our business, both organically and through M&A. Thank you, everyone, for your attention today. Have a great day."

I have been a member of the Perrigo's Board of Directors since 2003 and have had the privilege to serve on both the audit and remuneration committees. During my tenure on the board, I've come to deeply appreciate the strength of this company and its management as well as our ability to grow and deliver value while effectively addressing the challenges.
I'd like to take this opportunity today to talk with you about our CEO transition process. As previously announced, following our robust succession planning process, on April 25, the Board of Directors unanimously selected John Hendrickson as Chief Executive Officer. Speaking on behalf of the entire board, I can assure you that the choice to elevate John was clear. John has been essential to the company's success in each of his roles in Perrigo. John led and shaped the operational backbone of the organization, designing a vast and multifaceted infrastructure to produce and supply a broad and complex portfolio of products. He showed distinctive leadership as head of our Consumer Healthcare business from 2003 to 2007. During that challenging period when we were grappling with the movement of guaifenesin, which was the largest product in our OTC portfolio at the time behind the counter, John led us to increased revenue. All functions reported to him, including R&D, regulatory, sales, marketing and operations.
Since 2007, John has served as EVP and head of global supply chain until his promotion to president last year. His manufacturing and supply-chain leadership, exceptional operational track record and ability to connect with and get the most out of his people give us great confidence in our decision to promote John to president as well as our recent decision to appoint him to CEO.
In John, we identify the leader who knows the business, is committed to our mission and can make the choice if necessary to deliver value to our shareholders. The board recognizes, of course, that the success of Perrigo does not start or stop with one person John is supported by a talented, experienced team and the board has full confidence in the team's ability to work effectively with John to execute and deliver shareholder value.
Finally, I want to underscore my remarks by highlighting our commitment to corporate governance and transparency. To enhance independent decision-making at the board level and to align our structure with what we believe is appropriate for the company at this time, the board has chosen to separate the roles of CEO and Chairman of the Board. Our commitment to shareholders will remain, as it always has, essential to our decision-making process going forward.
And now I'd like to turn the call over to John."

During my time a",1654,"Thank you, Laurie, and welcome again everybody to Perrigo's first quarter 2016 earnings call. I want to start by saying how honored and privileged I am to be CEO of this great organization and lead our more than 13,000 talented employees. During my time at Perrigo, I have served in a variety of different capacities, as Laurie outlined, and I am acutely aware of what this great business has to offer customers, consumers and our shareholders. I will say it unequivocally, at its core, Perrigo is a truly diversified and unique business, transcending generic prescription products with a resilient OTC base. I believe there's a long runway for growth ahead of us, and I am confident we have the right cohesive management team in place to focus on the execution that is required to deliver clear value to our shareholders.
That said, I know that meeting or exceeding expectations is the foundation for establishing your trust. This will be my personal focus and the focus of the management team going forward.
Turning to Slide 6. Our recent track record of performance against our own expectation is unacceptable. I understand that. Our team understands that. My focus and that of my team will be on operational discipline in generating consistent results. I am confident we will deliver, given our opportunities for growth to form [ph] our platform and our deep long-standing relationships with our customers. We will deliver our results.
Now let me highlight the key components of my overarching leadership principles for our business. First, as I said, our operational execution is the cornerstone of our success. Developing, marketing, purchasing, manufacturing, distributing abroad complex array of customized products have always been our strength. Quality continues to be the driving force behind our organization marketing, and we have the infrastructure and quality track record to consistently move our products on the shelves for our customers and into the homes of our consumers.
Second, I'm action-oriented. I've already made critical decisions in a number of our businesses. I will continue to take appropriate steps to capitalize on opportunities and effectively address our challenges.
Third, I felt it important to share my guidance philosophy, which we addressed -- which we'll address in more detail soon. I'm unequivocally committed to transparency, and we'll be at actively engaged with and listening to you, your questions and comments. That's how I've always worked with their customers, suppliers, employees and shareholders.
Finally, our goal is to ultimately create value to our shareholders, the owners of our company. To that end, my primary focus at this time is on our core operating and organic growth vehicles. As always, we will continue to evaluate ways to refine and enhance our portfolio products to customers and consumers. We will continue to look at synergistic bolt-on acquisitions that fit strategically within our core infrastructure and we will continue to evaluate methods of returning capital to our shareholder base.
Now I'd like to give you my insight into the Perrigo Advantage and my perspective on each of our business segments. Looking at Slide 7, our Consumer Healthcare platform is core to Perrigo. We have a strong and durable position with numerous products, dosage forms and capabilities. Our U.S. consumer business includes more OTC abbreviated new drug applications than any other manufacturer, even including the large brand of pharmaceutical companies that you all know. This ability to bring new products to market will continue to drive growth in our CHC segment. In addition, we have one of the broadest store brand OTC supply chains in the world. That means the first raw materials being procured through manufacturing, all the way through logistics and distribution, ultimately work to our customers.
One truckload of products leaves the Perrigo distribution center every 30 minutes, 24/7, 365 days a year to go to our customers to ultimately go to our consumers. We are the company retailers look to as their partner of choice. We are the company retailers looking to drive value for their consumers and ultimately, their shareholders.
This segment continues to be led by Jeff Needham. Jeff is an industry innovator with over 30 years of experience. The deep customer relationships we have help ensure we continue to be a valued partner in this consumer space.
Next, turning to our Branded Consumer Healthcare division. Despite some challenges, my view of this business segment is one of optimism about the power of the platform that it provides us. Perrigo is now able to distribute products to an additional 32 countries globally, reaching greater than 300,000 pharmacists and retailers in these countries. The European OTC market represents $30 billion a year in sales.
Since the beginning of this calendar year, I have worked with the country leaders and the executive team in our Branded Consumer Healthcare division to develop a deeper understanding of the day-to-day operations of the business. We are now fully in effectively integrating BCH into our existing leadership structure. We are building upon the team's core sales and marketing strengths, implementing our own strong operational controls and structures.
As CEO, I've made a number of additional changes to the BCH business such as coming to a mutual agreement with Marc Coucke that he would resign and appointing Sharon Kochan as Head of the BCH business Sharon's background, disciplined approach and ability to drive organizations to peak performance made the decision to appoint him to lead the BCH team a clear one. Sharon was the architect of our Rx business, which he built from the ground up, with a superb executional track record. Track record includes the acquisition and integration of various bolt-on products and businesses during his tenure. 
At the current -- our international business, show results are overseen diverse markets including both branded and store brand offerings in multiple geographies such as Mexico and the U.K. I am confident that the growth, execution and financial accountability of the segment will be enhanced under Sharon's leadership. In addition to personnel changes, Sharon and I are providing our strong BCH leaders with increasing responsibilities to lead new geographies. -- our portfolio and divest underperforming assets. We are also exercising new and innovative products, such as our nicotine replacement therapy franchise acquired from GSK last summer. Our leaders are now aligned with the strategy to continue focusing on our top 20 brands to ensure growth of the strong portfolio. And to be clear, today, these top 20 products continue to grow at a faster pace in the markets that they're in.
These changes are in conjunction with the important decisions a Judy have made in the finance organization. She has enhanced financial management, and we are actively in the process of posting BCH of sales, forecasting, inventory control and operations planning on to Perrigo's existing platform and upgrading the financial planning at the analyst to support these activities and drive growth.
Again, I want to reiterate that the top 20 brands that we have in the business today continue to grow faster than the market. We have a supply chain and a platform to support pan-European growth and we can add products to further leverage this business.
Turning now to our Rx business. Our prescription business is an important part of our diversified consolidated portfolio. Our Rx business has a clear strategic rationale as part of our broad, diversified portfolio and is a great complement to our core consumer competencies. Products, plant, procurement, technology distribution are all highly synergistic to the OTC business. And this business represents a potential -- pipeline for product conversions from our x-OTP. For example, take our topical acne category within the Rx portfolio. When a category like this begins to switch, we are in a prime position to capitalize on this opportunity. Switch provides dermatology pipeline and allows us to benefit from 2 life cycles for a single pharmaceutical products. We also have a strong pipeline in our Rx business. While these new products are going to be more technically challenging with longer regulatory approval time frames, they do potentially create a higher barrier to entry hauling for longer, more enduring product lifespans.
As all of you know, pricing pressures can ultimately deflate a major topic within the industry. Our Rx team have done a great job over the past years of managing through this. However, we are not immune to this dynamic and ultimately increased competition and greater than expected price erosion hurt our performance in Q1 and resulted in lowering of our expectations for the year.
Doug Boothe, our EVP and General Manager of the Rx business, has been with Perrigo since 2013 leading the business through exception growth. Doug has been in the industry and seen various cycles in the Prescription Pharmaceuticals business and is the right person to guide the business in this market. 
Finally, Specialty Sciences and Tysabri. From my perspective, Tysabri is a valuable financial assets, which contributes meaningfully to our financial flexibility and enables us to capitalize on opportunities.
Now I'd like to hand the call over to Judy. But before I do so, I'd like to first congratulate Judy in our company on our newly expanded role announced this morning. As part of my strategy to take actions that will deliver enhanced value for our company and for our shareholders, you as owners, Judy Brown will take on an expanded role as Executive Vice President, Business Operations and Chief Financial Officer. In this role, Judy will have leadership of our global product portfolio and global shared service platform, complementing her current response abilities for current Corporate Development, finance, strategy and communications. Leveraging her experience in leading multinational finance and product about what organizations both at Perrigo and Wal-Zyr, Judy will now be the expansion of our existing portfolio and pipeline products across all business segments and geographies while optimizing our business services.
Well, thank you, Judy. I will now turn the call over to Judy. Judy Brown."

You can see on Slide 9 that GAAP net loss for the quarter was $133.1 million compared to a net loss of $95 million in the prior year. Let me explain the primary differences between our GAAP results and adjusted earnings.Our long-standing p",1849,"So diving in. You can see on Slide 9 that GAAP net loss for the quarter was $133.1 million compared to a net loss of $95 million in the prior year. Let me explain the primary differences between our GAAP results and adjusted earnings.
Our long-standing philosophy is to adjust GAAP EPS to help you better understand our underlying operation. These adjustments include such items as acquisition-related matters such as noncash acquisition-related amortization expenses, restructuring charges and related tax effects and those items outlined in tables 1 and 2 in today's press release.
You will notice that as described on February 18, we're also rebuilding our Vitamins, Minerals and Supplements operating results from our adjusted earnings in 2016 as the business is currently held for sale. A full reconciliation can be viewed in tables 1 and 2 in our press release.
There are 2 specific large noncash impairment charges here related to Branded Consumer Healthcare, which I will also talk in a moment when we get to the segment details.
So as you can see now on Slide 10. Perrigo delivered consolidated first quarter adjusted net sales growth of 33% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, excluding contributions from the VMS business for both 2016 and 2015. As noted on our fourth quarter 2015 earnings call, we exclude approximately $40 million of contribution each quarter in your models for 2015 related to this business.
During the first quarter, we experienced a confluence of events, which have impacted quarter results to a magnitude we could not have anticipated at the beginning of the quarter and which have also impacted our guidance for the full year as I'll discuss shortly. Net sales contributions from Branded Consumer Healthcare, which was not part of our business this time last year, was the primary driver of our year-over-year top line growth. Consolidated new product sales of $74 million, including $31 million in BCH new product sales, were partially offset by $39 million of discontinued products. First quarter consolidated adjusted gross margin what's a March quarter record of 47.9%, highlighted by first quarter adjusted gross profit margins in our Consumer Healthcare segment of 33.8%, with first quarter consolidated adjusted operating margin of 25.1%.
So walking through the segments, starting with CHC on Slide 11. In the quarter, adjusted net sales, excluding VMS, grew 2% on a constant currency basis, driven by continued momentum in store brand infant formula and continued strength in our NRT franchise. I'm pleased to note that Perrigo's supply infant formula market share has grown to 13.9%, according to IRR data, which is a record for the Consumer Healthcare team. These gains were partially offset by decreases in the analgesic and cough/cold categories following an extremely mild cough/cold season and the absence of the guaifenesin 600-milligram ER product as compared to last year. As previously discussed, this is the last quarter where our infant formula label refresh will have a negative year-over-year impact. This conversion accounted for the majority of the abnormally high discontinued product number of $32 million embedded in these results. New product sales in the quarter were $31 million. Remember we anticipated our new product launches in this segment to be weighted more heavily to the second half of the calendar year.
On Slide 12, you can see that BCH posted net sales of $318 million, with new products contributing $31 million and our acquired the GSK portfolio and Yokebe brands contributing another $37 million to this total. The BCH segment revenues were organically flat compared to the prior year, with growth in our top 20 brands primarily in the cough cold and allergy category despite a soft season in Europe, which was offset by lower OTC sales in certain markets.
In the quarter, BCH fell considerably short of our top line expectations. Despite soft top line results as previewed in February, we continue to make significant investment in advertising and promotion in this quarter, equal to approximately 18.6% of net sales. These effects were the primary drivers of adjusted operating income as a percent of sales of only approximately 8%. The net sales in the quarter combined with the change in forecasted net sales and adjusted operating income for the remainder of the year was the basis for the change in guidance for this segment as well as triggering an initial indicator of impairment. This started a process to update our long-range segment plan to evaluate a securing values. The change in fair value from previous estimates was due primarily to the changes in the current market at the performance of the brand such that the evaluation of the brand prioritization and product expenses or losses in new regions are being more focused to maximize the potential of the whole vascular brands in the segment portfolio.
As a result, as outlined in our press release this morning, is that we realized a pretax noncash impairment charge of approximately $467 million related to intangible assets acquired in conjunction with the Omega acquisition; $273 million related to indefinite live intangible assets; and the remaining $194 million related to goodwill. This is clearly a disappointment but steps are being taken to correct the underperformance in BCH, including changes in leadership as John has outlined. While many steps have already been taken, it is important to note that it will take time to fully realize the true value of the actions we are taking. 
On Slide 13, Rx net sales increased 2% which came in below our expectations. We experienced negative organic growth within the segment, resulting from several factors, so let me explain. The change in the competitive landscape was much more disruptive to our plan as it has been anticipated and impacted our overall pricing strategies for the segment. During the quarter, we experienced 24 competitive launches against our portfolio, producing sharp price erosions in the number of topical products we sell. These factors, combined with continued pricing pressure due to the consolidation of the large cooperative group and the absence of significant new products in the quarter, further impacted our ability to execute on our plant pricing strategy. Despite all of this, however, the team was able to maintain its extensive topical leadership position in the quarter. These pricing pressures impacted both the adjusted growth and operating margin, accounting for the year decline year-over-year.
Turning to Slide 14, Specialty Sciences net sales were $88 million in the quarter, up 9% on a constant currency basis.
Before I turn to the forecast, let me make a quick comment on the balance sheet. As of April 2, 2016, total cash on the balance sheet was $589 million and total debt was approximately $6.5 billion. The increase in debt from December 31 reflects the financing of the -- acquisition in January and the subsequent $1.2 billion senior notes issuance we did in early March to term out our short-term debt. As we have stated in the past, we are fully committed to our investment-grade rating and delevering our balance sheet through EBITDA growth and debt repayment.
Cash flow from operations in the quarter was $170 million, which included onetime unfavorable reduction in Accounts Payable of an estimated $67 million in Branded Consumer Healthcare related to the normalization of their accounts payable terms.
As a reminder, we intend to fund our previously announced share repurchase program, which runs out until late calendar 2018 through operating cash flow. To the extent the use of those cash flows for share repurchases would impede our delevering goals for any tuck-in acquisitions, we would slow our program for a period of time. Quarterly, given the cash generated and our commitment to delever, we will evaluate cash available for M&A and/or share repo. So let's move on now to 2016 guidance.
On April 25, we provided preliminary guidance with without -- so let me walk you through some more information by segment on Slide 16, starting with CHC. We expect Consumer Healthcare net sales for 2015 to be approximately $2.65 billion. The segment has been updated primarily for the exclusion of the guaifenesin 600-milligram ER product relaunch, delay in new product launches which include a risk-adjusted launch of a store brand version of Flonase in the second half of the year and some adjustments for recent customer negotiations. While the same continues to work on relaunching guaifenesin 600-milligram ER product, we believe it makes sense to remove it here from our financial forecast. We anticipate CHC adjusted operating margin to be relatively flat year-over-year.
Next, we expect BCH net sales for 2016 to be approximately $1.4 billion. To help you through your modeling, let me give you some color on our expectations for the adjusted operating margin in the segment. 2015 adjusted operating margin for the segment was 15.8% for the 9 months ended December. Our updated guidance assumes that adjusted operating margin will be approximately 200 basis points lower in 2016 due to the many organizational and portfolio changes we have discussed this morning, coupled with continued investment in ANP in our top 20 brands.
Rx. We expect Rx net sales for 2016 to be approximately $1.2 billion. Within Rx, we assume price erosion of approximately 6% for the remainder of the calendar year and now is in the launch of the generic portion of ProAir in 2017. Our guidance reflects the expectation that the adjusted operating margin will be in the high 40% ranges for the year.
All of this leads to our updated consolidated guidance perspective on Slide 17. We now expect revenue between $5.6 billion and $5.9 billion, which assumes greater than $300 million in new product launches across all segments for the year adjusted to reflect the new product delays we've already discussed.
Given the new jurisdictional mix of income expected across segments, particularly with the new your products slated for launch in the second half of the year, we are updating the full year adjusted effective tax rate guidance to be approximately 15% for 2016. Given the fact that this quarter's tax rate was 11.4%, you should model a tax rate of approximately 16% to 17% on a quarterly basis for the rest of the year.
Summing all of this up to the consolidated P&L. We continue to expect 2016 adjusted earnings per diluted share to be in a range between $8.20 and $8.60. As previously noted, we continue to expect approximately 55% of our adjusted diluted EPS to materialize in the second half of the calendar year, due primarily to timing of expected new product launches.
Lastly, a few comments on operating cash flow guidance for the year. We expect the performance of our business to deliver full year operating cash flow of approximately $1 billion, which includes the one-time unfavorable $67 million BCH-related normalization effects I mentioned a few moments ago. This represents an operating cash flow conversion approaching 90% to the midpoint of our adjusted net income earnings guidance. This business model continues to drive strong cash flows and illustrates the ability of our platform to generate quality net income performance.
I'll now hand the call back to John."

Turning now to Slide 19. I want to amplify what Judy said about our guidance. The guidance range that we put forward on April 25 accurately reflects the perspective of my full management team and our opportunities and on the dynamics facing Perrigo and our industry. As we stated earlier, we will set and communicate proper targets and work tirelessly to meet or exceed them. 
I also want to iteration the leadership principles that I talked about upfront, which at the core, focused on execution designed to drive shareholder value. First, as I said earlier, my foremost priority is operational execution. We have a great business, and operational excellence is the foundation which all of our success has been built. This is who we are. Our platform is designed to add products and technologies that foster our growth. High quality and affordability for our consumer is paramount. When we add new legs to our stool like we did with the infant nutrition and animal health, we leverage these business models, investing in R&D, talent and infrastructure to further growth. This is why we generate the strong cash flow that Judy emphasized earlier.
Second, I am action oriented and we'll deal with challenges and opportunities head-on. I've made and will continue to make critical decisions to improve certain aspects of our businesses.
Third, I'm unequivocally committed to transparency and will be actively engaged with and listening to your questions and comments. That's how I've always worked and that's how I will continue to work. 
Fourth and finally, everything I and the management team do is directed to delivering value to our shareholders and we will continue to deploy capital prudently and appropriately to that end.
I'd like to close by reiterating my confidence in the strength of the Perrigo business. We have a solid foundation to build on, we have an experienced management team, we have a deep pipeline of new products. We continue to refine and improve our operating model across all of our segments of business to drive returns. Our global platform gives us a springboard for growth and we are all fixated on leveraging our core advantages to deliver shareholder value. And I would be remiss if I didn't thank our more than 13,000 employees around the world for their hard work in building Perrigo as the business it is today. We have an exceptional group of professionals working to deliver Quality Affordable Healthcare Products around the world and they are core to our success in the past in an the future. And I'm honored to be part of this outstanding organization.
We will now open the call for questions and answers. I want to remind you that I am joined for Q&A by Perrigo's Chairman, Laurie Brlas; and our Executive Vice President, Judy Brown."

So as we look pragmatically at the rest of the year, we had to say what is a reasonable assumption based on the competitive landscape as it with us -- right now things I called out for the increased buying pressure across the cooperative large groups, which everyone in the industry is seeing -- right now, building that into our expectations, updating our forecast to reflect specific contractual agreements now in place to rest of the year, evaluating the pricing strategies that we have had in place for the last 3 quarters of the year and making sure that those are updated to reflect the new reality for the remainder of 2016 and making sure though that in our numbers and in our bottom line that we're still making the right investments in R&D. So not skipping in R&D with entirely with the situation in the market but making sure that we still made that contribution to long-term growth of the portfolio. So that's the evolution of the pricing update. We said 6% for the remainder of the year.

And so as the teams have done, they said very clearly give me my new product launches because it helps the whole basket of goods have -- better stickiness long-term in pricing."

I believe in Europe, we have a good platform. We're trying to put more operating structure into it. Take a little bit about the operating entrepreneurship out of it and bring some structures into it but it is a great platform. The GSK products that we bought a few months back are performing well in those markets. They -- the mixed team franchise, one of the biggest nicotine franchises, nicotine replacement therapy franchise in the U.S. and now having that in Europe, a great natural extension to our core consumer businesses. So I do believe that adding on core bolt-on acquisitions within the infrastructures can have a good return for shareholder value. So I'm a believer in that. And then ultimately, what else do we do with the cash and the value that we're generating. Are there other ways of returning that value to shareholders.

First of all, I do as you said, have great confidence with the team and the initial actions we've taken with the Omega, with Branded Consumer Healthcare as we call it in Europe. I won't go back to go through the whole -- but his integrity, his ability to drive performance of the operating line, he's proven himself. So I'm confident in him, I'm confident that we will need to add more leaders, and add more things to drive it but we're off to a great start. We also added one of our experienced financial leaders to that business about 2 months ago. He has already begun a much stronger financial planning, financial control acumen to the BCH team. So I feel good about that. Do I think that you can add a brand across every European country just like you do in the U.S? No. Each of our brands are more specialized in the regions there. It might be the Nordics or it might be down in the Baltic areas, but they're all more regionalized. I believe that even within those regions, one of the advantages that Omega has in our Branded Consumer Healthcare division is they have the ability to launch products within region segments and make them profitable. So when I say bolt on, it may not be just one pan-European brand. It may be brands that are much more regional but we can add to that infrastructure's growth. So I do have confidence in that. I have confidence in our ability to continue to provide growth on to that platform. I think the integration we're going to continue. We have agreed sales, marketing drive footprint the way the work with each country, whether it's a pharmacy driven country, whether it's a -- more likely U.K., which tends to be more like the U.S. from a retailer distribution. No matter what, they've got a good infrastructure there and they've been able to show a strong leadership. And so I got a lot of confidence in the business drivers there, et cetera. I think we need the operational backbone, the financial backbone that Perrigo brings to solidify that overall structure. Related to sort of the Mylan Stata [ph] business, Stata is a generic company that we distribute for in Belgium, as you might recall. During all the Mylan brings discussions, et cetera, there were some strange relationships there with Stata holding off some distribution, et cetera. We are basically through that. We are continuing to operate with Stata to distribute their products in Belgium. We are talking with them about what the go-forward relationship might be or might not be, but we still have a time period of a couple of years for that relationship. So that's where that is today. We're meeting all of them."

Maybe just give me a little bit of color to the extent you have questions on the impairments discussed. The intangible assets that the recorded in the indefinite live intangible asset basket that is recorded on our balance sheet is composition of the branded portfolio of Omega at the time of acquisition. So within each of the major categories, are several brands. As the year has progressed in 2015 and into 2016, we also did additional acquisitions. We have to get big portfolio, we launched the Yokebe product line, which is proving to be a very successful lifestyle health product that is performing very well in the portfolio and capturing a lot of market share. As we move then strategically as a team the product -- the team looked at offering the products and are moving away from XL-S, which was in the original acquisition basket and moving toward Yokebe, that triggers the requirement to lower the carrying value of those particular assets on the balance sheet. So one can look at the impairment is a negative. We are writing down certain assets that were acquired acquisition. But that the same time, we're also investing in other brands of the portfolio for future growth. So that's part of this composition of John talking -- we made several comments about re-analyzing the portfolio, re-prioritization that portfolio for growth, part of that prioritization process actually is what triggered the discussion around the impairment. So it's moving from plan a to plan b in triggering that impairment, that noncash charge. And looking at the remainder of the year, all that kind of comes together so that the guidance was updated to reflect certain changes in that portfolio, some ups, some downs. Of lowering the overall guidance across the categories to make some adjustments primarily with the focus on new products. So some expectations of timing changes on those and how we reprioritize the top 20 brands are what were the drivers for this year's guidance. And we didn't get specific on which categories got change guidance but suffice it to say, is really about putting different leverage within the overall top 20 brands basket."

So how should we really think about your generics business from the point forward? Is it going to be -- is -- becoming a more commoditized business or is this just a fluke in terms of the backlog the FDA started approving? And do you have the right composition of assets there? And then in terms of Omega, just longer term, it's always been characterized as a 5% to 10% of growing business and also the strategic rationale was to really be less of an operating synergy play but more of our revenue synergy play. And so does that still stand? Do you still have a lot of opportunities for revenue synergies in the longer term 2 to 3 years out."

But I just want to point out to everyone sort of stating the obvious is we saw flow through in these pricing dynamics at the top line, which flowed through in dollar terms through the bottom line versus our expectation in the impact for the full year. But please note, the adjusted margin are still very strong. So -- leadership position in the space, the products that we put to market are still stickier in relative terms than the average generic. And you can see that through both this quarter while the quarter year-over-year isn't back down, not arguing that point, those are still very attractive operating margin with continued investment in R&D. So I just what want to point that part out because it's really about relative dynamics but still attractive portfolio and we believe that we built in and update to the new landscape and still are looking at very attractive margins."

When you think about the synergistic side that relate to that we have with the Branded Consumer Healthcare business, they are still there. The operating side synergies, is still driving hard trying to deliver driving those to the bottom line. The revenue synergies in my mind are still there. They take -- and even in our model, longer to get to because you have multiple registration, multiple how the advertiser, promote different things, multiple regulations within different countries, even in the U.S. So in my perspective, they are so we're from a long-term plan but just take longer to get the results revenue synergies.

Certainly your derm products which have benefited from unusual portfolio price inflation generic drugs are deflationary but you benefited from inflationary products.

So it just seems that, that the end of the day the companies that were caught offguard concentrated portfolios to those that weren't and anticipated a low to mid-single-digit decline of prices have broad global portfolios. John, your portfolio is highly concentrated all in the U.S. While that has clearly served as a company well over the past couple of years, going forward, it does appear that the environment is changing for your type of portfolio. What do you see as a possible strategic option for this business? Does it still makes sense to keep for Perrigo? And is this a one-time rebasing or do we worry about those margins eventually coming back down to where Tevas and Mylans are? Or how do you think about that business strategically? And then just my follow-up question on Tysabri, you talked about that the not being core financial asset.

Let me start back and comment on our generic business kind of go back to the big picture. It definitely is a business focused on extended topicals. So it's not just term, it's ophthalmics, it's women's health but it's extended topicals kind of products. Those our usually require clinicals, broader types of approvals to get in there. They usually are not billion dollar blockbusters. They usually much more the brand much more $100 million products, et cetera, and so you to usually don't have 57 competitors going after that like you might with a 800-milligram -- or something of that nature. So it's still a phase. If we are a relatively big Rx explainer. I mean, we're certainly the top 10, not just within the extended topicals but in general when you look at the U.S. by generic generics base. I think it hit -- as we look back and understand how would hit, there certainly were some approvals, there's some buying power, all of those things that hit is faster than we expected and we had to address I think the others had been -- it hit them earlier because of their broad portfolio. They had a number of products that certainly were targeted in that -- in the initial barrage, if you will. So I do think we're in a unique time. We have a good product pipeline and we expect to continue to get those approvals and continue to be able to balance out the ups and downs of our product mix and portfolio, given we're going to continue to see the constant price pressure on our older products. We've always seen that. It's just escalated during the last quarter with the approvals. So when you look globally, I think it's a great question, one I think will contemplate here over the next couple of months as we look for the long-term strategy of our Rx business. We certainly as we get to other countries, have Rx businesses. They're not nearly as big. We do on Rx business in the U.K. that makes specialty progress being prescriptions. We have some businesses that distribute our Rx to Mexico. So we have parts of our business that -- Rx is much smaller than our core U.S. business. And so we will look at how that fits, does it fit internationally, does it fit globally into our structure. Clearly, in the U.S., it has a lot of advantaged advantages. Again, our whole infrastructure is geared around both of those and it provides a pipeline for us to continue to feed our OTC marketplace, OTC engine. So all of that is very good. I think the last kind of part of it is Tysabri. Again, I do see it as a financial asset. I think we will continue to look at it and figure out what is the best way to utilize that asset. Is it add cash to fund other things, is it liquidating parts of it, you do -- we will continue to evaluate the best use of that Tysabri asset."

As innovators launch the products, we're in a great position to capitalize on that. The macroeconomic trends of people getting older, needing more healthcare cost going up despite our ability or desire to control them more continue to drive people towards retail brands. And frankly, when they try them, and we recognize the quality there. And so that allows the share to grow and my belief is it will continue to allow the share to drive upward.

We continue to see switches as a big part of the growth to that over-the-counter market when you look out over the next few years. And as different categories talked about derm or others that switch, those open bigger opportunities. Going back a ways not to get to back too far, when you look at probably one of the clear categories used either go to the over-the-counter and get something that would put you to sleep when you had your allergies or you went through a doctor we got a prescription. Now as that -- as those products switch over-the-counter, the amount of opportunity that, that has created in the over-the-counter space is great. So we see that continuing for categories. And frankly, the regulatory agency, the government wanting to try and drive safe health care to be more affordable. And so all of those with think work in the favor of that. Related to additional kind of add-ins, we certainly are a big part of the business but there are still other segments, the other areas that would fit well within our overall system, overall structure, adding more items to the truck that are pharmaceutically oriented that we continue to look at. And not all of them will make sense for us, but we continue to make sure that we have the sort of optimal portfolio to bring that value to our retailers and then ultimately to consumers. So I think there's still those laps that Jeff and his team are continuing to look at to see how we add those in. Thank you. Thanks, Derek.
Well, with that, I thank everyone for joining us on the call. I appreciate your time and I look forward to meeting you personally here in the next couple of weeks as I get a chance to know and talk with you personally. Thank you very much."

I have been a member of Perrigo's Board of Directors since 2003 and have had the privilege to serve on both the audit and remuneration committees. During my tenure on the board, I've come to deeply appreciate the strength of this company and its management as well as our ability to grow and deliver value while effectively addressing challenges.
I'd like to take this opportunity today to talk with you about our CEO transition process. As previously announced, following our robust succession planning process, on April 25, the Board of Directors unanimously selected John Hendrickson as Chief Executive Officer. Speaking on behalf of the entire board, I can assure you that the choice to elevate John was clear. John has been essential to the company's success in each of his roles in Perrigo. 
John led and shaped the operational backbone of the organization, designing a vast and multifaceted infrastructure to produce and supply a broad and complex portfolio of products. He showed distinctive leadership as Head of our Consumer Healthcare business from 2003 to 2007. During that challenging period, when we were grappling with the movement of  pseudoephedrine, which was the largest product in our OTC portfolio at the time, behind the counter, John led his team to increased revenue. All functions reported to him, including R&D, regulatory, sales, marketing and operations.
Since 2007, John has served as EVP and Head of Global Supply Chain until his promotion to President last year. His manufacturing and supply chain leadership, exceptional operational track record and ability to connect with and get the most out of his people give us great confidence in our decision to promote John to President as well as our recent decision to appoint him to CEO. In John, we identified a leader who knows the business, is committed to our mission and can make the choices necessary to deliver value to our shareholders. 
The board recognizes, of course, that the success of Perrigo does not start or stop with one person. John is supported by a talented, experienced team, and the board has full confidence in the team's ability to work effectively with John to execute and deliver shareholder value.
Finally, I want to underscore my remarks by highlighting our commitment to corporate governance and transparency. To enhance independent decision-making at the board level and to align our structure with what we believe is appropriate for the company at this time, the board has chosen to separate the roles of CEO and Chairman of the Board. Our commitment to shareholders will remain, as it always has, essential to our decision-making process going forward.
And now I'd like to turn the call over to John."

I want to start by saying how honored and privileged I am to be CEO of this great organization and lead our more than 13,000 talented employees. During my time",1663,"Thank you, Laurie, and welcome again everybody to Perrigo's First Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. I want to start by saying how honored and privileged I am to be CEO of this great organization and lead our more than 13,000 talented employees. 
During my time at Perrigo, I have served in a variety of different capacities, as Laurie outlined, and I'm acutely aware of what this great business has to offer customers, consumers and our shareholders. I will say it unequivocally. At its core, Perrigo is a truly diversified and unique business, transcending generic prescription products with a resilient OTC base. I believe there's a long runway for growth ahead of us, and I am confident we have the right cohesive management team in place to focus on the execution that is required to deliver clear value to our shareholders. That said, I know that meeting or exceeding expectations is the foundation for establishing your trust. This will be my personal focus and the focus of the management team going forward.
Turning to Slide 6. Our recent track record of performance against our own expectations is unacceptable. I understand that. Our team understands that. My focus and that of my team will be on operational discipline in generating consistent results. I am confident we will deliver, given our opportunities for growth, the power of our platform and our deep long-standing relationships with our customers. We will deliver our results.
Now let me highlight the key components of my overarching leadership principles for our business. First, as I said, our operational execution is the cornerstone of our success. Developing, marketing, purchasing, manufacturing, distributing a broad, complex array of customized products have always been our strengths. Quality continues to be the driving force behind our organization, and we have the infrastructure and quality track record to consistently move our products onto shelves for our customers and into the homes of our consumers.
Second, I'm action-oriented. I've already made critical decisions in a number of our businesses. I will continue to take appropriate steps to capitalize on opportunities and effectively address our challenges.
Third, I felt it important to share my guidance philosophy, which we addressed -- which we'll address in more detail soon. I'm unequivocally committed to transparency, and we'll be actively engaged with and listening to you, your questions and comments. That's how I've always worked with our customers, suppliers, employees and shareholders.
Finally, our goal is to ultimately create value for the shareholders, the owners of our company. To that end, my primary focus at this time is on our core operating and organic growth vehicles. As always, we will continue to evaluate ways to refine and enhance our portfolio of products to customers and consumers. We will continue to look at synergistic bolt-on acquisitions that fit strategically within our core infrastructure, and we will continue to evaluate methods of returning capital to our shareholder base.
Now I'd look -- like to give you my insight into the Perrigo Advantage and my perspective on each of our business segments. Looking at Slide 7. Our Consumer Healthcare platform is core to Perrigo. We have a strong and durable position with numerous products, dosage forms and capabilities. Our U.S. consumer business includes more OTC abbreviated new drug applications than any other manufacturer, even including the large branded pharmaceutical companies that you all know. This ability to bring new products to market will continue to drive growth in our CHC segment. 
In addition, we have one of the broadest store brand OTC supply chains in the world. That means the first raw materials being procured through manufacturing, all the way through logistics and distribution, ultimately our -- to our customers. One truckload of product leaves a Perrigo distribution center every 30 minutes, 24/7, 365 days a year to go to our customers to ultimately go to our consumers. We are the company retailers look to as their partner of choice. We are the company retailers look to, to drive value for their consumers and ultimately, their shareholders. 
This segment continues to be led by Jeff Needham. Jeff is an industry innovator with over 30 years of experience. The deep customer relationships we have help ensure we continue to be a valued partner in this consumer space.
Next, turning to our Branded Consumer Healthcare division. Despite some challenges, my view of this business segment is one of optimism about the power of the platform that it provides us. Perrigo is now able to distribute products to an additional 32 countries globally, reacher -- reaching greater than 300,000 pharmacists and retailers in these countries. The European OTC market represents $30 billion a year in sales.
Since the beginning of this calendar year, I have worked with the country leaders and the executive team in our Branded Consumer Healthcare division to develop a deeper understanding of the day-to-day operations of the business. We are now fully and effectively integrating BCH into our existing leadership structure. We are building upon the team's core sales and marketing strengths, implementing our own strong operational controls and structures.
As CEO, I have made a number of additional changes to the BCH business, such as coming to a mutual agreement with Marc Coucke that he would resign and appointing Sharon Kochan as Head of the BCH business. Sharon's background, disciplined approach and ability to drive organizations to peak performance made the decision to appoint him to lead the BCH team a clear one. Sharon was the architect of our Rx business, which he built from the ground up, with a superb executional track record. Track record includes the acquisition and integration of various bolt-on products and businesses during his tenure. 
At the current -- as the current Head of our International Business, Sharon has also overseen diverse markets, including both branded and store brand offerings in multiple geographies such as Mexico and the U.K. I am confident that the growth, execution and financial accountability of the segment will be enhanced under Sharon's leadership. 
In addition to personnel changes, Sharon and I are providing our strong BCH leaders with increasing responsibilities to lead new geographies, prioritize our portfolio and divest underperforming assets. We are also emphasizing new and innovative products, such as our nicotine replacement therapy franchise acquired from GSK last summer. Our leaders are now aligned with the strategy to continue focusing on our top 20 brands to ensure growth of the strong portfolio. And to be clear, today, these top 20 products continue to grow at a faster pace than the markets that they are in.
These changes are in conjunction with the important decisions Judy has made in the finance organization. She has enhanced financial management, and we are actively in the process of putting BCH's sales forecasting, inventory control and operations planning on to Perrigo's existing platform and upgrading the financial planning and analysts to support these activities and drive growth. Again, I want to reiterate that the top 20 brands that we have in the business today continue to grow faster than the market. We have a supply chain and a platform to support pan-European growth, and we can add products to further leverage this business.
Turning now to our Rx business. Our prescription business is an important part of our diversified consolidated portfolio. Our Rx business has a clear strategic rationale as part of our broad, diversified portfolio and is a great complement to our core consumer competencies. Products, plant, procurement, technology distribution are all highly synergistic with the OTC business, and this business represents a potential feeder pipeline for product conversions from Rx to OTC. 
For example, take our topical acne category within the Rx portfolio. When a category like this begins to switch, we are in a prime position to capitalize on this opportunity. A switch provides a dermatology pipeline and allows us to benefit from 2 life cycles for a single pharmaceutical products. We also have a strong pipeline in our Rx business. While these new products are going to be more technically challenging with longer regulatory approval time frames, they do potentially create a higher barrier to entry, allowing for a longer, more enduring product lifespans.
As all of you know, pricing pressures and, ultimately, deflation have been a major topic across the industry. Our Rx team has done a great job over the past years of managing through this. However, we are not immune to this dynamic, and ultimately, increased competition and greater-than-expected price erosion hurt our performance in Q1 and resulted in lowering of our expectations for the year. Doug Boothe, our EVP and General Manager of the Rx business, has been with Perrigo since 2013, leading the business through exceptional growth. Doug has been in the industry and seen various cycles in the prescription pharmaceutical business and is the right person to guide the business in this market. 
Finally, Specialty Sciences and Tysabri. From my perspective, Tysabri is a valuable financial asset, which contributes meaningfully to our financial flexibility and enables us to capitalize on opportunities.
Now I'd like to hand the call over to Judy. But before I do so, I'd like to first congratulate Judy and our company on her newly expanded role announced this morning. As part of my strategy to take actions that will deliver enhanced value for our company and for our shareholders, you as owners, Judy Brown will take on an expanded role as Executive Vice President, Business Operations and Chief Financial Officer. In this role, Judy will have leadership of our global product portfolio and global shared service platform, complementing her current responsibilities for corporate development, finance, strategy and communications. Leveraging her experience in leading multinational financing and product development organizations, both at Perrigo and at Whirlpool, Judy will now lead the expansion of our existing portfolio and pipeline products across all business segments and geographies while optimizing our business services.  Well, thank you, Judy. 
I will now turn the call over to Judy. Judy Brown?"

You can see on Slide 9 that GAAP net loss for the quarter was $133.1 million compared to a net loss of $95 million in the prior year. Let me explain the primary differences between our GAAP results and adjusted earnings.Our long-standing p",1851,"So diving in. You can see on Slide 9 that GAAP net loss for the quarter was $133.1 million compared to a net loss of $95 million in the prior year. Let me explain the primary differences between our GAAP results and adjusted earnings.
Our long-standing philosophy is to adjust GAAP EPS to help you better understand our underlying operations. These adjustments include such items as acquisition-related matters, such as noncash acquisition-related amortization expenses, restructuring charges and related tax effects. And those items outlined in Tables 1 and 2 in today's press release. You will notice that, as described on February 18, we are also removing our Vitamins, Minerals and Supplements operating results from our adjusted earnings in 2016 as the business is currently held for sale. A full reconciliation can be viewed in Tables 1 and 2 in our press release.  There are 2 specific large noncash impairment charges here related to Branded Consumer Healthcare, which I will also talk about in a moment when we get to the segment details. 
So as you can see now on Slide 10, Perrigo delivered consolidated first quarter adjusted net sales growth of 33% year-over-year on a constant-currency basis, excluding contributions from the VMS business for both 2016 and 2015. As noted on our fourth quarter 2015 earnings call, we exclude approximately $40 million of contribution each quarter in your models for 2015 related to this business. During the first quarter, we experienced a confluence of events which has impacted quarter results to a magnitude we could not have anticipated at the beginning of the quarter and which have also impacted our guidance for the full year, as I'll discuss shortly. 
Net sales contributions from Branded Consumer Healthcare, which was not part of our business this time last year, was the primary driver of our year-over-year top line growth. Consolidated new product sales of $74 million, including $31 million in BCH new product sales, were partially offset by $39 million of discontinued products. First quarter consolidated adjusted gross margin was a March quarter record of 47.9%, highlighted by first quarter adjusted gross profit margins in our Consumer Healthcare segment of 33.8%, with first quarter consolidated adjusted operating margin of 25.1%.
So walking through the segments, starting with CHC on Slide 11. In the quarter, adjusted net sales, excluding VMS, grew 2% on a constant-currency basis, driven by continued momentum in store brand infant formula and continued strength in our NRT franchise. I'm pleased to note that Perrigo's supplied infant formula market share has grown to 13.9%, according to IRI data, which is a record for the Consumer Healthcare team. These gains were partially offset by decreases in the analgesic and cough/cold categories following an extremely mild cough/cold season and the absence of the guaifenesin 600-milligram ER product as compared to last year. 
As previously discussed, this is the last quarter where our infant formula label refresh will have a negative year-over-year impact. This conversion accounted for the majority of the abnormally high discontinued product number of $32 million embedded in these results. New product sales in the quarter were $31 million. Remember, we anticipated our new product launches in this segment to be weighted more heavily to the second half of the calendar year.
On Slide 12, you can see that BCH posted net sales of $318 million, with new products contributing $31 million and our acquired the GSK portfolio and Yokebe brand contributing another $37 million to this total. The BCH segment revenues were organically flat compared to the prior year, with growth in our top 20 brands primarily in the cough/cold and allergy category despite a soft season in Europe, which was offset by lower OTC sales in certain markets.
In the quarter, BCH fell considerably short of our top line expectations. Despite soft line -- soft top line results, as previewed in February, we continue to make significant investments in advertising and promotion in this quarter, equal to approximately 18.6% of net sales. These effects were the primary drivers of adjusted operating income as a percent of sales of only approximately 8%. 
The net sales miss in the quarter combined with the change in forecasted net sales and adjusted operating income for the remainder of the year were the basis for the change in guidance for this segment as well as triggering an initial indicator of impairment. This started a process to update our long-range segment plans to evaluate asset carrying values. The change in fair value from previous estimate was due primarily to the changes in the current market and performance of the brands, such that the evaluation of the brand prioritization and product extensions or launches in new regions are being more focused to maximize the potential of the whole basket of brands in the segment portfolio.
The result, as outlined in our press release this morning, is that we realize a pretax noncash impairment charge of approximately $467 million related to intangible assets acquired in conjunction with the Omega acquisition, $273 million related to indefinite lived intangible assets and the remaining $194 million related to goodwill. This is clearly a disappointment, but steps are being taken to correct the underperformance in BCH, including changes in leadership as John has outlined. While many steps have already been taken, it is important to note that it will take time to fully realize the true value of the actions we are taking. 
On Slide 13, Rx net sales increased 2%, which came in below our expectations. We experienced negative organic growth within the segment resulting from several factors, so let me explain. The change in the competitive landscape was much more disruptive to our plan than had been anticipated and impacted our overall pricing strategies for the segment. During the quarter, we experienced 24 competitive launches against our portfolio, producing sharp price erosions in a number of topical products we sell. These factors, combined with continued pricing pressure due to the consolidation of the large buying cooperative groups and the absence of significant new products in the quarter, further impacted our ability to execute on our planned pricing strategy. Despite all of this, however, the team was able to maintain its extended topics leadership position in the quarter. These pricing pressures impacted both the adjusted gross and operating margins, accounting for the decline you see here year-over-year.
Turning to Slide 14. Specialty Science net sales were $88 million in the quarter, up 9% on a constant-currency basis.
Before I turn to the forecast, I'll make a quick comment on the balance sheet. As of April 2, 2016, total cash on the balance sheet was $589 million and total debt was approximately $6.5 billion. The increase in debt from December 31 reflects the financing of the tretinoin acquisition in January and the subsequent $1.2 billion senior notes issuance we did in early March to term out our short-term debt. As we have stated in the past, we are fully committed to our investment-grade ratings and delevering our balance sheet through EBITDA growth and debt repayment. 
Cash flow from operations in the quarter was $170 million, which included onetime unfavorable reduction in accounts payable of an estimated $67 million in Branded Consumer Healthcare related to the normalization of their accounts payable terms. As a reminder, we intend to fund our previously announced share repurchase program, which runs out until late calendar 2018, through operating cash flow. To the extent the use of those cash flows for share repurchases would impede our deleveraging goals or any tuck-in acquisitions, we would slow or suspend the program for a period of time. Quarterly, given the cash generated and our commitment to delever, we will evaluate cash available for M&A and/or share repos. 
So let's move on now to 2016 guidance. On April 25, we provided preliminary guidance without much detail. So let me walk you through more information by segment on Slide 16, starting with CHC. We expect Consumer Healthcare net sales for 2016 to be approximately $2.65 billion. The segment has been updated primarily for the exclusion of the guaifenesin 600-milligram ER product relaunch, delay in new product launches, which include a risk-adjusted launch of the store brand version of Flonase in the second half of the year and some adjustments for recent customer negotiations. While the team continues to work on relaunching the guaifenesin 600-milligram ER product, we believe it makes sense to remove it here from our financial forecast. We anticipate CHC adjusted operating margin to be relatively flat year-over-year.
Next, we expect BCH net sales for 2016 to be approximately $1.4 billion. To help you through your modeling, let me give you some color on our expectations for the adjusted operating margin in the segment. 2015 adjusted operating margin for the segment was 15.8% for the 9 months ended December. Our updated guidance assume that adjusted operating margin will be approximately 200 basis points lower in 2016 due to the many organizational and portfolio changes we have discussed this morning, coupled with continued investment in A&P in our top 20 brands.
Rx. We expect Rx net sales for 2016 to be approximately $1.2 billion. Within Rx, we assume price erosion of approximately 6% for the remainder of the calendar year and now assume the launch of the generic version of ProAir in 2017. Our guidance reflects the expectation that the adjusted operating margin will be in the high 40% ranges for the year.
All of this leads to our updated consolidated guidance perspective on Slide 17. We now expect revenue between $5.6 billion and $5.9 billion, which assumes greater than $300 million in new product launches across all segments for the year, adjusted to reflect the new product delays we've already discussed.
Given the new jurisdictional mix of income expected across segments, particularly with the new products slated for launch in the second half of the year, we are updating the full year adjusted effective tax rate guidance to be approximately 15% for 2016. Given the fact that this quarter's tax rate was 11.4%, you should model a tax rate of approximately 16% to 17% on a quarterly basis for the rest of the year.
Summing all of this up to the consolidated P&L. We continue to expect 2016 adjusted earnings per diluted share to be in a range between $8.20 and $8.60. As previously noted, we continue to expect approximately 55% of our adjusted diluted EPS to materialize in the second half of the calendar year, due primarily to timing of expected new product launches.
Lastly, a few comments on operating cash flow guidance for the year. We expect the performance of our business to deliver full year operating cash flow of approximately $1 billion, which includes the onetime unfavorable $67 million BCH-related normalization effects I mentioned a few moments ago. This represents an operating cash flow conversion approaching 90% to the midpoint of our adjusted net income earnings guidance. This business model continues to drive strong cash flows and illustrates the ability of our platform to generate quality net income performance.
I'll now hand the call back to John."

As we stated earlier, we will set and communicate proper targets and work tirelessly to meet or exceed them. 
I also want to reiterate my leadership principles that I talked about upfront, which, at the core, focused on execution designed to drive shareholder value. First, as I said earlier, my foremost priority is operational execution. We have a great business, and operational excellence is the foundation which all of our successes is built.  This is who we are. 
Our platform is designed to add products and technologies that foster our growth. High quality and affordability for our consumer is paramount.

Fourth and finally, everything I and the management team do is directed to delivering value to Perrigo shareholders, and we will continue to deploy capital prudently and appropriately to that end.
I'd like to close by reiterating my confidence in the strength of the Perrigo business. We have a solid foundation to build on. We have an experienced management team. We have a deep pipeline of new products. We continue to refine and improve our operating model across all of our segments of business to drive returns. Our global platform gives us a springboard for growth, and we are all fixated on leveraging our core advantages to deliver shareholder value. 
And I would be remiss if I didn't thank our more than 13,000 employees around the world for their hard work in building Perrigo to the business it is today.

But perhaps you can talk about specific changes to the execution model or -- and whether or not you agree with the strategic sort of platform.

So we saw, I'll call it, some softness, starting in January, began to accelerate as these competitive launches -- I quoted 24 competitors launched against our products in Q1. And that, in and of itself, changed the pricing dynamics for our team versus their expectations. And so  as you look back, the -- sorry, [indiscernible] of the quarter. So as we look pragmatically at the rest of the year, we had to say, what is a reasonable assumption based on the competitive landscape as it faces us right now? Things I called out, the increased buying pressure across the cooperative large groups, which everyone in the industry is seeing to some extent right now, building that into our expectations, updating our forecast to reflect specific contractual agreements now in place for rest of the year, evaluating the pricing strategies that we have had in place for the last 3 quarters of the year and making sure that those are updated to reflect the new reality for the remainder of 2016 and making sure though that in our numbers and in our bottom line that we're still making the right investments in R&D. So not skimping in R&D with -- entirely with the situation in the market, but making sure that we still made that contribution to the long-term growth of the portfolio. So that's the evolution of the pricing update. And we said 6% for the remainder of the year. I think the team feels that, that's a reasonable approach to pricing, where they've evaluated and tried to take in the known knowns as well as a little bit of wiggle room for the unknowns. And going forward, still looking at adjusted operating margin for the segment in the high 40s, op -- adjusted operating margins for the full year."

So we don't have the ability, of course, to set pricing to the consumers on the shelf, that's the determination by the retailers. But we work actively on being effective in our own buying, having an effective supply chain to mitigate any pricing pressures seen for the Consumer Healthcare team and, of course, when we launch new products, it gives leverage to the entire basket of sales that the team goes out and speak with the retailers about. So the phrase used in my prepared remarks is directly linked, of course, to the dynamics of no big, very visible, large products launched this quarter in the OTC basket. We're going to have some very attractive ones coming up just very soon, but that's part of the yin and yang.

And then separately, 24 competitive launches against the topical product line. Can you quantify that in dollars? And what's this trend related to? Is this the FDA pushing more approvals? And maybe just any comments on the vulnerability that you might have on that happening with more products going forward."

Let me take some of those and then I may toss over to Judy for a couple others. First of all, capital deployment and return to shareholders. As I go through again and think about priority and I lay these out trying to mentally get these clear, I think organic growth, a great way to do it, great platform, makes sense. I believe in Europe, we have a good platform. We're trying to put more operating structure into it, take a little bit about the operating entrepreneurship out of it and bring some structures into it, but it is a good platform. The GSK products that we bought a few months back are performing well in those markets. The nicotine franchise, one of the biggest nicotine franchises, nicotine replacement therapy franchise in the U.S. and now having that in Europe, a great natural extension to our core consumer businesses. So I do believe that adding on core bolt-on acquisitions within the infrastructures can have a good return for shareholder value. So I'm a believer in that. And then ultimately, what else do we do with the cash and the value that we're generating? There's other ways of returning that value to shareholders. But I would put them in that order because I think that's a priority that we can deliver value to the group. Why don't I turn it over to Judy on the 24 and the escalation, et cetera..."

They have mom and pops in Europe, multiple countries, they don't have consolidated chains. How can you get comfortable that, that integration will go well and that you have a handle on the business? And related to that, during the Mylan saga, apparently Stada had changed their business with Omega and I think Mylan was blamed somehow. We never got a full answer in what happened with Stada and will they come back as they were before? And finally, can you give us an update on the Flonase as well?"

Let me go -- try and go in order. First of all, I do as you said. I have great confidence with the team and the initial actions we've taken with the Omega, with Branded Consumer Healthcare as we call it in Europe. I won't go back to go through the whole Churone's [ph] accolades but his integrity, his ability to drive performance to the operating line, he's proven himself. So I'm confident in him, I'm confident that we will need to add more leaders and add more things to drive it, but we're off to a great start. We also added one of our experienced financial leaders to that business about 2 months ago. He has already begun a much stronger financial planning, financial control acumen to the BCH team. So I feel good about that. Do I think that you can add a brand across every European country just like you do in the U.S? No. Each of our brands are more specialized with the regions there. It might be the Nordics or it might be down in the Baltic areas, but they're all more regionalized. I believe that even within those regions, one of the advantages that Omega has in our Branded Consumer Healthcare division is they have the ability to launch products within region segments and make them profitable. So when I say bolt ons, it may not be just one pan-European brand. It may be brands that are much more regional but we can add to that infrastructure's growth. So I do have confidence in that. I have confidence in our ability to continue to provide growth onto that platform. I think the integration, we're going to continue. They have agreed sales, marketing drive footprint. The way the work with each country, whether it's a pharmacy driven country, whether it's more like the U.K. which tends to be more like the U.S. from a retailer distribution. No matter what, they've got a good infrastructure there and they've been able to show strong leadership. And so I've got a lot of confidence in the business drivers there, et cetera. I think we need the operational backbone, the financial backbone that Perrigo brings to solidify that overall structure. 
Related to sort of the Mylan Stada business, Stada is a generic company that we distribute for in Belgium, as you might recall. During all the Mylan discussions, et cetera, there were some strange relationships there with Stada holding off some distribution, et cetera. We are basically through that. We are continuing to operate with Stada and  distribute their products in Belgium. We are talking with them about what the go-forward relationship might be or might not be, but we still have a time period of a couple years for that relationship. So that's where Stada is today. We're meeting all of them."

Maybe let me just give everyone a little bit of color to the extent you had questions on the impairments discussed. The intangible assets that are recorded in the indefinite live intangible asset basket that is recorded on our balance sheet is a composition of the branded portfolio of Omega at the time of acquisition. So within each of the major categories are several brands. As the year has progressed in 2015 and into 2016, we also did additional acquisitions. We did the GSK portfolio, we launched the Yokebe product line which is proving to be a very successful lifestyle health product that is performing very well in the portfolio and capturing a lot of market share. As we move then strategically as a team the team looked at offering the products and are moving away from XL-S which was in the original acquisition basket and moving toward Yokebe, that triggered the requirement to lower the carrying value of those particular assets on the balance sheet. So one can look at the impairment as a negative. We are writing down certain assets that were acquired from this acquisition. But in the same time, we're also investing in other brands in the portfolio for future growth. So that's part of this composition of John talking -- he made several comments about re-analyzing the portfolio, re-prioritizing that portfolio for growth. Part of that prioritization process actually is what triggered the discussion around the impairment. So it's moving from plan a to plan b in triggering that impairment, that noncash charge. And looking at the remainder of the year, all of that kind of comes together. So the guidance was updated to reflect certain changes in that portfolio, some ups, some downs, lowering the overall guidance across certain categories to make some adjustments primarily with the focus on new products. So some expectations of timing changes on those and how we re-prioritize the top 20 brands are what were the drivers for this year's guidance. And we didn't get specific on which categories got change in guidance but suffice it to say, it's really about pulling different levers within the overall top 20 brand basket."

And do you have the right composition of assets there? And then in terms of Omega, just longer term, it's always been characterized as a 5% to 10% of growing business.

All right. Let me just start off. Just briefly, I want to make one point on the Rx front. Because the Rx quarter performed so much differently than our expectations because of the items I've already mentioned and in taking a pragmatic view for the rest of the year, we lowered our guidance. We're calling out the reasons therefor. But I just want to point out to everyone, sort of stating the obvious is we saw flow through in these pricing dynamics at the top line which flowed through in dollar terms through to the bottom line versus our expectation and the impact for the full year. But please note, the adjusted margins are still very strong. So it seems though leadership position in the space, the products that we put to market are still stickier in relative terms than the average generic. And you can see that through both this quarter, while the quarter year-over-year isn't back down, not arguing that point, those are still very attractive operating margins with continued investment in R&D. So I just what want to point that part out because it's really about relative dynamics but still attractive portfolio, and we believe that we built in and update to the new landscape and still are looking at very attractive margins."

And again, my commitment is to come back to you and others in the summer here with our long-range growth plan related to Omega. When you think about the synergistic side that we have with the Branded Consumer Healthcare business, they are still there. The operating side synergies is still driving hard to try and deliver, driving those to the bottom line. The revenue synergies in my mind are still there. They take, and even in our model, longer to get to because you have multiple registrations, multiple how do you advertise or promote different things, multiple regulations within different countries even in the U.S. So in my perspective, they are still there from a long-term plan standpoint, but just takes longer to get the results in that revenue synergies. By putting Judy in her new role, one of her great opportunities will be taking the products that we have in different divisions and figuring out how do we leverage those across our global business portfolio.

The Consumer Healthcare business will have a bigger second half. Their new product launches are concentrated in the back half of the year. So that means that it's a build over the course of the year. Investments continue over the course of the year and if you recall, the June quarter for that last year as well as for Branded Consumer Healthcare were quite big in the June quarter of 2015. So it was a huge quarter. So expect the comps in CHC on a year-over-year basis to be more challenged, again, because of the last year dynamics. New products launched out in the second half will continue. So that CHC line, to your point, I think you called it out as a dip and then tick back up, and that's a reasonable estimate. And that's why we also made that comment, CHC is our largest business. We made that comment about expect approximately 55% of EPS to come in the second half of the year."

Certainly your portfolio is mostly derm products which have benefited from unusual price inflation and noticeably, generic drugs are deflationary but you benefited from inflationary products. I mean, will you take a step back? Clearly, the environment's changed. It seem that the FDA is approving more drugs in this piece that's creating competition which is pushing down prices. And at the same time, consolidated buyers are pressing for a broader depth of portfolio. So it just seems that the end of the day, the companies that were caught off guard had concentrated portfolios. Those that weren't and who had anticipated a low to mid-single-digit decline of prices have broad global portfolios. John, your portfolio is highly concentrated all in the U.S. While that has clearly served the company well over the past couple of years, going forward, it does appear that the environment is changing for your type of portfolio. What do you see as a possible strategic option for this business? Does it still makes sense to keep for Perrigo? And is this a one-time rebasing or do we worry about those margins eventually coming back down to where Tevas and Mylans are? Or how do you think about that business strategically? And then just my follow-up question on Tysabri, you talked about that the not being core, that's a financial asset. Isn't though the longer you wait, the less it's worth just given that competition is coming next year?"

Let me start back and cut them on our generic business, kind of go back to the big picture. It definitely is a business focused on extended topicals. So it's not just derm, it's ophthalmics, it's women's health but it's extended topical kind of products. Those that usually require clinical, broader types of approvals to get in there. They usually are not billion-dollar blockbusters, they usually are much more the brands. They usually are much more $100 million products, et cetera. And so you usually don't have 57 competitors going after that like you might with a 800-milligram ibuprofen or something of that nature. So it is still a phase. We are a relatively big Rx player. I mean, we're certainly in the top 10, not just within the extended topicals but in general when you look at the U.S. by generic generics space. I think it hits -- as we look back and understand how would hits, there certainly were some approvals, there's some buying power, all of those things that hit us faster than we expected and we had to address. I think the others had been -- it hit them earlier because of their broad portfolio. They had a number of products that certainly were targeted in that -- in the initial barrage, if you will. So I do think we're in a unique time. We have a good product pipeline and we expect to continue to get those approvals and continue to be able to balance out the ups and downs of our product mix and portfolio, given we're going to continue to see constant price pressure on our older products. We've always seen that. It's just escalated here in the last quarter with the approvals. So when you look globally, I think it's a great question, one I think we'll  contemplate here over the next couple of months as we look through the long-term strategy of our Rx business. We certainly, as we get to other countries, have Rx businesses. They're not nearly as big. We do an Rx business in the U.K. that makes very specialty prescriptions. We have some businesses that distribute to Rx in Mexico. So we have parts of our business that our Rx is certainly much smaller than our core U.S. business. And so we will look at how that fits, does it fit internationally, does it fit globally into our structure. Clearly, in the U.S., it has a lot of advantages. Again, our whole infrastructure is geared around both of those and it provides a pipeline for us to continue to feed our OTC marketplace, OTC engine. So all of that is very good. I think the last kind of part of it is Tysabri. Again, I do see it as a financial asset. I think we will continue to look at it and figure out what is the best way to utilize that asset. Does it add cash to fund other things? Is it liquidating parts of it and you'd want me to do other things with. We will continue to evaluate the best use of that Tysabri asset."

As we step back and the thing that you have in Consumer Healthcare is you do have ebbs and flows, we had Johnson & Johnson was out of the market with certain products and they came back. And so you certainly have ebbs and flows that are bigger shifts to the market. But when I step back big picture wise and say what's expected, the dynamics in the industry in my mind still remain unchanged. As innovators launch the products, we're in a great position to capitalize on that. The macroeconomic trends of people getting older, needing more healthcare, cost going up despite our ability or desire to control them more, continue to drive people towards retail brands. And frankly, when they try them, they recognize the quality there. And so that allows the share to grow and my belief is it will continue to allow the share to drive upward. I'd hate to speculate right now without again going through a long range plan team with exactly what percentages it will go. I foresee continued share growth.

So as I kind of add up all the parts, there is some base growth from our business that continues to allow that Consumer Healthcare business to grow. Switches are certainly game changing or category changing, depending on what kind of switch it is. We continue to see switches as a big part of the growth to that over-the-counter market when you look out over the next few years. And as different categories have talked about derm or others that switch, those open bigger opportunities. Going back ways, not to get too -- back too far, but when you look at non-sedating antihistamines, it's probably one of the clear categories used to either go to the over-the-counter and get something that would put you to sleep when you had your allergies or you went through a doctor we got a prescription. Now as that -- as those products switch all over-the-counter, the amount of opportunities that, that has created in the over-the-counter space is great. So we see that continuing for categories. And frankly, the regulatory agency, the government wanting to try and drive safe healthcare to be more affordable. And so all of those we think, work in the favor of that. Related to additional kind of add-ins, we certainly are a big part of the business but there are still other segments, other areas that would fit well within our overall system, overall structure, adding more items to the truck that are pharmaceutically oriented that we continue to look at. And not all of them will make sense for us, but we continue to make sure that we have the sort of optimal portfolio to bring that value to our retailers and then ultimately, to consumers. So I think there's still those laps that Jeff and his team are continuing to look at to see how we add those in. Thank you. Thanks, Derek.

I have been a member of Perrigo's Board of Directors since 2003 and have had the privilege to serve on both the Audit and Remunerations Committees. During my tenure on the Board, I've come to deeply appreciate the strength of this company and its management as well as our ability to grow and deliver value while effectively addressing challenges.
I'd like to take this opportunity today to talk with you about our CEO transition process. As previously announced, following our robust succession planning process, on April 25, the Board of Directors unanimously selected John Hendrickson as Chief Executive Officer. Speaking on behalf of the entire Board, I can assure you that the choice to elevate John was clear. John has been essential to the company's success in each of his roles with Perrigo. 
John led and shaped the operational backbone of the organization, designing a vast and multifaceted infrastructure to produce and supply a broad and complex portfolio of products. He showed distinctive leadership as Head of our Consumer Healthcare business from 2003 to 2007. During that challenging period, when we were grappling with the movement of pseudoephedrine, which was the largest product in our OTC portfolio at the time, to behind the counter, John led the team to increased revenues. All functions reported to him, including R&D, regulatory, sales, marketing and operations.
Since 2007, John had served as EVP and Head of Global Supply Chain until his promotion to President last year. His manufacturing and supply chain leadership, exceptional operational track record and ability to connect with and get the most out of his people give us great confidence in our decision to promote John to President as well as our recent decision to appoint him to CEO. In John, we identified a leader who knows the business, is committed to our mission and can make the choices necessary to deliver value to our shareholders. 
The Board recognizes, of course, that the success of Perrigo does not start or stop with one person. John is supported by a talented, experienced team, and the Board has full confidence in the team's ability to work effectively with John to execute and deliver shareholder value.
Finally, I want to underscore my remarks by highlighting our commitment to corporate governance and transparency. To enhance independent decision-making at the board level and to align our structure with what we believe is appropriate for the company at this time, the Board has chosen to separate the roles of CEO and Chairman of the Board. Our commitment to shareholders will remain, as it always has, essential to our decision-making process going forward.
And now I'd like to turn the call over to John."

I want to start by saying how honored and privileged I am to be CEO of this great organization and lead our more than 13,000 talented employees. During my ti",1658,"Thank you, Laurie, and welcome again, everybody, to Perrigo's First Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. I want to start by saying how honored and privileged I am to be CEO of this great organization and lead our more than 13,000 talented employees. 
During my time at Perrigo, I have served in a variety of different capacities, as Laurie outlined, and I'm acutely aware of what this great business has to offer customers, consumers and our shareholders. I will say it unequivocally, at its core, Perrigo is a truly diversified, unique business, transcending generic prescription products with a resilient OTC base. I believe there's a long runway for growth ahead of us, and I am confident we have the right cohesive management team in place to focus on the execution that is required to deliver clear value to our shareholders. That said, I know that meeting or exceeding expectations is the foundation for establishing your trust. This will be my personal focus and the focus of the management team going forward.
Turning to Slide 6. Our recent track record of performance against our own expectations is unacceptable. I understand that. Our team understands that. My focus and that of my team will be on operational discipline in generating consistent results. I am confident we will deliver, given our opportunities for growth, the power of our platform and our deep long-standing relationships with our customers. We will deliver our results.
Now let me highlight the key components of my overarching leadership principles for our business. First, as I said, our operational execution is the cornerstone of our success. Developing, marketing, purchasing, manufacturing, distributing a broad, complex array of customized products have always been our strengths. Quality continues to be the driving force behind our organization, and we have the infrastructure and quality track record to consistently move our products onto shelves for our customers and into the homes of our consumers.
Second, I'm action-oriented. I've already made critical decisions in a number of our businesses. I will continue to take appropriate steps to capitalize on opportunities and effectively address our challenges.
Third, I felt it important to share my guidance philosophy, which we addressed -- which we'll address in more detail soon. I'm unequivocally committed to transparency, and will be actively engaged with and listening to you, your questions and comments. That's how I've always worked with our customers, suppliers, employees and shareholders.
Finally, our goal is to ultimately create value for the shareholders, the owners of our company. To that end, my primary focus at this time is on our core operating and organic growth vehicles. As always, we will continue to evaluate ways to refine and enhance our portfolio of products to customers and consumers. We will continue to look at synergistic bolt-on acquisitions that fit strategically within our core infrastructure, and we will continue to evaluate methods of returning capital to our shareholder base.
Now I'd look -- like to give you my insight into the Perrigo Advantage and my perspective on each of our business segments. Looking at Slide 7. Our Consumer Healthcare platform is core to Perrigo. We have a strong and durable position with numerous products, dosage forms and capabilities. Our U.S. consumer business includes more OTC abbreviated new drug applications than any other manufacturer, even including the large branded pharmaceutical companies that you all know. This ability to bring new products to market will continue to drive growth in our CHC segment. 
In addition, we have one of the broadest store brand OTC supply chains in the world. That means the first raw materials being procured through manufacturing, all the way through logistics and distribution, ultimately out to our customers. One truckload of product leaves a Perrigo distribution center every 30 minutes, 24/7, 365 days a year to go to our customers, to ultimately go to our consumers. We are the company retailers look to as their partner of choice. We are the company retailers look to, to drive value for their consumers and ultimately, their shareholders. 
This segment continues to be led by Jeff Needham. Jeff is an industry innovator with over 30 years of experience. The deep customer relationships we have help ensure we continue to be a valued partner in this consumer space.
Next, turning to our Branded Consumer Healthcare division. Despite some challenges, my view of this business segment is one of optimism about the power of the platform that it provides us. Perrigo is now able to distribute products to an additional 32 countries globally, reaching greater than 300,000 pharmacists and retailers in these countries. The European OTC market represents $30 billion a year in sales.
Since the beginning of this calendar year, I have worked with the country leaders in the executive team in our Branded Consumer Healthcare division to develop a deeper understanding of the day-to-day operations of the business. We are now fully and effectively integrating BCH into our existing leadership structure. We are building upon the team's core sales and marketing strengths, implementing our own strong operational controls and structures.
As CEO, I have made a number of additional changes to the BCH business, such as coming to mutual agreement with Marc Coucke that he would resign and appointing Sharon Kochan as Head of the BCH business. Sharon's background, disciplined approach and ability to drive organizations to peak performance made the decision to appoint him to lead the BCH team a clear one. Sharon was the architect of our Rx business, which he built from the ground up with a superb executional track record. The track record includes the acquisition and integration of various bolt-on products and businesses during his tenure. 
At the current -- as the current Head of our International Business, Sharon has also overseen diverse markets, including both branded and store brand offerings in multiple geographies such as Mexico and the U.K. I am confident that the growth, execution and financial accountability of the segment will be enhanced under Sharon's leadership. 
In addition to personnel changes, Sharon and I are providing our strong BCH leaders with increasing responsibilities to lead new geographies, prioritize our portfolio and divest underperforming assets. We are also emphasizing new and innovative products, such as our nicotine replacement therapy franchise acquired from GSK last summer. Our leaders are now aligned with a strategy to continue focusing on our top 20 brands to ensure growth of this strong portfolio. And to be clear, today, these top 20 products continue to grow at a faster pace than the markets that they are in.
These changes are in conjunction with the important decisions Judy has made in the finance organization. She has enhanced financial management, and we are actively in the process of putting BCH's sales forecasting, inventory control and operations planning onto Perrigo's existing platform and upgrading the financial planning and analysts to support these activities and drive growth. Again, I want to reiterate that the top 20 brands that we have in the business today continue to grow faster than the markets. We have a supply chain and a platform to support pan-European growth, and we can add products that further leverage this business.
Turning now to our Rx business. Our prescription business is an important part of our diversified consolidated portfolio. Our Rx business has a clear, strategic rationale as part of our broad, diversified portfolio and is a great complement to our core consumer competencies. Products, plants, procurement, technology distribution are all highly synergistic with our OTC business, and this business represents a potential feeder pipeline for product conversions from Rx to OTC. 
For example, take our topical acne category within the Rx portfolio. When a category like this begins to switch, we are in a prime position to capitalize on this opportunity. A switch provides a dermatology pipeline and allows us to benefit from 2 life cycles for a single pharmaceutical product. We also have a strong pipeline in our Rx business. While these new products tend to be more technically challenging with longer regulatory approval time frames, they do potentially create a higher barrier to entry, allowing for a longer, more enduring product life-span.
As all of you know, pricing pressures and, ultimately, deflation have been a major topic across the industry. Our Rx team has done a great job over the past years of managing through this. However, we are not immune to this dynamic, and ultimately, increased competition and greater-than-expected price erosion hurt our performance in Q1 and resulted in a lowering of our expectations for the year. Doug Boothe, our EVP and General Manager of the Rx business, has been with Perrigo since 2013, leading the business to exceptional growth. Doug has been in the industry and seen various cycles in the prescription pharmaceutical business and is the right person to guide the business in this market. 
Finally, Specialty Sciences and Tysabri. From my perspective, Tysabri is a valuable financial asset, which contributes meaningfully to our financial flexibility and enables us to capitalize on opportunities.
Now I'd like to hand the call over to Judy. But before I do so, I'd like to first congratulate Judy and our company on her newly expanded role announced this morning. As part of my strategy to take actions that will deliver enhanced value for our company and for our shareholders, you as owners, Judy Brown will take on an expanded role as Executive Vice President, Business Operations and Chief Financial Officer. In this role, Judy will have leadership of our global product portfolio and global shared service platform, complementing her current responsibilities for corporate development, finance, strategy and communications. Leveraging her experience in leading multinational financing and product development organizations, both at Perrigo and at Whirlpool, Judy will now lead the expansion of our existing portfolio and pipeline products across all business segments and geographies while optimizing our business services.  So thank you, Judy. 
I will now turn the call over to Judy. Judy Brown."

You can see on Slide 9 that GAAP net loss for the quarter was $133.1 million compared to a net loss of $95 million in the prior year. Let me explain the primary differences between our GAAP results and adjusted earnings.Our long-standing p",1850,"So diving in. You can see on Slide 9 that GAAP net loss for the quarter was $133.1 million compared to a net loss of $95 million in the prior year. Let me explain the primary differences between our GAAP results and adjusted earnings.
Our long-standing philosophy is to adjust GAAP EPS to help you better understand our underlying operations. These adjustments include such items as acquisition-related matters, such as noncash acquisition-related amortization expenses, restructuring charges and related tax effects and those items outlined in Tables 1 and 2 in today's press release. You will notice that, as described on February 18, we are also removing our Vitamins, Minerals and Supplements operating results from our adjusted earnings in 2016 as the business is currently held for sale. A full reconciliation can be viewed in Tables 1 and 2 in our press release. There are 2 specific large noncash impairment charges here related to Branded Consumer Healthcare, which I will also talk about in a moment when we get to the segment details. 
So as you can see now on Slide 10, Perrigo delivered consolidated first quarter adjusted net sales growth of 33% year-over-year on a constant-currency basis, excluding contributions from the VMS business for both 2016 and 2015. As noted on our fourth quarter 2015 earnings call, please exclude approximately $40 million of contributions each quarter in your models for 2015 related to this business. During the first quarter, we experienced a confluence of events which has impacted quarter results to a magnitude we could not have anticipated at the beginning of the quarter and which have also impacted our guidance for the full year, as I'll discuss shortly. 
Net sales contributions from Branded Consumer Healthcare, which was not part of our business this time last year, was the primary driver of our year-over-year top line growth. Consolidated new product sales of $74 million, including $31 million in BCH new product sales, were partially offset by $39 million of discontinued products. First quarter consolidated adjusted gross margin was a March quarter record of 47.9%, highlighted by first quarter adjusted gross profit margins in our Consumer Healthcare segment of 33.8%, with first quarter consolidated adjusted operating margin of 25.1%.
So walking through the segments, starting with CHC on Slide 11. In the quarter, adjusted net sales, excluding VMS, grew 2% on a constant-currency basis, driven by continued momentum in store brand infant formula and continued strength in our NRT franchise. I'm pleased to note that Perrigo's supplied infant formula market share has grown to 13.9%, according to IRI data, which is a record for the Consumer Healthcare team. These gains were partially offset by decreases in the analgesic and cough/cold categories following an extremely mild cough/cold season and the absence of the guaifenesin 600-milligram ER products as compared to last year. 
As previously discussed, this is the last quarter where our infant formula label refresh will have a negative year-over-year impact. This conversion accounted for the majority of the abnormally high discontinued product number of $32 million embedded in these results. New product sales in the quarter were $31 million. Remember, we anticipated our new product launches in this segment to be weighted more heavily to the second half of the calendar year.
On Slide 12, you can see that BCH posted net sales of $318 million, with new products contributing $31 million, and our acquired GSK portfolio and Yokebe brand contributing another $37 million to this total. The BCH segment revenues were organically flat compared to the prior year, with growth in our top 20 brands primarily in the cough/cold and allergy category despite a soft season in Europe, which was offset by lower OTC sales in certain markets.
In the quarter, BCH fell considerably short of our top line expectations. Despite soft line -- soft top line results, as previewed in February, we continued to make significant investments in advertising and promotion in this quarter, equal to approximately 18.6% of net sales. These effects were the primary drivers of adjusted operating income as a percent of sales of only approximately 8%. 
The net sales miss in the quarter combined with a change in forecasted net sales and adjusted operating income for the remainder of the year were the basis for the change in guidance for this segment as well as triggering an initial indicator of impairment. This started a process to update our long-range segment plans to evaluate asset carrying values. The change in fair value from previous estimates was due primarily to the changes in the current market and performance of the brands, such that the evaluation of the brand prioritization and product extensions or launches in new regions are being more focused to maximize the potential of the whole basket of brands in the segment portfolio.
The result, as outlined in our press release this morning, is that we realized a pretax noncash impairment charge of approximately $467 million related to intangible assets acquired in conjunction with the Omega acquisition, $273 million related to indefinite lived intangible assets and the remaining $194 million related to goodwill. This is clearly a disappointment, but steps are being taken to correct the underperformance in BCH, including changes in leadership, as John has outlined. While many steps have already been taken, it is important to note that it will take time to fully realize the true value of the actions we are taking. 
On Slide 13, Rx net sales increased 2%, which came in below our expectations. We experienced negative organic growth within the segment resulting from several factors, so let me explain. The change in the competitive landscape was much more disruptive to our plan than had been anticipated and impacted our overall pricing strategies for the segment. During the quarter, we experienced 24 competitive launches against our portfolio, producing sharp price erosion in a number of topical products we sell. These factors, combined with continued pricing pressure due to the consolidation of the large buying cooperative groups and the absence of significant new products in the quarter further impacted our ability to execute on our planned pricing strategy. Despite all of this, however, the team was able to maintain its extended topicals leadership position in the quarter. These pricing pressures impacted both the adjusted gross and operating margins, accounting for the decline you see here year-over-year.
Turning to Slide 14. Specialty Science net sales were $88 million in the quarter, up 9% on a constant-currency basis.
Before I turn to the forecast, I'll make a quick comment on the balance sheet. As of April 2, 2016, total cash on the balance sheet was $589 million and total debt was approximately $6.5 billion. The increase in debt from December 31 reflects the financing of the tretinoin acquisition in January and the subsequent $1.2 billion senior notes issuance we did in early March to term out our short-term debt. As we have stated in the past, we are fully committed to our investment-grade ratings and delevering our balance sheet through EBITDA growth and debt repayments. 
Cash flow from operations in the quarter was $170 million, which included onetime unfavorable reduction in accounts payable of an estimated $67 million in Branded Consumer Healthcare related to the normalization of their accounts payable terms. As a reminder, we intend to fund our previously announced share repurchase program, which runs out until late calendar 2018, through operating cash flow. To the extent the use of those cash flows for share repurchases would impede our deleveraging goals or any tuck-in acquisitions, we would slow or suspend the program for a period of time. Quarterly, given the cash generated and our commitment to delever, we will evaluate cash available for M&A and/or share repos. 
So let's move on now to 2016 guidance. On April 25, we provided preliminary guidance without much detail. So let me walk you through more information by segment on Slide 16, starting with CHC. We expect Consumer Healthcare net sales for 2016 to be approximately $2.65 billion. The segment has been updated primarily for the exclusion of the guaifenesin 600-milligram ER product relaunch; delay in new product launches, which include a risk-adjusted launch of the store brand version of Flonase in the second half of the year; and some adjustments for recent customer negotiations. While the team continues to work on relaunching the guaifenesin 600-milligram ER product, we believe it makes sense to remove it here from our financial forecast. We anticipate CHC adjusted operating margin to be relatively flat year-over-year.
Next, we expect BCH net sales for 2016 to be approximately $1.4 billion. To help you through your modeling, let me give you some color on our expectations for the adjusted operating margin in the segment. 2015 adjusted operating margin for the segment was 15.8% for the 9 months ended December. Our updated guidance assumes that adjusted operating margin will be approximately 200 basis points lower in 2016 due to the many organizational and portfolio changes we have discussed this morning, coupled with continued investment in A&P in our top 20 brands.
Rx. We expect Rx net sales for 2016 to be approximately $1.2 billion. Within Rx, we assume price erosion of approximately 6% for the remainder of the calendar year and now assume the launch of the generic version of ProAir in 2017. Our guidance reflects the expectation that the adjusted operating margin will be in the high 40% ranges for the year.
All of this leads to our updated consolidated guidance perspective on Slide 17. We now expect revenue between $5.6 billion and $5.9 billion, which assumes greater than $300 million in new product launches across all segments for the year, adjusted to reflect the new product delays we've already discussed.
Given the new jurisdictional mix of income expected across segments, particularly with the new products slated for launch in the second half of the year, we are updating the full year adjusted effective tax rate guidance to be approximately 15% for 2016. Given the fact that this quarter's tax rate was 11.4%, you should model a tax rate of approximately 16% to 17% on a quarterly basis for the rest of the year.
Summing all of this up to the consolidated P&L, we continue to expect 2016 adjusted earnings per diluted share to be in a range between $8.20 and $8.60. As previously noted, we continue to expect approximately 55% of our adjusted diluted EPS to materialize in the second half of the calendar year, due primarily to timing of expected new product launches.
Lastly, a few comments on operating cash flow guidance for the year. We expect the performance of our business to deliver full year operating cash flow of approximately $1 billion, which includes the onetime unfavorable $67 million BCH-related normalization effects I mentioned a few moments ago. This represents an operating cash flow conversion approaching 90%, to the midpoint of our adjusted net income earnings guidance. This business model continues to drive strong cash flows and illustrates the ability of our platform to generate quality net income performance.
I'll now hand the call back to John."

I also want to reiterate my leadership principles that I talked about upfront, which, at the core, are focused on execution designed to drive shareholder value. First, as I said earlier, my foremost priority is operational execution. We have a great business, and operational excellence is the foundation which all of our successes are built.  This is who we are. 
Our platform is designed to add products and technologies that foster our growth. High quality and affordability for our consumer is paramount.

Fourth and finally, everything I and the management team do is directed to delivering value to Perrigo's shareholders, and we will continue to deploy capital prudently and appropriately to that end.
I'd like to close by reiterating my confidence in the strength of the Perrigo business. We have a solid foundation to build on. We have an experienced management team. We have a deep pipeline of new products. We continue to refine and improve our operating model across all of our segments of business to drive returns. Our global platform gives us a springboard for growth, and we are all fixated on leveraging our core advantages to deliver shareholder value. 
And I would be remiss if I didn't thank our more than 13,000 employees around the world for their hard work in building Perrigo into the business it is today.

And sorry to look backwards, but can you talk us through how the Board handled the Mylan situation and assure investors that all options were fully explored? And then for John, the issues that have weighed on Perrigo in recent times seem to be a blend of expectation setting, execution as well as strategic decisions that have been made in the past. So my question for you is, what changes do you plan to make? It seems like setting expectations, at least on paper, should be the easiest part of that. But perhaps you can talk about specific changes to the execution model or -- and whether or not you agree with the strategic sort of platform. It sounds like you believe the platform is intact and correct, and it's about execution. But would really like you to express whether you sort of agree with all the pieces at Perrigo and whether they're all core, et cetera."

So we saw, I'll call it, some softness, starting in January, and beginning to accelerate as these competitive launches, I quoted 24 competitors launched against our products in Q1. And that, in and of itself, changed the pricing dynamics for our team versus their expectations. And so as you look at the net -- sorry, [indiscernible] of the quarter. So as we look pragmatically at the rest of the year, we had to say what is a reasonable assumption based on the competitive landscape as it faces us right now? It's things I called out, with the increased buying pressure across the cooperative large groups, which everyone in the industry is seeing to some extent right now, building that into our expectations, updating our forecast to reflect specific contractual agreements now in place for the rest of the year, evaluating the pricing strategies that we had in place for the last 3 quarters of the year and making sure that those are updated to reflect the new reality for the remainder of 2016 and making sure though that in our numbers and on our bottom line that we're still making the right investments in R&D. So not skimping in R&D with -- entirely with the situation in the market, but making sure that we still made a net contribution to the long-term growth of the portfolio. So that's the evolution of the pricing update. We said 6% for the remainder of the year. I think the team feels that, that's a reasonable approach to pricing, where they've evaluated and tried to take in the known knowns as well as a little bit of wiggle room for the unknowns. And going forward, still looking at adjusted operating margin for the segment in the high 40s, op -- adjusted operating margins for the full year."

We frequently talked about our overall basket of Consumer Healthcare products being able to maintain stable pricing. And that continues to be the case but I've always said very clearly that in periods of time when we're not launching big new products, that dynamic becomes more challenging for our Consumer Healthcare team, and they do a yeoman's job out in the field every day, sitting with the buyers at important, large, sophisticated retailers, talking about overall pricing. So we don't have the ability, of course, to set pricing to the consumers on the shelf, that's the determination by the retailers. But we work actively on being effective in our own buying, having an effective supply chain to mitigate any pricing pressures seen for the Consumer Healthcare team and, of course, when we launch new products, it gives leverage to the entire basket of sales that the team goes out and speaks with the retailers about. So the phrase used in my prepared remarks is directly linked, of course, to the dynamics of no big, very visible, large products launched this quarter in the OTC basket. We're going to have some very attractive ones coming up just very soon, but that's part of the yin and yang. And so as the team sits down, they say very clearly, get  me my new product launches because it helps the whole basket of goods have better stickiness long term in pricing."

As I go through, again, and think about priority, and I lay these out trying to mentally get these clear, I think organic growth, a great way to do it, great platform, makes sense. I believe in Europe, we have a good platform. We're trying to put more operating structure into it, take a little bit about the operating entrepreneurship out of it and bring some structures into it, but it is a good platform. The GSK products that we bought a few months back are performing well in those markets. The nicotine franchise, one of the biggest nicotine franchises, nicotine replacement therapy franchise in the U.S., and now having that in Europe, a great natural extension for our core consumer businesses. So I do believe that adding on core bolt-on acquisitions within the infrastructures can have a good return for shareholder value. So I'm a believer in that. And then ultimately, what else do we do with the cash and the value that we're generating, are there other ways of returning that value to shareholders.

We also added one of our experienced financial leaders to that business about 2 months ago. He has already begun a much stronger financial planning, financial control acumen to the BCH team. So I feel good about that. Do I think that you could add a brand across every European country just like you do in the U.S? No. Each of our brands are more specialized within regions there. It might be the Nordics or it might be down in the Baltic areas, but they're all more regionalized. I believe that even within those regions, one of the advantages that Omega has in our Branded Consumer Healthcare division is they have the ability to launch products within region segments and make them profitable. So when I say bolt-ons, it may not be just one pan-European brand. It may be brands that are much more regional, but we can add to that infrastructure and grow. So I do have confidence in that. I have confidence in our ability to continue to provide growth onto that platform. I think the integration, we're going to continue. They have a great sales marketing drive footprint. The way the work with each country, whether it's a pharmacy driven country, whether it's a -- more like the U.K., which tends to be more like the U.S. from a retailer distribution. No matter what, they've got a good infrastructure there, and they've been able to show strong leadership. And so I've got a lot of confidence in the business drivers there, et cetera. I think we need the operational backbone, the financial backbone that Perrigo brings to solidify that overall structure. 
Related to sort of the Mylan Stada business, Stada is a generic company that we distribute for in Belgium, as you might recall. During all the Mylan discussions, et cetera, there were some strained relationships there, with Stada holding off some distribution, et cetera. We are basically through that. We are continuing to operate with Stada and  distribute their products in Belgium. We are talking with them about what the go-forward relationship might be or might not be, but we still have a time period of a couple years for that relationship. So that's where it's at as today. We're meeting all of them."

Maybe let me just give everyone a little bit of color to the extent you had questions on the impairments discussed. The intangible assets that are recorded in the indefinite live intangible asset basket that is recorded on our balance sheet is a composition of the branded portfolio of Omega at the time of acquisition. So within each of the major categories are several brands. As the year has progressed in 2015 and into 2016, we also did additional acquisitions. We did a GSK portfolio, we launched the Yokebe product line, which has proven to be a very successful lifestyle health product that is performing very well in the portfolio and capturing a lot of market share. As we moved then strategically as a team, the team looked at the offerings of products and are moving away from XL-S, which was in the original acquisition basket, and moving toward Yokebe, that triggered the requirement to lower the carrying value of those particular assets on the balance sheet. So one can look at the impairment as a negative. We are writing down certain assets that were acquired from this acquisition. But in the same time, we're also investing in other brands in the portfolio for future growth. So that's part of this composition of John talking -- he made several comments about re-analyzing the portfolio, reprioritizing that portfolio for growth. Part of that prioritization process actually is what triggered the discussion around the impairment. So it's moving from plan A to plan B in triggering that impairment, that noncash charge. In looking at the remainder of the year, all of that kind of comes together. So the guidance was updated to reflect certain changes in that portfolio, some up, some down, lowering the overall guidance across certain categories to make some adjustments primarily with the focus on new products. So some expectations of timing changes on those and how we reprioritized the top 20 brands are what were the drivers for this year's guidance. And we didn't get specific on which categories got changed in guidance, but suffice it to say it's really about pulling different levers within the overall top 20 brand basket."

And do you have the right composition of assets there? And then in terms of Omega, just longer term, it's always been characterized as a 5% to 10% growing business. And also, the strategic rationale was to really be less of an operating synergy play but more of a revenue synergy play. And so does that still stand? Do you still have a lot of opportunities for revenue synergies in the longer term 2 to 3 years out?"

All right. Let me just start off. Just briefly, I want to make one point on the Rx front. Because the Rx quarter performed so much differently than our expectations because of the items I've already mentioned and in taking a pragmatic view for the rest of the year, we lowered our guidance. We're calling out the reasons therefor. But I just want to point out to everyone, sort of stating the obvious, is we saw flow through in these pricing dynamics at the top line, which rolled through in dollar terms through to the bottom line versus our expectation and the impact for the full year. But please note, the adjusted margins are still very strong. So the team's still leadership position in the space, the products that we put to market are still stickier in relative terms than the average generic. And you can see that through both this quarter, while the quarter year-over-year is in fact down, not arguing that point, those are still very attractive operating margins with continued investment in R&D. So I just what wanted to point that part out because it's really about relative dynamics but still attractive portfolio, and we believe that we built in an update to the new landscape and still are looking at very attractive margins."

And again, my commitment is to come back to you and others in the summer here with our long-range growth plan related to Omega. When you think about the synergistic side that we have with the Branded Consumer Healthcare business, they are still there. The operating side synergies, the team's still driving hard to try and deliver, driving those to the bottom line. The revenue synergies, in my mind, are still there. They take, and even in our model, longer to get to because you have multiple registrations, multiple -- how do you advertise and promote different things, multiple regulations within different countries, even in the U.S. So in my perspective, they are still there from a long-term plan standpoint, but just take longer to get to those ultimate revenue synergies. By putting Judy in her new role, one of her great opportunities will be taking the products that we have in different divisions and figuring out how do we leverage those across our global business portfolio.

So I'm very open to looking at that and open to listening to other ways of thinking about it. Big picture, we're going to step back. There are certain parts of our business that are very synergistic together, and even though they seem like separate segments, do add value to each other.

And is this a one-time rebasing or do we worry about those margins eventually coming back down to where Teva's and Mylan's are? Or how do you think about that business strategically? And then just my follow-up question on Tysabri, you've talked about that the not being core, that's a financial asset. Isn't it, though, the longer you wait, the less it's worth just given that competition is coming next year?"

I'll try and -- I think I made good notes here, but will do my best to try and do those. Let me start back and kind of on our generic business, kind of go back to the big picture. It definitely is a business focused",552,"Wow. There was a lot of them in there. I'll try and -- I think I made good notes here, but will do my best to try and do those. Let me start back and kind of on our generic business, kind of go back to the big picture. It definitely is a business focused on extended topicals. So it's not just derm, it's ophthalmics, it's women's health, but it's extended topical kind of products. Those that usually require clinics, broader types of approvals to get in there. They usually are not billion-dollar blockbusters, they usually are much more -- the brands, they usually are much more $100 million products, et cetera. And so you usually don't have 57 competitors going after that like you might with a 800-milligram ibuprofen or something of that nature. So it is still a space, we are a relatively big Rx player. I mean, we're certainly in the top 10, not just within the extended topicals but in general, when you look at the U.S. generics space. I think it hit -- as we look back and understand how it hit, there certainly were some approvals, there's some buying power, all of those things that hit us faster than we expected and we had to address. I think the others had been -- it hit them earlier because of their broad portfolio. They had a number of products that certainly were targeted in that -- in the initial barrage, if you will. So I do think we're in a unique time. We have a good product pipeline, and we expect to continue to get those approvals and continue to be able to balance out the ups and downs of our product mix and portfolio, given we're going to continue to see constant price pressure on our older products. We've always seen that. It's just that escalated here in the last quarter with the approvals. So when you look globally, I think that's a great question, one I think we'll contemplate here over the next couple of months as we look through the long-term strategy of our Rx business. We certainly, as we get to other countries, have Rx businesses. They're not nearly as big. We do an Rx business in the U.K. that makes a very specialty prescription. We have some businesses that distribute through Rx in Mexico. So we have parts of our business that our Rx is certainly much smaller than our core U.S. business. And so we will look at how that fits, does it fit internationally, does it fit globally into our structure. Clearly, in the U.S., it has a lot of advantages. Again, our whole infrastructure is geared around both of those, and it provides a pipeline for us to continue to feed our OTC marketplace and OTC engine. So all of that is very good. I think the last kind of part of it is Tysabri. Again, I do see it as a financial asset. I think we will continue to look at it and figure out what is the best way to utilize that asset. Is it as cash to fund other things? Is it liquidating parts of it to use money to do other things with? We will continue to evaluate the best use of that Tysabri asset."

But when I step back big picture wise and say what's expected, the dynamics in the industry in my mind still remain unchanged. As innovators launch the products, we're in a great position to capitalize on that. The macroeconomic trends of people getting older, needing more healthcare, costs going up despite our ability or our desire to control them more, continue to drive people towards retail brands. And frankly, when they try them, they recognize the quality there. And so that allows the share to grow, and my belief is it will continue to allow the share to drive upward. I'd hate to speculate right now without, again, going to our long range planning team with exactly what percentages it will go. I foresee continued share growth.

So as I kind of add up all the parts, there is some base growth from our business that continues to allow that Consumer Healthcare business to grow. Switches are certainly game changing or category changing, depending on which kind of switch it is. We continue to see switches as a big part of the growth of that over-the-counter market when you look out over the next few years. And as different categories, we've talked about derm or others that switch, those open bigger opportunities. Going back a ways, not to get too -- back too far, but when you look at non-sedating antihistamines, it's probably one of the clear categories, you used to either go to the over-the-counter and get something that would put you to sleep when you had your allergies or you went to a doctor and got a prescription. Now as that -- as those products switched all over-the-counter, the amount of opportunities that, that has created in the over-the-counter space is great. So we see that continuing for categories. And frankly, the regulatory agencies and government wanting to try and drive safe healthcare to be more affordable. And so all of those we think, work in the favor of that. Related to additional kind of add-ins, they certainly are a big part of the business but there are still other segments, other areas that would fit well within our overall system, overall structure, adding more items to the truck that are pharmaceutically oriented that we continue to look at. And not all of them will make sense for us, but we continue to make sure that we have the sort of optimal portfolio to bring that value to our retailers and then ultimately to consumers. So I think there's still those left that Jeff and his team are continuing to look at to see how we add those in. Thank you. Thanks, Derek.

I have been a member of Perrigo's Board of Directors since 2003 and have had the privilege to serve on both the Audit and Remunerations Committees. During my tenure on the Board, I've come to deeply appreciate the strength of this company and its management as well as our ability to grow and deliver value while effectively addressing challenges.
I'd like to take this opportunity today to talk with you about our CEO transition process. As previously announced, following our robust succession planning process, on April 25, the Board of Directors unanimously selected John Hendrickson as Chief Executive Officer. Speaking on behalf of the entire Board, I can assure you that the choice to elevate John was clear. John has been essential to the company's success in each of his roles with Perrigo. 
John led and shaped the operational backbone of the organization, designing a vast and multifaceted infrastructure to produce and supply a broad and complex portfolio of products. He showed distinctive leadership as Head of our Consumer Healthcare business from 2003 to 2007. During that challenging period, when we were grappling with the movement of pseudoephedrine, which was the largest product in our OTC portfolio at the time, to behind the counter, John led the team to increased revenues. All functions reported to him, including R&D, regulatory, sales, marketing and operations.
Since 2007, John had served as EVP and Head of Global Supply Chain until his promotion to President last year. His manufacturing and supply chain leadership, exceptional operational track record and ability to connect with and get the most out of his people give us great confidence in our decision to promote John to President as well as our recent decision to appoint him to CEO. In John, we identified a leader who knows the business, is committed to our mission and can make the choices necessary to deliver value to our shareholders. 
The Board recognizes, of course, that the success of Perrigo does not start or stop with one person. John is supported by a talented, experienced team, and the Board has full confidence in the team's ability to work effectively with John to execute and deliver shareholder value.
Finally, I want to underscore my remarks by highlighting our commitment to corporate governance and transparency. To enhance independent decision-making at the board level and to align our structure with what we believe is appropriate for the company at this time, the Board has chosen to separate the roles of CEO and Chairman of the Board. Our commitment to shareholders will remain, as it always has, essential to our decision-making process going forward.
And now I'd like to turn the call over to John."

During my ti",1658,"Thank you, Laurie, and welcome again, everybody, to Perrigo's First Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. I want to start by saying how honored and privileged I am to be CEO of this great organization and lead our more than 13,000 talented employees. 
During my time at Perrigo, I have served in a variety of different capacities, as Laurie outlined, and I'm acutely aware of what this great business has to offer customers, consumers and our shareholders. I will say it unequivocally, at its core, Perrigo is a truly diversified, unique business, transcending generic prescription products with a resilient OTC base. I believe there's a long runway for growth ahead of us, and I am confident we have the right cohesive management team in place to focus on the execution that is required to deliver clear value to our shareholders. That said, I know that meeting or exceeding expectations is the foundation for establishing your trust. This will be my personal focus and the focus of the management team going forward.
Turning to Slide 6. Our recent track record of performance against our own expectations is unacceptable. I understand that. Our team understands that. My focus and that of my team will be on operational discipline in generating consistent results. I am confident we will deliver, given our opportunities for growth, the power of our platform and our deep long-standing relationships with our customers. We will deliver our results.
Now let me highlight the key components of my overarching leadership principles for our business. First, as I said, our operational execution is the cornerstone of our success. Developing, marketing, purchasing, manufacturing, distributing a broad, complex array of customized products have always been our strengths. Quality continues to be the driving force behind our organization, and we have the infrastructure and quality track record to consistently move our products onto shelves for our customers and into the homes of our consumers.
Second, I'm action-oriented. I've already made critical decisions in a number of our businesses. I will continue to take appropriate steps to capitalize on opportunities and effectively address our challenges.
Third, I felt it important to share my guidance philosophy, which we addressed -- which we'll address in more detail soon. I'm unequivocally committed to transparency, and will be actively engaged with and listening to you, your questions and comments. That's how I've always worked with our customers, suppliers, employees and shareholders.
Finally, our goal is to ultimately create value for the shareholders, the owners of our company. To that end, my primary focus at this time is on our core operating and organic growth vehicles. As always, we will continue to evaluate ways to refine and enhance our portfolio of products to customers and consumers. We will continue to look at synergistic bolt-on acquisitions that fit strategically within our core infrastructure, and we will continue to evaluate methods of returning capital to our shareholder base.
Now I'd look -- like to give you my insight into the Perrigo Advantage and my perspective on each of our business segments. Looking at Slide 7. Our Consumer Healthcare platform is core to Perrigo. We have a strong and durable position with numerous products, dosage forms and capabilities. Our U.S. consumer business includes more OTC abbreviated new drug applications than any other manufacturer, even including the large branded pharmaceutical companies that you all know. This ability to bring new products to market will continue to drive growth in our CHC segment. 
In addition, we have one of the broadest store brand OTC supply chains in the world. That means the first raw materials being procured through manufacturing, all the way through logistics and distribution, ultimately out to our customers. One truckload of product leaves a Perrigo distribution center every 30 minutes, 24/7, 365 days a year to go to our customers, to ultimately go to our consumers. We are the company retailers look to as their partner of choice. We are the company retailers look to, to drive value for their consumers and ultimately, their shareholders. 
This segment continues to be led by Jeff Needham. Jeff is an industry innovator with over 30 years of experience. The deep customer relationships we have help ensure we continue to be a valued partner in this consumer space.
Next, turning to our Branded Consumer Healthcare division. Despite some challenges, my view of this business segment is one of optimism about the power of the platform that it provides us. Perrigo is now able to distribute products to an additional 32 countries globally, reaching greater than 300,000 pharmacists and retailers in these countries. The European OTC market represents $30 billion a year in sales.
Since the beginning of this calendar year, I have worked with the country leaders in the executive team in our Branded Consumer Healthcare division to develop a deeper understanding of the day-to-day operations of the business. We are now fully and effectively integrating BCH into our existing leadership structure. We are building upon the team's core sales and marketing strengths, implementing our own strong operational controls and structures.
As CEO, I have made a number of additional changes to the BCH business, such as coming to mutual agreement with Marc Coucke that he would resign and appointing Sharon Kochan as Head of the BCH business. Sharon's background, disciplined approach and ability to drive organizations to peak performance made the decision to appoint him to lead the BCH team a clear one. Sharon was the architect of our Rx business, which he built from the ground up with a superb executional track record. The track record includes the acquisition and integration of various bolt-on products and businesses during his tenure. 
At the current -- as the current Head of our International Business, Sharon has also overseen diverse markets, including both branded and store brand offerings in multiple geographies such as Mexico and the U.K. I am confident that the growth, execution and financial accountability of the segment will be enhanced under Sharon's leadership. 
In addition to personnel changes, Sharon and I are providing our strong BCH leaders with increasing responsibilities to lead new geographies, prioritize our portfolio and divest underperforming assets. We are also emphasizing new and innovative products, such as our nicotine replacement therapy franchise acquired from GSK last summer. Our leaders are now aligned with a strategy to continue focusing on our top 20 brands to ensure growth of this strong portfolio. And to be clear, today, these top 20 products continue to grow at a faster pace than the markets that they are in.
These changes are in conjunction with the important decisions Judy has made in the finance organization. She has enhanced financial management, and we are actively in the process of putting BCH's sales forecasting, inventory control and operations planning onto Perrigo's existing platform and upgrading the financial planning and analysts to support these activities and drive growth. Again, I want to reiterate that the top 20 brands that we have in the business today continue to grow faster than the markets. We have a supply chain and a platform to support pan-European growth, and we can add products that further leverage this business.
Turning now to our Rx business. Our prescription business is an important part of our diversified consolidated portfolio. Our Rx business has a clear, strategic rationale as part of our broad, diversified portfolio and is a great complement to our core consumer competencies. Products, plants, procurement, technology distribution are all highly synergistic with our OTC business, and this business represents a potential feeder pipeline for product conversions from Rx to OTC. 
For example, take our topical acne category within the Rx portfolio. When a category like this begins to switch, we are in a prime position to capitalize on this opportunity. A switch provides a dermatology pipeline and allows us to benefit from 2 life cycles for a single pharmaceutical product. We also have a strong pipeline in our Rx business. While these new products tend to be more technically challenging with longer regulatory approval time frames, they do potentially create a higher barrier to entry, allowing for a longer, more enduring product life-span.
As all of you know, pricing pressures and, ultimately, deflation have been a major topic across the industry. Our Rx team has done a great job over the past years of managing through this. However, we are not immune to this dynamic, and ultimately, increased competition and greater-than-expected price erosion hurt our performance in Q1 and resulted in a lowering of our expectations for the year. Doug Boothe, our EVP and General Manager of the Rx business, has been with Perrigo since 2013, leading the business to exceptional growth. Doug has been in the industry and seen various cycles in the prescription pharmaceutical business and is the right person to guide the business in this market. 
Finally, Specialty Sciences and Tysabri. From my perspective, Tysabri is a valuable financial asset, which contributes meaningfully to our financial flexibility and enables us to capitalize on opportunities.
Now I'd like to hand the call over to Judy. But before I do so, I'd like to first congratulate Judy and our company on her newly expanded role announced this morning. As part of my strategy to take actions that will deliver enhanced value for our company and for our shareholders, you as owners, Judy Brown will take on an expanded role as Executive Vice President, Business Operations and Chief Financial Officer. In this role, Judy will have leadership of our global product portfolio and global shared service platform, complementing her current responsibilities for corporate development, finance, strategy and communications. Leveraging her experience in leading multinational financing and product development organizations, both at Perrigo and at Whirlpool, Judy will now lead the expansion of our existing portfolio and pipeline products across all business segments and geographies while optimizing our business services.  So thank you, Judy. 
I will now turn the call over to Judy. Judy Brown."

You can see on Slide 9 that GAAP net loss for the quarter was $133.1 million compared to a net loss of $95 million in the prior year. Let me explain the primary differences between our GAAP results and adjusted earnings.Our long-standing p",1850,"So diving in. You can see on Slide 9 that GAAP net loss for the quarter was $133.1 million compared to a net loss of $95 million in the prior year. Let me explain the primary differences between our GAAP results and adjusted earnings.
Our long-standing philosophy is to adjust GAAP EPS to help you better understand our underlying operations. These adjustments include such items as acquisition-related matters, such as noncash acquisition-related amortization expenses, restructuring charges and related tax effects and those items outlined in Tables 1 and 2 in today's press release. You will notice that, as described on February 18, we are also removing our Vitamins, Minerals and Supplements operating results from our adjusted earnings in 2016 as the business is currently held for sale. A full reconciliation can be viewed in Tables 1 and 2 in our press release. There are 2 specific large noncash impairment charges here related to Branded Consumer Healthcare, which I will also talk about in a moment when we get to the segment details. 
So as you can see now on Slide 10, Perrigo delivered consolidated first quarter adjusted net sales growth of 33% year-over-year on a constant-currency basis, excluding contributions from the VMS business for both 2016 and 2015. As noted on our fourth quarter 2015 earnings call, please exclude approximately $40 million of contributions each quarter in your models for 2015 related to this business. During the first quarter, we experienced a confluence of events which has impacted quarter results to a magnitude we could not have anticipated at the beginning of the quarter and which have also impacted our guidance for the full year, as I'll discuss shortly. 
Net sales contributions from Branded Consumer Healthcare, which was not part of our business this time last year, was the primary driver of our year-over-year top line growth. Consolidated new product sales of $74 million, including $31 million in BCH new product sales, were partially offset by $39 million of discontinued products. First quarter consolidated adjusted gross margin was a March quarter record of 47.9%, highlighted by first quarter adjusted gross profit margins in our Consumer Healthcare segment of 33.8%, with first quarter consolidated adjusted operating margin of 25.1%.
So walking through the segments, starting with CHC on Slide 11. In the quarter, adjusted net sales, excluding VMS, grew 2% on a constant-currency basis, driven by continued momentum in store brand infant formula and continued strength in our NRT franchise. I'm pleased to note that Perrigo's supplied infant formula market share has grown to 13.9%, according to IRI data, which is a record for the Consumer Healthcare team. These gains were partially offset by decreases in the analgesic and cough/cold categories following an extremely mild cough/cold season and the absence of the guaifenesin 600-milligram ER products as compared to last year. 
As previously discussed, this is the last quarter where our infant formula label refresh will have a negative year-over-year impact. This conversion accounted for the majority of the abnormally high discontinued product number of $32 million embedded in these results. New product sales in the quarter were $31 million. Remember, we anticipated our new product launches in this segment to be weighted more heavily to the second half of the calendar year.
On Slide 12, you can see that BCH posted net sales of $318 million, with new products contributing $31 million, and our acquired GSK portfolio and Yokebe brand contributing another $37 million to this total. The BCH segment revenues were organically flat compared to the prior year, with growth in our top 20 brands primarily in the cough/cold and allergy category despite a soft season in Europe, which was offset by lower OTC sales in certain markets.
In the quarter, BCH fell considerably short of our top line expectations. Despite soft line -- soft top line results, as previewed in February, we continued to make significant investments in advertising and promotion in this quarter, equal to approximately 18.6% of net sales. These effects were the primary drivers of adjusted operating income as a percent of sales of only approximately 8%. 
The net sales miss in the quarter combined with a change in forecasted net sales and adjusted operating income for the remainder of the year were the basis for the change in guidance for this segment as well as triggering an initial indicator of impairment. This started a process to update our long-range segment plans to evaluate asset carrying values. The change in fair value from previous estimates was due primarily to the changes in the current market and performance of the brands, such that the evaluation of the brand prioritization and product extensions or launches in new regions are being more focused to maximize the potential of the whole basket of brands in the segment portfolio.
The result, as outlined in our press release this morning, is that we realized a pretax noncash impairment charge of approximately $467 million related to intangible assets acquired in conjunction with the Omega acquisition, $273 million related to indefinite lived intangible assets and the remaining $194 million related to goodwill. This is clearly a disappointment, but steps are being taken to correct the underperformance in BCH, including changes in leadership, as John has outlined. While many steps have already been taken, it is important to note that it will take time to fully realize the true value of the actions we are taking. 
On Slide 13, Rx net sales increased 2%, which came in below our expectations. We experienced negative organic growth within the segment resulting from several factors, so let me explain. The change in the competitive landscape was much more disruptive to our plan than had been anticipated and impacted our overall pricing strategies for the segment. During the quarter, we experienced 24 competitive launches against our portfolio, producing sharp price erosion in a number of topical products we sell. These factors, combined with continued pricing pressure due to the consolidation of the large buying cooperative groups and the absence of significant new products in the quarter further impacted our ability to execute on our planned pricing strategy. Despite all of this, however, the team was able to maintain its extended topicals leadership position in the quarter. These pricing pressures impacted both the adjusted gross and operating margins, accounting for the decline you see here year-over-year.
Turning to Slide 14. Specialty Science net sales were $88 million in the quarter, up 9% on a constant-currency basis.
Before I turn to the forecast, I'll make a quick comment on the balance sheet. As of April 2, 2016, total cash on the balance sheet was $589 million and total debt was approximately $6.5 billion. The increase in debt from December 31 reflects the financing of the tretinoin acquisition in January and the subsequent $1.2 billion senior notes issuance we did in early March to term out our short-term debt. As we have stated in the past, we are fully committed to our investment-grade ratings and delevering our balance sheet through EBITDA growth and debt repayments. 
Cash flow from operations in the quarter was $170 million, which included onetime unfavorable reduction in accounts payable of an estimated $67 million in Branded Consumer Healthcare related to the normalization of their accounts payable terms. As a reminder, we intend to fund our previously announced share repurchase program, which runs out until late calendar 2018, through operating cash flow. To the extent the use of those cash flows for share repurchases would impede our deleveraging goals or any tuck-in acquisitions, we would slow or suspend the program for a period of time. Quarterly, given the cash generated and our commitment to delever, we will evaluate cash available for M&A and/or share repos. 
So let's move on now to 2016 guidance. On April 25, we provided preliminary guidance without much detail. So let me walk you through more information by segment on Slide 16, starting with CHC. We expect Consumer Healthcare net sales for 2016 to be approximately $2.65 billion. The segment has been updated primarily for the exclusion of the guaifenesin 600-milligram ER product relaunch; delay in new product launches, which include a risk-adjusted launch of the store brand version of Flonase in the second half of the year; and some adjustments for recent customer negotiations. While the team continues to work on relaunching the guaifenesin 600-milligram ER product, we believe it makes sense to remove it here from our financial forecast. We anticipate CHC adjusted operating margin to be relatively flat year-over-year.
Next, we expect BCH net sales for 2016 to be approximately $1.4 billion. To help you through your modeling, let me give you some color on our expectations for the adjusted operating margin in the segment. 2015 adjusted operating margin for the segment was 15.8% for the 9 months ended December. Our updated guidance assumes that adjusted operating margin will be approximately 200 basis points lower in 2016 due to the many organizational and portfolio changes we have discussed this morning, coupled with continued investment in A&P in our top 20 brands.
Rx. We expect Rx net sales for 2016 to be approximately $1.2 billion. Within Rx, we assume price erosion of approximately 6% for the remainder of the calendar year and now assume the launch of the generic version of ProAir in 2017. Our guidance reflects the expectation that the adjusted operating margin will be in the high 40% ranges for the year.
All of this leads to our updated consolidated guidance perspective on Slide 17. We now expect revenue between $5.6 billion and $5.9 billion, which assumes greater than $300 million in new product launches across all segments for the year, adjusted to reflect the new product delays we've already discussed.
Given the new jurisdictional mix of income expected across segments, particularly with the new products slated for launch in the second half of the year, we are updating the full year adjusted effective tax rate guidance to be approximately 15% for 2016. Given the fact that this quarter's tax rate was 11.4%, you should model a tax rate of approximately 16% to 17% on a quarterly basis for the rest of the year.
Summing all of this up to the consolidated P&L, we continue to expect 2016 adjusted earnings per diluted share to be in a range between $8.20 and $8.60. As previously noted, we continue to expect approximately 55% of our adjusted diluted EPS to materialize in the second half of the calendar year, due primarily to timing of expected new product launches.
Lastly, a few comments on operating cash flow guidance for the year. We expect the performance of our business to deliver full year operating cash flow of approximately $1 billion, which includes the onetime unfavorable $67 million BCH-related normalization effects I mentioned a few moments ago. This represents an operating cash flow conversion approaching 90%, to the midpoint of our adjusted net income earnings guidance. This business model continues to drive strong cash flows and illustrates the ability of our platform to generate quality net income performance.
I'll now hand the call back to John."

Turning now to Slide 19. I want to amplify what Judy said about our guidance. The guidance range that we put forward on April 25 accurately reflects the perspective of my full management team on our opportunities and on the dynamics facing Perrigo and our industry. As we stated earlier, we will set and communicate proper targets and work tirelessly to meet or exceed them. 
I also want to reiterate my leadership principles that I talked about upfront, which, at the core, are focused on execution designed to drive shareholder value. First, as I said earlier, my foremost priority is operational execution. We have a great business, and operational excellence is the foundation which all of our successes are built.  This is who we are. 
Our platform is designed to add products and technologies that foster our growth. High quality and affordability for our consumer is paramount. When we add new legs to our stool, like we did with infant nutrition and animal health, we leverage these business models, investing in R&D, talent and infrastructure to further growth. This is why we generate the strong cash flow that Judy emphasized earlier.
Second, I am action-oriented, and will deal with challenges and opportunities head on. I've made and will continue to make critical decisions to improve certain aspects of our businesses. 
Third, I am unequivocally committed to transparency and will be actively engaged with and listening to your questions and comments. That's how I've always worked, and that's how I will continue to work.  Fourth and finally, everything I and the management team do is directed to delivering value to Perrigo's shareholders, and we will continue to deploy capital prudently and appropriately to that end.
I'd like to close by reiterating my confidence in the strength of the Perrigo business. We have a solid foundation to build on. We have an experienced management team. We have a deep pipeline of new products. We continue to refine and improve our operating model across all of our segments of business to drive returns. Our global platform gives us a springboard for growth, and we are all fixated on leveraging our core advantages to deliver shareholder value. 
And I would be remiss if I didn't thank our more than 13,000 employees around the world for their hard work in building Perrigo into the business it is today. We have an exceptional group of professionals working to deliver quality, affordable healthcare products around the world, and they are core to our success in the past and in the future. And I am honored to be part of this outstanding organization.
We will now open the call for questions and answers. I want to remind you that I am joined for Q&A by Perrigo's Chairman, Laurie Brlas; and our Executive Vice President, Judy Brown."

So we saw, I'll call it, some softness, starting in January, and beginning to accelerate as these competitive launches, I quoted 24 competitors launched against our products in Q1. And that, in and of itself, changed the pricing dynamics for our team versus their expectations. And so as you look at the net -- sorry, [indiscernible] of the quarter. So as we look pragmatically at the rest of the year, we had to say what is a reasonable assumption based on the competitive landscape as it faces us right now? It's things I called out, with the increased buying pressure across the cooperative large groups, which everyone in the industry is seeing to some extent right now, building that into our expectations, updating our forecast to reflect specific contractual agreements now in place for the rest of the year, evaluating the pricing strategies that we had in place for the last 3 quarters of the year and making sure that those are updated to reflect the new reality for the remainder of 2016 and making sure though that in our numbers and on our bottom line that we're still making the right investments in R&D. So not skimping in R&D with -- entirely with the situation in the market, but making sure that we still made a net contribution to the long-term growth of the portfolio. So that's the evolution of the pricing update. We said 6% for the remainder of the year. I think the team feels that, that's a reasonable approach to pricing, where they've evaluated and tried to take in the known knowns as well as a little bit of wiggle room for the unknowns. And going forward, still looking at adjusted operating margin for the segment in the high 40s, op -- adjusted operating margins for the full year."

We frequently talked about our overall basket of Consumer Healthcare products being able to maintain stable pricing. And that continues to be the case but I've always said very clearly that in periods of time when we're not launching big new products, that dynamic becomes more challenging for our Consumer Healthcare team, and they do a yeoman's job out in the field every day, sitting with the buyers at important, large, sophisticated retailers, talking about overall pricing. So we don't have the ability, of course, to set pricing to the consumers on the shelf, that's the determination by the retailers. But we work actively on being effective in our own buying, having an effective supply chain to mitigate any pricing pressures seen for the Consumer Healthcare team and, of course, when we launch new products, it gives leverage to the entire basket of sales that the team goes out and speaks with the retailers about. So the phrase used in my prepared remarks is directly linked, of course, to the dynamics of no big, very visible, large products launched this quarter in the OTC basket. We're going to have some very attractive ones coming up just very soon, but that's part of the yin and yang. And so as the team sits down, they say very clearly, get  me my new product launches because it helps the whole basket of goods have better stickiness long term in pricing."

Let me take some of those and then I may toss over to Judy for a couple others. First of all, capital deployment and return to shareholders. As I go through, again, and think about priority, and I lay these out trying to mentally get these clear, I think organic growth, a great way to do it, great platform, makes sense. I believe in Europe, we have a good platform. We're trying to put more operating structure into it, take a little bit about the operating entrepreneurship out of it and bring some structures into it, but it is a good platform. The GSK products that we bought a few months back are performing well in those markets. The nicotine franchise, one of the biggest nicotine franchises, nicotine replacement therapy franchise in the U.S., and now having that in Europe, a great natural extension for our core consumer businesses. So I do believe that adding on core bolt-on acquisitions within the infrastructures can have a good return for shareholder value. So I'm a believer in that. And then ultimately, what else do we do with the cash and the value that we're generating, are there other ways of returning that value to shareholders.

So I'm confident in him, I'm confident that we will need to add more leaders and add more things to drive it, but I think we're off to a great start. We also added one of our experienced financial leaders to that business about 2 months ago. He has already begun a much stronger financial planning, financial control acumen to the BCH team. So I feel good about that. Do I think that you could add a brand across every European country just like you do in the U.S? No. Each of our brands are more specialized within regions there. It might be the Nordics or it might be down in the Baltic areas, but they're all more regionalized. I believe that even within those regions, one of the advantages that Omega has in our Branded Consumer Healthcare division is they have the ability to launch products within region segments and make them profitable. So when I say bolt-ons, it may not be just one pan-European brand. It may be brands that are much more regional, but we can add to that infrastructure and grow. So I do have confidence in that. I have confidence in our ability to continue to provide growth onto that platform. I think the integration, we're going to continue. They have a great sales marketing drive footprint. The way the work with each country, whether it's a pharmacy driven country, whether it's a -- more like the U.K., which tends to be more like the U.S. from a retailer distribution. No matter what, they've got a good infrastructure there, and they've been able to show strong leadership. And so I've got a lot of confidence in the business drivers there, et cetera. I think we need the operational backbone, the financial backbone that Perrigo brings to solidify that overall structure. 
Related to sort of the Mylan Stada business, Stada is a generic company that we distribute for in Belgium, as you might recall. During all the Mylan discussions, et cetera, there were some strained relationships there, with Stada holding off some distribution, et cetera. We are basically through that. We are continuing to operate with Stada and  distribute their products in Belgium. We are talking with them about what the go-forward relationship might be or might not be, but we still have a time period of a couple years for that relationship. So that's where it's at as today.

As we moved then strategically as a team, the team looked at the offerings of products and are moving away from XL-S, which was in the original acquisition basket, and moving toward Yokebe, that triggered the requirement to lower the carrying value of those particular assets on the balance sheet. So one can look at the impairment as a negative. We are writing down certain assets that were acquired from this acquisition. But in the same time, we're also investing in other brands in the portfolio for future growth. So that's part of this composition of John talking -- he made several comments about re-analyzing the portfolio, reprioritizing that portfolio for growth. Part of that prioritization process actually is what triggered the discussion around the impairment. So it's moving from plan A to plan B in triggering that impairment, that noncash charge. In looking at the remainder of the year, all of that kind of comes together. So the guidance was updated to reflect certain changes in that portfolio, some up, some down, lowering the overall guidance across certain categories to make some adjustments primarily with the focus on new products. So some expectations of timing changes on those and how we reprioritized the top 20 brands are what were the drivers for this year's guidance. And we didn't get specific on which categories got changed in guidance, but suffice it to say it's really about pulling different levers within the overall top 20 brand basket."

So how should we really think about your generics business from this point forward? Is it going to be -- is topicals now becoming a more commoditized business or is this just a fluke in terms of the backlog the FDA started approving? And do you have the right composition of assets there? And then in terms of Omega, just longer term, it's always been characterized as a 5% to 10% growing business. And also, the strategic rationale was to really be less of an operating synergy play but more of a revenue synergy play. And so does that still stand? Do you still have a lot of opportunities for revenue synergies in the longer term 2 to 3 years out?"

All right. Let me just start off. Just briefly, I want to make one point on the Rx front. Because the Rx quarter performed so much differently than our expectations because of the items I've already mentioned and in taking a pragmatic view for the rest of the year, we lowered our guidance. We're calling out the reasons therefor. But I just want to point out to everyone, sort of stating the obvious, is we saw flow through in these pricing dynamics at the top line, which rolled through in dollar terms through to the bottom line versus our expectation and the impact for the full year. But please note, the adjusted margins are still very strong. So the team's still leadership position in the space, the products that we put to market are still stickier in relative terms than the average generic. And you can see that through both this quarter, while the quarter year-over-year is in fact down, not arguing that point, those are still very attractive operating margins with continued investment in R&D. So I just what wanted to point that part out because it's really about relative dynamics but still attractive portfolio, and we believe that we built in an update to the new landscape and still are looking at very attractive margins."

And again, my commitment is to come back to you and others in the summer here with our long-range growth plan related to Omega. When you think about the synergistic side that we have with the Branded Consumer Healthcare business, they are still there. The operating side synergies, the team's still driving hard to try and deliver, driving those to the bottom line. The revenue synergies, in my mind, are still there. They take, and even in our model, longer to get to because you have multiple registrations, multiple -- how do you advertise and promote different things, multiple regulations within different countries, even in the U.S. So in my perspective, they are still there from a long-term plan standpoint, but just take longer to get to those ultimate revenue synergies. By putting Judy in her new role, one of her great opportunities will be taking the products that we have in different divisions and figuring out how do we leverage those across our global business portfolio.

And Judy, sorry to re-ask this, but I'm still just not clear exactly why, but why isn't the business seeing more margin erosion, given the competitive dynamics and pricing?

So it was a huge quarter. So expect the comps in CHC on a year-over-year basis to be more challenged, again, because of the last year dynamics.

Certainly, your portfolio is mostly derm products which has benefited from unusual price inflation -- typically generic drugs are deflationary, but you've benefited from inflationary products. I mean, when you take a step back, clearly, the environment's changed. It seems that the FDA is approving more drugs in this space, that's creating competition, which is pushing down prices. And at the same time, consolidated buyers are pressing for a broader depth of portfolio. So it just seems that at the end of the day, the companies that were caught off guard had concentrated portfolios. Those that weren't and who had anticipated a low to mid-single-digit decline in prices have broad global portfolios. John, your portfolio is highly concentrated all in the U.S. While that has clearly served the company well over the past couple of years, going forward, it does appear that the environment is changing for your type of portfolio. What do you see as a possible strategic option for this business? Does it still makes sense to keep for Perrigo? And is this a one-time rebasing or do we worry about those margins eventually coming back down to where Teva's and Mylan's are? Or how do you think about that business strategically? And then just my follow-up question on Tysabri, you've talked about that the not being core, that's a financial asset.

Let me start back and kind of on our generic business, kind of go back to the big picture. It definitely is a business focused on extended topicals. So it's not just derm, it's ophthalmics, it's women's health, but it's extended topical kind of products. Those that usually require clinics, broader types of approvals to get in there. They usually are not billion-dollar blockbusters, they usually are much more -- the brands, they usually are much more $100 million products, et cetera. And so you usually don't have 57 competitors going after that like you might with a 800-milligram ibuprofen or something of that nature. So it is still a space, we are a relatively big Rx player. I mean, we're certainly in the top 10, not just within the extended topicals but in general, when you look at the U.S. generics space. I think it hit -- as we look back and understand how it hit, there certainly were some approvals, there's some buying power, all of those things that hit us faster than we expected and we had to address. I think the others had been -- it hit them earlier because of their broad portfolio. They had a number of products that certainly were targeted in that -- in the initial barrage, if you will. So I do think we're in a unique time. We have a good product pipeline, and we expect to continue to get those approvals and continue to be able to balance out the ups and downs of our product mix and portfolio, given we're going to continue to see constant price pressure on our older products. We've always seen that. It's just that escalated here in the last quarter with the approvals. So when you look globally, I think that's a great question, one I think we'll contemplate here over the next couple of months as we look through the long-term strategy of our Rx business. We certainly, as we get to other countries, have Rx businesses. They're not nearly as big. We do an Rx business in the U.K. that makes a very specialty prescription. We have some businesses that distribute through Rx in Mexico. So we have parts of our business that our Rx is certainly much smaller than our core U.S. business. And so we will look at how that fits, does it fit internationally, does it fit globally into our structure. Clearly, in the U.S., it has a lot of advantages. Again, our whole infrastructure is geared around both of those, and it provides a pipeline for us to continue to feed our OTC marketplace and OTC engine. So all of that is very good. I think the last kind of part of it is Tysabri. Again, I do see it as a financial asset. I think we will continue to look at it and figure out what is the best way to utilize that asset. Is it as cash to fund other things? Is it liquidating parts of it to use money to do other things with? We will continue to evaluate the best use of that Tysabri asset."

But when I step back big picture wise and say what's expected, the dynamics in the industry in my mind still remain unchanged. As innovators launch the products, we're in a great position to capitalize on that. The macroeconomic trends of people getting older, needing more healthcare, costs going up despite our ability or our desire to control them more, continue to drive people towards retail brands. And frankly, when they try them, they recognize the quality there. And so that allows the share to grow, and my belief is it will continue to allow the share to drive upward. I'd hate to speculate right now without, again, going to our long range planning team with exactly what percentages it will go. I foresee continued share growth.

So as I kind of add up all the parts, there is some base growth from our business that continues to allow that Consumer Healthcare business to grow. Switches are certainly game changing or category changing, depending on which kind of switch it is. We continue to see switches as a big part of the growth of that over-the-counter market when you look out over the next few years. And as different categories, we've talked about derm or others that switch, those open bigger opportunities. Going back a ways, not to get too -- back too far, but when you look at non-sedating antihistamines, it's probably one of the clear categories, you used to either go to the over-the-counter and get something that would put you to sleep when you had your allergies or you went to a doctor and got a prescription. Now as that -- as those products switched all over-the-counter, the amount of opportunities that, that has created in the over-the-counter space is great. So we see that continuing for categories. And frankly, the regulatory agencies and government wanting to try and drive safe healthcare to be more affordable. And so all of those we think, work in the favor of that. Related to additional kind of add-ins, they certainly are a big part of the business but there are still other segments, other areas that would fit well within our overall system, overall structure, adding more items to the truck that are pharmaceutically oriented that we continue to look at. And not all of them will make sense for us, but we continue to make sure that we have the sort of optimal portfolio to bring that value to our retailers and then ultimately to consumers. So I think there's still those left that Jeff and his team are continuing to look at to see how we add those in. Thank you. Thanks, Derek.

On Slide 4, you will see today's agenda. First, I will provide an update on progress made executing on the strategic priorities outlined in May, followed by an overview of the quarter for the business units. I will provide you detail regarding the first phases of our strategic plan to improve operational performance, including an update on the specific actions we have already completed and some others underway. Then Judy will walk through the financial results for the quarter as well as the details that are behind our guidance revision. Finally, I will provide my perspective on our business for the remainder of the year and longer term. 
I've just completed my first 100 days as CEO of Perrigo. They have been intense and challenging. They've also been very productive. I've been taking a comprehensive look at our business strategically, operationally and financially and doing so with an open mind as to the path forward. You should know that I remain committed to the 4 governing principles that I outlined in May: disciplined execution; taking swift and decisive actions when necessary; being transparent with our owners, customers and employees; and above all, creating shareholder value. In the first 100 days, I have met with many of our shareholders to hear your thoughts about our company and the opportunities ahead. I have met with a number of our customers to hear what they expect from me and from my leadership team. And as always, I've spent considerable time speaking with employees across our sites worldwide. I've looked at each of our segments under the lens of my principles, and there are several key themes you will see throughout our comments today. Our Consumer Healthcare segment continues to operate with strong margins. Our near-term focus remains delivering additional operational efficiencies and predictable bottom line value while continuing to invest in future growth initiatives. The Branded Consumer Healthcare segment, under the new leadership of Sharon Kochan, also on 100 day of role in that position, performed generally consistent with our expectations in the quarter. Branded Consumer Healthcare continues to execute against our operating plan to enhance growth and develop the operating platform while at the same time prioritizing brand innovation and country-by-country channel strategies to drive the greatest value for shareholders. We have products and countries that are doing very well, and some that are not yet meeting our expectations. As you know, this is a complicated, multidimensional business. And our plan will take time to generate margins commensurate with leading branded consumer businesses. But I believe those can be achieved. The Rx business has been the most challenging to predict the short term given price erosion and the competitive dynamics in the sector. Despite those challenges, we continue to deliver attractive operating margins versus our RX Pharma peers and believe in the long-term fundamental of this business. Our comprehensive review of the business has resulted in lowering our outlook, primarily due to pricing expectations. We will share with you the changes we are making to deliver more predictable results under our new leadership. Our Specialty Sciences segment performed above our expectations in the first half of the year. While the short-term result of this noncore asset has been predictable, we continue to evaluate its long-term contribution within our portfolio and the best strategic use of its cash flow. 
Turning to Slide 6. As I stated 3 months ago, in accordance with good, responsible leadership, my team and I are looking at ways to drive value across our businesses through the dual end of profitability and cash flow conversion. We're digging deep to determine the best ways to unleash more value for our core segments. We are taking actions to improve organizational effectiveness, operating leverage and our overall cost structure. We have previously announced the sale of the U.S. VMS business, which closed last Friday, and the intent to sell both our API operation in India and our Etixx brand in Europe. In addition, we are announcing today that we are beginning to explore strategic alternatives for our businesses in Russia, South Africa, Argentina and our U.S. pet treats manufacturing operation in Kansas City. We will continue to look at our operations to deliver shareholder value while investing and growing our core. To that end, I'm not only working with my deep leadership team here, but also with our strong adviser network to ensure we are reviewing all of our businesses with the appropriate critical eye. 
Turning to Slide 7. As for the quarter, our financial results were below internal expectations. And as for the headlines, while we delivered CHC operating income in line with our internal expectations, and we continue to focus on improving the profitability of the BCH business, we continue to face pricing headwinds in Rx, even greater than we had anticipated, against the backdrop of a highly variable pharmaceutical pricing environment. To be clear, we missed our internal EPS in the quarter and expectations primarily as a result of the pricing impacts in the Rx segment. Judy will give detailed commentary regarding the final performance of our segment, but I'd like to provide a few observations now. 
Adjusted operating margins in the Consumer Healthcare segment were greater than 20% and continue to track near all-time highs. The team is executing against its operational targets with the foundation in making high-quality products. I'm pleased to report that the storebrand version of Flonase launched in the quarter and the segment achieved $32 million in new product sales. Infant formula and smoking cessation categories also continued to perform very well. Branded Consumer Healthcare adjusted net sales were generally in line with our expectation. Adjusted non-GAAP operating margins were 15%, an improvement over the first quarter margins, although adjusted gross profit margins were lower primarily due to weaker product mix. This was offset by cost-containment actions by the business unit in the quarter. We continue to build out the acquired products in the weight loss and smoking cessation categories across the platform, which is going very well. Collectively, as you think about our business, our consumer-facing segment still represent over 70% of our adjusted net sales for the quarter. In Rx, we experienced weaker second quarter than forecasted due largely to more aggressive pricing environment. Despite these headwinds, we continue to focus on generating healthy adjusted operating margins and driving our deep product pipeline forward. Notably during the quarter, we received approval for and launched the generic portion of BenzaClin. 
Let me turn to Slide 8 to dive deeper into Rx and walk you through what we are doing to better address the challenges we are facing in this segment. As stated in our press release issued earlier today, we have revised our adjusted EPS guidance for the full year to $6.85 to $7.15. A predominant factor impacting the updated guidance is continued price erosion within the Rx segment. Based on my valuation of segment, I want the first confirm that despite lower guidance for the segment, I believe Rx is a fundamentally sound business with solid strong long-term prospects. We remain in a leading market position with a deep pipeline in which we continue to invest. Our adjusted operating margins in the upper quartile of the Rx Pharma sector remain very attractive. That said, Rx competes in a fast-moving, dynamic environment, as evidenced by public comments from the sector's peer, we have also disclosed greater price erosion than expected. Against our own expectation, price erosion in the quarter was unfavorable to adjusted operating income by approximately $20 million. In light of this price erosion and our performance against our expectations this quarter, we've taken an even more pragmatic approach to forecasting for the second half of the year. We conduct a thorough evaluation and added any effect of known price changes, all anniversary price erosions in the prior calendar year. In addition, we include incremental adjustments for potential additional unfavorable pricing trends, although so far in Q3, we have not seen a rate of change in the pricing environment moderate. Through this process, we arrive at a price erosion forecast for the second half of the year of approximately 9% to 10% compared to the same period in 2015. Judy will walk through this process in an even greater detail in a few minutes. 
We continue to execute against our strategy for the segment, focusing on tougher-to-manufacture products with higher barriers to entry. We believe these products have greater longevity. As an example of this strategy, we're announcing today that we very recently purchased the remaining portion of the generic BenzaClin royalty stream that we did not own previously. As I just noted, BenzaClin was approved and launched in the quarter, and we see it as a longer-term asset, from which we will now capture 100% of the economics. 
While we continue to search for the best candidate internally and externally to lead this segment, I'm confident in John and the rest of our highly experienced Rx team and their ability to drive operating margins and build upon deep pipeline, maintaining current partnerships and developing new ones as well. 
Now turning to the BCH segment on Slide 9. We have also updated guidance to reflect our current estimates for net sales and margin mix. As we now anticipate, lower revenues for certain high-margin products, we have developed a 3-pillar plan to enhance profitability in the BCH business: review routes to market, optimize our portfolio and enhance the segment's effectiveness to mid to high teen operating margins. 
First, we are prioritizing brand strategies in core markets, which we expect to enable more predictable financial results. For example, last summer, we acquired the Yokebe meal replacement product, which is now a direct complement for our weight loss franchise, XLS. We now have a full range of weight loss tablet products, and now we have added meal replacement products in the franchise, providing our customers with a suite of product offerings with various consumer preferences. At the end of this quarter, we rolled out Yokebe in the U.K., Holland and Belgium within 6 months post the acquisition of purchasing the brand in Germany, and now have concrete plans to launch in other markets before the end of the year. We expect this family to be a primary driver of new products for this segment and exciting contributor to organic growth next year. 
Another example has been our success with reinvigorating growth behind NiQuitin, the smoking cessation brand we acquired last September. We launched new market programs behind the core patch products and are rebuilding the many lives into product distribution, which is gaining market share. In addition, new innovation will follow later this year to substantiate our global leadership position within the smoking cessation category. 
Second, we are making structural changes that include actions already underway, such as aligning our presence in the markets we serve by consolidating certain markets under efficient clusters, uniting our sales forces in certain markets and considering partners who can better manage commercial sales efforts in particular countries. If we identify a particular product or geography that is not meeting our hurdle rate, then we will take action with a commitment to increase profitability and cash flow conversion. For example, we continue to execute our restructuring plans announced in February. We have completed our sales force consolidation and realignment actions involved Germany and Spain and recently entered into consultation discussions with employees regarding the future direction of one of our BCH manufacturing facilities. We've also initiated a process to sell our Etixx brand in Europe. Additionally, as I've previously mentioned this morning, we are announcing further tangible actions to address market structures in certain countries, which will reduce operating costs and improve our profitability as we nurture sustainable growth in our top markets. This allows us to reinvest resources to high-performing parts of our business. Specifically, we are combining our markets under regional clusters and looking at alternative strategies for our businesses in Russia, South Africa and Argentina. 
Third, we are progressing with our integration plan to build out Perrigo's proven business processes onto the European platform. For example, we continue to have great success enhancing BCH's supply chain efficiencies. We anticipate approximately $40 million in savings per annum with projects that are already underway, which we expect to realize in the next 2 to 3 years. 
An important element underpinning our plans is our people. We have a talented team in Europe, and we are excited about the new talent we have injected into the organization, including a new leader of pan-European marketing efforts, new country leadership and increases to integration team in Europe to accelerate our process transformation. As I've said before, there's substantial work to be done, but I'm confident we can create greater shareholder value by improving and further leveraging this important consumer platform. The path of steadily improving margins is multifaceted and will take time, but the team has an actionable, multi-layered plan to improve profitability. 
Now I'm going to turn over to Judy to give us more details."

On Slide 11, you can see second quarter adjusted consolidated net sales were $1.4 billion, down $55 million or 3% year-over-year on a constant-currency basis, excluding sales from held-for-sale businesses",1652,"Thank you very much, John. Good morning, everyone. On Slide 11, you can see second quarter adjusted consolidated net sales were $1.4 billion, down $55 million or 3% year-over-year on a constant-currency basis, excluding sales from held-for-sale businesses in both the periods presented. This was driven by certain categories within the CHC segment, which I'll discuss in a moment, offset in part by increased sales in the Rx segment, which were driven largely by sales related to acquisitions and new products. 
Looking at the segment results on Slide 12. CHC adjusted net sales were down approximately $63 million [ph] year-over-year or 8% on a constant-currency basis, excluding sales from held-for-sale businesses in both periods. This was largely attributable to a weaker allergy season compared to last year, timing of customer promotional programs and lower net sales in the OTC contract manufacturing category. In addition, the analgesic category showed a net sales declined due primarily to a relatively lower pricing. These decreases were partially offset by higher net sales in the infant nutrition and smoking cessation categories. New product sales were $32 million, driven primarily by the store-brand launches of Flonase and new infant formulas. 
Adjusted gross profit margin remained strong at 36.6% as we experienced favorable product mix in the quarter and continue to leverage our supply chain proficiencies, offsetting the effects of lower pricing in certain categories. We continue to focus on our growth plan with increased R&D investments, which were 33% higher than last year on an adjusted basis. 
As John mentioned earlier, the priorities for this segment are twofold. First, delivering strong, predictable results by focusing on operational efficiencies. And second, investing in our future growth initiatives. The quarterly results for this segment are consistent with these priorities. 
Turning to Slide 13. In the quarter, Branded Consumer Healthcare segments adjusted net sales were $394 million compared with $401 million last year. The team delivered top and bottom line results in line with our internal expectations. These results included $29 million from acquisitions while new products contributed $28 million, led by innovation in the lifestyle category. Offsetting the favorable contribution of acquisitions and new products, the segment experienced lower adjusted gross margin due to unfavorable product mix and the comparison with the significant new product launch in the lifestyle segment in the second quarter of 2015. The effective lower gross profit margins was offset by cost control in the segment, resulting in adjusted operating margin for the quarter of approximately 15%, in line with our expectations. 
Turning now to Rx on Slide 14. Net sales were $293 million, 5% higher than last year, driven largely by $44 million related to acquisitions and new product sales of $26 million. As John mentioned a few minutes ago, our consolidated earnings were short of our internal forecast in the quarter due to the continued price erosion in this segment, which obviously flowed through directly to adjusted operating income as well. 
At a summary level, 3 factors affected year-over-year pricing in the quarter. First, the lack of an exclusive market position for 2 key products versus the prior year had an unfavorable impact. This first aspect was known and included in our May guidance. This impact anniversary-ed in the second quarter. Second, as previously discussed, there were a number of competitive product launches in the first quarter of 2016, which led to additional year-over-year price erosion beyond what the leadership team had anticipated. Third, there were continued pricing headwinds from consolidated buying groups. These last 2 effects were considered in our May 12 guidance, but not sufficient to reflect current aggressive market realities. Our new forecast process has reanalyzed the pricing environment in even more detail through the prism of these second quarter changes. And I'll talk about that in a few minutes. The Rx adjusted gross margin was down 720 basis points due to this year-over-year price erosion and competition in the industry, which also impacted the adjusted operating margin. 
Turning to Slide 16 and an update on our balance sheet. As of July 2, 2016, total cash in the balance sheet was $642 million and total debt was approximately $6.4 billion. As we have stated in the past, we are fully committed to our investment-grade rating, which include deleveraging our balance sheet through EBITDA growth and debt repayment. As part of that strategy, it has been stated -- our stated commitment to repay our $500 million of senior notes that mature in November. We are following through on that commitment through a proactive redemption call of those notes, which we announced yesterday. We have elected to accelerate the repayment of that debt into September in order to clearly illustrate our unequivocal commitment to deleveraging and proactively utilize cash in our balance sheet, while doing so in a manner that will be cost-neutral to shareholders in our current year. We are and expect to remain in compliance with our debt covenants under our credit agreements as we continue to take actions to strengthen our balance sheet. We have multiple paths to achieve that goal, including EBITDA and cash flow generation, enhanced through expense and CapEx management as well as the flexibility to pursue additional debt pay downs and/or to opportunistically refinance our credit facilities, in keeping with our conservative capital structure management philosophy. We generated approximately $400 million of cash from operating activities during the first 6 months of the year. Remember that this includes the unfavorable impact of approximately $70 million from the normalization of accounts payable within Branded Consumer Healthcare I noted in the first quarter. Consistent with other activities the team is undertaking to drive performance at BCH, this action was successfully taken to establish a more sustainable and predictable cash flow pattern at the business and will not similarly burden our expected operating cash flow generation in the second half of this year. With the changes in the forecast announced today, we are taking prudent immediate steps to use our strong cash flow conversion to prioritize our capital allocation on deleveraging. While there may be small tactical bolt-on acquisition opportunities, the team is first and foremost focused on execution. We committed to a long-term balance sheet and capital allocation strategy that creates value for shareholders. This strategy includes our commitment to our investment-grade rating. As such, we'll continue to focus on debt repayment and do not intend to reenter the share repurchase market in the near term. 
Turning to Slide 18. Our adjusted EPS guidance has been updated to $6.85 per share to $7.15 per share, reflecting primarily changes in the Rx segment. So let me walk you through our updated 2016 expectations by business unit so you can better understand the different dynamics by segment. 
Guidance for the CHC segment remains relatively unchanged as we expect 2016 adjusted net sales of approximately $2.6 billion, excluding contributions from the VMS business. We continue to anticipate CHC adjusted operating margins in the second half of the year similar to those achieved in the first half. We have tempered our second half BCH performance expectations for unfavorable product mix. We expect BCH adjusted net sales to be approximately $1.3 billion and continue to anticipate low double-digit adjusted operating margin for calendar 2016. Note that we anticipate higher advertising and promotion spend in the third quarter versus the fourth quarter, translating into our expectation of adjusted operating income being more heavily weighted to the fourth quarter versus the third. 
Now let's walk through the forecasting process used this quarter in our Rx segment, which, as stated multiple times this morning, has proven to be the most challenging area to forecast in this dynamic environment. We began by comprehensively reviewing all products, irrespective of size, on a bottoms-up basis, looking at both pricing and volume performance in the first half of the year versus previous assumptions and then analyzing the second half of the year potential, given current competitive dynamic. Excluding onetime items that impacted the first half of the year, such as known incidences of loss of exclusivity and for stock adjustments, the year-over-year price erosion run rate in the 6 months ended June was approximately 9%. Looking forward for the second half of the year, we conducted a comprehensive bottoms-up evaluation, adding in the effect of known price changes as well as the impact of anniversary-ed price erosion from the prior calendar year. On top of this, we included an incremental adjustment for potential additional unfavorable pricing trends. Although thus far in the third quarter, we have seen the rate of change in the pricing environment moderate. Through this process, we arrived at a second half year-over-year pricing erosion forecast of approximately 9% to 10% compared with the same period of the prior year. In addition, our updated guidance also reflects lower volume assumptions. We thus expect Rx net sales for 2016 to be approximately $1 billion with adjusted operating margin forecasted to be in the low 40% range for the year. The Rx team continues to focus on the long term by managing a balance of price, volume, market share and expenses to limit the impact to operating margin. On a consolidated basis, adjusted EPS for the third quarter of 2016 is expected to be the lowest of the year on higher operating expenditures for R&D and advertising and promotional investments. Our adjusted effective tax rate for the year is estimated at 15%, and you should model 17% into the second half of the year. Despite these announced expected changes in consolidated adjusted EPS performance, we continue to expect strong operating cash conversion in our business. Forecasted annual operating cash flow of over $900 million reflects a 90% conversion to adjusted net income. With over $640 million on the balance sheet and expanding operating cash flow, our platform continues to generate liquidity to execute on the deleveraging strategy discussed earlier. 
Now let me turn the call back over to John."

We anticipate new product launches over $300 million in 2016, [indiscernible] itself represents growth of approximately 5%. As a reminder, this year, we have already launched Fluticazone and [indiscernible] family of products. While not a comprehensive list, over the next 1.5 years, we expect to launch the remaining store-brand version of the guaifenesin family of products and continue to launch from our Rx pipeline, notably including ProAir. 
I also want to note that we recently received tentative approval from the FDA for OTC magnesium capsules, store-brand equivalent of Nexium. This is a key milestone towards an anticipated 2017 launch of this key new store-brand Rx-to-OTC switch product. The regulatory timing to market and what our position might be from a first-to-market standpoint is still unclear, but we do know that we are the first store brand or generic filer that's received a tentative approval, which is a very important step. We're currently working with our retail customers and making plans for launch the item as soon as possible after the late March 2017 market exclusivity period expires for the national brand. As I've said, the exact timing of when we're able to launch remains undetermined. 
Turning to Slide 21. Ultimately, I am confident that we are on a course to improve our performance and address our challenges. We have well-thought-out plans in place and will continue to execute against it. 
Before opening up the call for your questions, I'd like to close by underscoring some of the competitive advantages and why I believe they will drive long-term shareholder value. First, our durable CHC platform continues to leverage our deep relationships and our leading market position in store-brand OTC with numerous products, dosage forms and supply chain capabilities. We have more OTC NDAs than any other manufacturer, including the large branded pharmaceutical companies. Overall, the scale of our business is unmatched and operations continue to perform at the highest levels, delivering quality products into the medicine cabinets of consumers. Focusing on execution remains the priority as we continue to deliver predictable value. Our European consumer platform is also a differentiator that draws in our consumer capabilities. We have been evaluating the segment country by country and are taking actions across the business, which are detailed earlier. We will continue to reinvest in the core to drive profitability in this segment. With our 3-pillar operational plan in place, I have confidence that we will enhance profitability of the BCH segment by prioritizing brands and channels to ensure we are delivering the greatest value. To reiterate, the Rx business has a deep pipeline of new products, is committed to R&D investments and will continue to offer differentiated products, particularly in those high barrier to entry areas where Perrigo has exceptional capabilities. This segment continues to deliver attractive adjusted operating margins. And we are committed to building confidence in our ability to deliver improved results despite industry volatility. Overall, we are focused on improving our profitability and reviewing all aspects of our business and performance against our objectives. While we mentioned some actions we are taking today, we will continue to look at all aspects of value creation to drive optimal value from our unique portfolio. Perrigo is a strong company with a bright future despite the challenging times in the dynamic market, have confidence that our people, our processes and the plans we have laid out will deliver meaningful results. We have more steps to take, but we're on the right path in making progress daily against our stated goals. 
Looking forward, I see a business with several great platforms of growth. There will always be a need for quality affordable health care and Perrigo provides that to millions of consumers and patients worldwide. Brad?"

We can proactively go ahead and pay down that paper in September. And we are proceeding on that path right now as we speak. That will be -- give us even more headroom, more cushion, again not because there was a concern at the end of the year, even with the adjusted EBITDA numbers, but just to proactively demonstrate to everyone that we are, indeed, focused on deleveraging and utilizing our cash to do exactly that. In 2017, we have additional paper that will come due in Europe. And we intend fully to pay that down according to schedule. We could also proactively choose to early pay a term loan, given our cash flow planning, if we chose to do so, and/or we could conceptually opportunistically have discussions around our credit agreements. But at this point, as we look at our EBITDA projections as well as the step-down in the covenant leverage ratio requirement, we believe that we're comfortable that have plans in place to be proactive should any need require.

As I think, just stepping back on Rx again, if I go through it and look at it from my lens, still a solid, profitable business, despite all the negative pricing, et cetera.

Again, despite the pricing challenges, we feel we have a good pipeline, good link to our operations -- all the things that you had mentioned earlier and good switch support, even it's not specific product, it just what we have here on the Rx side links to the OTC side. So those are all the pluses. I think that investing in R&D and in the right strategic opportunity with partners is certainly a opportunity there to expand that. But even without putting more than we feel there's a decent pipeline there, our ProAir -- if I get into the ProAir one, as we look at, we're responding to FDA and going through the answers to their complete response letter, giving all the data together for that.

Annualize that into next year, and it obviously is going to be well off consensus for 2017, although granted consensus as of this morning has not been updated to fully reflect the changes in the environment that we highlighted in great depth on the official comments this morning. Suffice it to say, as we're looking at 2017 with our internal plan, the big drivers that we look at growth for next year and there is implied growth in our 2017 plans off of our internal 2016 number, are coming from many of the things, as John has already implied in the qualitative comments, which are: reestablishing bigger in-channel strategies in some of the markets in Europe that has been softer than had been originally anticipated, feeding the growth of the countries that are already performing quite well in advance of even market dynamics and continuing to feed that growth; right-sizing and organizing ourselves to drive back-office efficiencies and allow for expanded operating margins throughout Europe while continuing to fund advertising promotion and new product development within the European team. So we are most certainly planning for an improved 2017 year in the Branded Consumer Healthcare, as the team is rightsizing and reestablishing themselves. We have new products on deck for next year, a long list of new products. There is a particularly large one on deck for next year in Rx, which we moved from the end of 2016 into 2017, and at a healthy margin, plans to be a good contributor as well to the overall EPS growth of the year. And as John has likewise alluded to, taking a very hard look at how we spend in our SG&A making sure that we are laser-focused in being as efficient as possible given that recent dynamics so that we can, in fact, continue to drive bottom line growth. So not going to comment on consensus, as I'm presuming that at this stage consensus has become a bit irrelevant effective 6:32 a.m. Eastern Time today, but we will be continuing to provide you more color to be able to model 2017 both on these calls and investor presentations and conferences as well as upcoming analyst day."

But after the last quarter's performance, also went a step further and aggressively went and made some modeling assertions on known unknowns and as well went the next layer with unknown unknowns. Because after the fourth -- second quarter, and the accumulative effect of Q1 and Q2, the team under new leadership took a very different perspective on the potential for more dynamism on a go-forward basis, just given the rapid rate of change that they saw over the last 6 months. So it's not a reporting system problem, because if the accounting and the debits and credits and gross connect function as always, but rather a rapid pace of change unlike anything they had ever seen in the past. A very open dynamic with that -- between that team as well as the executive committee and talking very frankly and very openly about what they were seeing and putting forward assertions that made sense given the circumstances that we're working in today of trying to elaborate and be prepared for possible body blows if the pace of change were to -- were not to moderate as well. So that is the type of process they went through. I don't want to use the analogy of nuclear Armageddon. But given the last quarter, they definitely pushed hard on the unknown unknowns as well to try to prepare for the worst-case scenario."

And then having to build out a platform that enabled that whole thing. So if you think of all of those, we are still on the early stages of expanding through. So we're going through, we're taking actions, we're trying to correct things as we go from both a brand standpoint, what are we putting innovation into, what are we driving, what's the focus for the team? From a country standpoint, it's going into countries and working that through and then platform we've worked previously fair amount on the supply side and operating side.

All that said, we have good countries, good parts. People are driving things. So it's not -- nothing happens till then. We're making changes along that path. As far as Q2 strength, I'll say the team did a great job of having some good sales and driving that, also having some good cost controls and driving it. As we look at the year and investments we want to make and where it pans out, we're not ready to count on a 15% operating margin repeating every quarter yet. We believe we'll eventually get there and then some. But just don't want to plan on that for the next half, so we've lowered the expectations.

After all those changes, after we built in the 9% to 10% to the back half, all of that, we still have a business with a great return on invested capital, a great operating margin, great new product prospects. And so while I think there are many things we can do to enhance that business and drive more value and products to it, the main dynamic right now is this pricing dynamic. And that one is guide you through it, got to allow that to happen and have our new products start it again. We only describe Rx as a leaky bucket. We knew this was going to be a tough new products year.

Approximately 80% of the BCH segment business is coming from branded OTC, you all know, there's a small side of business that is coming from our distribution of certain generics in Belgium. Top 20 brands make up about 55% of sales of the segment. Other owned brands make up another 1/4 of sales, so there's my 80%. Our top 20 brands are contributing gross margins in the low 60s. The other brands are in the low 50s. So that blended rate in the mid-50s for the branded products is honestly in line or even slightly better than competitive peers in the European consumer space. So solid, competitive gross margins. Our advertising and promotion spend for the business is in line with or frankly even a little soft compared to other players. And the main driving factor now for us to improve operating margins is finding ways to be more structurally efficient. So in a country-by-country basis. And we'll be elaborating on more of this in detail, finding ways to be more efficient in our go-to-market, and importantly, on a shared service platform, finding ways that we can deliver back-office database services to the countries in a more efficient way so the teams can really focus their time and their energy on sales, market, product development, go-to-market and being closer to their customers. So those types of initiatives, as John referred to, take more time. That's going to be the focus now of the transformation team that's helping drive efficiencies across Europe to be able to drive more bottom line margin. Should it be a business that has operating margins in the high teens nearing 20%? Absolutely. Do we have a line of sight to that as the team understand the implication and what has to be done? Yes. Does it happen tomorrow? No. But if you just look at the key metrics: products, gross margin, A&P, those are in line. And now it's about driving efficiency through the other lines to be able to progress our way towards high teens operating margin, in line with the competitive dynamic of other branded consumer companies."

But I'd feel good about the position that we just look at share of products that we can't compete it, how are doing in maintaining and driving those higher, how consumers are doing and still driving retail brands at a value point versus brands. So I feel good about those kind of initiatives."

Then you drop down the widening for all the way to adjusted operating margin, very, very clear. The team made a choice absolute right thing, which was continue to invest incremental dollars in R&D. Even with that R&D investment, I would not say that anyone should feel badly about an operating -- adjusted operating margin of 20.7%. Yes, while it is down year-over-year, they could have chosen not to make those R&D investments to keep the AGM or AOM up, but did the right thing to invest in the long term the R&D investments in this whole soul business are forecasted for the full year to be higher on a year-over-year basis to continue to fund growth in 2017 and beyond."

I was thinking from a broader perspective, you guys used to talk about megatrends and one of them being that you would be able to gain continued incremental shares store brand against national brand about, I guess, 100 basis points a year. Is that trend overall still continuing? Or are you sort of tapped out on that market share at this point? I know you just went through some of the dynamics with certain products, but this is a megatrend, is that still continuing?

If you step back with all the big picture, and this is a way step back, but we're all getting older. Health care costs have done nothing but go up, despite everything we try to do to manage them down. We all need more health care and frankly have less money to spend on it. So from a macro dynamic, that's a pretty global trend, and so a macro dynamic, looking for a value to pay for some of those health care needs, in my mind, will continue to grow. So that's challenge. I think when you look at people from a pure store brand standpoint and looking at a value there, in my mind, there are still potential for higher share gains. If you look at certain countries, certain product lines, the share is much higher than on every product line. So when I say, ""Can you keep growing share?"" The answer would be yes. There's still growth there from a share standpoint, even in getting categories that are under their fair share, if you will, up to where a normalized fair share should be, there's opportunity. So I still think the growing share store-brand and total growing share is a trend that Jeff and his team are continuing to drive and get after that. It happens not just with pure share growth and promotion, but bringing in new products. New products, bold new energy. They bring consumers to the market, looking for those things and looking for equivalent kind of the products. So making sure they're getting out new products. Sounds like a new product play really does help drive share kind of across the board because of those things. So I think it's still good opportunities. The brands are out and doing good innovations, which I think is great because that kind of drives interest in the market and provides new opportunities for us to continue to grow also. Second part of your question was branded annualized growth and looking at that. And I'll go back to my premise of we are in a correction phase, getting everything kind of aligned to make sure that we have a good operating platform, good growth vehicles of brands, good country operating performance to continue to drive them. I think with the infrastructure of what we have, we should be able to grow our products faster than general markets are growing in those countries. And each country in Europe grows differently. I mean that's probably the biggest thing I've learned over the last 10 years is, we call it Europe, but it's not. Each country grows differently and different branded product of interest. I believe we can grow faster than those markets where the plans and the way we're positioning ourselves in those markets. But I'd rather give you a general number for Europe. I think we got a whole back on to have when we look at specific growth and how we fit in there and give you broader guidance on that."

We have guided to 14% adjusted effective tax rate and updated that to 15% given updated mix of income in this new guidance. And if you do your math, it says a higher rate or around 17% on average for the second half of the year. With respect to the GAAP-non-GAAP discussion which is all abuzz at the moment, that is also for us a pretty cut-and-dry answer. The tax-related items that flow through on our GAAP/non-GAAP tables within our press release this morning are related to tax effect of those items that are included as adjustments, like amortization of intangibles, et cetera.

I mean if you look back historically, those are the kind of numbers that you'd see in the industry, not kind of the ones that we're seeing at this stage. I don't have a better crystal ball, but when I look at it and say, ""It has to normalize out, a great generic industry."" It eventually gets back to a normalized point. So you get back to a 5% to 6% normalize decrease so first to file other items, but just normalized increases, but new products on top of that, put on some pricing might be up to get on other products that are way undervalued right now, to me, you get back to more normalized level.

On Slide 4, you will see today's agenda. First, I will provide an update on progress made executing on the strategic priorities outlined in May, followed by an overview of the quarter for the business units. I will provide you detail regarding the first phases of our strategic plan to improve operational performance, including an update on the specific actions we have already completed and some others underway. Then Judy will walk through the financial results for the quarter as well as the details that are behind our guidance revisions. Finally, I will provide my perspective on our business for the remainder of the year and longer term.
I've just completed my first 100 days as CEO at Perrigo. They have been intense and challenging. They have also been very productive. I have been taking a comprehensive look at our business strategically, operationally and financially; and am doing so with an open mind as to the path forward. You should know that I remain committed to the 4 governing principles that I outlined in May: disciplined execution; taking swift and decisive actions when necessary; being transparent with our owners, customers and employees; and above all, creating shareholder value. In the first 100 days, I have met with many of our shareholders to hear your thoughts about our company and the opportunities ahead. I have met with a number of our customers to hear what they expect from me and from my leadership team. And as always, I have spent considerable time speaking with employees across our sites worldwide.
I have looked at each of our segments under the lens of my principles, and there are several key themes you will see throughout our comments today. Our Consumer Healthcare segment continues to operate with strong margins. Our near-term focus remains delivering additional operational efficiencies and predictable bottom line value while continuing to invest in future growth initiatives. The Branded Consumer Healthcare segment, under the new leadership of Sharon Kochan, also in his 100th day of role in that position, performed generally consistent with our expectations in the quarter. Branded Consumer Healthcare continues to execute against our operating plan to enhance growth and develop the operating platform while at the same time prioritizing brand innovation and country-by-country channel strategies to drive the greatest value for shareholders. We have products and countries that are doing very well and some that are not yet meeting our expectations. As you know, this is a complicated, multidimensional business. And our plan will take time to generate margins commensurate with leading branded consumer businesses, but I believe those can be achieved.
The Rx business has been our most challenging to predict the short term given price erosion and the competitive dynamics in this sector. Despite those challenges, we continue to deliver attractive operating margins versus our RX pharma peers and believe in the long-term fundamentals of this business. Our comprehensive review of the business has resulted in lowering our outlook primarily due to pricing expectations. We will share with you the changes we are making to deliver more predictable results under our new leadership.
Our specialty science segment performed above our expectations in the first half of the year. While the short-term result of this noncore asset has been predictable, we continue to evaluate its long-term contributions within our portfolio and the best strategic use of its cash flows.
Turning to Slide 6. As I stated 3 months ago, in accordance with good, responsible leadership, my team and I are looking at ways to drive value across our businesses through the dual lenses of profitability and cash flow conversion. We're digging deep to determine the best ways to unleash more value for our core segments. We are taking actions to improve organizational effectiveness, operating leverage and our overall cost structure.
We have previously announced the sale of the U.S. VMS business, which closed last Friday; and the intent to sell both our API operation in India and our Etixx brand in Europe. In addition, we're announcing today that we are beginning to explore strategic alternatives for our businesses in Russia, South Africa, Argentina and our U.S. pet treats manufacturing operation in Kansas City.
We will continue to look at our operations to deliver shareholder value while investing and growing our core. To that end, I'm not only working with my deep leadership team here but also with our strong adviser network to ensure we are reviewing all of our businesses with the appropriate critical eye.
Turning to Slide 7. As for the quarter, our financial results were below internal expectations. And as for the headlines, while we delivered CHC operating income in line with our internal expectations and we continued to focus on improving the profitability of the BCH business, we continued to face pricing headwinds in Rx even greater than we had anticipated against the backdrop of a highly variable pharmaceutical pricing environment. To be clear: We missed our internal EPS in the quarter and expectations primarily as a result of the pricing impacts in this Rx segment. Judy will give detailed commentary regarding the final performance of those segment, but I would like to provide a few observations now.
Adjusted operating margins in the Consumer Healthcare segment were greater than 20% and continue to track near all-time highs. The team is executing against its operational targets, with the foundation of making high-quality products. I'm pleased to report that the store brand version of Flonase launched in the quarter, and the segment achieved $32 million in new product sales. Infant formula and smoking cessation categories also continued to perform very well.
Branded Consumer Healthcare adjusted net sales were generally in line with our expectation. Adjusted non-GAAP operating margins were 15%, an improvement over the first quarter margins, although adjusted gross profit margins were lower primarily due to weaker product mix. This was offset by cost-containment actions by the business unit in the quarter. We continue to build out the acquired products in the weight loss and smoking cessation categories across the platform, which is going very well. Collectively, as you think about our business, our consumer-facing segments still represent over 70% of our adjusted net sales for the quarter.
In Rx, we experienced a weaker second quarter than forecasted due largely to more aggressive pricing environment. Despite these headwinds, we continue to focus on generating healthy adjusted operating margins and driving our deep product pipeline forward. Notably during the quarter, we received approval for and launched the generic portion of BenzaClin. 
Let me turn to Slide 8 to dive deeper into Rx and walk you through what we are doing to better address the challenges we are facing in this segment. As stated in our press release issues -- issued earlier today, we have revised our adjusted EPS guidance for the full year to $6.85 to $7.15. A predominant factor impacting the updated guidance is continued price erosion within the Rx segment. Based on my evaluation of the segment, I want to first confirm that, despite lower guidance for the segment, I believe Rx is a fundamentally sound business with solid, strong long-term prospects. We remain in a leading market position with a deep pipeline into which we continue to invest. Our adjusted operating margins in the upper quartile of the Rx pharma sector remain very attractive. That said, Rx competes in a fast-moving, dynamic environment, as evidenced by public comments from the sector's peer, who have also disclosed greater price erosion than expected. Against our own expectations, price erosion in the quarter was unfavorable to adjusted operating income by approximately $20 million.
In light of this price erosion and our performance against our expectations this quarter, we've taken an even more pragmatic approach to forecasting for the second half of the year. We conducted thorough evaluation and added any effect of known price changes all anniversary-ing price erosions in the prior calendar year. In addition, we included incremental adjustments for potential additional unfavorable pricing trends, although so far in Q3 we have not seen the rate of change in the pricing environment moderate. Through this process, we arrived at a price erosion forecast for the second half of the year of approximately 9% to 10% compared to the same period in 2015. Judy will walk through this process in even greater details in a few minutes.
We continue to execute against our strategy for this segment, focusing on tougher-to-manufacture products with higher barriers to entry. We believe these products have greater longevity. As an example of this strategy, we're announcing today that we very recently purchased the remaining portion of the generic BenzaClin royalty stream that we did not own previously. As I just noted, BenzaClin was approved and launched in the quarter, and we see it as a longer-term asset from which we will now capture 100% of the economics. While we continue to search for the best candidate internally and externally to lead this segment, I am confident in John Wesolowski and the rest of our highly experienced Rx team in their ability to drive operating margins built upon a deep pipeline, maintaining current partnerships and developing new ones as well.
Now turning to the BCH segment on Slide 9. We have also updated guidance to reflect our current estimates for net sales and margin mix. As we now anticipate lower revenues for certain high-margin products, we have developed a 3-pillared plan to enhance profitability in the BCH business: review routes to market, optimize our portfolio and enhance the segment's effectiveness to mid- to high-teen operating margins.
First, we are prioritizing brand strategies in core markets which we expect to enable more predictable financial results. For example, last summer, we acquired the Yokebe meal replacement product, which is now a direct complement to our weight loss franchise XLS. We now will have a full range of weight loss tablet products. And now we have added meal replacement products to the franchise, providing our customers with a suite of product offerings addressing various consumer preferences. At the end of this quarter, we rolled out Yokebe in the U.K., Holland and Belgium, within 6 months post the acquisition and purchasing the brand in Germany; and now have concrete plans to launch in other markets before the end of the year. We expect this family to be a primary driver of new products for this segment and an exciting contributor to organic growth next year. Another example has been our success with reinvigorating growth behind NiQuitin, the smoking cessation brand we acquired last September. We launched new market programs behind the core patch product; and are rebuilding the mini lines into product distribution, which is gaining market share. In addition, new innovation will follow later this year to substantiate our global leadership position within the smoking cessation category.
Second, we are making structural changes that include actions already underway such as aligning our presence in the markets we serve by consolidating certain markets under efficient clusters, uniting our sales forces within certain markets and considering partners who can better manage commercial sales efforts in particular countries. If we identify a particular product or geography that is not meeting our hurdle rates, then we will take action, with a commitment to increase profitability and cash flow conversion. For example, we continue to execute our restructuring plans announced in February. We have completed our sales force consolidation and realignment actions involving Germany and Spain and recently entered into consultation discussions with employees regarding the future direction of one of our BCH manufacturing facilities. We have also initiated the process to sell our Etixx brand in Europe. Additionally, as I've previously mentioned this morning, we are announcing further tangible actions to address market structures in certain countries, which will reduce operating costs and improve our profitability as we nurture sustainable growth in our top markets. This allows us to reinvest resources to high-performing parts of our business. Specifically, we are combining our markets under regional clusters; and looking at alternative strategies for our businesses in Russia, South Africa and Argentina.
Third, we are progressing with our integration plans to build out Perrigo's proven business processes onto the European platform. For example, we continue to have great success enhancing BCH's supply chain efficiencies. We anticipate approximately $40 million in savings per annum with projects that are already underway, which we expect to realize in the next 2 to 3 years.
An important element underpinning our plans is our people. We have a talented team in Europe. And we are excited about the new talent we have injected into the organization, including a new leader of pan-European marketing efforts, new country leadership and increases to our integration team in Europe to accelerate our process transformation. And as I've said before, there is substantial work to be done, but I am confident we can create greater shareholder value by improving and further leveraging this important consumer platform. The path of steadily improving margins is multifaceted and it will take time, but the team has an actionable, multilayered plan to improve profitability.
Now I'm going to turn over to Judy to go over some more details."

Good morning, everyone.On Slide 11, you can see second quarter adjusted consolidated net sales were $1.4 billion, down $55 million or 3% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, excluding sales from held-for-sale businesse",1653,"Thank you very much, John. Good morning, everyone.
On Slide 11, you can see second quarter adjusted consolidated net sales were $1.4 billion, down $55 million or 3% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, excluding sales from held-for-sale businesses in both the periods presented. This was driven by certain categories within the CHC segment, which I'll discuss in a moment, offset in part by increased sales in the Rx segment, which were driven largely by sales related to acquisitions and new products.
Looking at the segment results on Slide 12. CHC adjusted net sales were down approximately $63 million year-over-year or 8% on a constant currency basis, excluding sales from held-for-sale businesses in both periods. This was largely attributable to a weaker allergy season compared to last year, timing of customer promotional programs and lower net sales in the OTC contract manufacturing category. In addition, the analgesic category showed a net sales decline due primarily to relatively lower pricing. These decreases were partially offset by higher net sales in the infant nutrition and smoking cessation categories. New product sales were $32 million, driven primarily by the store brand launches of Flonase and new infant formulas.
Adjusted gross profit margin remained strong at 36.6%, as we experienced favorable product mix in the quarter and continued to leverage our supply chain proficiencies, offsetting the effects of lower pricing in certain categories. We continued to focus on our growth plan with increased R&D investments, which were 33% higher than last year on an adjusted basis.
As John mentioned earlier, the priorities for this segment are twofold: first, delivering strong, predictable results by focusing on operational efficiencies; and second, investing in our future growth initiatives. The quarterly results for this segment are consistent with these priorities.
Turning to Slide 13. In the quarter, Branded Consumer Healthcare segment's adjusted net sales were $394 million compared with $401 million last year. The team delivered top and bottom line results in line with our internal expectations. These results included $29 million from acquisitions, while new products contributed $28 million, led by innovation in the lifestyle category. Offsetting the favorable contribution of acquisitions and new products, the segment experienced lower adjusted gross margin due to unfavorable product mix and the comparison with a significant new product launch in the lifestyle segment in the second quarter of 2015. The effect of lower gross profit margins was offset by cost control in this segment, resulting in adjusted operating margin for the quarter of approximately 15%, in line with our expectations.
Turning now to Rx on Slide 14. Net sales were $293 million, 5% higher than last year, driven largely by $44 million related to acquisitions and new product sales of $26 million. As John mentioned a few minutes ago, our consolidated earnings were short of our internal forecast in the quarter due to the continued price erosion in this segment, which obviously flowed through directly to adjusted operating income as well.
At a summary level, 3 factors affected year-over-year pricing in the quarter. First, the lack of an exclusive market position for 2 key products versus the prior year had an unfavorable impact. This first aspect was known and included in our May guidance. This impact anniversaried in the second quarter. Second, as previously discussed, there were a number of competitive product launches in the first quarter of 2016, which led to additional year-over-year price erosion beyond what the leadership team had anticipated. Third, there were continued pricing headwinds from consolidated buying groups. These last 2 effects were considered in our May 12 guidance but not sufficient to reflect current aggressive market realities. Our new forecast process has reanalyzed the pricing environment in even more detail through the prism of these second quarter changes, and I'll talk about that in a few minutes. The Rx adjusted gross margin was down 720 basis points due to this year-over-year price erosion; and competition in the industry, which also impacted the adjusted operating margin.
Turning to Slide 16 and an update on our balance sheet.
As of July 2, 2016, total cash in the balance sheet was $642 million, and total debt was approximately $6.4 billion. As we have stated in the past, we are fully committed to our investment-grade ratings, which includes deleveraging our balance sheet through EBITDA growth and debt repayment. As part of that strategy, it has been stated, our stated commitment to repay our $500 million of senior notes that mature in November. We are following through on that commitment through a proactive redemption call of those notes, which we announced yesterday. We have elected to accelerate the repayment of that debt into September in order to clearly illustrate our unequivocal commitment to deleveraging and proactively utilize cash in our balance sheet while doing so in a manner that will be cost neutral to shareholders in our current year. We are and expect to remain in compliance with our debt covenants under our credit agreements as we continue to take actions to strengthen our balance sheet. We have multiple paths to achieve that goal, including EBITDA and cash flow generation enhanced through expense and CapEx management, as well as the flexibility to pursue additional debt paydowns and/or to opportunistically refinance our credit facilities in keeping with our conservative capital structure management philosophy.
We generated approximately $400 million of cash from operating activities during the first 6 months of the year. Remember that this includes the unfavorable impact of approximately $70 million from the normalization of accounts payable within Branded Consumer Healthcare I noted in the first quarter. Consistent with other activities the team is undertaking to drive performance at BCH, this action was successfully taken to establish a more sustainable and predictable cash flow pattern at the business and will not similarly burden our expected operating cash flow generation in the second half of this year.
With the changes in the forecast announced today, we are taking prudent, immediate steps to use our strong cash flow conversion to prioritize our capital allocation on deleveraging. While there may be small, tactical bolt-on acquisition opportunities, the team is first and foremost focused on execution. We are committed to a long-term balance sheet and capital allocation strategy that creates value for shareholders. This strategy includes our commitment to our investment-grade ratings. As such, we'll continue to focus on debt repayment and do not intend to reenter the share repurchase market in the near term.
Turning to Slide 18. Our adjusted EPS guidance has been updated to $6.85 per share to $7.15 per share, reflecting primarily changes in the Rx segment. So let me walk you through our updated 2016 expectations by business unit so you can better understand the different dynamics by segment.
Guidance for the CHC segment remains relatively unchanged, as we expect 2016 adjusted net sales of approximately $2.6 billion, excluding contributions from the VMS business. We continue to anticipate CHC adjusted operating margins in the second half of the year similar to those achieved in the first half. We have tempered our second half BCH performance expectations for unfavorable product mix. We expect BCH adjusted net sales to be approximately $1.3 billion and continue to anticipate low double-digit adjusted operating margin for calendar 2016. Note that we anticipate higher advertising and promotion spend in the third quarter versus the fourth quarter, translating into our expectation of adjusted operating income being more heavily weighted to the fourth quarter versus the third.
Now let's walk through the forecasting process used this quarter in our Rx segment, which as stated multiple times this morning has proven to be the most challenging area to forecast in this dynamic environment. We began by comprehensively reviewing all products, irrespective of size, on a bottoms-up basis, looking at both pricing and volume performance in the first half of the year versus previous assumptions; and then analyzing the second half of the year potential given current competitive dynamics. Excluding onetime items that impacted the first half of the year such as known incidences of loss of exclusivity and floor stock adjustments, the year-over-year price erosion run rate in the 6 months ended June was approximately 9%. Looking forward for the second half of the year, we conducted a comprehensive bottoms-up evaluation, adding in the effect of known price changes as well as the impact of anniversaried price erosion from the prior calendar year. On top of this, we included an incremental adjustment for potential additional unfavorable pricing trends, although thus far in the third quarter, we have seen the rate of change in the pricing environment moderate.
Through this process, we arrived at a second half year-over-year pricing erosion forecast of approximately 9% to 10% compared to the same period of the prior year. In addition, our updated guidance also reflects lower volume assumptions. We thus expect Rx net sales for 2016 to be approximately $1 billion, with adjusted operating margin forecasted to be in the low-40% range for the year. The Rx team continues to focus on the long term by managing a balance of price, volume, market share and expenses to limit the impact to operating margins.
On a consolidated basis, adjusted EPS for the third quarter of 2016 is expected to be the lowest of the year on higher operating expenditures for R&D and advertising and promotional investments.
Our adjusted effective tax rate for the year is estimated at 15%. And you should model 17% into the second half of the year.
Despite these announced expected changes in consolidated adjusted EPS performance, we continue to expect strong operating cash conversion in our business. Forecasted annual operating cash flow of over $900 million reflects a 90% conversion to adjusted net income. With over $640 million on the balance sheet and expanding operating cash flow, our platform continues to generate liquidity to execute on the deleveraging strategy discussed earlier. 
Now let me turn the call back over to John."

Turning to Slide 20. We anticipate new product launches over $300 million in 2016. This by itself represents growth of approximately 5%. As a reminder, this year, we have already launched fluticasone and half of the guaifenesin family of products. While not a comprehensive list, over the next 1.5 years, we expect to launch the remaining store brand versions of the guaifenesin family of products; and continue to launch from our Rx pipeline, notably including ProAir.
I also want to note that we recently received tentative approval from the FDA for OTC esomeprazole magnesium capsules, the store brand equivalent to Nexium. This is a key milestone towards an anticipated 2017 launch of this key, new store-brand Rx-to-OTC switch product. The regulatory timing to market and what our position might be from a first-to-market standpoint is still unclear, but we do know that we are the first store brand or generic filer that's received a tentative approval, which is a very important step. We are currently working with our retail customers and making plans to launch the item as soon as possible after the late-March 2017 market exclusivity period expires for the national brand. As I said, the exact timing of when we're able to launch remains undetermined.
Turning to Slide 21. Ultimately, I am confident that we are on a course to improve our performance and address our challenges. We have well-thought-out plans in place, and we will continue to execute against it.
Before opening up the call for your questions, I'd like to close by underscoring some of our competitive advantages and why I believe they will drive long-term shareholder value. First, our durable CHC platform continues to leverage our deep relationships and our leading market position in store brand OTC with numerous products, dosage forms and supply chain capabilities. We own more OTC ANDAs than any other manufacturer, including all the large branded pharmaceutical companies. Overall, the scale of our business is unmatched and operations continue to perform at the highest levels, delivering quality products into the medicine cabinets of consumers. Focusing on execution remains the priority as we continue to deliver predictable value.
Our European consumer platform is also a differentiator that draws on our consumer capabilities. We have been evaluating the segment country by country and are taking actions across the business, which I detailed earlier. We will continue to reinvest in the core to drive profitability in this segment. With our 3-pillar operational plan in place, I have confidence that we will enhance profitability of the BCH segment by prioritizing brands and channels to ensure we are delivering the greatest value.
To reiterate, the Rx business has a deep pipeline of new products; is committed to R&D investments; and will continue to offer differentiated products, particularly in those ""high barrier to entry"" areas where Perrigo has exceptional capabilities. This segment continues to deliver attractive adjusted operating margins, and we are committed to building confidence in our ability to deliver improved results despite industry volatility.
Overall, we are focused on improving our profitability and reviewing all aspects of our business and performance against our objectives. While we mentioned some actions we are taking today, we will continue to look at all aspects of value creation to drive optimal value from our unique portfolio. Perrigo is a strong company with a bright future. Despite the challenging times in a dynamic arts [ph] market, I have confidence that our people, our processes and the plans they have laid out will deliver meaningful results. We have more steps to take, but we are on the right path and making progress daily against our stated goals. Looking forward, I see a business with several great platforms of growth. There will always be a need for quality, affordable health care, and Perrigo provides that to millions of consumers and patients worldwide.

Rather than waiting until November with this paper maturity in November of 2016, we said we have the cash on the balance sheet. We can proactively go ahead and pay down that paper in September, and we are proceeding on that path right now as we speak. That will give us even more headroom, more cushion, again, not because there was a concern at the end of the year even with the adjusted EBITDA numbers but just to proactively demonstrate to everyone that we are indeed focused on deleveraging and utilizing our cash to do exactly that. In 2017, we have additional paper that will come due in Europe, and we intend fully to pay that down according to schedule. We could also proactively choose to early pay a term loan, given our cash flow planning, if we chose to do so. And/or we could conceptually opportunistically have discussions around our credit agreements, but at this point, as we look at our EBITDA projections as well as the step-down in the covenant leverage ratio requirement, we believe that we are comfortable but have plans in place to be proactive should any need require. And again, this is about demonstrating our long-term commitment to our investment-grade ratings and continuing to be able to demonstrate very -- in a very public way that, that is the intention of the utilization of cash flow."

It's just what we have there on the Rx side links into that OTC side. So those are all the pluses. I think that investing in R&D and in the right strategic opportunities and partners is certainly a opportunity there to expand that, but even without putting more in, we feel that there's a decent pipeline there.

Suffice it to say, as we're looking at 2017 with our internal plans, the big drivers that we look at growth for next year, and there is implied growth in our 2017 plans off of our internal 2016 number, are coming from many of the things that as -- John has already implied in the qualitative comments, which are reestablishing vigor in channel strategies in some of the markets in Europe that have been softer than had been originally anticipated; feeding the growth of the countries that are already performing quite well in advance of even market dynamics and continuing to feed that growth; rightsizing and organizing ourselves to drive back-office efficiencies and allow for expanded operating margins throughout Europe while continuing to fund advertising, promotion and new product development within the European team. So we are most certainly planning for an improved 2017 year in the branded consumer health, as the team is rightsizing and reestablishing themselves. We have new products on deck for next year, a long list of new products. There is a particularly large one on deck for next year in Rx, which we moved from the end of 2016 into 2017 and at a healthy margin plans to be a good contributor as well to the overall EPS growth in the year. And as John has likewise alluded to, taking a very hard look at how we spend in our SG&A and making sure that we are laser focused in being as efficient as possible given the recent dynamics so that we can in fact continue to drive bottom line growth. So not going to comment on consensus, as I'm presuming that at this stage consensus has become a bit irrelevant and effective 6:32 a.m. Eastern time today, but we will be continuing to provide you more color to be able to model 2017 both on these calls, in investor presentations and conferences as well as an upcoming Analyst Day."

And if I could ask a real question then for John, I guess. With respect to the Rx generics segment, the company over the years has done a very good job of kind of plugging growth holes with small product acquisitions or even arguably financial transactions such as, you mentioned this morning, kind of buying back the royalty stream. Now I assume that the prioritization around those efforts has kind of been elevated in light of the pricing erosion on the existing business. But how should we be thinking about strategic options that you still have with respect to that business? And specifically thinking about potential platform-type acquisitions to potentially even dramatically expand your size and scale in that business?"

And by the way, thank you for catching and correcting our previous statements. So I appreciate that. So when I think of the Rx, we have had a good segment there, small acquisitions that have fit in or done some things to add to it. Let me do one clarity first, the royalty stream, which is a great one, we entered into it a long time ago with our partner. We actually make the product. We sell the product. We do everything with it. We just had a profit share with our partner who invested with it initially. And so it was one that fits right into our operating strategy because it's already within our sites, within our plants. So it's a very natural fit, that one. I do think there are still strategic fits within our core segments within the Rx business that are open for investments and doing things. So I think it's not a -- that opportunity, everything's gone. I think there are opportunities there for adding products, adding technologies that are more unique that could position us in a decent position in those. So we're looking at all aspects of Rx when we say what should we get into, are there unique operating platforms that would -- could set us apart from others and how we expand that, if we do expand it."

So is this trouble with the system -- the reporting systems, the managers in the business, the lack of negotiations with payers?

And as you know, we've gone through an Rx management team change in the last few months. And we have seen continued price declines in the last few months. So I tried to elaborate in the prepared remarks, but maybe a little bit more color. The entire Rx leadership team came together and sat down and then went through every single product this time, taking a maybe a more jaded lens on the reality of the market in which they're competing. And as we commented on, I'll use the great analogy of Donald Rumsfeld. They first, in the past, got -- went through the known knowns. Their entire product lineup, what they know is happening, what they can actively see and manage and included that in their forecast. And this is the marketing team, the sales team, the individual commercial members as well as the folks who manage the contract filings. And went through the known knowns, fine, they did that in the past. In the past, they've stopped at some known unknowns with a little bit of wiggle room. But after the last quarter's performance, also went a step further and aggressively went and made some modeling assertions on known unknowns and as well went the next layer with unknown unknown. Because after the fourth -- second quarter and the accumulative effect of Q1 and Q2, the team under new leadership took a very different perspective on the potential for more dynamism on a go-forward basis, just given the rapid rate of change that they saw over the last 6 months. So it's not a reporting system problem, because if the accounting and the debits and credits and gross to net function as always, but rather a rapid pace of change unlike anything they had ever seen in the past. A very open dynamic with that -- between that team as well as the executive committee and talking very frankly and very openly about what they were seeing and putting forward assertions that made sense given the circumstances that we're working in today of trying to elaborate and be prepared for possible body blows if the pace of change were to -- were not to moderate as well. So that is the type of process they went through. I don't want to use the analogy of nuclear Armageddon. But given the last quarter, they definitely pushed hard on the unknown unknowns as well to try to prepare for the worst-case scenario."

So if you think of all of those, we are still on the early stages of expanding through. So we're going through, we're taking actions, we're trying to correct things as we go from both the brand standpoint, what are we putting innovation into, what are we driving, what's the focus for the team. From a country standpoint, it's going into countries and working that through. And then platform, we've worked previously -- a fair amount on the supply side and operating side. And that's where we're seeing those benefits come through on the P&L from a savings standpoint, but we still have a long ways to go on the total infrastructure side to enable it. So it is still a -- another, I'll say, 18 months kind of process to work ultimately through that. To where, in my mind, you have a well-oiled operating system. All that said, we have good countries, good parts, people are driving things, so it's not -- nothing happens until then. We're making changes all along that path. As far as Q2 strength, I'll say the team did a great job of having some good sales and driving that, also having some good cost controls and driving it. As we look at the year and investments we want to make and where it pans out, we're not ready to count on a 15% operating margin repeating every quarter yet. We believe we'll eventually get there and then some. But just don't want to plan on that for the next half, so we've lowered the expectations so we can continue to build out our infrastructure for the long term."

So again, if I step back, big picture-wise, looking at our Rx business, certainly, and it goes without saying, that the pricing changes and dynamics there have been very large and certainly were the main driver of the quarter, big part of our lowering guidance, so it's a big key. If I step back then and say, okay, let's look at the business today, after all those changes, after we built in the 9% to 10% to the back half, all of that, we still have a business with a great return on invested capital, a great operating margin, a great new product prospects. And so while I think there are many things we can do to enhance that business and drive more value and products to it, the main dynamic right now is this pricing dynamic. And that one is a -- got to get through it, got to allow that to happen and have our new product start hit again. We only describe Rx as a leaky bucket. We knew this was going to be a tough new products year and we've had more leaking out of the bucket from a pricing standpoint than we've been able to put in with new products and other kinds of pricing actions in the top.

So when we look at our models here, those synergies are pushed out further to the next the 1 to 2 years out in our models, whereas the operating synergies continue at a more aggressive pace than we're able to deliver those faster. So in reality, we couldn't get the approvals and the regulatory drivers fast as we had originally planned on the synergies. Judy, you want to take the margin side of the..."

Let me just comment a little bit on the operating margin perspective on this business which is, if you step back and look at the gross margin evolution since we've owned the company, you'll see gross margins in the low-50s. Approximately 80% of the BCH segment business is coming from branded OTC, as you all know there's a small slice to the business that is coming from our distribution of certain generics in Belgium. Top 20 brands make up about 55% of sales of the segment. Other owned brands make up another 1/4 of sales, so there's my 80%. Our top 20 brands are contributing gross margins in the low-60s. The other brands are in the low-50s. So that blended rate in the mid-50s for the branded products is, honestly, in line or even slightly better than competitive peers in the European consumer space, so solid, competitive gross margins. Our advertising and promotion spend for the business is in line with or frankly even a little soft compared to other players. And the main driving factor now for us to improve operating margins is finding ways to be more structurally efficient. So on a country-by-country basis, and we'll be elaborating on more of these in detail, finding ways to be more efficient in our go-to-market and importantly on a shared service platform, finding ways that we can deliver back office day-to-day services to the countries in a more efficient way so the teams can really focus their time and their energy on sales, market, product development, go-to-market and being close to their customers. So those types of initiatives, as John referred to, take more time. That's going to be the focus now of the transformation team is helping drive efficiencies across Europe to be able to drive more bottom line margin. Should it be a business that has operating margins in the high-teens nearing 20%? Absolutely. Do we have a line of sight to that as the team understand the implication and what has to be done? Yes. Does it happen tomorrow? No. But if you just look at the key metrics: products, gross margin, A&P, those are in line. And now it's about driving efficiency to the other lines to be able to progress our way towards high-teens operating margin in line with the competitive dynamic of other branded consumer companies."

We had a big second quarter on the consumer side last year driven by a few, you said. There was also the retail was right at lower inventory position and kind of want to get to a stronger level at that time. So there were just a myriad of things that just made that a big consumer front. When I look at -- just step back and look at market share or what's going on, first of all, we continue to do very well from a market share standpoint, grow at store brands, continue to do well and we, as our percent of store brands, continue to do well. The things that impact that, Douglas, as I look at it are, as brand launch, so we have the nasal spray product that launched, and we are in those, originally, they take share from cough/cold/allergy, those brands will. As we come in there, we start gaining our fair share of those categories. J&J started coming back on the shelf. And as they did, we maintained a good chunk of the share, but they do get some shelves spacing and part of that share. And usually, once they're on, we're able to again continue to grow and drive our share. So you did have some dynamic I would say over the last couple of years that have caused the share growth to not be as dynamic upwardly as it had been both in big new product launches and switches, Nexium and another example. That takes share and then how we're able to be out there with that product, were a little lower share of the whole category. So that's what happened sort of the year-over-year, new product switches, those kind of things dynamic the drive it. But I feel good about the position when we just look at share of products that we can't compete in, how we're doing in maintaining and driving those higher, how consumers are doing at still buying retail brands at a value point versus brands. So I feel good about those kind of initiatives."

And you look at historical run rates, as I noted, an exceptional quarter. The team performed very efficiently. And even if you talk about the mix dynamics and things that were -- the ins and the outs on the top line, even with softer top line sales and speaking of conceptually lower volume, they still drove amazing efficiencies and kept that AGM up high. Then you drop down, why didn't it flow through all the way to adjusted operating margin? Very, very clear, the team made a conscious choice and did the absolute right thing, which was continue to invest incremental dollars in R&D. Even with that R&D investment, I would not say that anyone should feel badly about an operating -- adjusted operating margin of 20.7%. Yes, while it is down year-over-year, they could have chosen not to make those R&D investments to keep the AGM or AOM up, but did the right thing to invest in the long term. As you'll see, the R&D investments in this whole business are forecasted for the full year to be higher on a year-over-year basis to continue to fund growth in 2017 and beyond."

I was thinking from a broader perspective, you guys used to talk about megatrends and one of them being that you would be able to gain continued incremental shares store brand against national brand about, I guess, 100 basis points a year. Is that trend overall still continuing? Are you sort of tapped out on that market share at this point? I know you just went through some of the dynamics with certain products, but just as megatrend, is that still continuing? And then the branded side, at what point -- I know you had some good sequential growth, but at what point do you get back to a normalized annualized growth for that business? I mean, what should we assume for that normal annualized growth?"

So I would say, if you step back with all the big picture, and this is a way step back, but we're all getting older, health care costs have done nothing but go up despite everything we try to do to manage them down, we all need more health care and we frankly have less money to spend on it. So from a macro dynamic -- and that's pretty global trends, so from a macro dynamic, looking for a value way to pay for some of those health care needs, in my mind, will continue to grow, so that challenge. I think when you look at people from a pure store brand standpoint and looking at a value there, in my mind, there are still potential for higher share gains. If you look at certain countries, certain product lines, the share is much higher than on every product line. So when I say, can you keep growing share? My answer would be yes. There is still growth there from a share standpoint, even in getting categories that are under their fair share, if you will, up to where a normalized fair share should be, there's opportunity. So I still think the growing share store brand and total growing share is a trend that Jeff and his team are continuing to drive and get after that. It happens not just with pure share growth and promotion, but bringing in new products. New products, bold new energy, they bring consumers to the market looking for those things and looking for equivalent kind of the products, so making sure they're out with new products. What sounds like a new product play really does help drive share kind of across the board because of those things, so I think it's still good opportunities. The brands are out and doing good innovations, which I think is great because that kind of drives interest in the market and provides new opportunities for us to continue to grow also. Second part of your question was branded annualized growth and looking at that. And I'll go back to my premise of we're in a correction phase, getting everything kind of aligned to make sure that we have a good operating platform, good growth vehicles of brands, good country operating performance to continue to drive them. I think with the infrastructures of what we have, we should be able to grow our products faster than the general markets are growing in those countries. And each country in Europe grows differently. I mean, that's probably the biggest thing I've learned over the last 10 years is, we call it Europe, but it's not. It's each country grows differently and different brand and product interest. I believe we can grow faster than those markets with the brands and the way we're positioning ourselves in those markets. But I'd rather give you a general number for Europe. I think we got to hold back on that until we look at specific country growth and how we fit in there and give you broader guidance on that."

While it would be imprudent, particularly in light of the answer I just gave Greg in terms of an Analyst Day and specific guidance to get granular on the numbers, suffice it to say that I've had the pleasure of spending time with many of the country leaders. And I will tell you that their enthusiasm for our combined companies, for the platform, for the ability to grow and have investments beyond what they've had in the past and to really be able to hit the ground running now with Sharon's leadership and the reorganization of his team and to be able to really drive for the future is pretty exciting to be around. So I'm not going to quote a number, but suffice it to say, they're raring to go. There are challenges certain countries are going to have.

How confident am I in the ability to execute on that tax number? For my colleagues in the executive committee who are listening to this call, I will say that the confidence in the ability to have the adjusted effective tax rate that we guided to today is entirely dependent on the jurisdictional mix of them delivering on their operating income earnings before tax in the updated guidance provided to you this morning. So if you feel good about the segment guidance, then by definition, we should have a clear line of sight to delivering on that slightly higher tax rate. We had guided to 14% adjusted effective tax rate and updated that to 15% given updated mix of income in this new guidance. And if you do your math, that says a higher rate or around 17% on average for the second half of the year. With respect to the GAAP/non-GAAP discussion which is all abuzz at the moment, that is also for us a pretty cut-and-dry answer. The tax-related items that flow through on our GAAP/non-GAAP tables within our press release this morning are related to tax effect of those items that are included as adjustments, like amortization of intangibles, et cetera. So we don't have any fancy math in there, it's pretty vanilla tax effective items on that list. So I don't expect or anticipate any drama related to that particular item."

I believe that this part, as I look at it, will normalize back to a mean. And a mean is a 5% to 6% normalized price decreases. I mean if you look back historically, those are the kind of numbers that you'd see in the industry, not kind of the ones that we're seeing at this stage. I don't have a better crystal ball, but when I look at it and say, okay, it has to normalize out, a great generic industry, and eventually gets back to a normalized point. So you get back to a 5% to 6% normal decreases without first-to-file other items, but just normalized bucket increases with new products on top of that, put on some pricing you might be able to get on other products that are way undervalued right now, to me you get back to more normalized level.

In the first 100 days, I have met with many of our shareholders to hear your thoughts about our company and the opportunities ahead. I have met with a number of our customers to hear what they expect from me and from my leadership team. And as always, I have spent considerable time speaking with employees across our sites worldwide.
I have looked at each of our segments under the lens of my principles, and there are several key themes you will see throughout our comments today. Our Consumer Healthcare segment continues to operate with strong margins. Our near-term focus remains delivering additional operational efficiencies and predictable bottom line value while continuing to invest in future growth initiatives. The Branded Consumer Healthcare segment, under the new leadership of Sharon Kochan, also in his 100th day of role in that position, performed generally consistent with our expectations in the quarter. Branded Consumer Healthcare continues to execute against our operating plan to enhance growth and develop the operating platform while at the same time prioritizing brand innovation and country-by-country channel strategies to drive the greatest value for shareholders. We have products and countries that are doing very well and some that are not yet meeting our expectations. As you know, this is a complicated, multidimensional business. And our plan will take time to generate margins commensurate with leading branded consumer businesses, but I believe those can be achieved.
The Rx business has been our most challenging to predict the short term given price erosion and the competitive dynamics in this sector. Despite those challenges, we continue to deliver attractive operating margins versus our RX pharma peers and believe in the long-term fundamentals of this business. Our comprehensive review of the business has resulted in lowering our outlook primarily due to pricing expectations. We will share with you the changes we are making to deliver more predictable results under our new leadership.
Our specialty science segment performed above our expectations in the first half of the year. While the short-term result of this noncore asset has been predictable, we continue to evaluate its long-term contributions within our portfolio and the best strategic use of its cash flows.
Turning to Slide 6. As I stated 3 months ago, in accordance with good, responsible leadership, my team and I are looking at ways to drive value across our businesses through the dual lenses of profitability and cash flow conversion. We're digging deep to determine the best ways to unleash more value for our core segments. We are taking actions to improve organizational effectiveness, operating leverage and our overall cost structure.
We have previously announced the sale of the U.S. VMS business, which closed last Friday; and the intent to sell both our API operation in India and our Etixx brand in Europe. In addition, we're announcing today that we are beginning to explore strategic alternatives for our businesses in Russia, South Africa, Argentina and our U.S. pet treats manufacturing operation in Kansas City.
We will continue to look at our operations to deliver shareholder value while investing and growing our core. To that end, I'm not only working with my deep leadership team here but also with our strong adviser network to ensure we are reviewing all of our businesses with the appropriate critical eye.
Turning to Slide 7. As for the quarter, our financial results were below internal expectations. And as for the headlines, while we delivered CHC operating income in line with our internal expectations and we continue to focus on improving the profitability of the BCH business, we continue to face pricing headwinds in Rx even greater than we had anticipated against the backdrop of a highly variable pharmaceutical pricing environment. To be clear: We missed our internal EPS in the quarter and expectations primarily as a result of the pricing impacts in this Rx segment. Judy will give detailed commentary regarding the final performance of our segment, but I would like to provide a few observations now.
Adjusted operating margins in the Consumer Healthcare segment were greater than 20% and continue to track near all-time highs. The team is executing against its operational targets, with the foundation of making high-quality products. I'm pleased to report that the store brand version of Flonase launched in the quarter, and the segment achieved $32 million in new product sales. Infant formula and smoking cessation categories also continued to perform very well.
Branded Consumer Healthcare adjusted net sales were generally in line with our expectation. Adjusted non-GAAP operating margins were 15%, an improvement over the first quarter margins, although adjusted gross profit margins were lower primarily due to weaker product mix. This was offset by cost-containment actions by the business unit in the quarter. We continue to build out the acquired products in the weight loss and smoking cessation categories across the platform, which is going very well. Collectively, as you think about our business, our consumer-facing segments still represent over 70% of our adjusted net sales for the quarter.
In Rx, we experienced a weaker second quarter than forecasted due largely to more aggressive pricing environment. Despite these headwinds, we continue to focus on generating healthy adjusted operating margins and driving our deep product pipeline forward. Notably during the quarter, we received approval for and launched the generic portion of BenzaClin. 
Let me turn to Slide 8 to dive deeper into Rx and walk you through what we are doing to better address the challenges we are facing in this segment. As stated in our press release issues -- issued earlier today, we have revised our adjusted EPS guidance for the full year to $6.85 to $7.15. A predominant factor impacting the updated guidance is continued price erosion within the Rx segment. Based on my evaluation of the segment, I want to first confirm that, despite lower guidance for the segment, I believe Rx is a fundamentally sound business with solid, strong long-term prospects. We remain in a leading market position with a deep pipeline into which we continue to invest. Our adjusted operating margins in the upper quartile of the Rx pharma sector remain very attractive. That said, Rx competes in a fast-moving, dynamic environment, as evidenced by public comments from the sector's peer, who have also disclosed greater price erosion than expected. Against our own expectations, price erosion in the quarter was unfavorable to adjusted operating income by approximately $20 million.
In light of this price erosion and our performance against our expectations this quarter, we've taken an even more pragmatic approach to forecasting for the second half of the year. We conducted a thorough evaluation and added any effect of known price changes, all anniversary-ing price erosions in the prior calendar year. In addition, we included incremental adjustments for potential additional unfavorable pricing trends, although so far in Q3 we have not seen the rate of change in the pricing environment moderate. Through this process, we arrived at a price erosion forecast for the second half of the year of approximately 9% to 10% compared to the same period in 2015. Judy will walk through this process in even greater details in a few minutes.
We continue to execute against our strategy for this segment, focusing on tougher-to-manufacture products with higher barriers to entry. We believe these products have greater longevity. As an example of this strategy, we're announcing today that we very recently purchased the remaining portion of the generic BenzaClin royalty stream that we did not own previously. As I just noted, BenzaClin was approved and launched in the quarter, and we see it as a longer-term asset from which we will now capture 100% of the economics. While we continue to search for the best candidate internally and externally to lead this segment, I am confident in John Wesolowski and the rest of our highly experienced Rx team in their ability to drive operating margins built upon a deep pipeline, maintaining current partnerships and developing new ones as well.
Now turning to the BCH segment on Slide 9. We have also updated guidance to reflect our current estimates for net sales and margin mix. As we now anticipate lower revenues for certain high-margin products, we have developed a 3-pillar plan to enhance profitability in the BCH business: review routes to market, optimize our portfolio and enhance the segment's effectiveness to mid- to high-teen operating margins.
First, we are prioritizing brand strategies in core markets which we expect to enable more predictable financial results. For example, last summer, we acquired the Yokebe meal replacement product, which is now a direct complement to our weight loss franchise XLS. We now will have a full range of weight loss tablet products. And now we have added meal replacement products to the franchise, providing our customers with a suite of product offerings addressing various consumer preferences. At the end of this quarter, we rolled out Yokebe in the U.K., Holland and Belgium, within 6 months post-acquisition of purchasing the brand in Germany; and now have concrete plans to launch in other markets before the end of the year. We expect this family to be a primary driver of new products for this segment and an exciting contributor to organic growth next year. Another example has been our success with reinvigorating growth behind NiQuitin, the smoking cessation brand we acquired last September. We launched new market programs behind the core patch product; and are rebuilding the mini-lozenge product distribution, which is gaining market share. In addition, new innovation will follow later this year to substantiate our global leadership position within the smoking cessation category.
Second, we are making structural changes that include actions already underway such as aligning our presence in the markets we serve by consolidating certain markets under efficient clusters, uniting our sales forces in certain markets and considering partners who can better manage commercial sales efforts in particular countries. If we identify a particular product or geography that is not meeting our hurdle rate, then we will take action, with a commitment to increase profitability and cash flow conversion. For example, we continue to execute our restructuring plans announced in February. We have completed our sales force consolidation and realignment actions involving Germany and Spain and recently entered into consultation discussions with employees regarding the future direction of one of our BCH manufacturing facilities. We have also initiated the process to sell our Etixx brand in Europe. Additionally, as I've previously mentioned this morning, we are announcing further tangible actions to address market structures in certain countries, which will reduce operating costs and improve our profitability as we nurture sustainable growth in our top markets. This allows us to reinvest resources to high-performing parts of our business. Specifically, we are combining our markets under regional clusters; and looking at alternative strategies for our businesses in Russia, South Africa and Argentina.
Third, we are progressing with our integration plans to build out Perrigo's proven business processes onto the European platform. For example, we continue to have great success enhancing BCH's supply chain efficiencies. We anticipate approximately $40 million in savings per annum with projects that are already underway, which we expect to realize in the next 2 to 3 years.
An important element underpinning our plans is our people. We have a talented team in Europe. And we are excited about the new talent we have injected into the organization, including a new leader of Pan-European marketing efforts, new country leadership and increases to our integration team in Europe to accelerate our process transformation. As I've said before, there is substantial work to be done, but I am confident we can create greater shareholder value by improving and further leveraging this important consumer platform. The path of steadily improving margins is multifaceted and it will take time, but the team has an actionable, multilayered plan to improve profitability.
Now I'm going to turn over to Judy to go over some more details."

Good morning, everyone.On Slide 11, you can see second quarter adjusted consolidated net sales were $1.4 billion, down $55 million or 3% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, excluding sales from held-for-sale businesse",1653,"Thank you very much, John. Good morning, everyone.
On Slide 11, you can see second quarter adjusted consolidated net sales were $1.4 billion, down $55 million or 3% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, excluding sales from held-for-sale businesses in both the periods presented. This was driven by certain categories within the CHC segment, which I'll discuss in a moment, offset in part by increased sales in the Rx segment, which were driven largely by sales related to acquisitions and new products.
Looking at the segment results on Slide 12. CHC adjusted net sales were down approximately $63 million year-over-year or 8% on a constant currency basis, excluding sales from held-for-sale businesses in both periods. This was largely attributable to a weaker allergy season compared to last year, timing of customer promotional programs and lower net sales in the OTC contract manufacturing category. In addition, the analgesic category showed a net sales decline due primarily to relatively lower pricing. These decreases were partially offset by higher net sales in the infant nutrition and smoking cessation categories. New product sales were $32 million, driven primarily by the store brand launches of Flonase and new infant formulas.
Adjusted gross profit margin remained strong at 36.6%, as we experienced favorable product mix in the quarter and continued to leverage our supply chain proficiencies, offsetting the effects of lower pricing in certain categories. We continued to focus on our growth plan with increased R&D investments, which were 33% higher than last year on an adjusted basis.
As John mentioned earlier, the priorities for this segment are twofold: first, delivering strong, predictable results by focusing on operational efficiencies; and second, investing in our future growth initiatives. The quarterly results for this segment are consistent with these priorities.
Turning to Slide 13. In the quarter, Branded Consumer Healthcare segment's adjusted net sales were $394 million compared with $401 million last year. The team delivered top and bottom line results in line with our internal expectations. These results included $29 million from acquisitions, while new products contributed $28 million, led by innovation in the lifestyle category. Offsetting the favorable contribution of acquisitions and new products, the segment experienced lower adjusted gross margin due to unfavorable product mix and the comparison with a significant new product launch in the lifestyle segment in the second quarter of 2015. The effect of lower gross profit margins was offset by cost control in this segment, resulting in adjusted operating margin for the quarter of approximately 15%, in line with our expectations.
Turning now to Rx on Slide 14. Net sales were $293 million, 5% higher than last year, driven largely by $44 million related to acquisitions and new product sales of $26 million. As John mentioned a few minutes ago, our consolidated earnings were short of our internal forecast in the quarter due to the continued price erosion in this segment, which obviously flowed through directly to adjusted operating income as well.
At a summary level, 3 factors affected year-over-year pricing in the quarter. First, the lack of an exclusive market position for 2 key products versus the prior year had an unfavorable impact. This first aspect was known and included in our May guidance. This impact anniversaried in the second quarter. Second, as previously discussed, there were a number of competitive product launches in the first quarter of 2016, which led to additional year-over-year price erosion beyond what the leadership team had anticipated. Third, there were continued pricing headwinds from consolidated buying groups. These last 2 effects were considered in our May 12 guidance but not sufficient to reflect current aggressive market realities. Our new forecast process has reanalyzed the pricing environment in even more detail through the prism of these second quarter changes, and I'll talk about that in a few minutes. The Rx adjusted gross margin was down 720 basis points due to this year-over-year price erosion; and competition in the industry, which also impacted the adjusted operating margin.
Turning to Slide 16 and an update on our balance sheet.
As of July 2, 2016, total cash on the balance sheet was $642 million, and total debt was approximately $6.4 billion. As we have stated in the past, we are fully committed to our investment-grade ratings, which includes deleveraging our balance sheet through EBITDA growth and debt repayment. As part of that strategy, it has been stated, our stated commitment to repay our $500 million of senior notes that mature in November. We are following through on that commitment through a proactive redemption call of those notes, which we announced yesterday. We have elected to accelerate the repayment of that debt into September in order to clearly illustrate our unequivocal commitment to deleveraging and proactively utilize cash in our balance sheet while doing so in a manner that will be cost neutral to shareholders in our current year. We are and expect to remain in compliance with our debt covenants under our credit agreements as we continue to take actions to strengthen our balance sheet. We have multiple paths to achieve that goal, including EBITDA and cash flow generation enhanced through expense and CapEx management, as well as the flexibility to pursue additional debt paydowns and/or to opportunistically refinance our credit facilities in keeping with our conservative capital structure management philosophy.
We generated approximately $400 million of cash from operating activities during the first 6 months of the year. Remember that this includes the unfavorable impact of approximately $70 million from the normalization of accounts payable within Branded Consumer Healthcare I noted in the first quarter. Consistent with other activities the team is undertaking to drive performance at BCH, this action was successfully taken to establish a more sustainable and predictable cash flow pattern at the business and will not similarly burden our expected operating cash flow generation in the second half of this year.
With the changes in the forecast announced today, we are taking prudent, immediate steps to use our strong cash flow conversion to prioritize our capital allocation on deleveraging. While there may be small, tactical bolt-on acquisition opportunities, the team is first and foremost focused on execution. We are committed to a long-term balance sheet and capital allocation strategy that creates value for shareholders. This strategy includes our commitment to our investment-grade ratings. As such, we'll continue to focus on debt repayment and do not intend to reenter the share repurchase market in the near term.
Turning to Slide 18. Our adjusted EPS guidance has been updated to $6.85 per share to $7.15 per share, reflecting primarily changes in the Rx segment. So let me walk you through our updated 2016 expectations by business unit so you can better understand the different dynamics by segment.
Guidance for the CHC segment remains relatively unchanged, as we expect 2016 adjusted net sales of approximately $2.6 billion, excluding contributions from the VMS business. We continue to anticipate CHC adjusted operating margins in the second half of the year similar to those achieved in the first half. We have tempered our second half BCH performance expectations for unfavorable product mix. We expect BCH adjusted net sales to be approximately $1.3 billion and continue to anticipate low double-digit adjusted operating margin for calendar 2016. Note that we anticipate higher advertising and promotion spend in the third quarter versus the fourth quarter, translating into our expectation of adjusted operating income being more heavily weighted to the fourth quarter versus the third.
Now let's walk through the forecasting process used this quarter in our Rx segment, which as stated multiple times this morning has proven to be the most challenging area to forecast in this dynamic environment. We began by comprehensively reviewing all products, irrespective of size, on a bottoms-up basis, looking at both pricing and volume performance in the first half of the year versus previous assumptions; and then analyzing the second half of the year potential given current competitive dynamics. Excluding onetime items that impacted the first half of the year such as known incidences of loss of exclusivity and floor stock adjustments, the year-over-year price erosion run rate in the 6 months ended June was approximately 9%. Looking forward for the second half of the year, we conducted a comprehensive bottoms-up evaluation, adding in the effect of known price changes as well as the impact of anniversaried price erosion from the prior calendar year. On top of this, we included an incremental adjustment for potential additional unfavorable pricing trends, although thus far in the third quarter, we have seen the rate of change in the pricing environment moderate.
Through this process, we arrived at a second half year-over-year pricing erosion forecast of approximately 9% to 10% compared to the same period of the prior year. In addition, our updated guidance also reflects lower volume assumptions. We thus expect Rx net sales for 2016 to be approximately $1 billion, with adjusted operating margin forecasted to be in the low-40% range for the year. The Rx team continues to focus on the long term by managing a balance of price, volume, market share and expenses to limit the impact to operating margins.
On a consolidated basis, adjusted EPS for the third quarter of 2016 is expected to be the lowest of the year on higher operating expenditures for R&D and advertising and promotional investments.
Our adjusted effective tax rate for the year is estimated at 15%. And you should model 17% into the second half of the year.
Despite these announced expected changes in consolidated adjusted EPS performance, we continue to expect strong operating cash conversion in our business. Forecasted annual operating cash flow of over $900 million reflects a 90% conversion to adjusted net income. With over $640 million on the balance sheet and expanding operating cash flow, our platform continues to generate liquidity to execute on the deleveraging strategy discussed earlier. 
Now let me turn the call back over to John."

Turning to Slide 20. We anticipate new product launches over $300 million in 2016. This by itself represents growth of approximately 5%. As a reminder, this year, we have already launched fluticasone and half of the guaifenesin family of products. While not a comprehensive list, over the next 1.5 years, we expect to launch the remaining store brand versions of the guaifenesin family of products; and continue launch from our Rx pipeline, notably including ProAir.
I also want to note that we recently received tentative approval from the FDA for OTC esomeprazole magnesium capsules, the store brand equivalent to Nexium. This is a key milestone towards an anticipated 2017 launch of this key, new store-brand Rx-to-OTC switch product. The regulatory timing to market and what our position might be from a first-to-market standpoint is still unclear, but we do know that we are the first store brand or generic filer that's received a tentative approval, which is a very important step. We are currently working with our retail customers and making plans to launch the item as soon as possible after the late-March 2017 market exclusivity period expires for the national brand. As I said, the exact timing of when we're able to launch remains undetermined.
Turning to Slide 21. Ultimately, I am confident that we are on a course to improve our performance and address our challenges. We have well-thought-out plans in place, and we will continue to execute against it.
Before opening up the call for your questions, I'd like to close by underscoring some of our competitive advantages and why I believe they will drive long-term shareholder value. First, our durable CHC platform continues to leverage our deep relationships and our leading market position in store brand OTC with numerous products, dosage forms and supply chain capabilities. We own more OTC ANDAs than any other manufacturer, including all the large branded pharmaceutical companies. Overall, the scale of our business is unmatched and operations continue to perform at the highest levels, delivering quality products into the medicine cabinets of consumers. Focusing on execution remains the priority as we continue to deliver predictable value.
Our European consumer platform is also a differentiator that draws on our consumer capabilities. We have been evaluating the segment country by country and are taking actions across the business, which I detailed earlier. We will continue to reinvest in the core to drive profitability in this segment. With our 3-pillar operational plan in place, I have confidence that we will enhance profitability of the BCH segment by prioritizing brands and channels to ensure we are delivering the greatest value.
To reiterate, the Rx business has a deep pipeline of new products; is committed to R&D investments; and will continue to offer differentiated products, particularly in those ""high barrier to entry"" areas where Perrigo has exceptional capabilities. This segment continues to deliver attractive adjusted operating margins, and we are committed to building confidence in our ability to deliver improved results despite industry volatility.
Overall, we are focused on improving our profitability and reviewing all aspects of our business and performance against our objectives. While we mentioned some actions we are taking today, we will continue to look at all aspects of value creation to drive optimal value from our unique portfolio. Perrigo is a strong company with a bright future. Despite the challenging times in a dynamic arts [ph] market, I have confidence that our people, our processes and the plans they have laid out will deliver meaningful results. We have more steps to take, but we are on the right path and making progress daily against our stated goals. Looking forward, I see a business with several great platforms of growth. There will always be a need for quality, affordable health care, and Perrigo provides that to millions of consumers and patients worldwide.

In 2017, we have additional paper that will come due in Europe, and we intend fully to pay that down according to schedule. We could also proactively choose to early pay a term loan, given our cash flow planning, if we chose to do so.

So logically speaking, if you were to take the first half of the year actual EPS generated and the midpoint of the EPS guidance we just provided you, it would imply a second half decline over first half. Annualize that into next year, and it obviously is going to be well off consensus for 2017, although granted consensus as of this morning has not been updated to fully reflect the changes in the environment that we highlighted in great depth on the official comments this morning. Suffice it to say, as we're looking at 2017 with our internal plans, the big drivers that we look at growth for next year, and there is implied growth in our 2017 plans off of our internal 2016 number, are coming from many of the things that -- as John has already implied in the qualitative comments, which are reestablishing vigor in channel strategies in some of the markets in Europe that have been softer than had been originally anticipated; feeding the growth of the countries that are already performing quite well in advance of even market dynamics and continuing to feed that growth; rightsizing and organizing ourselves to drive back-office efficiencies and allow for expanded operating margins throughout Europe while continuing to fund advertising, promotion and new product development within the European team. So we are most certainly planning for an improved 2017 year in the branded consumer health, as the team is rightsizing and reestablishing themselves. We have new products on deck for next year, a long list of new products. There is a particularly large one on deck for next year in Rx, which we moved from the end of 2016 into 2017 and at a healthy margin plans to be a good contributor as well to the overall EPS growth of the year. And as John has likewise alluded to, taking a very hard look at how we spend in our SG&A and making sure that we are laser focused in being as efficient as possible given the recent dynamics so that we can in fact continue to drive bottom line growth. So not going to comment on consensus, as I'm presuming that at this stage consensus has become a bit irrelevant at effective 6:32 a.m. Eastern time today, but we will be continuing to provide you more color to be able to model 2017 both on these calls, in investor presentations and conferences as well as an upcoming Analyst Day."

And if I could ask a real question then for John, I guess. With respect to the Rx generics segment, the company over the years has done a very good job of kind of plugging growth holes with small product acquisitions or even arguably financial transactions such as, you mentioned this morning, kind of buying back the royalty stream. Now I assume that the prioritization around those efforts has kind of been elevated in light of the pricing erosion on the existing business. But how should we be thinking about strategic options that you still have with respect to that business?

And by the way, thank you for catching and correcting our previous statements. So I appreciate that. So when I think of the Rx, we have had a good segment there, small acquisitions that have fit in or done some things to add to it. Let me do one clarity first, the royalty stream, which is a great one, we entered into this a long time ago with our partner. We actually make the product. We sell the product. We do everything with it. We just had a profit share with our partner who invested with it initially. And so it was one that fits right into our operating strategy because it's already within our sites, within our plants. So it's a very natural fit, that one. I do think there are still strategic fits within our core segments within the Rx business that are open for investments and doing things. So I think it's not a dead opportunity, everything's gone. I think there are opportunities there for adding products, adding technologies that are more unique that could position us in a decent position in those. So we're looking at all aspects of Rx when we say what should we get into, are there unique operating platforms that would -- could set us apart from others and how we expand that, if we do expand it."

So is this trouble with the systems -- the reporting systems, the managers in the business, the lack of negotiations with payers?

And as you know, we've gone through an Rx management team change in the last few months. And we have seen continued price declines in the last few months. So I tried to elaborate in the prepared remarks, but maybe a little bit more color. The entire Rx leadership team came together and sat down and then went through every single product this time, taking a maybe a more jaded lens on the reality of the market in which they're competing. And as we commented on, I'll use the great analogy of Donald Rumsfeld. They first, in the past, got -- went through the known knowns. Their entire product lineup, what they know is happening, what they can actively see and manage and included that in their forecast. And this is the marketing team, the sales team, the individual commercial members as well as the folks who manage the contract filings. And went through the known knowns, fine, they did that in the past. In the past, they've stopped at some known unknowns with a little bit of wiggle room. But after the last quarter's performance, also went a step further and aggressively went and made some modeling assertions on known unknowns and as well went the next layer with unknown unknowns. Because after the fourth -- second quarter and the accumulative effect of Q1 and Q2, the team under new leadership took a very different perspective on the potential for more dynamism on a go-forward basis, just given the rapid rate of change that they saw over the last 6 months. So it's not a reporting system problem, because if the accounting and the debits and credits and the gross to net function as always, but rather a rapid pace of change unlike anything they had ever seen in the past. A very open dynamic with that -- between that team as well as the executive committee and talking very frankly and very openly about what they were seeing and putting forward assertions that made sense given the circumstances that we're working in today of trying to elaborate and be prepared for possible body blows if the pace of change were to -- were not to moderate as well. So that is the type of process they went through. I don't want to use the analogy of nuclear Armageddon. But given the last quarter, they definitely pushed hard on the unknown unknowns as well to try to prepare for the worst-case scenario."

So we're going through, we're taking actions, we're trying to correct things as we go from both the brand standpoint, what are we putting innovation into, what are we driving, what's the focus for the team. From a country standpoint, it's going into countries and working that through. And then platform, we've worked previously -- a fair amount on the supply side and operating side. And that's where we're seeing those benefits come through on the P&L from a savings standpoint, but we still have a long ways to go on the total infrastructure side to enable it. So it is still a -- another, I'll say, 18 months kind of process to work ultimately through that. To where, in my mind, you have a well-oiled operating system. All that said, we have good countries, good parts, people are driving things, so it's not -- nothing happens till then. We're making changes all along that path. As far as Q2 strength, I'll say the team did a great job of having some good sales and driving that, also having some good cost controls and driving it. As we look at the year and investments we want to make and where it pans out, we're not ready to count on a 15% operating margin repeating every quarter yet. We believe we'll eventually get there and then some.

And so while I think there are many things we can do to enhance that business and drive more value and products to it, the main dynamic right now is this pricing dynamic. And that one is a -- got to get through it, got to allow that to happen and have our new product start hit again. We always describe Rx as a leaky bucket. We knew this was going to be a tough new products year and we've had more leaking out of the bucket from a pricing standpoint than we've been able to put in with new products and other kinds of pricing actions in the top.

We're going to be doing that, as John mentioned, very comprehensively with our board, not only looking at our own plans, looking at the overall marketplace and environment. And all of that comes together to be able to prepare for that dialogue with The Street in terms of our perspective on '17 and beyond so that we're not only looking at the classic business unit stream, but putting that whole perspective together, as John mentioned, on looking at all assets, looking at the ones that are not perhaps performing in line with our expectations and the road to recovery and investments required therein and to be able to put all of that into a comprehensive view of forward-looking guidance rather than isolating it only to top line growth run rates, but really give you a broader perspective on the overall portfolio."

There are 2 or 3 suppliers out there in the market. We'd still -- with Jeff and his business have usually done a good job of getting their fair share of those kind of complex products. So I don't think this will be a 10-person market. It's just a unique product. And at some point, there's more complexity on there. So that's my perspective. It could be wrong, but that's in general where I think that market will end up. We -- on the limited guaranteed launch, we've not talked about that. And at this point, can't talk further about what that means and the quantities or volumes that, that means. We'll have to come back to that one at a later time. McKesson-Walmart. So McKesson has distributed some of Walmart's products within our normal consumer business. Previously, some of their pseudoephedrine products or other products are distributed through McKesson, they've had that relationship on some of the OTC products. But as far as the full impact, it really is a 2017, where more of our products could cross over through McKesson in some of those distributions. But McKesson does do some distribution already with some of those major retailers on some of their more controlled-type OTC products."

Let me just comment a little bit on the operating margin perspective on this business which is, if you step back and look at the gross margin evolution since we've owned the company, you'll see gross margins in the low-50s. Approximately 80% of the BCH segment business is coming from branded OTC, as you all know there's a small slice to the business that is coming from our distribution of certain generics in Belgium. Top 20 brands make up about 55% of sales of the segment. Other owned brands make up another 1/4 of sales, so there's my 80%. Our top 20 brands are contributing gross margins in the low-60s. The other brands are in the low-50s. So that blended rate in the mid-50s for the branded products is, honestly, in line or even slightly better than competitive peers in the European consumer space, so solid, competitive gross margins. Our advertising and promotion spend for the business is in line with or frankly even a little soft compared to other players. And the main driving factor now for us to improve operating margins is finding ways to be more structurally efficient. So on a country-by-country basis, and we'll be elaborating on more of these in detail, finding ways to be more efficient in our go-to-market and importantly on a shared service platform, finding ways that we can deliver on back office day-to-day services to the countries in a more efficient way so the teams can really focus their time and their energy on sales, market, product development, go-to-market and being close to their customers. So those types of initiatives, as John referred to, take more time. That's going to be the focus now of the transformation team is helping drive efficiencies across Europe to be able to drive more bottom line margin. Should it be a business that has operating margins in the high-teens nearing 20%? Absolutely. Do we have a line of sight to that? Does the team understand the implication and what has to be done? Yes. Does it happen tomorrow? No. But if you just look at the key metrics: products, gross margin, A&P, those are in line. And now it's about driving efficiency to the other lines to be able to progress our way towards high-teens operating margin in line with the competitive dynamic of other branded consumer companies."

We had a big second quarter in the consumer side last year driven by a few, you said. There was also the retailers were at a lower inventory position and kind of wanted to get to a stronger level at that time. So there were just a myriad of things that just made that a big consumer front. When I look at -- just step back and look at market share or what's going on, first of all, we continue to do very well from a market share standpoint, grow at store brands, continue to do well and we, as our percent of store brands, continue to do well. The things that impact that, Douglas, as I look at it are, as brand launch, so we had the nasal spray product that launched, and we are in those, originally, they take share from cough/cold/allergy, those brands will. As we come in there, we start gaining our fair share of those categories. J&J started coming back on the shelf. And as they did, we maintained a good chunk of the share, but they do get some shelf spacing and part of that share. And usually, once they're on, we're able to again continue to grow and drive our share. So you did have some dynamics, I would say, over the last couple of years that have caused the share growth to not be as dynamic upwardly as it had been both in big new product launches and switches, Nexium and another example. That takes share and then how we're able to be out there with that product, we're a little lower share of the whole category. So that's what happened sort of in the year-over-year, new product switches, those kind of things dynamic that drive it. But I feel good about the position when we just look at share of products that we can compete in, how we're doing in maintaining and driving those higher, how consumers are doing at still buying retail brands at a value point versus brands. So I feel good about those kind of initiatives."

Then you drop down, why didn't it flow through all the way to adjusted operating margin? Very, very clear, the team made a conscious choice and did the absolute right thing, which was continue to invest incremental dollars in R&D. Even with that R&D investment, I would not say that anyone should feel badly about an operating -- adjusted operating margin of 20.7%. Yes, while it is down year-over-year, they could have chosen not to make those R&D investments to keep the AGM or AOM up, but did the right thing to invest in the long term.

I know you just went through some of the dynamics with certain products, but just as megatrend, is that still continuing?

So I would say, if you step back with all the big picture, and this is a way step back, but we're all getting older, health care costs have done nothing but go up despite everything we try to do to manage them down, we all need more health care and we frankly have less money to spend on it. So from a macro dynamic -- and that's pretty global trends, so from a macro dynamic, looking for a value way to pay for some of those health care needs, in my mind, will continue to grow, so that challenge. I think when you look at people from a pure store brand standpoint and looking at a value there, in my mind, there are still potential for higher share gains. If you look at certain countries, certain product lines, the share is much higher than on every product line. So when I say, can you keep growing share? My answer would be yes. There is still growth there from a share standpoint, even in getting categories that are under their fair share, if you will, up to where a normalized fair share should be, there's opportunity. So I still think the growing share store brand and total growing share is a trend that Jeff and his team are continuing to drive and get after that. It happens not just with pure share growth and promotion, but bringing in new products. New products, bold new energy, they bring consumers to the market looking for those things and looking for equivalent kind of products, so making sure they're out with new products. What sounds like a new product play really does help drive share kind of across the board because of those things, so I think it's still good opportunities. The brands are out and doing good innovations, which I think is great because that kind of drives interest in the market and provides new opportunities for us to continue to grow also. Second part of your question was branded annualized growth and looking at that. And I'll go back to my premise of we're in a correction phase, getting everything kind of aligned to make sure that we have a good operating platform, good growth vehicles of brands, good country operating performance to continue to drive them. I think with the infrastructures of what we have, we should be able to grow our products faster than the general markets are growing in those countries. And each country in Europe grows differently. I mean, that's probably the biggest thing I've learned over the last 10 years is, we call it Europe, but it's not. It's each country grows differently and different brand and product interest. I believe we can grow faster than those markets with the brands and the way we're positioning ourselves in those markets. But I'd rather give you a general number for Europe. I think we got to hold back on that until we look at specific country growth and how we fit in there and give you broader guidance on that."

How confident am I in the ability to execute on that tax number?

We had guided to 14% adjusted effective tax rate and updated that to 15% given updated mix of income in this new guidance. And if you do your math, that says a higher rate or around 17% on average for the second half of the year. With respect to the GAAP/non-GAAP discussion which is all abuzz at the moment, that is also for us a pretty cut-and-dry answer. The tax-related items that flow through on our GAAP/non-GAAP tables within our press release this morning are related to tax effect of those items that are included as adjustments, like amortization of intangibles, et cetera.

I mean, if you look back historically, those are the kind of numbers that you'd see in the industry, not kind of the ones that we're seeing at this stage. I don't have a better crystal ball, but when I look at it and say, okay, it has to normalize out, a great generic industry, and eventually gets back to a normalized point. So you get back to a 5% to 6% normal decreases without first-to-file other items, but just normalized bucket increases with new products on top of that, put on some pricing you might be able to get on other products that are way undervalued right now, to me you get back to a more normalized level.

Typically, when we think about price erosion on consumer, we're able to balance that out with some pricing, some new products and kind of manage the overall portfolio when you look at it. But it has some of the similar dynamics, not quite as dramatic because your starting point is a lot different, but some of the same dynamics as the other business. Jeff and team have managed it well to try and look at the whole basket and say, how do we get the value from the whole basket that we're bringing there."

And at the end of the day, all of the comments and actions we're taking right now with respect to the balance sheet, coming back full circle to Jami's first question on this call, are about a prudent capital strategy and a prudent capital management strategy, making sure that we, as a management team, are considering the capability of building cushion, having optimal working flexibility as an organization. And at this point in time, given our commitment to investment grade and our plans to continue on our debt repay down strategy, we believe that at this point in time, it's the most prudent thing to do to put that repo on hold and make sure that we're razor-focused on operations and the most optimal balance sheet possible."

Branded consumer, turning that around, driving in the right direction, a good platform, still needs a fair amount of work, fair amount of focus, but good driver there of what we need to do.

On Slide 4, you will see today's agenda. First, I will provide an update on progress made executing on the strategic priorities outlined in May, followed by an overview of the quarter for the business units. I will provide you detail regarding the first phases of our strategic plan to improve operational performance, including an update on the specific actions we have already completed and some others underway. Then Judy will walk through the financial results for the quarter as well as the details that are behind our guidance revisions. Finally, I will provide my perspective on our business for the remainder of the year and longer term.
I've just completed my first 100 days as CEO at Perrigo. They have been intense and challenging. They have also been very productive. I have been taking a comprehensive look at our business strategically, operationally and financially; and am doing so with an open mind as to the path forward. You should know that I remain committed to the 4 governing principles that I outlined in May: disciplined execution; taking swift and decisive actions when necessary; being transparent with our owners, customers and employees; and above all, creating shareholder value. In the first 100 days, I have met with many of our shareholders to hear your thoughts about our company and the opportunities ahead. I have met with a number of our customers to hear what they expect from me and from my leadership team. And as always, I have spent considerable time speaking with employees across our sites worldwide.
I have looked at each of our segments under the lens of my principles, and there are several key themes you will see throughout our comments today. Our Consumer Healthcare segment continues to operate with strong margins. Our near-term focus remains delivering additional operational efficiencies and predictable bottom line value while continuing to invest in future growth initiatives. The Branded Consumer Healthcare segment, under the new leadership of Sharon Kochan, also in his 100th day of role in that position, performed generally consistent with our expectations in the quarter. Branded Consumer Healthcare continues to execute against our operating plan to enhance growth and develop the operating platform while at the same time prioritizing brand innovation and country-by-country channel strategies to drive the greatest value for shareholders. We have products and countries that are doing very well and some that are not yet meeting our expectations. As you know, this is a complicated, multidimensional business. And our plan will take time to generate margins commensurate with leading branded consumer businesses, but I believe those can be achieved.
The Rx business has been our most challenging to predict the short term given price erosion and the competitive dynamics in this sector. Despite those challenges, we continue to deliver attractive operating margins versus our RX pharma peers and believe in the long-term fundamentals of this business. Our comprehensive review of the business has resulted in lowering our outlook primarily due to pricing expectations. We will share with you the changes we are making to deliver more predictable results under our new leadership.
Our specialty science segment performed above our expectations in the first half of the year. While the short-term result of this noncore asset has been predictable, we continue to evaluate its long-term contributions within our portfolio and the best strategic use of its cash flows.
Turning to Slide 6. As I stated 3 months ago, in accordance with good, responsible leadership, my team and I are looking at ways to drive value across our businesses through the dual lenses of profitability and cash flow conversion. We're digging deep to determine the best ways to unleash more value for our core segments. We are taking actions to improve organizational effectiveness, operating leverage and our overall cost structure.
We have previously announced the sale of the U.S. VMS business, which closed last Friday; and the intent to sell both our API operation in India and our Etixx brand in Europe. In addition, we're announcing today that we are beginning to explore strategic alternatives for our businesses in Russia, South Africa, Argentina and our U.S. pet treats manufacturing operation in Kansas City.
We will continue to look at our operations to deliver shareholder value while investing and growing our core. To that end, I'm not only working with my deep leadership team here but also with our strong adviser network to ensure we are reviewing all of our businesses with the appropriate critical eye.
Turning to Slide 7. As for the quarter, our financial results were below internal expectations. And as for the headlines, while we delivered CHC operating income in line with our internal expectations and we continue to focus on improving the profitability of the BCH business, we continue to face pricing headwinds in Rx even greater than we had anticipated against the backdrop of a highly variable pharmaceutical pricing environment. To be clear: We missed our internal EPS in the quarter and expectations primarily as a result of the pricing impacts in this Rx segment. Judy will give detailed commentary regarding the final performance of our segment, but I would like to provide a few observations now.
Adjusted operating margins in the Consumer Healthcare segment were greater than 20% and continue to track near all-time highs. The team is executing against its operational targets, with the foundation of making high-quality products. I'm pleased to report that the store brand version of Flonase launched in the quarter, and the segment achieved $32 million in new product sales. Infant formula and smoking cessation categories also continued to perform very well.
Branded Consumer Healthcare adjusted net sales were generally in line with our expectation. Adjusted non-GAAP operating margins were 15%, an improvement over the first quarter margins, although adjusted gross profit margins were lower primarily due to weaker product mix. This was offset by cost-containment actions by the business unit in the quarter. We continue to build out the acquired products in the weight loss and smoking cessation categories across the platform, which is going very well. Collectively, as you think about our business, our consumer-facing segments still represent over 70% of our adjusted net sales for the quarter.
In Rx, we experienced a weaker second quarter than forecasted due largely to more aggressive pricing environment. Despite these headwinds, we continue to focus on generating healthy adjusted operating margins and driving our deep product pipeline forward. Notably during the quarter, we received approval for and launched the generic portion of BenzaClin. 
Let me turn to Slide 8 to dive deeper into Rx and walk you through what we are doing to better address the challenges we are facing in this segment. As stated in our press release issues -- issued earlier today, we have revised our adjusted EPS guidance for the full year to $6.85 to $7.15. A predominant factor impacting the updated guidance is continued price erosion within the Rx segment. Based on my evaluation of the segment, I want to first confirm that, despite lower guidance for the segment, I believe Rx is a fundamentally sound business with solid, strong long-term prospects. We remain in a leading market position with a deep pipeline into which we continue to invest. Our adjusted operating margins in the upper quartile of the Rx pharma sector remain very attractive. That said, Rx competes in a fast-moving, dynamic environment, as evidenced by public comments from the sector's peer, who have also disclosed greater price erosion than expected. Against our own expectations, price erosion in the quarter was unfavorable to adjusted operating income by approximately $20 million.
In light of this price erosion and our performance against our expectations this quarter, we've taken an even more pragmatic approach to forecasting for the second half of the year. We conducted a thorough evaluation and added any effect of known price changes, all anniversary-ing price erosions in the prior calendar year. In addition, we included incremental adjustments for potential additional unfavorable pricing trends, although so far in Q3 we have not seen the rate of change in the pricing environment moderate. Through this process, we arrived at a price erosion forecast for the second half of the year of approximately 9% to 10% compared to the same period in 2015. Judy will walk through this process in even greater details in a few minutes.
We continue to execute against our strategy for this segment, focusing on tougher-to-manufacture products with higher barriers to entry. We believe these products have greater longevity. As an example of this strategy, we're announcing today that we very recently purchased the remaining portion of the generic BenzaClin royalty stream that we did not own previously. As I just noted, BenzaClin was approved and launched in the quarter, and we see it as a longer-term asset from which we will now capture 100% of the economics. While we continue to search for the best candidate internally and externally to lead this segment, I am confident in John Wesolowski and the rest of our highly experienced Rx team in their ability to drive operating margins built upon a deep pipeline, maintaining current partnerships and developing new ones as well.
Now turning to the BCH segment on Slide 9. We have also updated guidance to reflect our current estimates for net sales and margin mix. As we now anticipate lower revenues for certain high-margin products, we have developed a 3-pillar plan to enhance profitability in the BCH business: review routes to market, optimize our portfolio and enhance the segment's effectiveness to mid- to high-teen operating margins.
First, we are prioritizing brand strategies in core markets which we expect to enable more predictable financial results. For example, last summer, we acquired the Yokebe meal replacement product, which is now a direct complement to our weight loss franchise XLS. We now will have a full range of weight loss tablet products. And now we have added meal replacement products to the franchise, providing our customers with a suite of product offerings addressing various consumer preferences. At the end of this quarter, we rolled out Yokebe in the U.K., Holland and Belgium, within 6 months post-acquisition of purchasing the brand in Germany; and now have concrete plans to launch in other markets before the end of the year. We expect this family to be a primary driver of new products for this segment and an exciting contributor to organic growth next year. Another example has been our success with reinvigorating growth behind NiQuitin, the smoking cessation brand we acquired last September. We launched new market programs behind the core patch product; and are rebuilding the mini-lozenge product distribution, which is gaining market share. In addition, new innovation will follow later this year to substantiate our global leadership position within the smoking cessation category.
Second, we are making structural changes that include actions already underway such as aligning our presence in the markets we serve by consolidating certain markets under efficient clusters, uniting our sales forces in certain markets and considering partners who can better manage commercial sales efforts in particular countries. If we identify a particular product or geography that is not meeting our hurdle rate, then we will take action, with a commitment to increase profitability and cash flow conversion. For example, we continue to execute our restructuring plans announced in February. We have completed our sales force consolidation and realignment actions involving Germany and Spain and recently entered into consultation discussions with employees regarding the future direction of one of our BCH manufacturing facilities. We have also initiated the process to sell our Etixx brand in Europe. Additionally, as I've previously mentioned this morning, we are announcing further tangible actions to address market structures in certain countries, which will reduce operating costs and improve our profitability as we nurture sustainable growth in our top markets. This allows us to reinvest resources to high-performing parts of our business. Specifically, we are combining our markets under regional clusters; and looking at alternative strategies for our businesses in Russia, South Africa and Argentina.
Third, we are progressing with our integration plans to build out Perrigo's proven business processes onto the European platform. For example, we continue to have great success enhancing BCH's supply chain efficiencies. We anticipate approximately $40 million in savings per annum with projects that are already underway, which we expect to realize in the next 2 to 3 years.
An important element underpinning our plans is our people. We have a talented team in Europe. And we are excited about the new talent we have injected into the organization, including a new leader of Pan-European marketing efforts, new country leadership and increases to our integration team in Europe to accelerate our process transformation. As I've said before, there is substantial work to be done, but I am confident we can create greater shareholder value by improving and further leveraging this important consumer platform. The path of steadily improving margins is multifaceted and it will take time, but the team has an actionable, multilayered plan to improve profitability.
Now I'm going to turn over to Judy to go over some more details."

Good morning, everyone.On Slide 11, you can see second quarter adjusted consolidated net sales were $1.4 billion, down $55 million or 3% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, excluding sales from held-for-sale businesse",1653,"Thank you very much, John. Good morning, everyone.
On Slide 11, you can see second quarter adjusted consolidated net sales were $1.4 billion, down $55 million or 3% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, excluding sales from held-for-sale businesses in both the periods presented. This was driven by certain categories within the CHC segment, which I'll discuss in a moment, offset in part by increased sales in the Rx segment, which were driven largely by sales related to acquisitions and new products.
Looking at the segment results on Slide 12. CHC adjusted net sales were down approximately $63 million year-over-year or 8% on a constant currency basis, excluding sales from held-for-sale businesses in both periods. This was largely attributable to a weaker allergy season compared to last year, timing of customer promotional programs and lower net sales in the OTC contract manufacturing category. In addition, the analgesic category showed a net sales decline due primarily to relatively lower pricing. These decreases were partially offset by higher net sales in the infant nutrition and smoking cessation categories. New product sales were $32 million, driven primarily by the store brand launches of Flonase and new infant formulas.
Adjusted gross profit margin remained strong at 36.6%, as we experienced favorable product mix in the quarter and continued to leverage our supply chain proficiencies, offsetting the effects of lower pricing in certain categories. We continued to focus on our growth plan with increased R&D investments, which were 33% higher than last year on an adjusted basis.
As John mentioned earlier, the priorities for this segment are twofold: first, delivering strong, predictable results by focusing on operational efficiencies; and second, investing in our future growth initiatives. The quarterly results for this segment are consistent with these priorities.
Turning to Slide 13. In the quarter, Branded Consumer Healthcare segment's adjusted net sales were $394 million compared with $401 million last year. The team delivered top and bottom line results in line with our internal expectations. These results included $29 million from acquisitions, while new products contributed $28 million, led by innovation in the lifestyle category. Offsetting the favorable contribution of acquisitions and new products, the segment experienced lower adjusted gross margin due to unfavorable product mix and the comparison with a significant new product launch in the lifestyle segment in the second quarter of 2015. The effect of lower gross profit margins was offset by cost control in this segment, resulting in adjusted operating margin for the quarter of approximately 15%, in line with our expectations.
Turning now to Rx on Slide 14. Net sales were $293 million, 5% higher than last year, driven largely by $44 million related to acquisitions and new product sales of $26 million. As John mentioned a few minutes ago, our consolidated earnings were short of our internal forecast in the quarter due to the continued price erosion in this segment, which obviously flowed through directly to adjusted operating income as well.
At a summary level, 3 factors affected year-over-year pricing in the quarter. First, the lack of an exclusive market position for 2 key products versus the prior year had an unfavorable impact. This first aspect was known and included in our May guidance. This impact anniversaried in the second quarter. Second, as previously discussed, there were a number of competitive product launches in the first quarter of 2016, which led to additional year-over-year price erosion beyond what the leadership team had anticipated. Third, there were continued pricing headwinds from consolidated buying groups. These last 2 effects were considered in our May 12 guidance but not sufficient to reflect current aggressive market realities. Our new forecast process has reanalyzed the pricing environment in even more detail through the prism of these second quarter changes, and I'll talk about that in a few minutes. The Rx adjusted gross margin was down 720 basis points due to this year-over-year price erosion; and competition in the industry, which also impacted the adjusted operating margin.
Turning to Slide 16 and an update on our balance sheet.
As of July 2, 2016, total cash on the balance sheet was $642 million, and total debt was approximately $6.4 billion. As we have stated in the past, we are fully committed to our investment-grade ratings, which includes deleveraging our balance sheet through EBITDA growth and debt repayment. As part of that strategy, it has been stated, our stated commitment to repay our $500 million of senior notes that mature in November. We are following through on that commitment through a proactive redemption call of those notes, which we announced yesterday. We have elected to accelerate the repayment of that debt into September in order to clearly illustrate our unequivocal commitment to deleveraging and proactively utilize cash in our balance sheet while doing so in a manner that will be cost neutral to shareholders in our current year. We are and expect to remain in compliance with our debt covenants under our credit agreements as we continue to take actions to strengthen our balance sheet. We have multiple paths to achieve that goal, including EBITDA and cash flow generation enhanced through expense and CapEx management, as well as the flexibility to pursue additional debt paydowns and/or to opportunistically refinance our credit facilities in keeping with our conservative capital structure management philosophy.
We generated approximately $400 million of cash from operating activities during the first 6 months of the year. Remember that this includes the unfavorable impact of approximately $70 million from the normalization of accounts payable within Branded Consumer Healthcare I noted in the first quarter. Consistent with other activities the team is undertaking to drive performance at BCH, this action was successfully taken to establish a more sustainable and predictable cash flow pattern at the business and will not similarly burden our expected operating cash flow generation in the second half of this year.
With the changes in the forecast announced today, we are taking prudent, immediate steps to use our strong cash flow conversion to prioritize our capital allocation on deleveraging. While there may be small, tactical bolt-on acquisition opportunities, the team is first and foremost focused on execution. We are committed to a long-term balance sheet and capital allocation strategy that creates value for shareholders. This strategy includes our commitment to our investment-grade ratings. As such, we'll continue to focus on debt repayment and do not intend to reenter the share repurchase market in the near term.
Turning to Slide 18. Our adjusted EPS guidance has been updated to $6.85 per share to $7.15 per share, reflecting primarily changes in the Rx segment. So let me walk you through our updated 2016 expectations by business unit so you can better understand the different dynamics by segment.
Guidance for the CHC segment remains relatively unchanged, as we expect 2016 adjusted net sales of approximately $2.6 billion, excluding contributions from the VMS business. We continue to anticipate CHC adjusted operating margins in the second half of the year similar to those achieved in the first half. We have tempered our second half BCH performance expectations for unfavorable product mix. We expect BCH adjusted net sales to be approximately $1.3 billion and continue to anticipate low double-digit adjusted operating margin for calendar 2016. Note that we anticipate higher advertising and promotion spend in the third quarter versus the fourth quarter, translating into our expectation of adjusted operating income being more heavily weighted to the fourth quarter versus the third.
Now let's walk through the forecasting process used this quarter in our Rx segment, which as stated multiple times this morning has proven to be the most challenging area to forecast in this dynamic environment. We began by comprehensively reviewing all products, irrespective of size, on a bottoms-up basis, looking at both pricing and volume performance in the first half of the year versus previous assumptions; and then analyzing the second half of the year potential given current competitive dynamics. Excluding onetime items that impacted the first half of the year such as known incidences of loss of exclusivity and floor stock adjustments, the year-over-year price erosion run rate in the 6 months ended June was approximately 9%. Looking forward for the second half of the year, we conducted a comprehensive bottoms-up evaluation, adding in the effect of known price changes as well as the impact of anniversaried price erosion from the prior calendar year. On top of this, we included an incremental adjustment for potential additional unfavorable pricing trends, although thus far in the third quarter, we have seen the rate of change in the pricing environment moderate.
Through this process, we arrived at a second half year-over-year pricing erosion forecast of approximately 9% to 10% compared to the same period of the prior year. In addition, our updated guidance also reflects lower volume assumptions. We thus expect Rx net sales for 2016 to be approximately $1 billion, with adjusted operating margin forecasted to be in the low-40% range for the year. The Rx team continues to focus on the long term by managing a balance of price, volume, market share and expenses to limit the impact to operating margins.
On a consolidated basis, adjusted EPS for the third quarter of 2016 is expected to be the lowest of the year on higher operating expenditures for R&D and advertising and promotional investments.
Our adjusted effective tax rate for the year is estimated at 15%. And you should model 17% into the second half of the year.
Despite these announced expected changes in consolidated adjusted EPS performance, we continue to expect strong operating cash conversion in our business. Forecasted annual operating cash flow of over $900 million reflects a 90% conversion to adjusted net income. With over $640 million on the balance sheet and expanding operating cash flow, our platform continues to generate liquidity to execute on the deleveraging strategy discussed earlier. 
Now let me turn the call back over to John."

Turning to Slide 20. We anticipate new product launches over $300 million in 2016. This by itself represents growth of approximately 5%. As a reminder, this year, we have already launched fluticasone and half of the guaifenesin family of products. While not a comprehensive list, over the next 1.5 years, we expect to launch the remaining store brand versions of the guaifenesin family of products; and continue launch from our Rx pipeline, notably including ProAir.
I also want to note that we recently received tentative approval from the FDA for OTC esomeprazole magnesium capsules, the store brand equivalent to Nexium. This is a key milestone towards an anticipated 2017 launch of this key, new store-brand Rx-to-OTC switch product. The regulatory timing to market and what our position might be from a first-to-market standpoint is still unclear, but we do know that we are the first store brand or generic filer that's received a tentative approval, which is a very important step. We are currently working with our retail customers and making plans to launch the item as soon as possible after the late-March 2017 market exclusivity period expires for the national brand. As I said, the exact timing of when we're able to launch remains undetermined.
Turning to Slide 21. Ultimately, I am confident that we are on a course to improve our performance and address our challenges. We have well-thought-out plans in place, and we will continue to execute against it.
Before opening up the call for your questions, I'd like to close by underscoring some of our competitive advantages and why I believe they will drive long-term shareholder value. First, our durable CHC platform continues to leverage our deep relationships and our leading market position in store brand OTC with numerous products, dosage forms and supply chain capabilities. We own more OTC ANDAs than any other manufacturer, including all the large branded pharmaceutical companies. Overall, the scale of our business is unmatched and operations continue to perform at the highest levels, delivering quality products into the medicine cabinets of consumers. Focusing on execution remains the priority as we continue to deliver predictable value.
Our European consumer platform is also a differentiator that draws on our consumer capabilities. We have been evaluating the segment country by country and are taking actions across the business, which I detailed earlier. We will continue to reinvest in the core to drive profitability in this segment. With our 3-pillar operational plan in place, I have confidence that we will enhance profitability of the BCH segment by prioritizing brands and channels to ensure we are delivering the greatest value.
To reiterate, the Rx business has a deep pipeline of new products; is committed to R&D investments; and will continue to offer differentiated products, particularly in those ""high barrier to entry"" areas where Perrigo has exceptional capabilities. This segment continues to deliver attractive adjusted operating margins, and we are committed to building confidence in our ability to deliver improved results despite industry volatility.
Overall, we are focused on improving our profitability and reviewing all aspects of our business and performance against our objectives. While we mentioned some actions we are taking today, we will continue to look at all aspects of value creation to drive optimal value from our unique portfolio. Perrigo is a strong company with a bright future. Despite the challenging times in a dynamic arts [ph] market, I have confidence that our people, our processes and the plans they have laid out will deliver meaningful results. We have more steps to take, but we are on the right path and making progress daily against our stated goals. Looking forward, I see a business with several great platforms of growth.

So as we sit here today, at the end of June, our leverage ratio was 4.7x. We are well within that band at the end of the quarter. It does step down to 4.5x in the back half of the year and then down to 4x at the end of the first quarter of 2017, but as commented in the call, we chose rather than waiting until November with this paper maturity in November 2016, we said we have the cash on the balance sheet. We can proactively go ahead and pay down that paper in September, and we are proceeding on that path right now as we speak. That will give us even more headroom, more cushion, again, not because there was a concern at the end of the year even with the adjusted EBITDA numbers but just to proactively demonstrate to everyone that we are indeed focused on deleveraging and utilizing our cash to do exactly that. In 2017, we have additional paper that will come due in Europe, and we intend fully to pay that down according to schedule. We could also proactively choose to early pay a term loan, given our cash flow planning, if we chose to do so. And/or we could conceptually opportunistically have discussions around our credit agreements, but at this point, as we look at our EBITDA projections as well as the step-down in the covenant leverage ratio requirements, we believe that we are comfortable but have plans in place to be proactive should any need require. And again, this is about demonstrating our long-term commitment to our investment-grade ratings and continuing to be able to demonstrate very -- in a very public way that, that is the intention of utilization of cash flow."

As I think, just stepping back on Rx again, if I go through it and look at it from my lens, still a solid, profitable business.

Again, despite the pricing challenges, we feel we have a good pipeline; good link to our operations supply, all the things that you had mentioned earlier; and good switch support even if it's not specific products. It's just what we have there on the Rx side links into that OTC side. So those are all the pluses. I think that investing in R&D and in the right strategic opportunities and partners is certainly a opportunity there to expand that, but even without putting more in, we feel that there's a decent pipeline there. Our ProAir, if I get into the ProAir one: As we look at it, we're responding to FDA and going through the answers to their complete response letters, getting all the data together for that. We have not necessarily moved out the detailed timing as we look at 2017, but being more realistic, we want to put in the normal timing for the updated response et cetera, so we talk about during '17.

So logically speaking, if you were to take the first half of the year actual EPS generated and the midpoint of the EPS guidance we just provided you, it would imply a second half decline over first half. Annualize that into next year, and it obviously is going to be well off consensus for 2017, although granted consensus as of this morning has not been updated to fully reflect the changes in the environment that we highlighted in great depth on the official comments this morning. Suffice it to say, as we're looking at 2017 with our internal plans, the big drivers that we look at growth for next year, and there is implied growth in our 2017 plans off of our internal 2016 number, are coming from many of the things that -- as John has already implied in the qualitative comments, which are reestablishing vigor in channel strategies in some of the markets in Europe that have been softer than had been originally anticipated; feeding the growth of the countries that are already performing quite well in advance of even market dynamics and continuing to feed that growth; rightsizing and organizing ourselves to drive back-office efficiencies and allow for expanded operating margins throughout Europe while continuing to fund advertising, promotion and new product development within the European team. So we are most certainly planning for an improved 2017 year in the branded consumer health, as the team is rightsizing and reestablishing themselves. We have new products on deck for next year, a long list of new products. There is a particularly large one on deck for next year in Rx, which we moved from the end of 2016 into 2017 and at a healthy margin plans to be a good contributor as well to the overall EPS growth of the year. And as John has likewise alluded to, taking a very hard look at how we spend in our SG&A and making sure that we are laser focused in being as efficient as possible given the recent dynamics so that we can in fact continue to drive bottom line growth. So not going to comment on consensus, as I'm presuming that at this stage consensus has become a bit irrelevant at effective 6:32 a.m. Eastern time today, but we will be continuing to provide you more color to be able to model 2017 both on these calls, in investor presentations and conferences as well as an upcoming Analyst Day."

And if I could ask a real question then for John, I guess. With respect to the Rx generics segment, the company over the years has done a very good job of kind of plugging growth holes with small product acquisitions or even arguably financial transactions such as, you mentioned this morning, kind of buying back the royalty stream. Now I assume that the prioritization around those efforts has kind of been elevated in light of the pricing erosion on the existing business.

And by the way, thank you for catching and correcting our previous statements. So I appreciate that. So when I think of the Rx, we have had a good segment there, small acquisitions that have fit in or done some things to add to it. Let me do one clarity first, the royalty stream, which is a great one, we entered into this a long time ago with our partner. We actually make the product. We sell the product. We do everything with it. We just had a profit share with our partner who invested with it initially. And so it was one that fits right into our operating strategy because it's already within our sites, within our plants. So it's a very natural fit, that one. I do think there are still strategic fits within our core segments within the Rx business that are open for investments and doing things. So I think it's not a dead opportunity, everything's gone. I think there are opportunities there for adding products, adding technologies that are more unique that could position us in a decent position in those. So we're looking at all aspects of Rx when we say what should we get into, are there unique operating platforms that would -- could set us apart from others and how we expand that, if we do expand it."

But also, what appears to be a clear lack of visibility given the repeated downgrades in the earnings guidance, and it's not over one product or a recall or a plant closure, it's a range of businesses. So is this trouble with the systems -- the reporting systems, the managers in the business, the lack of negotiations with payers?

And as you know, we've gone through an Rx management team change in the last few months. And we have seen continued price declines in the last few months. So I tried to elaborate in the prepared remarks, but maybe a little bit more color. The entire Rx leadership team came together and sat down and then went through every single product this time, taking a maybe a more jaded lens on the reality of the market in which they're competing. And as we commented on, I'll use the great analogy of Donald Rumsfeld. They first, in the past, got -- went through the known knowns. Their entire product lineup, what they know is happening, what they can actively see and manage and included that in their forecast. And this is the marketing team, the sales team, the individual commercial members as well as the folks who manage the contract filings. And went through the known knowns, fine, they did that in the past. In the past, they've stopped at some known unknowns with a little bit of wiggle room. But after the last quarter's performance, also went a step further and aggressively went and made some modeling assertions on known unknowns and as well went the next layer with unknown unknowns. Because after the fourth -- second quarter and the accumulative effect of Q1 and Q2, the team under new leadership took a very different perspective on the potential for more dynamism on a go-forward basis, just given the rapid rate of change that they saw over the last 6 months. So it's not a reporting system problem, because if the accounting and the debits and credits and the gross to net function as always, but rather a rapid pace of change unlike anything they had ever seen in the past. A very open dynamic with that -- between that team as well as the executive committee and talking very frankly and very openly about what they were seeing and putting forward assertions that made sense given the circumstances that we're working in today of trying to elaborate and be prepared for possible body blows if the pace of change were to -- were not to moderate as well. So that is the type of process they went through. I don't want to use the analogy of nuclear Armageddon. But given the last quarter, they definitely pushed hard on the unknown unknowns as well to try to prepare for the worst-case scenario."

So if you think of all of those, we are still on the early stages of expanding through. So we're going through, we're taking actions, we're trying to correct things as we go from both the brand standpoint, what are we putting innovation into, what are we driving, what's the focus for the team. From a country standpoint, it's going into countries and working that through. And then platform, we've worked previously -- a fair amount on the supply side and operating side. And that's where we're seeing those benefits come through on the P&L from a savings standpoint, but we still have a long ways to go on the total infrastructure side to enable it. So it is still a -- another, I'll say, 18 months kind of process to work ultimately through that. To where, in my mind, you have a well-oiled operating system. All that said, we have good countries, good parts, people are driving things, so it's not -- nothing happens till then. We're making changes all along that path. As far as Q2 strength, I'll say the team did a great job of having some good sales and driving that, also having some good cost controls and driving it.

We believe we'll eventually get there and then some. But just don't want to plan on that for the next half, so we've lowered the expectations so we can continue to build out our infrastructure for the long term."

So again, if I step back, big picture-wise, look at our Rx business, certainly, and it goes without saying, that the pricing changes and dynamics there have been very large and certainly were the main driver of the quarter, big part of our lowering guidance, so it's a big key. If I step back then and say, okay, let's look at the business today, after all those changes, after we built in the 9% to 10% to the back half, all of that, we still have a business with a great return on invested capital, a great operating margin, great new product prospects. And so while I think there are many things we can do to enhance that business and drive more value and products to it, the main dynamic right now is this pricing dynamic. And that one is a -- got to get through it, got to allow that to happen and have our new product start hit again. We always describe Rx as a leaky bucket. We knew this was going to be a tough new products year and we've had more leaking out of the bucket from a pricing standpoint than we've been able to put in with new products and other kinds of pricing actions in the top. And so that's been what really compounded and added in this year. But in my mind, I look at the overall business fundamentals, and they are still solid."

There are 2 or 3 suppliers out there in the market. We'd still -- with Jeff and his business have usually done a good job of getting their fair share of those kind of complex products. So I don't think this will be a 10-person market. It's just a unique product. And at some point, there's more complexity on there. So that's my perspective. It could be wrong, but that's in general where I think that market will end up. We -- on the limited guaranteed launch, we've not talked about that. And at this point, can't talk further about what that means and the quantities or volumes that, that means. We'll have to come back to that one at a later time. McKesson-Walmart. So McKesson has distributed some of Walmart's products within our normal consumer business. Previously, some of their pseudoephedrine products or other products are distributed through McKesson, they've had that relationship on some of the OTC products.

Let me just comment a little bit on the operating margin perspective on this business which is, if you step back and look at the gross margin evolution since we've owned the company, you'll see gross margins in the low-50s. Approximately 80% of the BCH segment business is coming from branded OTC, as you all know there's a small slice to the business that is coming from our distribution of certain generics in Belgium. Top 20 brands make up about 55% of sales of the segment. Other owned brands make up another 1/4 of sales, so there's my 80%. Our top 20 brands are contributing gross margins in the low-60s. The other brands are in the low-50s. So that blended rate in the mid-50s for the branded products is, honestly, in line or even slightly better than competitive peers in the European consumer space, so solid, competitive gross margins. Our advertising and promotion spend for the business is in line with or frankly even a little soft compared to other players. And the main driving factor now for us to improve operating margins is finding ways to be more structurally efficient. So on a country-by-country basis, and we'll be elaborating on more of these in detail, finding ways to be more efficient in our go-to-market and importantly on a shared service platform, finding ways that we can deliver on back office day-to-day services to the countries in a more efficient way so the teams can really focus their time and their energy on sales, market, product development, go-to-market and being close to their customers. So those types of initiatives, as John referred to, take more time. That's going to be the focus now of the transformation team is helping drive efficiencies across Europe to be able to drive more bottom line margin. Should it be a business that has operating margins in the high-teens nearing 20%? Absolutely. Do we have a line of sight to that? Does the team understand the implication and what has to be done? Yes. Does it happen tomorrow? No. But if you just look at the key metrics: products, gross margin, A&P, those are in line. And now it's about driving efficiency to the other lines to be able to progress our way towards high-teens operating margin in line with the competitive dynamic of other branded consumer companies."

We had a big second quarter in the consumer side last year driven by a few, you said. There was also the retailers were at a lower inventory position and kind of wanted to get to a stronger level at that time. So there were just a myriad of things that just made that a big consumer front. When I look at -- just step back and look at market share or what's going on, first of all, we continue to do very well from a market share standpoint, grow at store brands, continue to do well and we, as our percent of store brands, continue to do well. The things that impact that, Douglas, as I look at it are, as brand launch, so we had the nasal spray product that launched, and we are in those, originally, they take share from cough/cold/allergy, those brands will. As we come in there, we start gaining our fair share of those categories. J&J started coming back on the shelf. And as they did, we maintained a good chunk of the share, but they do get some shelf spacing and part of that share. And usually, once they're on, we're able to again continue to grow and drive our share. So you did have some dynamics, I would say, over the last couple of years that have caused the share growth to not be as dynamic upwardly as it had been both in big new product launches and switches, Nexium and another example. That takes share and then how we're able to be out there with that product, we're a little lower share of the whole category. So that's what happened sort of in the year-over-year, new product switches, those kind of things dynamic that drive it. But I feel good about the position when we just look at share of products that we can compete in, how we're doing in maintaining and driving those higher, how consumers are doing at still buying retail brands at a value point versus brands.

Then you drop down, why didn't it flow through all the way to adjusted operating margin? Very, very clear, the team made a conscious choice and did the absolute right thing, which was continue to invest incremental dollars in R&D. Even with that R&D investment, I would not say that anyone should feel badly about an operating -- adjusted operating margin of 20.7%. Yes, while it is down year-over-year, they could have chosen not to make those R&D investments to keep the AGM or AOM up, but did the right thing to invest in the long term.

I know you just went through some of the dynamics with certain products, but just as megatrend, is that still continuing?

So I would say, if you step back with all the big picture, and this is a way step back, but we're all getting older, health care costs have done nothing but go up despite everything we try to do to manage them down, we all need more health care and we frankly have less money to spend on it. So from a macro dynamic -- and that's pretty global trends, so from a macro dynamic, looking for a value way to pay for some of those health care needs, in my mind, will continue to grow, so that challenge. I think when you look at people from a pure store brand standpoint and looking at a value there, in my mind, there are still potential for higher share gains. If you look at certain countries, certain product lines, the share is much higher than on every product line. So when I say, can you keep growing share? My answer would be yes. There is still growth there from a share standpoint, even in getting categories that are under their fair share, if you will, up to where a normalized fair share should be, there's opportunity. So I still think the growing share store brand and total growing share is a trend that Jeff and his team are continuing to drive and get after that. It happens not just with pure share growth and promotion, but bringing in new products. New products, bold new energy, they bring consumers to the market looking for those things and looking for equivalent kind of products, so making sure they're out with new products. What sounds like a new product play really does help drive share kind of across the board because of those things, so I think it's still good opportunities. The brands are out and doing good innovations, which I think is great because that kind of drives interest in the market and provides new opportunities for us to continue to grow also. Second part of your question was branded annualized growth and looking at that. And I'll go back to my premise of we're in a correction phase, getting everything kind of aligned to make sure that we have a good operating platform, good growth vehicles of brands, good country operating performance to continue to drive them. I think with the infrastructures of what we have, we should be able to grow our products faster than the general markets are growing in those countries. And each country in Europe grows differently. I mean, that's probably the biggest thing I've learned over the last 10 years is, we call it Europe, but it's not. It's each country grows differently and different brand and product interest. I believe we can grow faster than those markets with the brands and the way we're positioning ourselves in those markets. But I'd rather give you a general number for Europe. I think we got to hold back on that until we look at specific country growth and how we fit in there and give you broader guidance on that."

While it would be imprudent, particularly in light of the answer I just gave Greg in terms of an Analyst Day and specific guidance to get granular on the numbers, suffice it to say that I've had the pleasure of spending time with many of the country leaders. And I will tell you that their enthusiasm for our combined companies, for the platform, for the ability to grow and have investments beyond what they've had in the past and to really be able to hit the ground running now with Sharon's leadership and the reorganization of his team and to be able to really drive for the future is pretty exciting to be around. So I'm not going to quote a number, but suffice it to say, they're raring to go. There are challenges certain countries are going to have. Change is afoot as their leadership teams are looking at different way of driving their channels, but there is a lot of enthusiasm and excitement to definitely be able to take their product platform and grow beyond the market growth in their respective countries."

On the Rx business, how confident are you that you actually get back to a ""normal"" pricing level versus 10% this year, given the comment that 2017 is when you could see more incremental pressure from one stop combining with Walmart? If the Rx business is $1 billion this year, 10% price is down to $900 million before new products next year, so why shouldn't we be thinking about that as we look into '17?"

How confident am I in the ability to execute on that tax number? For my colleagues in the executive committee who are listening to this call, I will say that the confidence in the ability to have the adjusted effective tax rate that we guided to today is entirely dependent on the jurisdictional mix of them delivering on their operating income earnings before tax in the updated guidance provided to you this morning. So if you feel good about the segment guidance, then by definition, we should have a clear line of sight to delivering on that slightly higher tax rate. We had guided to 14% adjusted effective tax rate and updated that to 15% given updated mix of income in this new guidance. And if you do your math, that says a higher rate or around 17% on average for the second half of the year. With respect to the GAAP/non-GAAP discussion which is all abuzz at the moment, that is also for us a pretty cut-and-dry answer. The tax-related items that flow through on our GAAP/non-GAAP tables within our press release this morning are related to tax effect of those items that are included as adjustments, like amortization of intangibles, et cetera. So we don't have any fancy math in there, it's pretty vanilla on tax effective items on that list. So I don't expect or anticipate any drama related to that particular item."

I believe that this part, as I look at it, will normalize back to a mean. And a mean is a 5% to 6% normalized price decreases. I mean, if you look back historically, those are the kind of numbers that you'd see in the industry, not kind of the ones that we're seeing at this stage. I don't have a better crystal ball, but when I look at it and say, okay, it has to normalize out, a great generic industry, and eventually gets back to a normalized point. So you get back to a 5% to 6% normal decreases without first-to-file other items, but just normalized bucket increases with new products on top of that, put on some pricing you might be able to get on other products that are way undervalued right now, to me you get back to a more normalized level.

We have a lot to cover today. First, I want to provide a comprehensive progress update on the strategic and operational action plans I[ph] outlined during our last earnings call. We've made a lot of progress, but there's still much work to be done. Then Judy will walk through the financial results for the quarter, and I'll end with a final comment before our Q&A session.
Turning to Slide 4. At the outset, I want to reinforce the team's strong belief in Perrigo's strategy to providing quality, affordable health care products to customers and consumers around the world. In fact, we believe it is vital to our current global health care environment. Macro trends for our business are strong, and Perrigo is in a unique position to capitalize on those trends. Regardless of the political or economic climate, global consumers, customers, insurers alike continue to search for effective health care products that provide value. And Perrigo remains a leader in providing both effective products and great value to both consumers in front and behind the pharmacy counter. In fact, every second of every day, nearly 2,200 people around the globe use a Perrigo product, and our products save consumers more than $7.5 billion every year. This is a great place to operate.
Turning to Slide 5. Foremost, I want to begin by saying that we had a solid quarter in line with expectations, which I'm pleased to share with you. Good top line growth in our Consumer Healthcare segment was led by U.S. Consumer Healthcare adjusted net sales increase of 4%, despite a poor allergy season. In addition, this team continues to drive strong adjusted operating margins at 20% in the quarter. And our Rx business performance was in line with our expectations. Importantly, the cash generation of the business model continues to be strong with $304 million generated in the quarter.
This quarter, we also made great progress against a number of our actions to focus and improve our business. And I know you're all interested in hearing about that. With assistance from a leading consulting firm, we continue to make substantial progress against these initiatives to maximize shareholder value. Let me give you some of the highlights here, and then I will drive -- dive deeper into them on the slides that follow.
First, corporate governance. I'm excited that we added 2 new board members with great, relevant experience and long track records of creating value. Their unique expertise and skill sets will also support our ongoing portfolio review that I will address next. Second, we conducted portfolio review to optimize our business offerings. As announced in April, we have been thoroughly assessing our portfolio through a comprehensive strategic, operational and financial review of all of our businesses. As I've said, we will not leave any stone unturned. With that in mind, this [ph] slide outlines the items we've completed or initiated to date. The board and management believe the next step to unlock shareholder value is today's announcement that we are exploring strategic alternatives for the Tysabri royalty stream. We continue to evaluate all businesses, including the market position and growth opportunities for our U.S. Rx business, which I'll also discuss further.
Third, improved performance in BCH. We've taken a number of actions this quarter, leveraging core strengths in Consumer Healthcare to address a number of challenges with the goal of enhancing margins. I will discuss in more detail specific market dynamics and actions in the slide that follows.
Fourth, we will focus our efforts to optimize organizational effectiveness. A core strength of Perrigo is to build effective operating systems and organizational structures to deliver performance. A key component of our future success is to match cost structures with existing and future expected market dynamics, and we are conducting a review of our optimal cost structure going forward to achieve our business objectives.
And finally, we'll continue to work hard every day for our customers and consumers. I have continued to assert that we have fundamentally sound and attractive businesses and with unique competitive advantages. Despite their challenges, both our CHD and Rx segment continue to deliver strong operating margins.
Now let me dive a little bit further into each of these. Turning to Slide 6. This morning, we announced that our board appointed 2 new directors, Geoff Parker, who has already joined the board; and Ted Samuels, who will begin his service on January 4, 2017. Geoff brings a wealth of financial expertise, while Ted brings a significant investor perspective. As you can see on their slide, their experience is direct result -- excuse me, directly relevant to our current strategy and ongoing initiatives. Additionally, 2 of our current board members, Michael Jandernoa and Gary Kunkle, have elected to not stand for reelection. While they will continue to serve as directors until our next AGM, I would like to thank both Mike and Gary for their long-term service and commitment to Perrigo. We continue to work with a nationally recognized search firm to identify other potential independent directors who possess significant experience and successful track records of delivering shareholder value.
Turning to Slide 7. A key outcome of our ongoing portfolio review is today's announcement that we would explore alternatives for Tysabri royalty stream. As you know, Tysabri dramatically improves the quality of life for patients with MS. And financially, it provides stable and predictable cash flow. After careful consideration, the board and management believe that now is the right time to explore a review of strategic alternatives for Tysabri to potentially monetize the value of this attractive asset, which we believe will enable us to derisk, delever and continue to focus on Perrigo's core strengths. In our portfolio review, we are weighing the benefits of divesting or finding alternatives for asset alongside our commitment to maintain an investment-grade rating. Any proceeds from a potential Tysabri sale would be prioritized with this comment in mind, as retaining our investment-grade status is a cornerstone to our capital structure philosophy.
Turning to Slide 8. As we all know, the Rx space has been very dynamic over the last year, month, week, however you want to look at it. I have had many conversations with investors over the last few months about the future of our Rx business, and we continue to evaluate the business' market dynamics, portfolio strategies and long-range growth opportunities in order to generate the best value. Our strategic review of the segment requires an in-depth, comprehensive evaluation of the interdependencies within our business. Such areas of manufacturing, shared service functions and tax are more complicated and deserve thoughtful considerations. The Perrigo board has formed a special subcommittee with me on our Rx business to evaluate all of these aspects and determine the best path to optimize shareholder value with this segment. We expect to complete this review in the first quarter of 2017.
On to Slide 9. Now I'll discuss our Branded Consumer Healthcare business. As you may have seen this morning, first, we announced a noncash impairment charge in our BCH segment. Second, Perrigo Board of Directors has authorized the company to initiate a claim and arbitration against the sellers of Omega Pharma Invest NV, which we plan to do before the end of this year. As you would expect, while you may have questions in this regard, it is our policy to not comment on legal matters, so we will not provide further detail at this time.
Despite the impairment, which Judy will discuss in detail, I continue to believe in the long-term power of this business, along with its core platforms and competencies. Across the European continent, there are a number of tailwinds that are encouraging for the long-term outlook in this business. OTC market growth remains healthy at approximately 2% to 3% per year, and consumer demographics and dynamics continue to trend favorably, driving increased use of OTC products. We have been actively engaged in Europe over the past 6 months to build out our leadership team, enhance processes and develop organizational effectiveness needed to improve the performance of the BCH segment. Our long-term objectives for this business are: first, we are committed to bringing the BCH business to CHC-level profitability. We are currently in the process of overlaying the CHC operational philosophies, experience and expertise to enhance BCH performance. Second, we are a top 5 European OTC business with scale and reach in the multiple channels and in multiple markets. Our goal is to remain a top player within the Europe infrastructure. Finally, we believe that this business can attain at or above-market growth in the long term. We continue to prioritize brand strategies in core markets, which should enable more predictable financial results. Many of the individual markets in which we operate are performing well, like the U.K., Spain, the Netherlands and the Nordics, and we remain optimistic about the potential of the BCH business given all these factors. That said, there is still much work to be done to achieve these objectives.
Turning to Slide 10 and continuing with the BCH business. European OTC market has different channels to the consumer, for instance, approximately 1/3 of our business in the wholesale pharmacy channel, and we are particularly focused on the inventory management systems in those countries employing this model. Order patterns of products we sell into the wholesale pharmacy channels are not always aligned with sellout patterns to pharmacies as the wholesalers act as a conduit, which could build inventory inefficiencies, something we are systematically addressing. With our strengths, opportunities and challenges in mind, we have a series of actions to focus on countries and products where we have the ability to win in the marketplace. The action plan comprises 4 key initiatives which are underway. One, the success of an organization starts with leadership. The countries where we perform well have effective, efficient, great leaders who are able to quickly adapt to changing market dynamics. We have added 4 new country leaders to expand our expertise and have fresh perspectives on our go-to-market strategies in countries that are not meeting expectations. I am confident that we have the right people in place for these countries. Two, we are prioritizing certain geographies and brand strategies across the portfolio, aligning investments with our ability to win by product and by market. This means identifying the geographies and opportunities that have the capability to provide high returns on investment and making plans to either divest or partner with others who can better manage commercial sales efforts, in particular, countries where there is no clear path. Currently, there are 4 challenging countries we are focused on. In Belgium and Italy, we are focused on inventory channel inefficiencies. In Germany, we are focused on working to achieve greater scale. And in France, we are making strategic investments in innovation to diversify our product concentration from seasonal lifestyle products. Three, we're taking steps to be more efficient and align costs with revenues. We are continuing to integrate the BCH infrastructure on to our Irish platform and overlay CHC operational philosophies, experience and expertise to enhance the margin profile on incentivizing the business team to focus on margin growth. Fourth, new products are the lifeline of a growing consumer company, and we are no different. For us to be successful in the long term, we need to increase investments in innovation to bring more novel products to market. As an example, we have a great success with our new multi-symptom formula, Bronchostop, which has achieved the #1 position in the U.K. This product is currently being launched in other attractive markets. While they will take time to fully materialize, I'm confident that these 4 specific actions will improve profitability. I see a path to CHC-level operating margins for the business, and I'm committed to taking steps to improve this important business. 
Turning to Slide 11. We continue to maximize the global infrastructure we have in place, and I'm pleased to note that last year's announced consolidation of our global supply chain activities in Ireland is generating a run rate benefit of approximately $40 million in net income, a nice job as a team to hit this target. We will continue to focus our efforts to optimize organizational effectiveness. As discussed last quarter, we're making good progress towards our goal of realizing an additional $40 million in the Branded Consumer Healthcare supply chain savings, which we expect to achieve over the next 2 years. Let me reiterate. One of our core strength is building effective operating systems and organizational structures to deliver performance results. Our future success relies on managing cost structures with existing and future expected market dynamics. To this end, we are conducting an even more comprehensive review of our overall cost structure going forward to achieve our business objectives. We expect this study to conclude in the first quarter of 2017.
As you can see on Slide 12, the store brand OTC category continues to grow, despite significant national brand product launches that are experiencing a period of exclusivity as well as a return of a prominent national brand. I would like to briefly highlight 2 store brand categories on this slide. First, the smoking cessation category continues to grow share despite the return of a prominent national brand competitor. And second, the infant formula category continues to drive significant store brand share gains as a result of key investments in infrastructure and marketing programs. I'd especially on this call like to recognize the infant formula team as our store brand penetration for infant formula is now over 14%. You can see also on the slide that our strong market position in OTC health care continues to be driven by favorable market dynamics. The store brand proposition continues to resonate well as consumers look for ways to save money without compromising quality or effectiveness.
One favorable dynamic that I want to highlight is the continued importance of the Rx-to-OTC switches, which can be seen on Slide 13. Notably, we believe there are more than $19 billion of potential Rx-to-OTC switch opportunities that Perrigo is well positioned to capitalize on. Given the current backdrop of a health care industry, it is reasonable to expect that consumers, insurers and government programs will continue to seek more affordable health care options. Switching prescription products to over-the-counter is a simple way to take costs out of the system and one that we continue to see as a core element of our CHC business. While I will not touch on all of these categories, we've already seen some of these categories expand, and we believe others have room to grow. Over the past few years, we've seen brands in the nasal category move over-the-counter: Nasacort, Flonase, Rhinocort. This is typically how we see categories expand. Once one product is in category switches, others will follow. Given this dynamic, I'd like to highlight the recent FDA approval of an acne product to move over-the-counter We believe this could be a catalyst for other products in the acne category to move OTC, and this is a category where Perrigo already has a strong presence.
As we look over the next 3 years, we see promising opportunities within our new product pipeline. You can see that recent switches from some of the categories we just discussed will be playing a significant role in our new product sales going forward. With the pipeline representing more than $1 billion in brand sales over the next 3 years, we are well positioned to leverage industry tailwinds at our OTC business.
Looking at Slide 15. Updates we implemented in the Rx forecasting process last quarter proved beneficial this quarter as achieved its internal forecast. As you can see here, our Rx business is a leader in the extended topical space. The business has grown from its infancy just over 10 years ago to a leader in the space today. We continue to executing on our [ph] strategy for the segment, focusing on tougher-to-manufacture products with higher barriers to entry. Obviously, price erosion is still a large concern industry-wide. However, during the second half of the year, pricing remains [ph] in line with our expectations. The segment remains in a leading market position, and we continue to invest in our pipeline. Adjusted operating margins remain attractive. As I discussed earlier, we continue to assess the business [ph] role in Perrigo going forward.
Turning to Slide 16. We continue to anticipate new product launches of approximately $300 million in 2016. This represents growth of approximately 5% over reported net sales in calendar 2015. As a reminder, this year, we have already launched the store brand versions of Flonase, Nasacort and 3 of the guaifenesin family of products.
With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Judy, who will walk you through the third quarter results. Judy?"

On Slide 19, you can see third quarter adjusted consolidated net sales were $1.3 billion, an increase of $29 million or 3% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. As a reminder, these numbers exclude from both periods sales from held-for-sale businesses, including the API business, our European sports brand and the U.S. VMS business, the sale of which was completed on August 5. Growth in the quarter was driven by higher adjusted net sales in the U.S. OTC business and the infant nutrition category within our CHC segment as well as higher sales in the Rx segment related to product acquisitions and new product sales. For the quarter, consolidated new product sales of $79 million were offset in part by $10 million of discontinued products.
Looking at the segment results on Slide 20. CHC adjusted net sales in the quarter increased approximately $14 million year-over-year or 3% on a constant currency basis. Our U.S. consumer business grew nearly 4% in the quarter, largely attributable to continued strong performance in the infant nutrition and smoking cessation categories and new product sales of $33 million, driven primarily by the store brand launches of fluticasone and 3 products in the guaifenesin family. These increases were offset partially by price erosion, lower sales in our antacid category and discontinued products of $6 million. Our sales were also impacted by the absence of our higher-margin Mucinex 600-milligram extended-release equivalent store brand product and unfavorable foreign currency movement of $7 million. This year, adjusted gross profit margin was 35%. I'd like to remind you that last year was a record quarter for the segment, driven by strong product mix. On a comparative basis, this quarter's adjusted gross margins were lower due primarily to the absence of the product I just mentioned, pricing pressures and the fact that many of the new product launches this year are partnered products, which means that gross profit dollars are shared with our supplier.
Let me talk to you a little bit about pricing in the segment. As we discussed in the past, in today's macroeconomic environment, our customers continue to look for value and ask that we pass our material cost efficiencies on to them. This is a new. Our team has quietly and effectively fought this fight for years, working every day to meet our customers' needs for continually lower prices. In the quarter, this net effect has only slightly impacted adjusted gross profit margins as we've been able to largely offset this with scale and efficiencies. The team sustained adjusted operating margins of 20% as we continue to proactively manage operating expenses, which were lower in the quarter. We continue to invest in our business, increasing spending in R&D investments by 8% compared to last year on an adjusted basis.
Turning to Slide 21. The Branded Consumer Healthcare segment's adjusted net sales were $304 million compared to $302 million last year and grew 2% on a constant currency basis. These results included $18 million from acquisitions, while new product sales contributed $26 million. These increases were offset primarily by lower sales in the lifestyle and natural health vitamin product categories as well as lower sales in the markets John discussed earlier.
Adjusted gross profit margins were 47.5%, consistent with the second quarter of 2016. However, compared to the prior year, the segment experienced lower adjusted gross profit margins in the quarter. Approximately half of the margin change compared to the prior year was due to the business dynamics in Belgium, where the new management team there will work on improving the operating model in this market for a longer-term consistency in operating results, as John outlined earlier. We also experienced unfavorable mix in the quarter due to the lower sales in lifestyle and natural health vitamins categories, which have higher-than-average margins. In addition, we experienced unfavorable currency effects on euro-denominated purchases for the U.K. sterling market.
The BCH segment realized adjusted operating margin of 10% in the quarter. Lower adjusted gross profit was partially offset by cost-containment measures and lower advertising and promotion spending as management moderated A&P priorities in the quarter to align with market dynamics.
In the third quarter, we realized an impairment for indefinite and indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill related to our BCH business of $1.7 billion. The factors that contributed to this impairment were: one, changes in the market and performance of the brands due to moderated new product launch assumptions; two, execution of certain key product strategies falling short of operating management's plans causing a reduction to baseline forecast models in France, Germany and Italy; three, certain macroeconomic factors, which have continued to impact the business more than expected, in addition to unfavorable foreign currency impacts experienced primarily in the U.K. related to Brexit; and four, a change in the Belgian forecast due to a fundamental reduction in volume with a major wholesaler that is not expected to be short term in nature. The calculation of this impairment is a complicated process. While our GAAP net income and EPS include a preliminary calculation for the related tax effect of the impairment, we are completing our final control procedures, which will be finalized by the end of our -- by the filing of our 10-Q, which is anticipated to be by the end of the day today. Any changes to this would not impact our adjusted earnings per share discussed throughout this announcement today.
Turning now to Rx on Slide 22. Net sales were $267 million, 4% higher than last year on a constant currency basis, driven largely by $32 million related to acquisitions and new product sales of $18 million. The Rx adjusted gross margin was 59% in the quarter due to product acquisitions and new products. Pricing pressures in the segment were in line with our expectations announced last quarter. In addition to acquisitions, we also experienced meaningful productivity improvements compared to last year, which were a factor in offsetting the effect of lower pricing. Adjusted operating margin for the segment was 42.5%, an increase of 40 basis points over the same period last year. R&D investments in the quarter increased $6 million as the team continues to invest in pipeline products.
Our Specialty Sciences segment realized net sales in the quarter of $93 million compared to $85 million last year. Tysabri sales benefited in the quarter from a onetime favorable adjustment to discounts and allowances. Based on the current royalty percentage that Perrigo received, the effect of this benefit was approximately $3.6 million. In addition, the segment benefited from a $6 million reduction in operating expenses due to lower legal costs in the current year.
Turning to Slide 24 and an update on our balance sheet. As of October 1, 2016, total cash on the balance sheet was $363 million, and total debt was approximately $5.9 billion. Our total debt declined by over $500 million in the previous quarter end as we proactively repaid our $500 million of senior notes, which would have matured on November 8, 2016, consistent with our stated deleveraging strategy and our commitment to our investment-grade ratings. We generated $304 million of cash from operating activities during the quarter, which brings us to approximately $704 million of cash from operating activities for the first 9 months of the year. This represents a cash flow conversion of operating cash flow to adjusted net income of 129% in the quarter. Excluding the contribution of the Tysabri royalty from both the numerator and denominator of this equation, the conversion would increase to 148%. We will continue to use our strong cash flow conversion to prioritize our capital allocation toward deleveraging. We do not intend to reenter the share repurchase market in the near term, and as John stated earlier, our commitment to our investment-grade rating extends to the alternatives process we are undertaking for Tysabri.
Turning to Slide 26. We are confirming the full year 2016 adjusted earnings per share guidance midpoint we announced in August. I would like to take a moment to briefly review the details by segment. For the CHC segment, we continue to expect 2016 adjusted net sales of approximately $2.6 billion and second half adjusted operating margins in line with those in the first half. I would like to remind you that these expectations continue to exclude 2016 contributions from the U.S. VMS business, which was sold on August 5. We still expect approximately $1.3 billion in adjusted net sales for the BCH segment, and we now anticipate adjusted operating margins for the second half of the year to be approximately 10%, which is due primarily to lower adjusted gross profit contributions due to the effects discussed earlier. We continue to align A&P spend with sales patterns and therefore expect fourth quarter seasonal A&P spend to be higher relative to the third quarter to support the cough/cold season. The Rx segment net sales guidance also remains unchanged at approximately $1 billion, and we continue to expect adjusted operating margin in the low 40% range for the full year. Consistent with our comments last quarter, our forecast continues to assume second half year-over-year price erosion on like-for-like products of 9% to 10%. We expect consolidated full year 2016 cash flows to be approximately $900 million.
I'll now turn the call back over to John."

In closing, on Slide 28, I outlined specific areas of strategic and operational focus shortly after becoming CEO in the spring. I'm pleased to have been able to share with you today the many actions we've completed and initiated, making substantial progress on multiple fronts in line with these focus areas. While we have challenges to overcome, I believe the team can deliver the Perrigo advantage. CHC adjusted net sales growth was solid in the quarter, and the segment achieved strong margins. We're executing against our plans in BCH to drive greater profitability and enhance the business. Our continued focus on Rx execution paid off in the quarter as the team was in line with expectations and margins remained attractive. It's been a busy 6 months, and I, with the help of the board and our management team, have been working hard to enhance performance and drive shareholder value. And there's much work left to be done. We're performing our business review expeditiously but thoughtfully, drawing on the right expertise with an objective lens. I am confident we're in the right course to improve our performance and address our challenges. Now more than ever, the importance of affordable health care products is clear, and Perrigo is uniquely positioned to provide these products to our customers and patients across the globe.
Thank you. Brad?"

Because I am quite certain that many of you are curious as to the fact that we had a large impairment recorded in May and are again going through this same exercise only 6 months later. The entire process of calculating impairment starts with run rate indicators on the underlying assets of the business. So as you, I'm sure, Sumant, being the careful reader of these Qs and Ks that you are, I'm sure that you noted that we have outlined that the basis of the original assets -- the original purchase price accounting are definite and indefinite-lived assets by product category, which means, and I remember commenting on this in our May earnings call, that as expectations on those specific categories change over time, it changes the perspective on the long-term indefinite cash flows discounted back to today. What does that mean? At the time we did our evaluation in May, we had certain assertions, country by country, on the future cash flows from our XLS medical technology, a weight loss product, other products in our lifestyle category as well as certain other products in cough/cold and our animal health categories in Europe. In the last 6 months, some of the assertions on those product categories have changed further, both combination of these 4 [ph] things I outlined in the call, macroeconomic factors and the management team's assertion of how to utilize those assets best on a go-forward basis. So yes, inherent to your question, has the expectation of run rate of revenues from those categories changed? Yes. And that is the underlying starting point of an indicator of impairment and the reason that the entire process had to be started over again to rerun cash flows for those product categories, those definite and indefinite-lived assets. And due to the magnitude of the change projected in those particular products and categories, it did also trigger the indicator to run a goodwill impairment analysis, i.e. what are the total cash flows of the total business ex -- even including those assets that are not specifically targeted, the product categories I've commented on already. So stepping back, the underlying expectation on run rate for our business in Europe continues to be -- to grow at a rate above market. But the combination of products to get there, the assertion of brand strategies to make that successful and the contributors of -- to those cash flows on a long-term basis have changed, thereby creating the underlying impairment that you see in the books today. John, I don't know if you want to comment [ph] on future run rate."

When we look at the portfolio from a broader view and perspective, Tysabri, as we said, was a noncore part of that overall portfolio. It wasn't a strategic part of our business. It wasn't one of those links that we want to grow, drive, et cetera. And in fact, it was a good contributor of financial, good leverage there but didn't contribute to the core part of what we were doing. So as we looked at it from a strategic standpoint, we said it's noncore. And at what point does it make sense to look at other strategic alternatives for it? And was now the right time or sometime in the future? But we elected as a board to say, ""No, we believe now is the right time to look for that and do that.""

That being said, the plan would be -- to John's point, in order to focus the portfolio and focus on core businesses that we would use that cash, first and foremost, to delever, looking at being able to get down to something more like 3.25 turn and deploying the cash that would come from that sale from any sale, first and foremost, to delever the balance sheet. Effective tax rate-wise, you got into a little granularity in trying to prognosticate on any kind of Irish tax structures. Suffice it to say, at the time we would have a sale, the effective tax rate would also go up for the company. Why? Jurisdictional mix. This particular assets royalty streams today, our tax in the single digits. And so without that mix of earnings before tax in there, obviously, the remaining -- remain co-tax rate will be higher.

So while we haven't given long-term guidance or even 2017 guidance in CHC, that is the framework that the team is entering [ph] planning with -- and one that they're planning to, again, pass value on to customers and maintain margins on the go forward."

The way I think about, yes, BCH and Consumer Healthcare and our core businesses is the way we deliver the best value is when we can find good M&A opportunities that fit right into those business segments. When we find products categories that fit in to our Consumer Healthcare business, we're able to drop value very quickly to the bottom line because the infrastructure supports it. My belief is we will get the infrastructure in a better place in Europe, instead of a number of unique, different infrastructures, we'll be able to fill them together in a more efficient structure and want to continue to have product acquisitions, smaller things that we bolt on to that that can deliver value to the bottom very quickly. So again, I call them bolt-on acquisitions within our core focus, that consumer-facing, the focus on delivering value to consumers, to me, we can deliver great value there. And so I wouldn't see us in the near term trying to do a transformational acquisition that change the face of who we are. I'd see us creating focus and looking for bolt-on acquisitions that add value to our core."

Let me talk about Branded Consumer Healthcare first. So kind of comment, as I said in my opening comments, as I've said is that consumer-facing company bring value, M&A, larger footprint and presence in Europe, in concept, is a good place to be. Markets are growing. They're good consumer markets. I believe they're going to continue to evolve to meet cost-effective solutions, whether it's brands or store brands that we offer in countries, those kind of things. So any macroeconomic level, I like being Europe. I think it's a good place to be. Now I'd step back and say, ""Does that mean that every part of our branded business and consumer parts in Europe are operating well and we belong in long term?"" And I'd say, ""We're going through that analysis."" We announced the last time we were doing some restructuring and looking at potential exits from products in Russia that the -- Argentina, which is in Europe, I realize that. South Africa, other areas. So we continue to look at the branded consumer portfolio and say we have a right to win in this country, we have the right product, do we have the right go-to-market strategy? And I think there will continue to be pruning of that overall portfolio to make it much more effective. On the organizational and G&A effectiveness and operating cost of goods effectiveness, we can continue to drive more efficiency and effectiveness there to make sure that the sales we have drop right to the bottom line. So a lot of work in what I'd call creating the Perrigo Bureau is not from how we sell, not to go-to-market, but the actual back office, how we're able to deliver sales to bottom is what we got to continue to work on there. So fundamentally, yes, I like being there. It's not been easy. It won't -- we still have a lot of work to do, but I think the market ties in with our consumer-facing side. The -- when I think about the OTC and Rx business, and again, I said this before, there are some ties in the business between operating side things, plant, some of the procurement side, those kind of things that are good links from that standpoint. Certainly, going to market, the selling process, the people you call on at the buying groups, et cetera, are different. So on the backside, they are there. They are good synergies we're able to pull out, but they probably aren't game changers, as far as ultimate decisions to make. We'd look at all of those and say those are part of the equation, and they wouldn't limit us from deciding to do something else with the business, if that's where the data where we chose to go. I hope that's helpful."

So first of all, revenue synergies between -- I'll say that the Europe and U.S. or U.S. and Europe, those kind of revenue synergies, have been slower to materialize than was originally contemplate",474,"Yes. So let me go through a number of those in order here. So first of all, revenue synergies between -- I'll say that the Europe and U.S. or U.S. and Europe, those kind of revenue synergies, have been slower to materialize than was originally contemplated. The -- just because of the regulatory processes, the unique ingredients in some of the products here that we've got to kind of do changes to get them in Europe and vice versa. So that part of it has been slower than expected. So yes, the actual operating synergies and cost and those kinds of things continue to progress as well, but it's taken us longer to get those reverse synergies. We have, in certain markets, worked out, in the U.K. example, where we have a big presence of store brands from legacy Perrigo and doing a lot to combine our branded business with our store brand, with our pharmacy business because of what is and we have this all under this a great leader for Perrigo who runs that whole business now. And he's driving synergies across all combination of that business structure. So Marc, we haven't given up on the synergies to move products back and forth, to move that. We're actually doing more processes moving back and forth and products at this point, but we think there still are synergies there, and we need to drive some of that. Let me go to Belgium and some of the issues there. First of all, we still do business with Stada. We still move it through. We continue -- we do a number of different distribution methods in Belgium. There's a number of different avenues to go to market. One of the biggest ones is through pharmacy distributors, pharmacy wholesalers, as you might call them here in the U.S. And the -- and they would go out to independent pharmacies throughout the Belgium country. There's been, what I'd call, inventory and efficiencies in that model, selling in, selling out, making sure we got good tracking now with the sellout. So we know what's going there, but making sure that we understand where all the pockets of inventory are and how to manage and normalize that has created longer than we had originally expected. We expected it to normalize relatively quick. So we continue to work with distributors, the wholesalers, the chain, everything in Belgium to make that smooth or flow smoother. And it has definitely taking us longer than expected, but that relationship is good. We continue to exhibit their products as well as our own OTC products to that same channel. On the -- a last question was on key brands and how much of the portfolio they made was the question are what the -- can you as that one more time, Marc. I'm sorry."

The -- when you look at pharma space, et cetera, pricing again has always been a dynamic that's in there, although it's gotten more dramatic here recently at Perrigo.

But keep in that pipeline, getting those products approved and launched becomes the way that you work to offset that pricing dynamic, and that continues to be the battle all the time, especially in this dynamic pricing environment we're in.

And then you have a pretty big launch coming up in [indiscernible] I was wondering if you could comment on the dynamics? Do you expect this to be one of your biggest products like Prilosec? Or do you expect a little more competition pending for Nexium?"

First of all, I mean, cough/cold, I'll just say, [indiscernible] the last couple of years, our operating supply team has gotten better and better, and the customers have gotten better and better. And so the inventory they used to buy, in the old days, if I go back to my junior days, they buy 5 months' worth of products because they were concerned you're going to be able to supply in the cold season. That doesn't happen anymore. We do ship some products in, but they are storing small amounts, and they expect that our supply chain can keep it flowing. So you don't have these huge surges of big product inflows like we used to, again, 10 years ago or so. So they are sitting where they want to be for the season right now. We are prepped and ready, continue to operate and ready for that to happen. Allergy was a little bit lighter here in the fall, and cough/cold really hasn't started taking off yet. Weather has been a little bit milder. But we are ready to service that when and if it hits. On the Nexium issue, we are gearing up and prepared. As you know, we have a tentative approval for that product. There are other filers in that space, but we are preparing for the launch whenever that date arrives to get that to market certainly next year."

Maybe first, on the Rx side, just given some of the dynamics in the generic space and the consolidating customer base, do you believe that more scale, whether that's achieved either through buying additional assets or selling the franchise and getting scale that way, would help the portfolio? Or do you feel like given the strength you have in your vertical that really isn't a consideration we should be thinking about as you look at strategic options for that business? Second question was on BCH, just latest thinking about long-term operating margin targets? Is there some rough numbers you can point us to where margins could recover to over time?"

So first of all, generic space, certainly, the consolidated number of buyers, kind of the atmosphere right now on drug pricing, all those kind of things that certainly have a dynamic on the pricing what's been going on. I think there are times when scale certainly is beneficial. You're going in with [indiscernible] and I would say on the Rx side, especially in our categories, most of the buyers won't just buy a whole category from you, whatever their product specific. So scale, while good, because it -- you got a broader array of products to bounce any one price decrease, price concession of, there's still bidding, asking for price, asking if you want to bid on a product, item by item. And so really that part of it doesn't give you huge benefits from the scale. There's a spreading of the risk that helps. I think when you look at BCH longer term, our goal is to continue to drive net operating margin up to what I'd call our Consumer Healthcare margins, so up to the higher teens, in my mind. Now we've got a lot of work to get there because, as Judy said, we're looking at 10% or so. That includes product growth and higher margins than where we're at as well as operating efficiencies to deliver support to those products so more of that sales drop to the bottom. Judy, you have anything to add to that?"

It's different because we are not going on a pan-European basis across all countries in Europe, but doing spending more locally or regionally-focused. Part of the initiative or thinking about ongoing enhancements to adjusted operating margin on a long-term basis is finding ways to go to market and lead away as possible. But still, even increase our A&P spend as percent of sales to afford more bullish marketing through advertising -- sorry, pull marketing through advertising and have the right balance of push, i.e. selling expenses in the portfolio to optimize the overall revenue growth on a long-term basis. So trying to strive for enhancing the percent of sales and maintaining that comparability with a larger European, pan-European brand."

We have a lot to cover today. First, I want to provide a comprehensive progress update on the strategic and operational action plans that I outlined during our last earnings call. We've made a lot of progress, but there's still much work to be done. Then Judy will walk through the financial results for the quarter, and I'll end with a final comment before our Q&A session.
Turning to Slide 4. At the outset, I want to reinforce the team's strong belief in Perrigo's strategy to providing quality, affordable health care products to customers and consumers around the world. In fact, we believe it is vital to our current global health care environment. Macro trends for our business are strong, and Perrigo is in a unique position to capitalize on those trends. Regardless of the political or economic climate, global consumers, customers, insurers alike continue to search for effective health care products that provide value. And Perrigo remains a leader in providing both effective products and great value to both consumers in front and behind the pharmacy counter. In fact, every second of every day, nearly 2,200 people around the globe use a Perrigo product, and our products save consumers more than $7.5 billion every year. This is a great place to operate.
Turning to Slide 5. Foremost, I want to begin by saying that we had a solid quarter in line with expectations, which I'm pleased to share with you. Good top line growth in our Consumer Healthcare segment was led by U.S. Consumer Healthcare adjusted net sales increase of 4%, despite a poor allergy season. In addition, this team continues to drive strong adjusted operating margins at 20% in the quarter. And our Rx business performance was in line with our expectations. Importantly, the cash generation of the business model continues to be strong with $304 million generated in the quarter.
This quarter, we also made great progress against a number of our actions to focus and improve our business. And I know you're all interested in hearing about that. With assistance from a leading consulting firm, we continue to make substantial progress against these initiatives to maximize shareholder value. Let me give you some of the highlights here, and then I will drive -- dive deeper into them on the slides that follow.
First, corporate governance. I'm excited that we added 2 new board members with great, relevant experience and long track records of creating value. Their unique expertise and skill sets will also support our ongoing portfolio review that I will address next. Second, we conducted portfolio review to optimize our business offerings. As announced in April, we have been thoroughly assessing our portfolio through a comprehensive strategic, operational and financial review of all of our businesses. As I've said, we will not leave any stone unturned. With that in mind, this slide outlines the items we've completed or initiated to date. The board and management believe the next step to unlock shareholder value is today's announcement that we are exploring strategic alternatives for the Tysabri royalty stream. We continue to evaluate all businesses, including the market position and growth opportunities for our U.S. Rx business, which I'll also discuss further.
Third, improved performance in BCH. We've taken a number of actions this quarter, leveraging core strengths in Consumer Healthcare to address a number of challenges with the goal of enhancing margins. I will discuss in more detail specific market dynamics and actions in the slide that follows.
Fourth, we will focus our efforts to optimize organizational effectiveness. A core strength of Perrigo is to build effective operating systems and organizational structures to deliver performance. A key component of our future success is to match cost structures with existing and future expected market dynamics, and we are conducting a review of our optimal cost structure going forward to achieve our business objectives.
And finally, we'll continue to work hard every day for our customers and consumers. I have continued to assert that we have fundamentally sound and attractive businesses and with unique competitive advantages. Despite their challenges, both our CHC and Rx segment continue to deliver strong operating margins.
Now let me dive a little bit further into each of these. Turning to Slide 6. This morning, we announced that our board appointed 2 new directors, Geoff Parker, who has already joined the board; and Ted Samuels, who will begin his service on January 4, 2017. Geoff brings a wealth of financial expertise, while Ted brings a significant investor perspective. As you can see on their slide, their experience is direct result -- excuse me, directly relevant to our current strategy and ongoing initiatives. Additionally, 2 of our current board members, Michael Jandernoa and Gary Kunkle, have elected to not stand for reelection. While they will continue to serve as directors until our next AGM, I would like to thank both Mike and Gary for their long-term service and commitment to Perrigo. We continue to work with a nationally recognized search firm to identify other potential independent directors who possess significant experience and successful track records of delivering shareholder value.
Turning to Slide 7. A key outcome of our ongoing portfolio review is today's announcement that we would explore alternatives for Tysabri royalty stream. As you know, Tysabri dramatically improves the quality of life for patients with MS. And financially, it provides stable and predictable cash flow. After careful consideration, the board and management believe that now is the right time to explore a review of strategic alternatives for Tysabri to potentially monetize the value of this attractive asset, which we believe will enable us to derisk, delever and continue to focus on Perrigo's core strengths. In our portfolio review, we are weighing the benefits of divesting or finding alternatives for asset alongside our commitment to maintain an investment-grade rating. Any proceeds from a potential Tysabri sale would be prioritized with this comment in mind, as retaining our investment-grade status is a cornerstone to our capital structure philosophy.
Turning to Slide 8. As we all know, the Rx space has been very dynamic over the last year, month, week, however you want to look at it. I have had many conversations with investors over the last few months about the future of our Rx business, and we continue to evaluate the business' market dynamics, portfolio strategies and long-range growth opportunities in order to generate the best value. Our strategic review of the segment requires an in-depth, comprehensive evaluation of the interdependencies within our business. Such areas of manufacturing, shared service functions and tax are more complicated and deserve thoughtful considerations. The Perrigo board has formed a special subcommittee with me on our Rx business to evaluate all of these aspects and determine the best path to optimize shareholder value with this segment. We expect to complete this review in the first quarter of 2017.
On to Slide 9. Now I'll discuss our Branded Consumer Healthcare business. As you may have seen this morning, first, we announced a noncash impairment charge in our BCH segment. Second, Perrigo Board of Directors has authorized the company to initiate a claim and arbitration against the sellers of Omega Pharma Invest NV, which we plan to do before the end of this year. As you would expect, while you may have questions in this regard, it is our policy to not comment on legal matters, so we will not provide further detail at this time.
Despite the impairment, which Judy will discuss in detail, I continue to believe in the long-term power of this business, along with its core platforms and competencies. Across the European continent, there are a number of tailwinds that are encouraging for the long-term outlook in this business. OTC market growth remains healthy at approximately 2% to 3% per year, and consumer demographics and dynamics continue to trend favorably, driving increased use of OTC products. We have been actively engaged in Europe over the past 6 months to build out our leadership team, enhance processes and develop organizational effectiveness needed to improve the performance of the BCH segment. Our long-term objectives for this business are: first, we are committed to bringing the BCH business to CHC-level profitability. We are currently in the process of overlaying the CHC operational philosophies, experience and expertise to enhance BCH performance. Second, we are a top 5 European OTC business with scale and reach in the multiple channels and in multiple markets. Our goal is to remain a top player within the Europe infrastructure. Finally, we believe that this business can attain at or above-market growth in the long term. We continue to prioritize brand strategies in core markets, which should enable more predictable financial results. Many of the individual markets in which we operate are performing well, like the U.K., Spain, the Netherlands and the Nordics, and we remain optimistic about the potential of the BCH business given all these factors. That said, there is still much work to be done to achieve these objectives.
Turning to Slide 10 and continuing with the BCH business. European OTC market has different channels to the consumer, for instance, approximately 1/3 of our business in the wholesale pharmacy channel, and we are particularly focused on the inventory management systems in those countries employing this model. Order patterns of products we sell into the wholesale pharmacy channels are not always aligned with sellout patterns to pharmacies as the wholesalers act as a conduit, which could build inventory inefficiencies, something we are systematically addressing. With our strengths, opportunities and challenges in mind, we have a series of actions to focus on countries and products where we have the ability to win in the marketplace. The action plan comprises 4 key initiatives which are underway. One, the success of an organization starts with leadership. The countries where we perform well have effective, efficient, great leaders who are able to quickly adapt to changing market dynamics. We have added 4 new country leaders to expand our expertise and have fresh perspectives on our go-to-market strategies in countries that are not meeting expectations. I am confident that we have the right people in place for these countries. Two, we are prioritizing certain geographies and brand strategies across the portfolio, aligning investments with our ability to win by product and by market. This means identifying the geographies and opportunities that have the capability to provide high returns on investment and making plans to either divest or partner with others who can better manage commercial sales efforts, in particular, countries where there is no clear path. Currently, there are 4 challenging countries we are focused on. In Belgium and Italy, we are focused on inventory channel inefficiencies. In Germany, we are focused on working to achieve greater scale. And in France, we are making strategic investments in innovation to diversify our product concentration from seasonal lifestyle products. Three, we're taking steps to be more efficient and align costs with revenues. We are continuing to integrate the BCH infrastructure on to our Irish platform and overlay CHC operational philosophies, experience and expertise to enhance the margin profile on incentivizing the business team to focus on margin growth. Fourth, new products are the lifeline of a growing consumer company, and we are no different. For us to be successful in the long term, we need to increase investments in innovation to bring more novel products to market. As an example, we have a great success with our new multi-symptom formula, Bronchostop, which has achieved the #1 position in the U.K. This product is currently being launched in other attractive markets. While they will take time to fully materialize, I'm confident that these 4 specific actions will improve profitability. I see a path to CHC-level operating margins for the business, and I'm committed to taking steps to improve this important business. 
Turning to Slide 11. We continue to maximize the global infrastructure we have in place, and I'm pleased to note that last year's announced consolidation of our global supply chain activities in Ireland is generating a run rate benefit of approximately $40 million in net income, a nice job as a team to hit this target. We will continue to focus our efforts to optimize organizational effectiveness. As discussed last quarter, we're making good progress towards our goal of realizing an additional $40 million in the Branded Consumer Healthcare supply chain savings, which we expect to achieve over the next 2 years. Let me reiterate. One of our core strength is building effective operating systems and organizational structures to deliver performance results. Our future success relies on managing cost structures with existing and future expected market dynamics. To this end, we are conducting an even more comprehensive review of our overall cost structure going forward to achieve our business objectives. We expect this study to conclude in the first quarter of 2017.
As you can see on Slide 12, the store brand OTC category continues to grow, despite significant national brand product launches that are experiencing a period of exclusivity as well as a return of a prominent national brand. I would like to briefly highlight 2 store brand categories on this slide. First, the smoking cessation category continues to grow share despite the return of a prominent national brand competitor. And second, the infant formula category continues to drive significant store brand share gains as a result of key investments in infrastructure and marketing programs. I'd especially on this call like to recognize the infant formula team as our store brand penetration for infant formula is now over 14%. You can see also on the slide that our strong market position in OTC health care continues to be driven by favorable market dynamics. The store brand proposition continues to resonate well as consumers look for ways to save money without compromising quality or effectiveness.
One favorable dynamic that I want to highlight is the continued importance of the Rx-to-OTC switches, which can be seen on Slide 13. Notably, we believe there are more than $19 billion of potential Rx-to-OTC switch opportunities that Perrigo is well positioned to capitalize on. Given the current backdrop of a health care industry, it is reasonable to expect that consumers, insurers and government programs will continue to seek more affordable health care options. Switching prescription products to over-the-counter is a simple way to take costs out of the system and one that we continue to see as a core element of our CHC business. While I will not touch on all of these categories, we've already seen some of these categories expand, and we believe others have room to grow. Over the past few years, we've seen brands in the nasal category move over-the-counter: Nasacort, Flonase, Rhinocort. This is typically how we see categories expand. Once one product is in category switches, others will follow. Given this dynamic, I'd like to highlight the recent FDA approval of an acne product to move over-the-counter We believe this could be a catalyst for other products in the acne category to move OTC, and this is a category where Perrigo already has a strong presence.
As we look over the next 3 years, we see promising opportunities within our new product pipeline. You can see that recent switches from some of the categories we just discussed will be playing a significant role in our new product sales going forward. With the pipeline representing more than $1 billion in brand sales over the next 3 years, we are well positioned to leverage industry tailwinds at our OTC business.
Looking at Slide 15. Updates we implemented in the Rx forecasting process last quarter proved beneficial this quarter as achieved its internal forecast. As you can see here, our Rx business is a leader in the extended topical space. The business has grown from its infancy just over 10 years ago to a leader in the space today. We continue to executing against our strategy for the segment, focusing on tougher-to-manufacture products with higher barriers to entry. Obviously, price erosion is still a large concern industry-wide. However, during the second half of the year, pricing remains in line with our expectations. The segment remains in a leading market position, and we continue to invest in our pipeline. Adjusted operating margins remain attractive. As I discussed earlier, we continue to assess the business as well as Perrigo going forward.
Turning to Slide 16. We continue to anticipate new product launches of approximately $300 million in 2016. This represents growth of approximately 5% over reported net sales in calendar 2015. As a reminder, this year, we have already launched the store brand versions of Flonase, Nasacort and 3 of the guaifenesin family of products.
With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Judy, who will walk you through the third quarter results. Judy?"

As you could see on Slide 18, reported net sales for the quarter were $1.4 billion, and reported net loss was $1.3 billion compared to net income of $113 million in the prior year. Non-GAAP adjustments to the reported numbers include add-backs of items such as impairment charges, restructuring charges and acquisition- and integration-related items, including the amortization of acquired intangible assets. As outlined in our press release this morning, in the third quarter, we realized an impairment for indefinite and definite-lived intangible assets and goodwill related to our BCH business of $1.7 billion. I will provide more details on this charge in a few moments.
On Slide 19, you can see third quarter adjusted consolidated net sales were $1.3 billion, an increase of $29 million or 3% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. As a reminder, these numbers exclude from both periods sales from held-for-sale businesses, including the API business, our European sports brand and the U.S. VMS business, the sale of which was completed on August 5. Growth in the quarter was driven by higher adjusted net sales in the U.S. OTC business and the infant nutrition category within our CHC segment as well as higher sales in the Rx segment related to product acquisitions and new product sales. For the quarter, consolidated new product sales of $79 million were offset in part by $10 million of discontinued products.
Looking at the segment results on Slide 20. CHC adjusted net sales in the quarter increased approximately $14 million year-over-year or 3% on a constant currency basis. Our U.S. consumer business grew nearly 4% in the quarter, largely attributable to continued strong performance in the infant nutrition and smoking cessation categories and new product sales of $33 million, driven primarily by the store brand launches of fluticasone and 3 products in the guaifenesin family. These increases were offset partially by price erosion, lower sales in our antacid category and discontinued products of $6 million. Our sales were also impacted by the absence of our higher-margin Mucinex 600-milligram extended-release equivalent store brand product and unfavorable foreign currency movement of $7 million. This year, adjusted gross profit margin was 35%. I'd like to remind you that last year was a record quarter for the segment, driven by strong product mix. On a comparative basis, this quarter's adjusted gross margins were lower due primarily to the absence of the product I just mentioned, pricing pressures and the fact that many of the new product launches this year are partnered products, which means that gross profit dollars are shared with our supplier.
Let me talk to you a little bit about pricing in the segment. As we discussed in the past, in today's macroeconomic environment, our customers continue to look for value and ask that we pass our material cost efficiencies on to them. This is a new. Our team has quietly and effectively fought this fight for years, working every day to meet our customers' needs for continually lower prices. In the quarter, this net effect has only slightly impacted adjusted gross profit margins as we've been able to largely offset this with scale and efficiencies. The team sustained adjusted operating margins of 20% as we continue to proactively manage operating expenses, which were lower in the quarter. We continue to invest in our business, increasing spending in R&D investments by 8% compared to last year on an adjusted basis.
Turning to Slide 21. The Branded Consumer Healthcare segment's adjusted net sales were $304 million compared to $302 million last year and grew 2% on a constant currency basis. These results included $18 million from acquisitions, while new product sales contributed $26 million. These increases were offset primarily by lower sales in the lifestyle and natural health vitamin product categories as well as lower sales in the markets John discussed earlier.
Adjusted gross profit margins were 47.5%, consistent with the second quarter of 2016. However, compared to the prior year, the segment experienced lower adjusted gross profit margins in the quarter. Approximately half of the margin change compared to the prior year was due to the business dynamics in Belgium, where the new management team there will work on improving the operating model in this market for a longer-term consistency in operating results, as John outlined earlier. We also experienced unfavorable mix in the quarter due to the lower sales in lifestyle and natural health vitamins categories, which have higher-than-average margins. In addition, we experienced unfavorable currency effects on euro-denominated purchases for the U.K. sterling market.
The BCH segment realized adjusted operating margin of 10% in the quarter. Lower adjusted gross profit was partially offset by cost-containment measures and lower advertising and promotion spending as management moderated A&P priorities in the quarter to align with market dynamics.
In the third quarter, we realized an impairment for indefinite and indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill related to our BCH business of $1.7 billion. The factors that contributed to this impairment were: one, changes in the market and performance of the brands due to moderated new product launch assumptions; two, execution of certain key product strategies falling short of operating management's plans causing a reduction to baseline forecast models in France, Germany and Italy; three, certain macroeconomic factors, which have continued to impact the business more than expected, in addition to unfavorable foreign currency impacts experienced primarily in the U.K. related to Brexit; and four, a change in the Belgian forecast due to a fundamental reduction in volume with a major wholesaler that is not expected to be short term in nature. The calculation of this impairment is a complicated process. While our GAAP net income and EPS include a preliminary calculation for the related tax effect of the impairment, we are completing our final control procedures, which will be finalized by the end of our -- by the filing of our 10-Q, which is anticipated to be by the end of the day today. Any changes to this would not impact our adjusted earnings per share discussed throughout this announcement today.
Turning now to Rx on Slide 22. Net sales were $267 million, 4% higher than last year on a constant currency basis, driven largely by $32 million related to acquisitions and new product sales of $18 million. The Rx adjusted gross margin was 59% in the quarter due to product acquisitions and new products. Pricing pressures in the segment were in line with our expectations announced last quarter. In addition to acquisitions, we also experienced meaningful productivity improvements compared to last year, which were a factor in offsetting the effect of lower pricing. Adjusted operating margin for the segment was 42.5%, an increase of 40 basis points over the same period last year. R&D investments in the quarter increased $6 million as the team continues to invest in pipeline products.
Our Specialty Sciences segment realized net sales in the quarter of $93 million compared to $85 million last year. Tysabri sales benefited in the quarter from a onetime favorable adjustment to discounts and allowances. Based on the current royalty percentage that Perrigo received, the effect of this benefit was approximately $3.6 million. In addition, the segment benefited from a $6 million reduction in operating expenses due to lower legal costs in the current year.
Turning to Slide 24 and an update on our balance sheet. As of October 1, 2016, total cash on the balance sheet was $363 million, and total debt was approximately $5.9 billion. Our total debt declined by over $500 million in the previous quarter end as we proactively repaid our $500 million of senior notes, which would have matured on November 8, 2016, consistent with our stated deleveraging strategy and our commitment to our investment-grade ratings. We generated $304 million of cash from operating activities during the quarter, which brings us to approximately $704 million of cash from operating activities for the first 9 months of the year. This represents a cash flow conversion of operating cash flow to adjusted net income of 129% in the quarter. Excluding the contribution of the Tysabri royalty from both the numerator and denominator of this equation, the conversion would increase to 148%. We will continue to use our strong cash flow conversion to prioritize our capital allocation toward deleveraging. We do not intend to reenter the share repurchase market in the near term, and as John stated earlier, our commitment to our investment-grade rating extends to the alternatives process we are undertaking for Tysabri.
Turning to Slide 26. We are confirming the full year 2016 adjusted earnings per share guidance midpoint we announced in August. I would like to take a moment to briefly review the details by segment. For the CHC segment, we continue to expect 2016 adjusted net sales of approximately $2.6 billion and second half adjusted operating margins in line with those in the first half. I would like to remind you that these expectations continue to exclude 2016 contributions from the U.S. VMS business, which was sold on August 5. We still expect approximately $1.3 billion in adjusted net sales for the BCH segment, and we now anticipate adjusted operating margins for the second half of the year to be approximately 10%, which is due primarily to lower adjusted gross profit contributions due to the effects discussed earlier. We continue to align A&P spend with sales patterns and therefore expect fourth quarter seasonal A&P spend to be higher relative to the third quarter to support the cough/cold season. The Rx segment net sales guidance also remains unchanged at approximately $1 billion, and we continue to expect adjusted operating margin in the low 40% range for the full year. Consistent with our comments last quarter, our forecast continues to assume second half year-over-year price erosion on like-for-like products of 9% to 10%. We expect consolidated full year 2016 cash flows to be approximately $900 million.
I'll now turn the call back over to John."

In closing, on Slide 28, I outlined specific areas of strategic and operational focus shortly after becoming CEO in the spring. I'm pleased to have been able to share with you today the many actions we've completed and initiated, making substantial progress on multiple fronts in line with these focus areas. While we have challenges to overcome, I believe the team can deliver the Perrigo advantage. CHC adjusted net sales growth was solid in the quarter, and the segment achieved strong margins. We're executing against our plans in BCH to drive greater profitability and enhance the business. Our continued focus on Rx execution paid off in the quarter as the team was in line with expectations and margins remained attractive. It's been a busy 6 months, and I, with the help of the board and our management team, have been working hard to enhance performance and drive shareholder value. And there's much work left to be done. We're performing our business review expeditiously but thoughtfully, drawing on the right expertise with an objective lens. I am confident we're in the right course to improve our performance and address our challenges. Now more than ever, the importance of affordable health care products is clear, and Perrigo is uniquely positioned to provide these products to our customers and patients across the globe.
Thank you. Brad?"

Because I am quite certain that many of you are curious as to the fact that we had a large impairment recorded in May and are again going through this same exercise only 6 months later. The entire process of calculating impairment starts with run rate indicators on the underlying assets of the business. So as you, I'm sure, Sumant, being the careful reader of these Qs and Ks that you are, I'm sure that you noted that we have outlined that the basis of the original assets -- the original purchase price accounting are definite and indefinite-lived assets by product category, which means, and I remember commenting on this in our May earnings call, that as expectations on those specific categories change over time, it changes the perspective on the long-term indefinite cash flows discounted back to today. What does that mean? At the time we did our evaluation in May, we had certain assertions, country by country, on the future cash flows from our XLS medical technology, a weight loss product, other products in our lifestyle category as well as certain other products in cough/cold and our animal health categories in Europe. In the last 6 months, some of the assertions on those product categories have changed further, both combination of these 4 things I outlined in the call, macroeconomic factors and the management team's assertion of how to utilize those assets best on a go-forward basis. So yes, inherent to your question, has the expectation of run rate of revenues from those categories changed? Yes. And that is the underlying starting point of an indicator of impairment and the reason that the entire process had to be started over again to rerun cash flows for those product categories, those definite and indefinite-lived assets. And due to the magnitude of the change projected in those particular products and categories, it did also trigger the indicator to run a goodwill impairment analysis, i.e. what are the total cash flows of the total business ex -- even including those assets that are not specifically targeted, the product categories I've commented on already. So stepping back, the underlying expectation on run rate for our business in Europe continues to be -- to grow at a rate above market. But the combination of products to get there, the assertion of brand strategies to make that successful and the contributors of -- to those cash flows on a long-term basis have changed, thereby creating the underlying impairment that you see in the books today. John, I don't know if you want to comment further on future run rate."

They're good consumer markets. I think they're going to continue to evolve, to need cost-effective solutions, whether it's brands or store brands that we offer in countries, those kind of things. So at a macroeconomic level, I like being in Europe. I think the -- it's a good place to be. Now I step back and say, does that mean that every part of our branded business and consumer parts in Europe are operating well and we belong in long term? And I'd say, we're going through that analysis. We announced the last time we were doing some restructuring and looking at potential exits from products in Russia. The -- Argentina, which isn't in Europe, I realize that. South Africa, other areas. So we continue to look at the branded consumer portfolio and say, do we have a right to win in this country? Do we have the right products? Do we have the right go-to-market strategy? And I think there will continue to be pruning of that overall portfolio to make it much more effective. On the organizational and G&A effectiveness and operating cost of goods effectiveness, we can continue to drive more efficiency and effectiveness there to make sure that the sales we have drop right to the bottom line. So a lot of work in what I'd call creating the Perrigo Bureau of not from how we sell, not the go-to-market, but the actual back office, how we're able to deliver sales to the bottom is what we've got to continue to work on there. But -- so fundamentally, yes, I like being there. It's not been easy. It won't -- we still have a lot of work to do, but I think the market ties in with our consumer-facing side. The -- when I think about the OTC and Rx, and again, I said this before, there are some ties to the business between operating side things, plants, some of the procurement side, those kind of things that are good links from that standpoint. Certainly, going to market, the selling process, the people you call on at the buying groups, et cetera, are different. So on the backside, they are there. They are good synergies we're able to pull out, but they probably aren't game changers as far as ultimate decisions to make. We'd look at all of those and say those are part of the equation, and they wouldn't limit us from deciding to do something else with the business if that's where the data where we chose to go. I hope that's helpful."

The",478,"Yes. So let me go through a number of those in order here. So first of all, revenue synergies between, I'll say, the Europe and U.S. or U.S. and Europe, those kind of revenue synergies, have been slower to materialize than was originally contemplated. The -- just because of the regulatory processes, the unique ingredients in some of the products here that we've got to kind of do changes to get them in Europe and vice versa. So that part of it has been slower than expected. The actual operating synergies, the costs and those kinds of things continue to progress as well, but it's taken us longer to get at those reverse synergies. We have, in certain markets, worked -- I'll pick the U.K. an example, where we had a big presence of store brand from legacy Perrigo and doing a lot to combine our branded business with our store brand, with our pharmacy business because of what this is. And we have those all under Neil Lister, a great leader for Perrigo, who runs that whole business now. And he's driving synergies across all combinations of that business structure. So Marc, we haven't given up on the synergies to move products back and forth, to move that. We're actually doing more processes moving back and forth than products at this point. But we think there still are synergies there at least to drive some of that. Let me go to Belgium and some of the issues there. First of all, we still do business with Stada. We still move it through. We've continued -- we do a number of different distribution methods in Belgium. There's a number of different avenues to go to market. One of the biggest ones is through pharmacy distributors, pharmacy wholesalers, as you might call them here in the U.S. And the -- and they would go out to independent pharmacies throughout the Belgium country. There's been what I'd call inventory inefficiencies in that model of selling in, where is it selling out, making sure we've got good tracking now with the sellout so we know what's going there, but making sure that we understand where all the pockets of inventory are and how to manage and normalize that has created longer than we had originally expected. We expected it to normalize relatively quick. So we continue to work with the distributors, the wholesalers, the chains, everything in Belgium, to make that smooth or flow smoother. And it definitely takes us longer than we expected. But that relationship is good. We continue to distribute their products as well as our own OTC products to that same channel. On the -- your last question was on key brands, and how much of the portfolio they made was the question or what the -- can you ask that one more time, Marc? I'm sorry."

So rather than get into granularity right now on this call, talking about specific growth rates of the top brands, we are making changes to certain categories and the expectations of the brand and product growth. Some of the new leadership in Europe is looking specifically at the combination of their local jewel brand investments versus the potential for developing pan-European or more regional brand strategies. Those will be part of our conversations as we go into 2017, but the main area of focus for that operating team on the ground in the last 6 weeks has been trying to get very deep-dive information on what they're planning to do by their product categories in order to put forward meaningful cash flow estimates for those products so that we could do a more refined impairment calculation that we talked about earlier on the call."

But keeping that pipeline, getting those products approved and launched becomes the way that you work to offset that pricing dynamic.

As we've talked about and kind of laid out the parts of the impairment, that doesn't really say that you can't grow the business going forward or the business won't grow. It doesn't say that anything you buy, we'll layer into there and grow it. So you're exactly right that it's sort of a, here's what we have, is it performing as we expected? Are different products performing? And Judy will go into those in a minute here. But it certainly doesn't say there isn't growth for the business and there aren't ways to enhance that growth. Certainly, one of those is innovation within the product lines. So you know this, once you have brands, the brand will become stagnant. You've got to follow it up with the Max Strength and the Extra Max and the -- here's the liquid that goes with the tablet, all of those kind of innovation that flow there. That comes both internally but even more so making sure we fund product acquisitions that can add to that innovation. So that's kind of it's got to be part and it's part of the growth path going forward. And again, I'll let Judy come back to that impairment question in a minute here. On the innovation side, I think you're exactly right. We hired a new Chief Strategy and Innovation Officer to help drive that, to help us to look for how we continue to drive that innovation. He comes from the consumer industry, brings great experience with him and will be great there. I think the other leadership we brought in from the outside have good branded, good consumer, good consumer-facing experience and brings credibility to all those countries where we're selling. So they clearly are not exports from the Perrigo infrastructure to them from that standpoint. And [indiscernible] we are bringing a fair amount of our sales and operations planning, inventory management, cost of goods sold, how to consolidate sites, that sort of infrastructure, bringing that to them because that's sort of a universal thing versus a business-specific skill, et cetera. And I would say, we're not done adding either. So we've added some good ones.

The fact that we had a goodwill impairment in addition means by definition that the long-term cash flows coming from the entire business that we acquired have stepped down. That's -- it's a bounding box, algebraic equation. That one must reexamine each year to say, are the expected cash flow streams from all of the assets that were acquired the same or have they moved since acquisition or since the last goodwill evaluation? So the answer is, yes, it has stepped down. And then to John's point, there's still growth in the model. To the earlier comment, there's still growth expectations ahead of the market, but importantly, we can't -- you can't step away from the earlier statement of have the expectations changed.

And I would say, on the Rx side, especially in our categories, most of the buyers won't just buy a whole category from you, whatever, they are product specific. So scale, while good, because it -- you got a broader array of products to bounce any one price decrease, price concession off, they're still bidding, asking you for price, asking you if you want to bid on a product item by item. And so, really, that part of it doesn't give you huge benefits from the scale. There is a spreading of risk that helps. I think when you look at BCH longer term, our goal is to continue to drive net operating margin up to what I call our Consumer Healthcare margins, so up to the higher teens, in my mind. Now we've got a lot of work to get there because, as Judy said, we're looking at 10% or so. That includes product growth at higher margins than where we're at as well as operating efficiencies to deliver support to those products so more of that sales can drop to the bottom. Judy, you have anything else to add to that?"

And the run rate as a percent of sales is expected to be similar. But if we think about how we stand in comparison to larger brands, companies and their percent of sales spend, our spend is similar. It's different because we are not going on a pan-European basis across all countries in Europe but doing spend more locally or regionally focused. Part of the initiative of thinking about ongoing enhancements to adjusted operating margin on a long-term basis is finding ways to go to market in as lean a way as possible but still even increase our A&P spend as a percent of sales to afford more push marketing through advertising -- sorry, pull marketing through advertising and have the right balance of push, i.e. selling expenses in the portfolio to optimize the overall revenue growth on a long-term basis. So trying to strive for enhancing the percent of sales and maintaining that comparability with the larger European, pan-European brands."

We have a lot to cover today. First, I want to provide a comprehensive progress update on the strategic and operational action plan that I outlined during our last earnings call. We've made a lot of progress, but there's still much work to be done. Then Judy will walk through the financial results for the quarter, and I'll end with a final comment before our Q&A session.
Turning to Slide 4. At the outset, I want to reinforce the team's strong belief in Perrigo's strategy to providing quality, affordable health care products to customers and consumers around the world. In fact, we believe it is vital to our current global health care environment. Macro trends for our business are strong, and Perrigo is in a unique position to capitalize on those trends. Regardless of the political or economic climate, global consumers, customers, insurers alike continue to search for effective health care products that provide value. And Perrigo remains a leader in providing both effective products and great value to both consumers in front and behind the pharmacy counter. In fact, every second of every day, nearly 2,200 people around the globe use a Perrigo product, and our products save consumers more than $7.5 billion every year. This is a great place to operate.
Turning to Slide 5. Foremost, I want to begin by saying that we had a solid quarter in line with expectations, which I'm pleased to share with you. Good top line growth in our Consumer Healthcare segment was led by U.S. Consumer Healthcare adjusted net sales increase of 4%, despite a slower allergy season. In addition, this team continues to drive strong adjusted operating margins at 20% in the quarter. And our Rx business performance was in line with our expectations. Importantly, the cash generation of the business model continues to be strong with $304 million generated in the quarter.
This quarter, we also made great progress against a number of our actions to focus and improve our business. And I know you're all interested in hearing about that. With assistance from a leading consulting firm, we continue to make substantial progress against these initiatives to maximize shareholder value. Let me give you some of the highlights here, and then I will drive -- dive deeper into them on the slides that follow.
First, corporate governance. I'm excited that we added 2 new board members with great, relevant experience and long track records of creating value. Their unique expertise and skill sets will also support our ongoing portfolio review that I will address next. Second, we conducted portfolio review to optimize our business offerings. As announced in April, we have been thoroughly assessing our portfolio through a comprehensive strategic, operational and financial review of all of our businesses. As I've said, we will not leave any stone unturned. With that in mind, this slide outlines the items we've completed or initiated to date. The board and management believe the next step to unlock shareholder value is today's announcement that we are exploring strategic alternatives for the Tysabri royalty stream. We continue to evaluate all businesses, including the market position and growth opportunities for our U.S. Rx business, which I will also discuss further.
Third, improved performance in BCH. We've taken a number of actions this quarter, leveraging core strengths in Consumer Healthcare to address a number of challenges with the goal of enhancing margins. I will discuss in more detail specific market dynamics and actions in the slide that follows.
Fourth, we will focus our efforts to optimize organizational effectiveness. A core strength of Perrigo is to build effective operating systems and organizational structures to deliver performance. A key component of our future success is to match cost structures with existing and future expected market dynamics, and we are conducting a review of our optimal cost structure going forward to achieve our business objectives.
And finally, we'll continue to work hard every day for our customers and consumers. I have continued to assert that we have fundamentally sound and attractive businesses and with unique competitive advantages. Despite their challenges, both our CHC and Rx segment continue to deliver strong operating margins.
Now let me dive a little bit further into each of these. Turning to Slide 6. This morning, we announced that our board appointed 2 new directors, Geoff Parker, who has already joined the board; and Ted Samuels, who will begin his service on January 4, 2017. Geoff brings a wealth of financial expertise, while Ted brings a significant investor perspective. As you can see on their slide, their experience is direct result -- excuse me, directly relevant to our current strategy and ongoing initiatives. Additionally, 2 of our current board members, Michael Jandernoa and Gary Kunkle, have elected to not stand for reelection. While they will continue to serve as directors until our next AGM, I would like to thank both Mike and Gary for their long-term service and commitment to Perrigo. We continue to work with a nationally recognized search firm to identify other potential independent directors who possess significant experience and successful track records of delivering shareholder value.
Turning to Slide 7. A key outcome of our ongoing portfolio review is today's announcement that we would explore alternatives for Tysabri royalty stream. As you know, Tysabri dramatically improves the quality of life for patients with MS. And financially, it provides stable and predictable cash flow. After careful consideration, the board and management believe that now is the right time to explore a review of strategic alternatives for Tysabri to potentially monetize the value of this attractive asset, which we believe will enable us to derisk, delever and continue to focus on Perrigo's core strengths. In our portfolio review, we are weighing the benefits of divesting or finding alternatives for asset alongside our commitment to maintain an investment-grade rating. Any proceeds from a potential Tysabri sale would be prioritized with this comment in mind, as retaining our investment-grade status is a cornerstone to our capital structure philosophy.
Turning to Slide 8. As we all know, the Rx space has been very dynamic over the last year, month, week, however you want to look at it. I have had many conversations with investors over the last few months about the future of our Rx business, and we continue to evaluate the business' market dynamics, portfolio strategies and long-range growth opportunities in order to generate the best value. Our strategic review of the segment requires an in-depth, comprehensive evaluation of the interdependencies within our business. Such areas of manufacturing, shared service functions and tax are more complicated and deserve thoughtful considerations. The Perrigo board has formed a special subcommittee with me on our Rx business to evaluate all of these aspects and determine the best path to optimize shareholder value with this segment. We expect to complete this review in the first quarter of 2017.
On to Slide 9. Now I'll discuss our Branded Consumer Healthcare business. As you may have seen this morning, first, we announced a noncash impairment charge in our BCH segment. Second, Perrigo's Board of Directors has authorized the company to initiate a claim and arbitration against the sellers of Omega Pharma Invest NV, which we plan to do before the end of this year. As you would expect, while you may have questions in this regard, it is our policy to not comment on legal matters, so we will not provide further detail at this time.
Despite the impairment, which Judy will discuss in detail, I continue to believe in the long-term power of this business, along with its core platforms and competencies. Across the European continent, there are a number of tailwinds that are encouraging for the long-term outlook in this business. OTC market growth remains healthy at approximately 2% to 3% per year, and consumer demographics and dynamics continue to trend favorably, driving increased use of OTC products. We have been actively engaged in Europe over the past 6 months to build out our leadership team, enhance processes and develop organizational effectiveness needed to improve the performance of the BCH segment. Our long-term objectives for this business are: first, we are committed to bringing the BCH business to CHC-level profitability. We are currently in the process of overlaying the CHC operational philosophies, experience and expertise to enhance BCH performance. Second, we are a top 5 European OTC business with scale and reach in the multiple channels and in multiple markets. Our goal is to remain a top player within the Europe infrastructure. Finally, we believe that this business can attain at or above-market growth in the long term. We continue to prioritize brand strategies in core markets, which should enable more predictable financial results. Many of the individual markets in which we operate are performing well, like the U.K., Spain, the Netherlands and the Nordics, and we remain optimistic about the potential of BCH business given all these factors. That said, there is still much work to be done to achieve these objectives.
Turning to Slide 10 and continuing with the BCH business. The European OTC market has different channels to the consumer, for instance, approximately 1/3 of our business in the wholesale pharmacy channel, and we are particularly focused on the inventory management systems in those countries employing this model. Order patterns of products we sell into the wholesale pharmacy channels are not always aligned with sellout patterns to pharmacies as the wholesalers act as a conduit, which could build inventory inefficiencies, something we are systematically addressing. With our strengths, opportunities and challenges in mind, we have a series of actions to focus on countries and products where we have the ability to win in the marketplace. The action plan comprises 4 key initiatives which are underway. One, the success of an organization starts with leadership. The countries where we perform well have effective, efficient, great leaders who are able to quickly adapt to changing market dynamics. We have added 4 new country leaders to expand our expertise and have fresh perspectives on our go-to-market strategies in countries that are not meeting expectations. I am confident that we have the right people in place for these countries. Two, we are prioritizing certain geographies and brand strategies across the portfolio, aligning investments with our ability to win by product and by market. This means identifying the geographies and opportunities that have the capability to provide high returns on investment and making plans to either divest or partner with others who can better manage commercial sales efforts, in particular, countries where there is no clear path. Currently, there are 4 challenging countries we are focused on. In Belgium and Italy, we are focused on inventory channel inefficiencies. In Germany, we are focused on working to achieve greater scale. And in France, we are making strategic investments in innovation to diversify our product concentration from seasonal lifestyle products. Three, we're taking steps to be more efficient and align costs with revenues. We are continuing to integrate the BCH infrastructure on to our Irish platform and overlay CHC operational philosophies, experience and expertise to enhance the margin profile on incentivizing the business team to focus on margin growth. Fourth, new products are the lifeline of a growing consumer company, and we are no different. For us to be successful in the long term, we need to increase investments in innovation to bring more novel products to market. As an example, we have a great success with our new multi-symptom formula, Bronchostop, which has achieved the #1 position in the U.K. This product is currently being launched in other attractive markets. While they will take time to fully materialize, I am confident that these 4 specific actions will improve profitability. I see a path to CHC-level operating margins for the business, and I'm committed to taking steps to improve this important business. 
Turning to Slide 11. We continue to maximize the global infrastructure we have in place, and I'm pleased to note that last year's announced consolidation of our global supply chain activities in Ireland is generating a run rate benefit of approximately $40 million in net income, a nice job as a team to hit this target. We will continue to focus our efforts to optimize organizational effectiveness. As discussed last quarter, we're making good progress towards our goal of realizing an additional $40 million in the Branded Consumer Healthcare supply chain savings, which we expect to achieve over the next 2 years. Let me reiterate. One of our core strength is building effective operating systems and organizational structures to deliver performance results. Our future success relies on managing cost structures with existing and future expected market dynamics. To this end, we are conducting even a more comprehensive review of our overall cost structure going forward to achieve our business objectives. We expect this study to conclude in the first quarter of 2017.
As you can see in Slide 12, the store brand OTC category continues to grow, despite significant national brand product launches that are experiencing a period of exclusivity as well as a return of a prominent national brand. I would like to briefly highlight 2 store brand categories on this slide. First, the smoking cessation category continues to grow share despite the return of a prominent national brand competitor. And second, the infant formula category continues to drive significant store brand share gains as a result of key investments in infrastructure and marketing programs. I'd especially on this call like to recognize the infant formula team as our store brand penetration for infant formula is now over 14%. You can see also on the slide that our strong market position in OTC health care continues to be driven by favorable market dynamics. The store brand proposition continues to resonate well as consumers look for ways to save money without compromising quality or effectiveness.
One favorable dynamic that I want to highlight is the continued importance of the Rx-to-OTC switches, which can be seen on Slide 13. Notably, we believe there are more than $19 billion of potential Rx-to-OTC switch opportunities that Perrigo is well positioned to capitalize on. Given the current backdrop of a health care industry, it is reasonable to expect that consumers, insurers and government programs will continue to seek more affordable health care options. Switching prescription products to over-the-counter is a simple way to take costs out of the system and one that we continue to see as a core element of our CHC business. While I will not touch on all of these categories, we've already seen some of these categories expand, and we believe others have room to grow. Over the past few years, we've seen brands in the nasal category move to over-the-counter: Nasacort, Flonase, Rhinocort. This is typically how we see categories expand. Once one product is in category switches, others will follow. Given this dynamic, I'd like to highlight the recent FDA approval of an acne product to move over-the-counter. We believe this could be a catalyst for other products in the acne category to move OTC, and this is a category where Perrigo already has a strong presence.
As we look over the next 3 years, we see promising opportunities within our new product pipeline. You can see that recent switches from some of the categories we just discussed will be playing a significant role in our new product sales going forward. With the pipeline representing more than $1 billion in brand sales over the next 3 years, we are well positioned to leverage industry tailwinds at our OTC business.
Looking at Slide 15. Updates we implemented in the Rx forecasting process last quarter proved beneficial this quarter as achieved its internal forecast. As you can see here, our Rx business is a leader in the extended topical space. The business has grown from its infancy just over 10 years ago to a leader in the space today. We continue to executing against our strategy for the segment, focusing on tougher-to-manufacture products with higher barriers to entry. Obviously, price erosion is still a large concern industry-wide. However, during the second half of the year, pricing remains in line with our expectations. The segment remains in a leading market position, and we continue to invest in our pipeline. Adjusted operating margins remain attractive. As I discussed earlier, we continue to assess the business's role with Perrigo going forward.
Turning to Slide 16. We continue to anticipate new product launches of approximately $300 million in 2016. This represents growth of approximately 5% over reported net sales in calendar 2015. As a reminder, this year, we have already launched the store brand versions of Flonase, Nasacort and 3 of the guaifenesin family of products.
With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Judy, who will walk you through third quarter results. Judy?"
319092,407275922,1083477,"Perrigo Company plc, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 10, 2016",2016-11-10,"Earnings Calls","Perrigo Company plc","Executives","Thanks, John. As you could see on Slide 18, reported net sales for the quarter were $1.4 billion, and reported net loss was $1.3 billion compared to net income of $113 million in the prior year. Non-GAAP adjustments to the reported numbers include add-bac",1656,"Thanks, John. As you could see on Slide 18, reported net sales for the quarter were $1.4 billion, and reported net loss was $1.3 billion compared to net income of $113 million in the prior year. Non-GAAP adjustments to the reported numbers include add-backs of items such as impairment charges, restructuring charges and acquisition- and integration-related items, including the amortization of acquired intangible assets. As outlined in our press release this morning, in the third quarter, we realized an impairment for indefinite and definite-lived intangible assets and goodwill related to our BCH business of $1.7 billion. I will provide more details on this charge in a few moments.
On Slide 19, you can see third quarter adjusted consolidated net sales were $1.3 billion, an increase of $29 million or 3% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. As a reminder, these numbers exclude from both periods sales from held-for-sale businesses, including the API business, our European sports brand and the U.S. VMS business, the sale of which was completed on August 5. Growth in the quarter was driven by higher adjusted net sales in the U.S. OTC business and the infant nutrition category within our CHC segment as well as higher sales in the Rx segment related to product acquisitions and new product sales. For the quarter, consolidated new product sales of $79 million were offset in part by $10 million of discontinued products.
Looking at the segment results on Slide 20. CHC adjusted net sales in the quarter increased approximately $14 million year-over-year or 3% on a constant currency basis. Our U.S. consumer business grew nearly 4% in the quarter, largely attributable to continued strong performance in the infant nutrition and smoking cessation categories and new product sales of $33 million, driven primarily by the store brand launches of fluticasone and 3 products in the guaifenesin family. These increases were offset partially by price erosion, lower sales in our antacid category and discontinued products of $6 million. Our sales were also impacted by the absence of our higher-margin Mucinex 600-milligram extended-release equivalent store brand product and unfavorable foreign currency movement of $7 million. This year, adjusted gross profit margin was 35%. I'd like to remind you that last year was a record quarter for the segment, driven by strong product mix. On a comparative basis, this quarter's adjusted gross margins were lower due primarily to the absence of the product I just mentioned, pricing pressures and the fact that many of the new product launches this year are partnered products, which means that gross profit dollars are shared with our supplier.
Let me talk to you a little bit about pricing in the segment. As we discussed in the past, in today's macroeconomic environment, our customers continue to look for value and ask that we pass our material cost efficiencies on to them. This isn't new. Our team has quietly and effectively fought this fight for years, working every day to meet our customers' needs for continually lower prices. In the quarter, this net effect has only slightly impacted adjusted gross profit margins as we've been able to largely offset this with scale and efficiencies. The team sustained adjusted operating margins of 20% as we continue to proactively manage operating expenses, which were lower in the quarter. We continue to invest in our business, increasing spending in R&D investments by 8% compared to last year on an adjusted basis.
Turning to Slide 21. The Branded Consumer Healthcare segment's adjusted net sales were $304 million compared to $302 million last year and grew 2% on a constant currency basis. These results included $18 million from acquisitions, while new product sales contributed $26 million. These increases were offset primarily by lower sales in the lifestyle and natural health vitamin product categories as well as lower sales in the markets John discussed earlier.
Adjusted gross profit margins were 47.5%, consistent with the second quarter of 2016. However, compared to the prior year, the segment experienced lower adjusted gross profit margins in the quarter. Approximately half of the margin change compared to the prior year was due to the business dynamics in Belgium, where the new management team there will work on improving the operating model in this market for a longer-term consistency in operating results, as John outlined earlier. We also experienced unfavorable mix in the quarter due to the lower sales in lifestyle and natural health vitamins categories, which have higher-than-average margins. In addition, we experienced unfavorable currency effects on euro-denominated purchases for the U.K. sterling market.
The BCH segment realized adjusted operating margin of 10% in the quarter. Lower adjusted gross profit was partially offset by cost-containment measures and lower advertising and promotion spending as management moderated A&P priorities in the quarter to align with market dynamics.
In the third quarter, we realized an impairment for indefinite and definite-lived intangible assets and goodwill related to our BCH business of $1.7 billion. The factors that contributed to this impairment were: one, changes in the market and performance of the brands due to moderated new product launch assumptions; two, execution of certain key product strategies falling short of operating management's plans causing a reduction to baseline forecast models in France, Germany and Italy; three, certain macroeconomic factors, which have continued to impact the business more than expected, in addition to unfavorable foreign currency impacts experienced primarily in the U.K. related to Brexit; and four, a change in the Belgian forecast due to a fundamental reduction in volume with a major wholesaler that is not expected to be short term in nature. The calculation of this impairment is a complicated process. While our GAAP net income and EPS include the preliminary calculation for the related tax effect of the impairment, we are completing our final control procedures, which will be finalized by the end of our -- by the filing of our 10-Q, which is anticipated to be by the end of the day today. Any changes to this would not impact our adjusted earnings per share discussed throughout this announcement today.
Turning now to Rx on Slide 22. Net sales were $267 million, 4% higher than last year on a constant currency basis, driven largely by $32 million related to acquisitions and new product sales of $18 million. The Rx adjusted gross margin was 59% in the quarter due to product acquisitions and new products. Pricing pressures in the segment were in line with our expectations announced last quarter. In addition to acquisitions, we also experienced meaningful productivity improvements compared to last year, which were a factor in offsetting the effect of lower pricing. Adjusted operating margin for the segment was 42.5%, an increase of 40 basis points over the same period last year. R&D investments in the quarter increased $6 million as the team continues to invest in pipeline products.
Our Specialty Sciences segment realized net sales in the quarter of $93 million compared to $85 million last year. Tysabri sales benefited in the quarter from a onetime favorable adjustment to discounts and allowances. Based on the current royalty percentage that Perrigo received, the effect of this benefit was approximately $3.6 million. In addition, the segment benefited from a $6 million reduction in operating expenses due to lower legal costs in the current year.
Turning to Slide 24 and an update on our balance sheet. As of October 1, 2016, total cash on the balance sheet was $363 million, and total debt was approximately $5.9 billion. Our total debt declined by over $500 million from the previous quarter end as we proactively repaid our $500 million of senior notes, which would have matured on November 8, 2016, consistent with our stated deleveraging strategy and our commitment to our investment-grade ratings. We generated $304 million of cash from operating activities during the quarter, which brings us to approximately $704 million of cash from operating activities for the first 9 months of the year. This represents a cash flow conversion of operating cash flow to adjusted net income of 129% in the quarter. Excluding the contribution of the Tysabri royalty from both the numerator and denominator of this equation, the conversion would increase to 148%. We will continue to use our strong cash flow conversion to prioritize our capital allocation toward deleveraging. We do not intend to reenter the share repurchase market in the near term, and as John stated earlier, our commitment to our investment-grade rating extends to the alternatives process we are undertaking for Tysabri.
Turning to Slide 26. We are confirming the full year 2016 adjusted earnings per share guidance midpoint we announced in August. I would like to take a moment to briefly review the details by segment. For the CHC segment, we continue to expect 2016 adjusted net sales of approximately $2.6 billion and second half adjusted operating margins in line with those in the first half. I would like to remind you that these expectations continue to exclude 2016 contributions from the U.S. VMS business, which was sold on August 5. We still expect approximately $1.3 billion in adjusted net sales for the BCH segment, and we now anticipate adjusted operating margins for the second half of the year to be approximately 10%, which is due primarily to lower adjusted gross profit contributions due to the effects discussed earlier. We continue to align A&P spend with sales patterns and therefore expect fourth quarter seasonal A&P spend to be higher relative to the third quarter to support the cough/cold season. The Rx segment net sales guidance also remains unchanged at approximately $1 billion, and we continue to expect adjusted operating margin in the low 40% range for the full year. Consistent with our comments last quarter, our forecast continues to assume second half year-over-year price erosion on like-for-like products of 9% to 10%. We expect consolidated full year 2016 cash flows to be approximately $900 million.

In closing, on Slide 28, I outlined specific areas of strategic and operational focus shortly after becoming CEO in the spring. I'm pleased to have been able to share with you today the many actions we've completed and initiated, making substantial progress on multiple fronts in line with these focus areas. While we have challenges to overcome, I believe the team can deliver the Perrigo advantage. CHC adjusted net sales growth was solid in the quarter, and the segment achieved strong margins. We're executing against our plans in BCH to drive greater profitability and enhance the business. Our continued focus on Rx execution paid off in the quarter as the team was in line with expectations and margins remained attractive. It's been a busy 6 months, and I, with the help of the board and our management team, have been working hard to enhance performance and drive shareholder value. And there's much work left to be done. We're performing our business review expeditiously but thoughtfully, drawing on the right expertise with an objective lens. I am confident we're on the right course to improve our performance and address our challenges. Now more than ever, the importance of affordable health care products is clear, and Perrigo is uniquely positioned to provide these products to our customers and patients across the globe.
Thank you. Brad?"

Because I am quite certain that many of you are curious as to the fact that we had a large impairment recorded in May and are again going through this same exercise only 6 months later. The entire process of calculating impairment starts with run rate indicators on the underlying assets of the business. So as you, I'm sure, Sumant, being the careful reader of these Qs and Ks that you are, I'm sure that you noted that we have outlined that the basis of the original assets -- the original purchase price accounting are definite and indefinite-lived assets by product category, which means, and I remember commenting on this in our May earnings call, that if expectations on those specific categories change over time, it changes the perspective on the long-term indefinite cash flows discounted back to today. What does that mean? At the time we did our evaluation in May, we had certain assertions, country by country, on the future cash flows from our XLS medical technology, a weight loss product, other products in our lifestyle category as well as certain other products in cough/cold and our animal health categories in Europe. In the last 6 months, some of the assertions on those product categories have changed further, both combination of these 4 things I outlined in the call, macroeconomic factors and the management team's assertion of how to utilize those assets best on a go-forward basis. So yes, inherent to your question, has the expectation of run rate of revenues from those categories changed? Yes. And that is the underlying starting point of an indicator of impairment and the reason that the entire process had to be started over again to rerun cash flows for those product categories, those definite and indefinite-lived assets. And due to the magnitude of the change projected in those particular products and categories, it did also trigger the indicator to run a goodwill impairment analysis, i.e. what are the total cash flows of the total business ex -- even including those assets that are not specifically targeted as the product categories I've commented on already. So stepping back, the underlying expectation on run rate for our business in Europe continues to be -- to grow at a rate above market. But the combination of products to get there, the assertion of brand strategies to make that successful and the contributors of -- to those cash flows on a long-term basis have changed, thereby creating the underlying impairment that you see in the books today. John, I don't know if you want to comment further on future run rate."

That being said, the plan would be -- to John's point, in order to focus the portfolio and focus on core businesses that we would use that cash, first and foremost, to delever, looking at being able to get down to something more like 3.25 turns and deploying the cash that would come from that sale from any sale, first and foremost, to delever the balance sheet. Effective tax rate-wise, you got into a little granularity in trying to prognosticate on any kind of Irish tax structures. Suffice it to say, at the time we would have a sale, the effective tax rate would also go up for the company. Why? Jurisdictional mix. This particular asset's royalty streams today are taxed in the single digits. And so without that mix of earnings before tax in there, obviously, the remaining -- remain co-tax rate will be higher.

So that dynamic continues, and the team does a good job. And part of the costs work that John commented on officially in his comments was directed towards the CHC team working with -- within our manufacturing group, our supply chain group to help find value within our overall supply chain so that they are in a better position to continue to pass on that savings to their customers while at the same time maintaining adjusted gross margins on a go-forward basis.

We'll be able to build [ph] them together in a more efficient structure and want to continue to have product acquisitions, smaller things that we bolt on to that, that can deliver value to the bottom very quickly.

So kind of as I said in my comments, I think as a consumer-facing company bringing value, M&A, larger footprint and presence in Europe, in concept, is a good place to be. Markets are growing. They're good consumer markets. I think they're going to continue to evolve, to need cost-effective solutions, whether it's brands or store brands that we offer in countries, those kind of things. So at a macroeconomic level, I like being in Europe. I think the -- it's a good place to be. Now I step back and say, does that mean that every part of our branded business and consumer parts in Europe are operating well and we belong in long term? And I'd say, we're going through that analysis. We announced the last time we were doing some restructuring and looking at potential exits from products in Russia. The -- Argentina, which isn't in Europe, I realize that. South Africa, other areas. So we continue to look at the branded consumer portfolio and say, do we have a right to win in this country? Do we have the right products? Do we have the right go-to-market strategy? And I think there will continue to be pruning of that overall portfolio to make it much more effective. On the organizational and G&A effectiveness and operating cost of goods effectiveness, we can continue to drive more efficiency and effectiveness there to make sure that the sales we have drop right to the bottom line. So a lot of work in what I'd call creating the Perrigo Bureau of not from how we sell, not the go-to-market, but the actual back office, how we're able to deliver sales to the bottom is what we've got to continue to work on there. But -- so fundamentally, yes, I like being there. It's not been easy. It won't -- we still have a lot of work to do, but I think the market ties in with our consumer-facing side. The -- when I think about the OTC and Rx, and again, I said this before, there are some ties to the business between operating side things, plants, some of the procurement side, those kind of things that are good links from that standpoint. Certainly, going to market, the selling process, the people you call on at the buying groups, et cetera, are different. So on the backside, they are there. They are good synergies we're able to pull out, but they probably aren't game changers as far as ultimate decisions to make. We'd look at all of those and say those are part of the equation, and they wouldn't limit us from deciding to do something else with the business if that's where the data are that we chose to go.

So first of all, revenue synergies between, I'll say, the -- Europe and U.S. or U.S. and Europe, those kind of revenue synergies, have been slower to materialize than was originally contemplated. The -- just because of the regulatory processes, the unique ingredients in some of the products here that we've got to kind of do changes to, to get them in Europe and vice versa. So that part of it has been slower than expected. The actual operating synergies of costs and those kinds of things continue to progress as well, but it's taken us longer to get at those reverse synergies. We have, in certain markets, worked -- I'll pick the U.K. an example, where we had a big presence of store brand from legacy Perrigo and doing a lot to combine our branded business with our store brand, with our pharmacy business because of what it is. And we have those all under Neil Lister, a great leader for Perrigo, who runs that whole business now. And he's driving synergies across all combinations of that business structure. So Marc, we haven't given up on the synergies to move products back and forth, to move that. We're actually doing more processes moving back and forth than products at this point. But we think there still are synergies there and ways to drive some of that. Let me go to Belgium and some of the issues there. First of all, we still do business with Stada. We still move it through. We've continued -- we do a number of different distribution methods in Belgium. There's a number of different avenues to go to market. One of the biggest ones is through pharmacy distributors, pharmacy wholesalers, as you might call them here in the U.S. And the -- and they would go out to independent pharmacies throughout the Belgium country. There's been what I'd call inventory inefficiencies in that model of selling in, where is it selling out, making sure we've got good tracking now with the sellout so we know what's going there, but making sure that we understand where all the pockets of inventory are and how to manage and normalize that has created longer than we had originally expected. We expected it to normalize relatively quick. So we continue to work with the distributors, the wholesalers, the chains, everything in Belgium, to make that smooth or flow smoother. And it definitely takes us longer than we expected. But Stada relationship is good. We continue to distribute their products as well as our own OTC products to that same channel. On the -- your last question was on key brands, and how much of the portfolio they made was the question or what the -- can you ask that one more time, Marc? I'm sorry."

So rather than get into granularity right now on this call, talking about specific growth rates of the top brands, we are making changes to certain categories and the expectations of the brand and product growth. Some of the new leadership in Europe is looking specifically at the combination of their local jewel brand investments versus the potential for developing pan-European or more regional brand strategies. Those will be part of our conversations as we go into 2017, but the main area of focus for that operating team on the ground in the last 6 weeks has been trying to get very deep-dive information on what they plan to do by their product categories in order to put forward meaningful cash flow estimates for those products so that we could do a more refined impairment calculation that we talked about earlier on the call."

But keeping that pipeline, getting those products approved and launched becomes the way that you work to offset that pricing dynamic.

It's much more of just reviewing expectations for very specific product lines as they are today, and that obviously needs to change. And so when we think about long-term growth, it's probably going to be coming from -- via product acquisitions, which Omega was very successful with over the years, as well as sort of internal R&D efforts. And then my second question is in terms of the leadership at BCH, just curious if -- given the fact that it is a very different business from your store brand, sort of core, the thought of bringing in or -- sort of some external people with more traditional OTC -- branded OTC experience just to introduce some new perspectives versus what has always been sort of the Perrigo way of doing things."

I'll give philosophically -- and I'll maybe get through the others and give it back to Judy on that one. As we've talked about and kind of laid out the parts of the impairment, that doesn't really say that you can't grow the business going forward or the business won't grow. It doesn't say that anything you buy will layer into there and grow it. So you're exactly right that it's sort of a, here's what we have, is it performing as we expected? Are different products performing? And Judy will go into those in a minute here. But it certainly doesn't say there isn't growth for the business and there aren't ways to enhance that growth. Certainly, one of those is innovation within the product lines. So you know this, once you have brands, the brand will become stagnant. You've got to follow it up with the Max Strength and the Extra Max and the -- here's the liquid that goes with the tablet, all of those kind of innovations that flow there. That comes both internally but even more so making sure we fund product acquisitions that can add to that innovation. So that's kind of got to be part and is part of the growth path going forward. And again, I'll let Judy come back to that impairment question in a minute here. On the innovation side, I think you're exactly right. We hired a new Chief Strategy and Innovation Officer to help drive that, to help us to look for how we continue to drive that innovation. He comes from the consumer industry, brings great experience with him and will be great there. I think the other leadership we brought in from the outside has good branded, good consumer, good consumer-facing experience and brings credibility to all those countries where we're selling. So they clearly are not exports from the Perrigo infrastructure to them from that standpoint. On the supply chain side, we are bringing a fair amount of our sales and operations planning, inventory management, cost of goods sold, how to consolidate sites, that sort of infrastructure, bringing that to them because that's sort of a universal thing versus a business-specific skill, et cetera. And I will say, we're not done adding either. So we've added some good ones. We continue to look at where we need European branded leadership, European leadership, et cetera, to bring into the company to make sure that we are successful in all the objectives we laid out. Judy, please, on the other impairment thoughts."

The fact that we had a goodwill impairment in addition means by definition that the long-term cash flows coming from the entire business that we acquired have stepped down. That's -- it's a bounding box, algebraic equation that one must reexamine each year to say, are the expected cash flow streams from all of the assets that were acquired the same or have they moved since acquisition or since the last goodwill evaluation? So the answer is, yes, it has stepped down. And then to John's point, there's still growth in the model. To the earlier comment, there's still growth expectations ahead of the market, but importantly, we can't -- you can't step away from the earlier statement of have the expectations changed.

Do we need to invest, disinvest? What do we need to do? So there's a lot of discussions. I think when you step back to your second question, on the Rx business, good portfolio. On the Consumer Healthcare business, good portfolio of new products. Depends on when products switch. Those are -- some of the products in the pipeline are dependent on switches. Some are line extensions to what's out there, but we have good engines, good R&D, internal functions that support both of those businesses, well-developed teams that drive that as well as we continue to look for business development opportunities to supplement that as far as bolt-on acquisitions.

That doesn't happen anymore. We do ship some product in, but they are storing small amounts, and they expect that our supply chain can keep it flowing.

So first of all, on the generic space, certainly, the consolidated number of buyers, kind of the atmosphere right now on drug pricing, all those kind of things that have hit, certainly have a dynamic on the pricing and what's been going on. I think there are times when scale certainly is beneficial. You're going in with a basket. I would say, on the Rx side, especially in our categories, most of the buyers won't just buy a whole category from you, whatever, they are product specific. So scale, while good, because it -- you got a broader array of products to bounce any one price decrease, price concession off, they're still bidding, asking you for price, asking you if you want to bid on a product item by item. And so, really, that part of it doesn't give you huge benefits from the scale. There is a spreading of risk that helps. I think when you look at BCH longer term, our goal is to continue to drive net operating margin up to what I call our Consumer Healthcare margins, so up to the higher teens, in my mind. Now we've got a lot of work to get there because, as Judy said, we're looking at 10% or so. That includes product growth at higher margins than where we're at as well as operating efficiencies to deliver support to those products so more of that sales can drop to the bottom.

It's different because we are not going on a pan-European basis across all countries in Europe but doing spend more locally or regionally focused. Part of the initiative of thinking about ongoing enhancements to adjusted operating margin on a long-term basis is finding ways to go to market in as lean a way as possible but still even increase our A&P spend as a percent of sales to afford more push marketing through advertising -- sorry, pull marketing through advertising and have the right balance of push, i.e. selling expenses in the portfolio to optimize the overall revenue growth on a long-term basis.

We have a lot to cover today. First, I want to provide a comprehensive progress update on the strategic and operational action plan that I outlined during our last earnings call. We've made a lot of progress, but there's still much work to be done. Then Judy will walk through the financial results for the quarter, and I'll end with a final comment before our Q&A session.
Turning to Slide 4. At the outset, I want to reinforce the team's strong belief in Perrigo's strategy to providing quality, affordable health care products to customers and consumers around the world. In fact, we believe it is vital to our current global health care environment. Macro trends for our business are strong, and Perrigo is in a unique position to capitalize on those trends. Regardless of the political or economic climate, global consumers, customers, insurers alike continue to search for effective health care products that provide value. And Perrigo remains a leader in providing both effective products and great value to both consumers in front and behind the pharmacy counter. In fact, every second of every day, nearly 2,200 people around the globe use a Perrigo product, and our products save consumers more than $7.5 billion every year. This is a great place to operate.
Turning to Slide 5. Foremost, I want to begin by saying that we had a solid quarter in line with expectations, which I'm pleased to share with you. Good top line growth in our Consumer Healthcare segment was led by U.S. Consumer Healthcare adjusted net sales increase of 4%, despite a slower allergy season. In addition, this team continues to drive strong adjusted operating margins at 20% in the quarter. And our Rx business performance was in line with our expectations. Importantly, the cash generation of the business model continues to be strong with $304 million generated in the quarter.
This quarter, we also made great progress against a number of our actions to focus and improve our business. And I know you're all interested in hearing about that. With assistance from a leading consulting firm, we continue to make substantial progress against these initiatives to maximize shareholder value. Let me give you some of the highlights here, and then I will drive -- dive deeper into them on the slides that follow.
First, corporate governance. I'm excited that we added 2 new board members with great, relevant experience and long track records of creating value. Their unique expertise and skill sets will also support our ongoing portfolio review that I will address next. Second, we conducted portfolio review to optimize our business offerings. As announced in April, we have been thoroughly assessing our portfolio through a comprehensive strategic, operational and financial review of all of our businesses. As I've said, we will not leave any stone unturned. With that in mind, this slide outlines the items we've completed or initiated to date. The board and management believe the next step to unlock shareholder value is today's announcement that we are exploring strategic alternatives for the Tysabri royalty stream. We continue to evaluate all businesses, including the market position and growth opportunities for our U.S. Rx business, which I will also discuss further.
Third, improved performance in BCH. We've taken a number of actions this quarter, leveraging core strengths in Consumer Healthcare to address a number of challenges with the goal of enhancing margins. I will discuss in more detail specific market dynamics and actions in the slide that follows.
Fourth, we will focus our efforts to optimize organizational effectiveness. A core strength of Perrigo is to build effective operating systems and organizational structures to deliver performance. A key component of our future success is to match cost structures with existing and future expected market dynamics, and we are conducting a review of our optimal cost structure going forward to achieve our business objectives.
And finally, we'll continue to work hard every day for our customers and consumers. I have continued to assert that we have fundamentally sound and attractive businesses and with unique competitive advantages. Despite their challenges, both our CHC and Rx segment continue to deliver strong operating margins.
Now let me dive a little bit further into each of these. Turning to Slide 6. This morning, we announced that our board appointed 2 new directors, Geoff Parker, who has already joined the board; and Ted Samuels, who will begin his service on January 4, 2017. Geoff brings a wealth of financial expertise, while Ted brings a significant investor perspective. As you can see on their slide, their experience is direct result -- excuse me, directly relevant to our current strategy and ongoing initiatives. Additionally, 2 of our current board members, Michael Jandernoa and Gary Kunkle, have elected to not stand for reelection. While they will continue to serve as directors until our next AGM, I would like to thank both Mike and Gary for their long-term service and commitment to Perrigo. We continue to work with a nationally recognized search firm to identify other potential independent directors who possess significant experience and successful track records of delivering shareholder value.
Turning to Slide 7. A key outcome of our ongoing portfolio review is today's announcement that we would explore alternatives for Tysabri royalty stream. As you know, Tysabri dramatically improves the quality of life for patients with MS. And financially, it provides stable and predictable cash flow. After careful consideration, the board and management believe that now is the right time to explore a review of strategic alternatives for Tysabri to potentially monetize the value of this attractive asset, which we believe will enable us to derisk, delever and continue to focus on Perrigo's core strengths. In our portfolio review, we are weighing the benefits of divesting or finding alternatives for asset alongside our commitment to maintain an investment-grade rating. Any proceeds from a potential Tysabri sale would be prioritized with this comment in mind, as retaining our investment-grade status is a cornerstone to our capital structure philosophy.
Turning to Slide 8. As we all know, the Rx space has been very dynamic over the last year, month, week, however you want to look at it. I have had many conversations with investors over the last few months about the future of our Rx business, and we continue to evaluate the business' market dynamics, portfolio strategies and long-range growth opportunities in order to generate the best value. Our strategic review of the segment requires an in-depth, comprehensive evaluation of the interdependencies within our business. Such areas of manufacturing, shared service functions and tax are more complicated and deserve thoughtful considerations. The Perrigo board has formed a special subcommittee with me on our Rx business to evaluate all of these aspects and determine the best path to optimize shareholder value with this segment. We expect to complete this review in the first quarter of 2017.
On to Slide 9. Now I'll discuss our Branded Consumer Healthcare business. As you may have seen this morning, first, we announced a noncash impairment charge in our BCH segment. Second, Perrigo's Board of Directors has authorized the company to initiate a claim and arbitration against the sellers of Omega Pharma Invest NV, which we plan to do before the end of this year. As you would expect, while you may have questions in this regard, it is our policy to not comment on legal matters, so we will not provide further detail at this time.
Despite the impairment, which Judy will discuss in detail, I continue to believe in the long-term power of this business, along with its core platforms and competencies. Across the European continent, there are a number of tailwinds that are encouraging for the long-term outlook in this business. OTC market growth remains healthy at approximately 2% to 3% per year, and consumer demographics and dynamics continue to trend favorably, driving increased use of OTC products. We have been actively engaged in Europe over the past 6 months to build out our leadership team, enhance processes and develop organizational effectiveness needed to improve the performance of the BCH segment. Our long-term objectives for this business are: first, we are committed to bringing the BCH business to CHC-level profitability. We are currently in the process of overlaying the CHC operational philosophies, experience and expertise to enhance BCH performance. Second, we are a top 5 European OTC business with scale and reach in the multiple channels and in multiple markets. Our goal is to remain a top player within the Europe infrastructure. Finally, we believe that this business can attain at or above-market growth in the long term. We continue to prioritize brand strategies in core markets, which should enable more predictable financial results. Many of the individual markets in which we operate are performing well, like the U.K., Spain, the Netherlands and the Nordics, and we remain optimistic about the potential of BCH business given all these factors. That said, there is still much work to be done to achieve these objectives.
Turning to Slide 10 and continuing with the BCH business. The European OTC market has different channels to the consumer, for instance, approximately 1/3 of our business in the wholesale pharmacy channel, and we are particularly focused on the inventory management systems in those countries employing this model. Order patterns of products we sell into the wholesale pharmacy channels are not always aligned with sellout patterns to pharmacies as the wholesalers act as a conduit, which could build inventory inefficiencies, something we are systematically addressing. With our strengths, opportunities and challenges in mind, we have a series of actions to focus on countries and products where we have the ability to win in the marketplace. The action plan comprises 4 key initiatives which are underway. One, the success of an organization starts with leadership. The countries where we perform well have effective, efficient, great leaders who are able to quickly adapt to changing market dynamics. We have added 4 new country leaders to expand our expertise and have fresh perspectives on our go-to-market strategies in countries that are not meeting expectations. I am confident that we have the right people in place for these countries. Two, we are prioritizing certain geographies and brand strategies across the portfolio, aligning investments with our ability to win by product and by market. This means identifying the geographies and opportunities that have the capability to provide high returns on investment and making plans to either divest or partner with others who can better manage commercial sales efforts, in particular, countries where there is no clear path. Currently, there are 4 challenging countries we are focused on. In Belgium and Italy, we are focused on inventory channel inefficiencies. In Germany, we are focused on working to achieve greater scale. And in France, we are making strategic investments in innovation to diversify our product concentration from seasonal lifestyle products. Three, we're taking steps to be more efficient and align costs with revenues. We are continuing to integrate the BCH infrastructure on to our Irish platform and overlay CHC operational philosophies, experience and expertise to enhance the margin profile on incentivizing the business team to focus on margin growth. Fourth, new products are the lifeline of a growing consumer company, and we are no different. For us to be successful in the long term, we need to increase investments in innovation to bring more novel products to market. As an example, we have a great success with our new multi-symptom formula, Bronchostop, which has achieved the #1 position in the U.K. This product is currently being launched in other attractive markets. While they will take time to fully materialize, I am confident that these 4 specific actions will improve profitability. I see a path to CHC-level operating margins for the business, and I'm committed to taking steps to improve this important business. 
Turning to Slide 11. We continue to maximize the global infrastructure we have in place, and I'm pleased to note that last year's announced consolidation of our global supply chain activities in Ireland is generating a run rate benefit of approximately $40 million in net income, a nice job as a team to hit this target. We will continue to focus our efforts to optimize organizational effectiveness. As discussed last quarter, we're making good progress towards our goal of realizing an additional $40 million in the Branded Consumer Healthcare supply chain savings, which we expect to achieve over the next 2 years. Let me reiterate. One of our core strength is building effective operating systems and organizational structures to deliver performance results. Our future success relies on managing cost structures with existing and future expected market dynamics. To this end, we are conducting even a more comprehensive review of our overall cost structure going forward to achieve our business objectives. We expect this study to conclude in the first quarter of 2017.
As you can see in Slide 12, the store brand OTC category continues to grow, despite significant national brand product launches that are experiencing a period of exclusivity as well as a return of a prominent national brand. I would like to briefly highlight 2 store brand categories on this slide. First, the smoking cessation category continues to grow share despite the return of a prominent national brand competitor. And second, the infant formula category continues to drive significant store brand share gains as a result of key investments in infrastructure and marketing programs. I'd especially on this call like to recognize the infant formula team as our store brand penetration for infant formula is now over 14%. You can see also on the slide that our strong market position in OTC health care continues to be driven by favorable market dynamics. The store brand proposition continues to resonate well as consumers look for ways to save money without compromising quality or effectiveness.
One favorable dynamic that I want to highlight is the continued importance of the Rx-to-OTC switches, which can be seen on Slide 13. Notably, we believe there are more than $19 billion of potential Rx-to-OTC switch opportunities that Perrigo is well positioned to capitalize on. Given the current backdrop of a health care industry, it is reasonable to expect that consumers, insurers and government programs will continue to seek more affordable health care options. Switching prescription products to over-the-counter is a simple way to take costs out of the system and one that we continue to see as a core element of our CHC business. While I will not touch on all of these categories, we've already seen some of these categories expand, and we believe others have room to grow. Over the past few years, we've seen brands in the nasal category move to over-the-counter: Nasacort, Flonase, Rhinocort. This is typically how we see categories expand. Once one product is in category switches, others will follow. Given this dynamic, I'd like to highlight the recent FDA approval of an acne product to move over-the-counter. We believe this could be a catalyst for other products in the acne category to move OTC, and this is a category where Perrigo already has a strong presence.
As we look over the next 3 years, we see promising opportunities within our new product pipeline. You can see that recent switches from some of the categories we just discussed will be playing a significant role in our new product sales going forward. With the pipeline representing more than $1 billion in brand sales over the next 3 years, we are well positioned to leverage industry tailwinds at our OTC business.
Looking at Slide 15. Updates we implemented in the Rx forecasting process last quarter proved beneficial this quarter as achieved its internal forecast. As you can see here, our Rx business is a leader in the extended topical space. The business has grown from its infancy just over 10 years ago to a leader in the space today. We continue to executing against our strategy for the segment, focusing on tougher-to-manufacture products with higher barriers to entry. Obviously, price erosion is still a large concern industry-wide. However, during the second half of the year, pricing remains in line with our expectations. The segment remains in a leading market position, and we continue to invest in our pipeline. Adjusted operating margins remain attractive. As I discussed earlier, we continue to assess the business's role with Perrigo going forward.
Turning to Slide 16. We continue to anticipate new product launches of approximately $300 million in 2016. This represents growth of approximately 5% over reported net sales in calendar 2015. As a reminder, this year, we have already launched the store brand versions of Flonase, Nasacort and 3 of the guaifenesin family of products.
With that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Judy, who will walk you through third quarter results. Judy?"
319092,407275922,1083907,"Perrigo Company plc, Q3 2016 Earnings Call, Nov 10, 2016",2016-11-10,"Earnings Calls","Perrigo Company plc","Executives","Thanks, John. As you could see on Slide 18, reported net sales for the quarter were $1.4 billion, and reported net loss was $1.3 billion compared to net income of $113 million in the prior year. Non-GAAP adjustments to the reported numbers include add-bac",1656,"Thanks, John. As you could see on Slide 18, reported net sales for the quarter were $1.4 billion, and reported net loss was $1.3 billion compared to net income of $113 million in the prior year. Non-GAAP adjustments to the reported numbers include add-backs of items such as impairment charges, restructuring charges and acquisition- and integration-related items, including the amortization of acquired intangible assets. As outlined in our press release this morning, in the third quarter, we realized an impairment for indefinite and definite-lived intangible assets and goodwill related to our BCH business of $1.7 billion. I will provide more details on this charge in a few moments.
On Slide 19, you can see third quarter adjusted consolidated net sales were $1.3 billion, an increase of $29 million or 3% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. As a reminder, these numbers exclude from both periods sales from held-for-sale businesses, including the API business, our European sports brand and the U.S. VMS business, the sale of which was completed on August 5. Growth in the quarter was driven by higher adjusted net sales in the U.S. OTC business and the infant nutrition category within our CHC segment as well as higher sales in the Rx segment related to product acquisitions and new product sales. For the quarter, consolidated new product sales of $79 million were offset in part by $10 million of discontinued products.
Looking at the segment results on Slide 20. CHC adjusted net sales in the quarter increased approximately $14 million year-over-year or 3% on a constant currency basis. Our U.S. consumer business grew nearly 4% in the quarter, largely attributable to continued strong performance in the infant nutrition and smoking cessation categories and new product sales of $33 million, driven primarily by the store brand launches of fluticasone and 3 products in the guaifenesin family. These increases were offset partially by price erosion, lower sales in our antacid category and discontinued products of $6 million. Our sales were also impacted by the absence of our higher-margin Mucinex 600-milligram extended-release equivalent store brand product and unfavorable foreign currency movement of $7 million. This year, adjusted gross profit margin was 35%. I'd like to remind you that last year was a record quarter for the segment, driven by strong product mix. On a comparative basis, this quarter's adjusted gross margins were lower due primarily to the absence of the product I just mentioned, pricing pressures and the fact that many of the new product launches this year are partnered products, which means that gross profit dollars are shared with our supplier.
Let me talk to you a little bit about pricing in the segment. As we discussed in the past, in today's macroeconomic environment, our customers continue to look for value and ask that we pass our material cost efficiencies on to them. This isn't new. Our team has quietly and effectively fought this fight for years, working every day to meet our customers' needs for continually lower prices. In the quarter, this net effect has only slightly impacted adjusted gross profit margins as we've been able to largely offset this with scale and efficiencies. The team sustained adjusted operating margins of 20% as we continue to proactively manage operating expenses, which were lower in the quarter. We continue to invest in our business, increasing spending in R&D investments by 8% compared to last year on an adjusted basis.
Turning to Slide 21. The Branded Consumer Healthcare segment's adjusted net sales were $304 million compared to $302 million last year and grew 2% on a constant currency basis. These results included $18 million from acquisitions, while new product sales contributed $26 million. These increases were offset primarily by lower sales in the lifestyle and natural health vitamin product categories as well as lower sales in the markets John discussed earlier.
Adjusted gross profit margins were 47.5%, consistent with the second quarter of 2016. However, compared to the prior year, the segment experienced lower adjusted gross profit margins in the quarter. Approximately half of the margin change compared to the prior year was due to the business dynamics in Belgium, where the new management team there will work on improving the operating model in this market for a longer-term consistency in operating results, as John outlined earlier. We also experienced unfavorable mix in the quarter due to the lower sales in lifestyle and natural health vitamins categories, which have higher-than-average margins. In addition, we experienced unfavorable currency effects on euro-denominated purchases for the U.K. sterling market.
The BCH segment realized adjusted operating margin of 10% in the quarter. Lower adjusted gross profit was partially offset by cost-containment measures and lower advertising and promotion spending as management moderated A&P priorities in the quarter to align with market dynamics.
In the third quarter, we realized an impairment for indefinite and definite-lived intangible assets and goodwill related to our BCH business of $1.7 billion. The factors that contributed to this impairment were: one, changes in the market and performance of the brands due to moderated new product launch assumptions; two, execution of certain key product strategies falling short of operating management's plans causing a reduction to baseline forecast models in France, Germany and Italy; three, certain macroeconomic factors, which have continued to impact the business more than expected, in addition to unfavorable foreign currency impacts experienced primarily in the U.K. related to Brexit; and four, a change in the Belgian forecast due to a fundamental reduction in volume with a major wholesaler that is not expected to be short term in nature. The calculation of this impairment is a complicated process. While our GAAP net income and EPS include the preliminary calculation for the related tax effect of the impairment, we are completing our final control procedures, which will be finalized by the end of our -- by the filing of our 10-Q, which is anticipated to be by the end of the day today. Any changes to this would not impact our adjusted earnings per share discussed throughout this announcement today.
Turning now to Rx on Slide 22. Net sales were $267 million, 4% higher than last year on a constant currency basis, driven largely by $32 million related to acquisitions and new product sales of $18 million. The Rx adjusted gross margin was 59% in the quarter due to product acquisitions and new products. Pricing pressures in the segment were in line with our expectations announced last quarter. In addition to acquisitions, we also experienced meaningful productivity improvements compared to last year, which were a factor in offsetting the effect of lower pricing. Adjusted operating margin for the segment was 42.5%, an increase of 40 basis points over the same period last year. R&D investments in the quarter increased $6 million as the team continues to invest in pipeline products.
Our Specialty Sciences segment realized net sales in the quarter of $93 million compared to $85 million last year. Tysabri sales benefited in the quarter from a onetime favorable adjustment to discounts and allowances. Based on the current royalty percentage that Perrigo received, the effect of this benefit was approximately $3.6 million. In addition, the segment benefited from a $6 million reduction in operating expenses due to lower legal costs in the current year.
Turning to Slide 24 and an update on our balance sheet. As of October 1, 2016, total cash on the balance sheet was $363 million, and total debt was approximately $5.9 billion. Our total debt declined by over $500 million from the previous quarter end as we proactively repaid our $500 million of senior notes, which would have matured on November 8, 2016, consistent with our stated deleveraging strategy and our commitment to our investment-grade ratings. We generated $304 million of cash from operating activities during the quarter, which brings us to approximately $704 million of cash from operating activities for the first 9 months of the year. This represents a cash flow conversion of operating cash flow to adjusted net income of 129% in the quarter. Excluding the contribution of the Tysabri royalty from both the numerator and denominator of this equation, the conversion would increase to 148%. We will continue to use our strong cash flow conversion to prioritize our capital allocation toward deleveraging. We do not intend to reenter the share repurchase market in the near term, and as John stated earlier, our commitment to our investment-grade rating extends to the alternatives process we are undertaking for Tysabri.
Turning to Slide 26. We are confirming the full year 2016 adjusted earnings per share guidance midpoint we announced in August. I would like to take a moment to briefly review the details by segment. For the CHC segment, we continue to expect 2016 adjusted net sales of approximately $2.6 billion and second half adjusted operating margins in line with those in the first half. I would like to remind you that these expectations continue to exclude 2016 contributions from the U.S. VMS business, which was sold on August 5. We still expect approximately $1.3 billion in adjusted net sales for the BCH segment, and we now anticipate adjusted operating margins for the second half of the year to be approximately 10%, which is due primarily to lower adjusted gross profit contributions due to the effects discussed earlier. We continue to align A&P spend with sales patterns and therefore expect fourth quarter seasonal A&P spend to be higher relative to the third quarter to support the cough/cold season. The Rx segment net sales guidance also remains unchanged at approximately $1 billion, and we continue to expect adjusted operating margin in the low 40% range for the full year. Consistent with our comments last quarter, our forecast continues to assume second half year-over-year price erosion on like-for-like products of 9% to 10%. We expect consolidated full year 2016 cash flows to be approximately $900 million.
I'll now turn the call back over to John."

So as you, I'm sure, Sumant, being the careful reader of these Qs and Ks that you are, I'm sure that you noted that we have outlined that the basis of the original assets -- the original purchase price accounting are definite and indefinite-lived assets by product category, which means, and I remember commenting on this in our May earnings call, that if expectations on those specific categories change over time, it changes the perspective on the long-term indefinite cash flows discounted back to today. What does that mean? At the time we did our evaluation in May, we had certain assertions, country by country, on the future cash flows from our XLS medical technology, a weight loss product, other products in our lifestyle category as well as certain other products in cough/cold and our animal health categories in Europe. In the last 6 months, some of the assertions on those product categories have changed further, both combination of these 4 things I outlined in the call, macroeconomic factors and the management team's assertion of how to utilize those assets best on a go-forward basis. So yes, inherent to your question, has the expectation of run rate of revenues from those categories changed? Yes. And that is the underlying starting point of an indicator of impairment and the reason that the entire process had to be started over again to rerun cash flows for those product categories, those definite and indefinite-lived assets. And due to the magnitude of the change projected in those particular products and categories, it did also trigger the indicator to run a goodwill impairment analysis, i.e. what are the total cash flows of the total business ex -- even including those assets that are not specifically targeted as the product categories I've commented on already. So stepping back, the underlying expectation on run rate for our business in Europe continues to be -- to grow at a rate above market. But the combination of products to get there, the assertion of brand strategies to make that successful and the contributors of -- to those cash flows on a long-term basis have changed, thereby creating the underlying impairment that you see in the books today. John, I don't know if you want to comment further on future run rate."

That being said, the plan would be -- to John's point, in order to focus the portfolio and focus on core businesses that we would use that cash, first and foremost, to delever, looking at being able to get down to something more like 3.25 turns and deploying the cash that would come from that sale from any sale, first and foremost, to delever the balance sheet. Effective tax rate-wise, you got into a little granularity in trying to prognosticate on any kind of Irish tax structures. Suffice it to say, at the time we would have a sale, the effective tax rate would also go up for the company. Why? Jurisdictional mix. This particular asset's royalty streams today are taxed in the single digits. And so without that mix of earnings before tax in there, obviously, the remaining -- remain co-tax rate will be higher. I'm not -- at this level, I'm not going to get into gory detail of the ins and outs at the time of the sale, but suffice it to say that the tax implications of this on a go-forward basis, we would talk about that at the time of the sale."

So that dynamic continues, and the team does a good job. And part of the costs work that John commented on officially in his comments was directed towards the CHC team working with -- within our manufacturing group, our supply chain group to help find value within our overall supply chain so that they are in a better position to continue to pass on that savings to their customers while at the same time maintaining adjusted gross margins on a go-forward basis.

My belief is we will get the infrastructure in a better place in Europe instead of a number of unique, different infrastructures. We'll be able to build [ph] them together in a more efficient structure and want to continue to have product acquisitions, smaller things that we bolt on to that, that can deliver value to the bottom very quickly.

So kind of as I said in my comments, I think as a consumer-facing company bringing value, M&A, larger footprint and presence in Europe, in concept, is a good place to be. Markets are growing. They're good consumer markets. I think they're going to continue to evolve, to need cost-effective solutions, whether it's brands or store brands that we offer in countries, those kind of things. So at a macroeconomic level, I like being in Europe. I think the -- it's a good place to be. Now I step back and say, does that mean that every part of our branded business and consumer parts in Europe are operating well and we belong in long term? And I'd say, we're going through that analysis. We announced the last time we were doing some restructuring and looking at potential exits from products in Russia. The -- Argentina, which isn't in Europe, I realize that. South Africa, other areas. So we continue to look at the branded consumer portfolio and say, do we have a right to win in this country? Do we have the right products? Do we have the right go-to-market strategy? And I think there will continue to be pruning of that overall portfolio to make it much more effective. On the organizational and G&A effectiveness and operating cost of goods effectiveness, we can continue to drive more efficiency and effectiveness there to make sure that the sales we have drop right to the bottom line. So a lot of work in what I'd call creating the Perrigo Bureau of not from how we sell, not the go-to-market, but the actual back office, how we're able to deliver sales to the bottom is what we've got to continue to work on there. But -- so fundamentally, yes, I like being there. It's not been easy. It won't -- we still have a lot of work to do, but I think the market ties in with our consumer-facing side. The -- when I think about the OTC and Rx, and again, I said this before, there are some ties to the business between operating side things, plants, some of the procurement side, those kind of things that are good links from that standpoint. Certainly, going to market, the selling process, the people you call on at the buying groups, et cetera, are different. So on the backside, they are there. They are good synergies we're able to pull out, but they probably aren't game changers as far as ultimate decisions to make. We'd look at all of those and say those are part of the equation, and they wouldn't limit us from deciding to do something else with the business if that's where the data are that we chose to go.

So let me go through a number of those in order here. So first of all, revenue synergies between, I'll say, the -- Europe and U.S. or U.S. and Europe, those kind of revenue synergies, have been slower to materialize than was originally contemplated. The -- just because of the regulatory processes, the unique ingredients in some of the products here that we've got to kind of do changes to, to get them in Europe and vice versa. So that part of it has been slower than expected. The actual operating synergies of costs and those kinds of things continue to progress as well, but it's taken us longer to get at those reverse synergies. We have, in certain markets, worked -- I'll pick the U.K. an example, where we had a big presence of store brand from legacy Perrigo and doing a lot to combine our branded business with our store brand, with our pharmacy business because of what it is. And we have those all under Neil Lister, a great leader for Perrigo, who runs that whole business now. And he's driving synergies across all combinations of that business structure. So Marc, we haven't given up on the synergies to move products back and forth, to move that. We're actually doing more processes moving back and forth than products at this point. But we think there still are synergies there and ways to drive some of that. Let me go to Belgium and some of the issues there. First of all, we still do business with Stada. We still move it through. We've continued -- we do a number of different distribution methods in Belgium. There's a number of different avenues to go to market. One of the biggest ones is through pharmacy distributors, pharmacy wholesalers, as you might call them here in the U.S. And the -- and they would go out to independent pharmacies throughout the Belgium country. There's been what I'd call inventory inefficiencies in that model of selling in, where is it selling out, making sure we've got good tracking now with the sellout so we know what's going there, but making sure that we understand where all the pockets of inventory are and how to manage and normalize that has created longer than we had originally expected. We expected it to normalize relatively quick. So we continue to work with the distributors, the wholesalers, the chains, everything in Belgium, to make that smooth or flow smoother. And it definitely takes us longer than we expected. But Stada relationship is good. We continue to distribute their products as well as our own OTC products to that same channel. On the -- your last question was on key brands, and how much of the portfolio they made was the question or what the -- can you ask that one more time, Marc? I'm sorry."

So it's not just the brands we want to drive more pan-European, like Bronchostop and some of those, through our regional great products that we're going to try and drive because that's who we are. We're not quite the -- here's the only 20 brands that's going to be 90% of our portfolio. We're going to drive those brands but also continue to invest in those regional brands."

So rather than get into granularity right now on this call, talking about specific growth rates of the top brands, we are making changes to certain categories and the expectations of the brand and product growth. Some of the new leadership in Europe is looking specifically at the combination of their local jewel brand investments versus the potential for developing pan-European or more regional brand strategies. Those will be part of our conversations as we go into 2017, but the main area of focus for that operating team on the ground in the last 6 weeks has been trying to get very deep-dive information on what they plan to do by their product categories in order to put forward meaningful cash flow estimates for those products so that we could do a more refined impairment calculation that we talked about earlier on the call."

So I'm just trying to connect that with your prior commentary around expectations of 9% to 10% deflation in the second half and still the maintenance of that deflation expectation for the balance of the year. And then just as a corollary to that. A lot of companies have talked about another leg down in pricing that sort of occurred post the end of calendar third quarter.

The -- when you look at the pharma space, et cetera, pricing, again, has always been a dynamic that's in there, although it's gotten more dramatic here recently, et cetera.

We have 27 ANDAs pending FDA approval, 5 Paragraph 4 litigations, a number of active clinical studies. But keeping that pipeline, getting those products approved and launched becomes the way that you work to offset that pricing dynamic. And that continues to be the -- a battle all the time, especially in this dynamic pricing environment we're in. On the Omega front and our announcements, I'm going to kind of avoid that question.

So just to make sure we're understanding, I mean, in terms of the impairment charges, this really doesn't necessarily reflect specifically a change in long-term outlook from what you think of the business. It's much more of just reviewing expectations for very specific product lines as they are today, and that obviously needs to change. And so when we think about long-term growth, it's probably going to be coming from -- via product acquisitions, which Omega was very successful with over the years, as well as sort of internal R&D efforts. And then my second question is in terms of the leadership at BCH, just curious if -- given the fact that it is a very different business from your store brand, sort of core, the thought of bringing in or -- sort of some external people with more traditional OTC -- branded OTC experience just to introduce some new perspectives versus what has always been sort of the Perrigo way of doing things."

I'll give philosophically -- and I'll maybe get through the others and give it back to Judy on that one. As we've talked about and kind of laid out the parts of the impairment, that doesn't really say that you can't grow the business going forward or the business won't grow. It doesn't say that anything you buy will layer into there and grow it. So you're exactly right that it's sort of a, here's what we have, is it performing as we expected? Are different products performing? And Judy will go into those in a minute here. But it certainly doesn't say there isn't growth for the business and there aren't ways to enhance that growth. Certainly, one of those is innovation within the product lines. So you know this, once you have brands, the brand will become stagnant. You've got to follow it up with the Max Strength and the Extra Max and the -- here's the liquid that goes with the tablet, all of those kind of innovations that flow there. That comes both internally but even more so making sure we fund product acquisitions that can add to that innovation. So that's kind of got to be part and is part of the growth path going forward. And again, I'll let Judy come back to that impairment question in a minute here. On the innovation side, I think you're exactly right. We hired a new Chief Strategy and Innovation Officer to help drive that, to help us to look for how we continue to drive that innovation. He comes from the consumer industry, brings great experience with him and will be great there. I think the other leadership we brought in from the outside has good branded, good consumer, good consumer-facing experience and brings credibility to all those countries where we're selling. So they clearly are not exports from the Perrigo infrastructure to them from that standpoint. On the supply chain side, we are bringing a fair amount of our sales and operations planning, inventory management, cost of goods sold, how to consolidate sites, that sort of infrastructure, bringing that to them because that's sort of a universal thing versus a business-specific skill, et cetera. And I will say, we're not done adding either. So we've added some good ones. We continue to look at where we need European branded leadership, European leadership, et cetera, to bring into the company to make sure that we are successful in all the objectives we laid out. Judy, please, on the other impairment thoughts."

The fact that we had a goodwill impairment in addition means by definition that the long-term cash flows coming from the entire business that we acquired have stepped down. That's -- it's a bounding box, algebraic equation that one must reexamine each year to say, are the expected cash flow streams from all of the assets that were acquired the same or have they moved since acquisition or since the last goodwill evaluation? So the answer is, yes, it has stepped down. And then to John's point, there's still growth in the model. To the earlier comment, there's still growth expectations ahead of the market, but importantly, we can't -- you can't step away from the earlier statement of have the expectations changed. Absolutely. That's what triggered the impairment calculation. But there is still growth in the model on a country -- for a host of countries and for pan-European bases, yes."

Do we need to invest, disinvest? What do we need to do? So there's a lot of discussions. I think when you step back to your second question, on the Rx business, good portfolio. On the Consumer Healthcare business, good portfolio of new products. Depends on when products switch. Those are -- some of the products in the pipeline are dependent on switches. Some are line extensions to what's out there, but we have good engines, good R&D, internal functions that support both of those businesses, well-developed teams that drive that as well as we continue to look for business development opportunities to supplement that as far as bolt-on acquisitions.

That doesn't happen anymore. We do ship some product in, but they are storing small amounts, and they expect that our supply chain can keep it flowing. So you don't have these huge surges of big product inflows like we used to, again, 10 years ago or so. So they are sitting where they want to be for the season right now. We are prepped and ready, continue to operate and ready for that to happen. Allergy was a little bit lighter here in the fall, and cough/cold really hasn't sort of taking off yet. Weather has been a little bit milder. But we are ready to service that when and if it hits. On the Nexium issue, we are gearing up and prepared.

So first of all, on the generic space, certainly, the consolidated number of buyers, kind of the atmosphere right now on drug pricing, all those kind of things that have hit, certainly have a dynamic on the pricing and what's been going on. I think there are times when scale certainly is beneficial. You're going in with a basket. I would say, on the Rx side, especially in our categories, most of the buyers won't just buy a whole category from you, whatever, they are product specific. So scale, while good, because it -- you got a broader array of products to bounce any one price decrease, price concession off, they're still bidding, asking you for price, asking you if you want to bid on a product item by item. And so, really, that part of it doesn't give you huge benefits from the scale. There is a spreading of risk that helps. I think when you look at BCH longer term, our goal is to continue to drive net operating margin up to what I call our Consumer Healthcare margins, so up to the higher teens, in my mind. Now we've got a lot of work to get there because, as Judy said, we're looking at 10% or so. That includes product growth at higher margins than where we're at as well as operating efficiencies to deliver support to those products so more of that sales can drop to the bottom.
