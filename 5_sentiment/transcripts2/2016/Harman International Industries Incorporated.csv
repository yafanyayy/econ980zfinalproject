I'm very pleased to report that earlier this morning, we released solid results for the second quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, net sales increased 19% to $1.8 billion, our performance on the top line again resulted in double-digit EBITDA growth. We expanded our operating margins and generated $225 million in EBITDA and reported earnings per share of $1.84. On a constant-currency basis, EBITDA was up 20%, and earnings per share was up 9% compared to the prior year. This is now our 11th consecutive quarter of top and bottom line growth. 
Let me give you some additional color specifically on Connected Car division. Q1 came in 19% top line on constant currency; Q2, 9%; first half, 14%. You may recall we guided you for 13% on constant currency, and we are up already ahead of our guidance, and we feel pretty good about our second half. If [indiscernible] gets validated, in fiscal '15, you may recall, we booked $6.2 billion worth of automotive orders, year-to-date we booked $2 billion, that is $8.2 billion of orders in the last 18 months. We never had any momentum like that, and I don't think anybody else had in the industry. [indiscernible] rates are expanding, continue to expand and to expedite nonlinear [indiscernible] extension, which we all are hoping and waiting to see soon. We have done some big moves transformation. We acquired [indiscernible] for end to end connectivity services in the car, we acquired Redbend, we acquired [indiscernible] for cybersecurity because of there is no autonomous Connected Car without cybersecurity, you should be asking that question to other people. No one is thinking about it, but we got a strong confidence from our automakers at TS and had it validated and we have tremendous enthusiasm. So I don't know what market, I'm feeling damn good. 
So with that, let me just go on to talk about our other divisions. In our consumer business, we have a very strong holiday season as a result of the growing consumer demand for our family of portable speakers, including the recently launched JBL Xtreme, JBL Flip 3, JBL, our expanded global distribution channels together with prime shelf space and marketing initiatives after huge evidence. In addition, our partnership with media market in Germany and connect in France delivered very strong sales growth. You may recall we became the leading audio partner in media stores a year ago. In the automotive business OEMs side separate investing in connected and autonomous car technology along with smart audio solutions. We are well-positioned to capitalize on this demand, peak rates for Connected Car and car audio solutions continue to rise. At the end of fiscal '15 we have an industry-leading backlog of $23 billion. Since then, we have secured another $2 billion of new automotive awards year-to-date, and as I remind, this is a double-digit operating margin business. 
So before I dive into the details of the division, let me recap some of the headlines we made at CES earlier this month. As some of you know firsthand, our exhibit hall was packed, and this is a high quality audience strictly by invitation only with our current and potential customers. The entire [indiscernible] of the show. It was great seeing so many of you at the investor event. HARMAN's innovations were standout, earning a company-best and industry-best [indiscernible] CES Innovation awards, America's Choice Award for our new cobranded JBL Under Armour headphone which I'll talk about in a minute and a Best of CES Award for voice audio. HARMAN is partnering with the most innovative companies in the world. Our announcements with Google, Microsoft and Under Armour gained broad attention, and I'll go into details in a second. We also demonstrated HARMAN's newest technology for the connected and intelligent car, like enhancing intelligent [indiscernible] solution. We call it lists, and IBS. HARMAN had integrated the industry's most complete end-to-end system to provide drivers intelligent, adaptable and personalized solution in the car. We have built a suite of integrated technologies encompassing not only infotainment which includes navigation, multimedia and radio and television tuners to now include telematics, safety and cybersecurity features on one complete platform. This complete platform is scalable and modular to allow OEMs and consumers maximum flexibility. Again, this is very forward-looking and strong validation for leading automakers. 
This is what we call, top of that we are the only supplier who can provide a full suite of connected services that leverage cloud and data analytics increasingly becoming important for auto industry. We're all aware of the benefits of the Connected Car. At the same time, we cannot sacrifice security for functionality. To complete HARMAN's 5-plus 1 security network, which is already the most comprehensive in the industry, we announced acquisition of [indiscernible]. Tellis Sechrist the global automotive cybersecurity company specializing in actual production for connectivity goes. Tellis sic technology will be integrated into HARMAN's 5-plus 1 security architecture aimed at protecting the critical points of in the connected and autonomous car. We expect to close this transaction shortly.  This will be our second entirely based cybersecurity acquisition. As a reminder, Redbend gave us  2 of the critical element of the 5-plus 1 architecture, the hyper visor layer and the overlayer of data technology, and now we brought2 two Telesat [indiscernible] production control. 
Let me take a close look at our divisions and review some recent notable achievements. Starting with Connected Car division, which is highlighted on Slide 6 of our investor presentation. HARMAN launched embedded infotainment solutions on a number of new vehicle models, including the new Genesis luxury brand for Hyundai. The system is now available in Korea on board the Genesis EQ 900 and will be available in Europe, North America by mid-2016. The Connected Car division also received follow-on business from Subaru. Our first award if you remember across our line entry and mid-and high worldwide we received sometime earlier and it is expected to go in SOP mode in fiscal year 2017. Additionally, HARMAN announced a strategic partnership with Microsoft to bring new model and cloud-based services to our automotive market. That's a first in the industry. The first implementation of this partnership is to integrate key elements of the Microsoft Office 365 productivity suite. Working with Microsoft is a natural fit for HARMAN. As we continue our track record of partnering to integrate the best solutions into cars for consumers. 
Now turning to the Lifestyle Audio division, which is starting to become my second favorite. Some of our recent notable achievements are highlighted on Slide 7 of our investor presentations. We had an extremely strong holiday season in consumer audio. As I mentioned earlier, we are experiencing phenomenal success with our award-winning line of affordable speakers. On top of that, our headphones are also gaining momentum in the market. You may know, HARMAN is already #1 worldwide in the sports headphones. In November, HARMAN reviewed the JBL Everest wireless headphones exclusively for the 3 largest consumer electronics retailers, Best Buy in the United States, Connect in France and me to in Germany. Our strategy partnership with Under Armour, the fastest growing apparel and health and wellness fitness company will bring to market new and meaningful innovation in the fast-growing connected health and connected fitness space. It's all about connectivity.  At CES, we introduced our first 2 cobranded products, wireless headphones for the new JBL Under Armour Bluetooth headphones with heart rate monitoring. The heart rate headphones won a CES 2016 Editor's Choice Award. 
And now turning to car audio, audio an essential part of Connected Car experience. It is no more than just having a great music experience. You need it for connectivity. An award-winning car audio solutions and powerful portfolio of brands continue to resonate with drivers leading to another strong quarter of growth. [indiscernible] have a 20-plus percent EBITDA margin business going up on a top line business. HARMAN secured new car from Audi, BMW, GE, Volvo among others. In addition, HARMAN secured first customer for industry-first for this refers individual China's own technology, you might have seen that last year in our CES booth and we have secured an order from a European OEM. That's a strong proof point of HARMAN's excellence in car engineering and product design. 
Our car audio solutions continue to expand across car lines globally. The branded audio solutions that launched during the quarter included Harley-Davidson, Roadglide with HARMAN Kardon, Toyota Prius with JBL, Nexus GS with Mark Levinson, and Hyundai Acqueous with Lexicon. As you may recall, last year, we acquired Bang & Olufsen automotive audio business. And we have now integrated HARMAN Technologies into the Bang & Olufsen product line. As a result, we're winning new awards and industry recognitions. We are also getting traction with NL play, a second brand targeting the mass market. Our Bang & Olufsen Car and audio solution in the Audi Q7 won the best sound system latest choice award from [indiscernible] in Germany. 
At CES, we showcased our new Summit car audio platform, representing the pinnacle of car audio, addressing the growing demand for personalization and adaptability through flexible software solutions. This scalable platform integrates the best of HARMAN's sound processing and sound management technologies such as Quantum Logic surround sound, individual sound zones and Clarify, along with new features like connected jukebox and virtual menus to create an unprecedented in-car audio experience for drivers. We also introduced the industry-first Infinity [indiscernible] drive, which seamlessly integrate Lifestyle Audio for the whole car and on-the-go. [indiscernible] won the Best of CES Award -- I mean, Best of CES Award. With Summit advisor drive we now have scalable car audio platform, system-on-chip global flexibility modular and scalable that can serve an entire spectrum of the car audio market from high end luxury to entry-level. 
Now turning to Professional Solutions division highlighted on Slide 8 on the investor presentation, during the quarter, we were selected by [indiscernible] integrators and installers around the world. Some notable products include the Dubai Opera House, Newport Station, the USC School of Business and ESPN Studios in Mexico City. HARMAN's products also followed a wide range of events including New Year's Eve in Times Square and the World AIDS Day concert in Carnegie Hall.  Division launched our 12 new major products during the quarter, several of which were recognized by industry associations. 
Now let me update you on the 2 important strategic initiatives we are implementing in this division to take the performance to a whole new level. First, our go-to-market approach. On October 1, our sales structure was realigned to better capitalize on our unique end to end solution including audio, video, lighting and control of enterprise and control systems for enterprise segment and entertainment segments. With this new structure, we are better-positioned to bring complete and tailored solution to different vertical markets. This is happening, takes a little bit of a time to adjust for our distributors and dealers and [indiscernible] but it's going very well. And personally visited many of the customers end points. Second initiative, we are on track to complete our plans to improve our European manufacturing footprints which was significantly bring our costs down. We are consolidating our professional product manufacturing centers in Denmark and the U.K. into a single, more cost efficient Hungarian facility. The first of those consolidation was completed in December, while the second one is well underway and expected to be fully operational by end of March. That is right on plan. As I mentioned previously, we expect to realize the full benefits from these strategic initiatives in our fiscal 2017. 
Now turning to the Connected Services division, highlighted on Slide 9 of the Investor presentation. During the quarter, HARMAN began providing software product development services to new customers, including intervisitor and alliance view lines few. Connected Services also secured follow-on business from Nielsen, Polycom, [indiscernible] and a new car company, and DealerTrak, also, a major automotive dealer network in the United States. Now that is part of cost automotive. In addition, we continue building the background for our industry-leading OPE software update technology winning awards with Honda in Japan, Jaguar Land Rover, et cetera. Our OTS solutions are not only updating infotainment systems, but also other non-HARMAN ECUs in the car.  In the case of Jaguar Land Rover, we'll be updating the telematics control unit [indiscernible]. As you can see, we're getting momentum with our OTA business. Lending on our success for Daimler and Subaru in automotive and KDDI mobile in Japan, we now have secured over $100 million worth of OTA business over the last 12 months, and expect to continue this momentum. This is again a very pleasant news for us, and that's exactly what we expected. 
During the quarter, Connected Services was recognized as a top global R&D services provider by the respected advisory firm [indiscernible] know place HARMAN in the leadership so on, the highest category across multiple industry verticals. In addition, several of HARMAN's aftermarket products won CES Innovation Award, including the JBL Legend Infinity Geer 5, JBL SmartBass and JBL Trip. At CES, we showcased our cloud based end to end service delivery platform for the Connected Car. This platform allows automakers and service providers to introduce and easily deploy new enterprise cloud services to connected vehicles. With our service delivery platform, HARMAN was partnered with OEMs to provide a number of new service offerings, including a very interesting features and adding new software features after the car is being sold. Connecting local data to predict part failures, forecasting for preventive maintenance and enabling OEMs and dealers to address software issues in the field more efficiently without making a call. This industry first service delivery platform, and I repeat, this is the industry's first service delivery platform, addresses the existing and future demand for scalability, security and flexibility in the provisioning of Connected Car services for automaker and their customers. 
Additionally, Google selected HARMAN to be the first system integration partner for [indiscernible]. Its android-based IoT developer platform. They were also selected HARMAN as a first honor to be [indiscernible] Google's communication partner for IoT devices. This positions HARMAN is a technology partner of choice for device manufacturer to design and develop products for a range of key IoT applications, serving the smart home, consumer, automotive and enterprise segments. Let me remind you, our collaboration with Google spans over a decade, from the development and scaling of Android-based ecosystem across mobile devices and consumer equipment as a member of the open handset alliance to automotive, as a member of Google's Open Automotive Alliance, and now, IoT. Our partnership with market leaders like Microsoft and Google will allow us to expand our customer base across automotive, mobile app communications and enterprise. 
In summary, I am extremely pleased with our strong financial results for the first half, which are in line with our expectations. As you would expect, we are closely monitoring recent macroeconomic headwinds, but at this point, we are on track to deliver on our full year plan. In addition, we are seeing good momentum in building our backlog. Finally, I am energized by our continued innovation. That has been differentiating HARMAN from anybody else. In addition, several of HARMAN's other initiative which are in place. Innovation and a strong partnerships that we have formed this year that will drive further growth. All of these factors position HARMAN for sustainable long-term growth. 
Now I will turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Sandy Rowland, who will give you additional color in our financial results for the quarter."

Let me walk you through our financial highlights for the quarter. As a reminder, most of my financial remarks are provided on an operational basis which excludes restructuring, non-recurring acquisition-related item. I want to point out that majority of the difference between our GAAP an operational result is due to the non-cash amortization of intangible assets recognize as a result of our recent acquisition. Before reconciliation of our GAAP to our operational results is included in the press release that we issued this morning. This quarter, our revenues were $1.8 billion, an increase of 12% compared to the prior year or 19%, excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and FX, our net sales increased 12%. Revenue in our Connected Car there is an increased 2% versus the prior year or 9% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. The increase in net sales was due to higher take rates, stronger automotive production and the expansion of recently launched platforms. 
Revenue in our Lifestyle Audio division increased 20% compared to the prior year or 26%, excluding foreign exchange. The increase in net sales was primarily due to new product introductions and expanded global distribution channels in consumer audio. In our Car Audio business, the increase in sales was driven by the acquisition of the Bang & Olufsen car audio business and higher take rates. 
Revenue in our Professional Solutions division increased [ph] 7% compared to the prior year or 4% excluding foreign exchange, mainly due to weakness in emerging markets, particularly Brazil and Russia. Revenue in our Connected Car Services Division was $170 million in the quarter compared to $74 million a year ago. The increase in revenue was primarily due to the expansion of our services portfolio as a result of the acquisition of Symphony Teleca. Total company gross margin increased 60 basis points to 30.8%. The improvement was primarily due to improved leverage of fixed costs as a result of higher sales volume, as well as the expansion of our services portfolio. Connected Car gross margin increased 60 basis points to 25% primarily due to better leverage of fixed costs and lower warranty costs. Lifestyle Audio gross margin increased 50 basis points to 32.7%, primarily due to improved operating leverage as a result of higher sales volume. Professional Solutions gross margin increased 100 basis points to 41.4% driven by lower manufacturing expenses. And Connected Services gross margins were 33.2%. 
Our SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales increased 30 basis points from the prior year to 20.3% due to higher investments in research and development. Connected Car SG&A declined 30 basis points to 13% and Lifestyle Audio SG&A decreased 110 basis points to 18.2%, both due to improved operating leverage on higher sales. SG&A expenses in Professional Solutions increased 190 basis points to 29.9% due to lower sales volume. Connected Services SG&A as a percentage of sales was 22 2%. And finally, corporate SG&A as a percentage of sales remains relatively flat compared to the prior year.  Consolidated operating income was $186 million compared to $162 million in the prior year, a 15% increase or 21% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Our EPS was $1.84 compared to $1.79 in the prior year, up 3% or 9% excluding FX. 
Now let me provide with a few updates on capital allocation. Fiscal year-to-date, we have repurchased approximately 495,000 shares at a cost of $50 million. We have approximately $450 million remaining on our board authorized share repurchase program. While liquidity position continues to be strong, we have sufficient cash and access to our revolving credit facility to make the second payment for Symphony Teleca and to close the Telesat acquisition which we anticipate closing shortly. In light of current market conditions, we do expect to repurchase additional shares in the second half of this fiscal year. As Dinesh said earlier, we are on track to deliver on our revenue and earnings targets for our core business. Assuming our acquisition of Telesat closes expected over the next few weeks, it will be deleted to earnings by approximately $0.05 as it is a bolt-on technology investment. Let me also remind you of the traditional seasonality in our businesses. Production tends to be slower in our fiscal third quarter and the annual price reductions in the automotive businesses also occurs in this quarter. We also have a higher interest payments as a result of making the second payment on Symphony Teleca and closing the Telesat acquisition. 
Overall, we are very pleased with our strong first-half results despite the foreign currency headwinds and broad macroeconomic uncertainty, we have performed well and are well-positioned for continued growth in our core businesses. 
Thank you for your attention. Dinesh and I are now happy to take your questions."

And we will also expect our second half is more back-loaded as it would be an extension. So we'll also see that. So all in all, we guided 13% for the full year.

So consumer business really performed extremely well and you know by now, we do not take this business sacrificing our bottom line. So consumer business is holding and expected profitability and still growing the top line and car audio is a very robust profitable business.

Display audio would be a smart display unit but it will now the smart links like various car lines, Apple's CarPlay, Google's Android link, automotive link and many others. So we are seeing the convergence that 50% and moving very fast into fully embedded with everything or into [indiscernible]. So we also ask about our revenue. We don't break out majorities of our business is mid-segment and high-end. We also do, in all of these cars, where customers are asking we are integrating and drive Google Link, CarPlay, SLS, various car like, we're actually the first company to integrate Baidu CarLife ever in the industry. So that is just on top of it, it is not in lieu of that. However, when I mentioned earlier to Brian's question, very many entry-level car in China being produced. They don't have anything. So you might see the production from when you look at ICH Orion, the production going up but they don't have anything. When cars from Japan, Korea, China -- not China, the United States or Germany where they are shipped to China or even produced there, there you will see us assistance entry system, medium system or high-end system."

You probably noticed all the content that LG Corp. add on the car, including the contract for infotainment. I'm just curious if that was something -- are these the kind of products you're able to bid on? Or are you seeing companies like LG or Sony or Panasonic kind of get these types of things?

But we also keep in mind that for Q3 which we are in, traditionally, as it gets hit with annual price reductions, so that's already built into that guidance. So that would have an impact but we would need to be. Right now, we are saying we are going to meet guidance for the margin. So that looks good and other part of the question was related to, let's see, how's that development happening. Well, first of all, as you know, very well, the high-end  cars we are in very strong position worldwide. That's very high to begin with, so we rely on the production increase as the gross we will gain because there's not so much credit movement. The biggest take improvement is coming from mid-segment where we are very strong player. In fact, majority of our backlog today is in that segment even if it is coming from general automakers, because they also mid-segment.
[Audio Gap]
So we have been working, in fact, we may recall, with the fast tier 1 to integrate iPhone Out from Apple. It is very first of the world so we go back to the history of the business and other parts of their product lines. And Google, we also go back 10 years in the directly HARMAN system as well as services business, Connected Services. They're actually very strong services partner for product development and we are a member of open handset alliance, we are a member of open automotive alliance and we are the only company to date doing a commercial level development of android-based hybrid infotainment system which will be future proof. You can personalize it, you can keep it up-to-date current with 4G LTE built into it so we're very happy with that. So experience wise, I think they are learning a lot you might have seen in terms of press release from some of the Bay Area companies was making a lot of headlines freeze on hiring in automotive states. Well, we're all learning. The automotive industry is complex. We had been saying for a long time that we have players like HARMAN with very competitive ecosystem knowledge and investing in innovation of cybersecurity connectivity and also end to end services was bug unlike the headsets or handsets, we launched them would take them, we can't do that show with that said, I think automakers have renewed confidence in companies like HARMAN and our other [indiscernible]. And as I said, I can just underscore what CES this year wants. It is the best CES ever for HARMAN. We have with our customers with our new customers thinking twice and with a lot of activity out there, It was very busy right now, and that's a good thing."

Second one, Sandy, you mentioned a little bit on FX, but can you remind us what the transactional FX headwind is to EBIT or EBITDA this year? And then your comments about a similar amount of hedges next year, does that mean that the headwind next year on FX, all else being equal, should be about the same as of the headwind this year gets worse or better next year? And then the last one, more strategic, Dinesh, so in the last few weeks, Ford clearly have gotten very aggressive announcing at CES they're basically making infotainment standard on every car and then I guess, AT&T announced a couple of days ago that they're going to embed LTE on every Ford vehicle. So we're seeing at least Ford take this from an option to something that's more standard fit and obviously, that's not a big customer of your connected car business, but you kind of have the other 2 big U.S. manufacturers who are. So I'm wondering what you're hearing from them in terms of competitive response or kind anything in the industry that you think maybe Ford could be a tipping point here to move that attach rate up significantly from the smaller increases we've seen in the last couple of years."

The very first one was Connected Services business seasonality first half versus second half. Yes, this business has seasonality, and typically second half in the business is stronger and exactly that's how we see it. We do carry a little bit of a backlog, but we do not report that to the backlog that we report does not have -- has nothing to do with the services but we track that backlog, we have it. The second half is stronger and will make the guidance we have given you and we feel good about. It's growing, actually. And you mentioned about customers in the U.S., you mentioned Ford, you mentioned GM, AT&T, I actually see it very positively to just validate what you said. This is where it's going and that's what you might have been seen us pushing full integration of telematics and reinvesting in telematics as well. That's why we acquired Redband, Redband in Honda car, actually, and JLR, we will be upgrading the ECUs through telematics and we're investing in telematics, we are going second-generation telematics solution end to end for Daimler cars right now. So telematics will be big for us and telematics will drive connectivity and higher penetration, whether through telematics but they have an offering and we're investing. So I see a very important announcement coming from Ford, and by the way, you mentioned GM, that they have also announced they have Ford GLD built into every single car. So I am very pleased that automakers are recognizing and making the right investment to have the connectivity secure upfront. And once you have a secure conductivity in the car with OTA, we will be able to bring latest feature functionality even when the car has left the dealership and keep it current, update the firmware, software applications, even people like you and I can personalize our experience, we can buy, what you want to buy. A lot of that is happening. So telematics is a big piece and we are right in the middle of it."

And then the uncertainty is around the 25% that we don't hedge because you're running right around the USD 1.10 euro exchange that we have planned. It could be a higher rate next year and we see a tailwind if it dips again with the headwind. So what we don't know is the unhedged piece but still looking like in pretty good shape in that area."

So it is true, we acquired Redband, they're already engaged with multiple Tier 1s like HARMAN and HARMAN's competitors. First, thing we did, I myself joined the incoming CEO to talk to various tailwinds to tell them that will keep at arm's length just like we did many years when we [indiscernible] because this is an industry solution. We don't need to monopolize that, and we want everybody to benefit. And it's not just infotainment, it actually will update of firmware, software, various other ETU's supply by many of the other Tier 1s. That is ready happening and will happen and I hope it will happen because it is by far, the best OTA upgraded technology. Now coming back to monetization, it goes, first of all, as I said, we have booked $100 million of business, that is all software. So when it starts to go to the the revenue conversion, it is a very high margin business, as you would expect. In terms of how we charge, it is either licensing model, sometimes it is car licensed to the warranty as OEMs, may want to have it all in a subscription. Sometimes it is by model. So it's different, different packaging at Redbend before we acquired have been doing. Right now, we are trying to streamline and also working with major automakers where we have bigger opportunity, how do we sort of do create a model. And so basically it's a new stream are recurring revenue will come once the red band is there as a server as well as a client which is fitting in the car so it's just like anything which needs to be kept always alive and you get paid for. So we see a big opportunity because now you may start to a term no one else want to talk yet, it is called data. However, manages the data is the big winner. We will manage data through our Connected Services division and Redbend will provide the data exchange, whether you're AT&T, Verizon, China Mobile, Vodafone, they provide the plumbing and we are the mechanism for secure data exchange and update of the data. So we will be having data, and that data will go to OEMs, to dealers for the diagnostics, for consumer behavior, for insurance companies, to wellness, health, so we will be doing that in the management so we feel very good about. And that's where Redbend is part of our Connected Services division where we have our cloud management applications, we have our analytics division, very strong analytics engine, combine that with Redbend, you got a powerful services business and that's services business is calling on HARMAN competitors and all car companies directly."

All you could do, that we can say, look, HARMAN will start the package cybersecurity 5-plus 1 and including Redbend technology in every single new offering will come out from now on, and that will be priced as a bundle. But that will be an association, and that's the way I like to think you maintain price-performance ratio, you maintain going forward, you do not lose the pricing. You maintain the pricing power, but you keep adding features, feature functionality exponentially. So you keep your margins and continue to build margin and your leverage will give you the better margin. We will probably go both ways. Some customers who do not do business with us from infotainment to car audio, they're already using our Redbend and cybersecurity technology. They will pay us on a license basis. Those who are buying complete system from us, it will be totally embedded so they will get the whole offering and we'll get paid for the system.

I will give you my view as I see. By no means, the guidance for any expectations. Look, everybody talks about whether it is IHS, whether it is LMC or customers, any resource that's 65%, 70% take rates and that is going to happen 3 years or 5 years, but you're right, it's going to happen in 3 to 5 years. Not going to be beyond 5 years. It's happening in that period. If that happens, right now, industry average this year is supposed to be around 27%, 28% take rates, this number goes up to 65%, 70%. Guess who's going to benefit the most? It's HARMAN we're going to be working 9, 10 of the large OEMs of the 15 sitting with $23 billion backlog plus $2 billion we had booked this year. That backlog is based on current take rates. So you could double that thing am I just double from 27%, 28% to 55%. If the number goes up. That's why I get excited in 3, 5 years time, potentially if anything goes well as the industry said, HARMAN could see our revenue doubling again. And that's why I said I was opening our new center, because we don't know more than 1 year at a time. We only have visibility 1 year, but 5 years out, is it possible? You bet it's possible. Plus I think another very important piece which will drive take rates is connected services. OEM is struggling one thing, they don't know or they are not quite sure enough on how to create the back and connectivity to servers, the upload of data, the download of data analytics and make sense out of it and that Connected Services piece as right our acquisition that, that will transformational move will be made and after that, to people have also talked him going in that direction but there are not too many targets like Symphony Teleca. So we're very excited about that. So I've been very optimistic, if not quite clearly because it is embedded in here, embedded within the day, embedded is not pushing out by the way, on phones. They will also be integrated but the way our car industry is going is fully embedded and we will gain from that."

Our perfo",2620,"Thank you, Yijing, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I'm very pleased to report that earlier this morning, we released solid results for the second quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, net sales increased 19% to $1.8 billion. Our performance on the top line again resulted in double-digit EBITDA growth. We expanded our operating margins and generated $225 million in EBITDA and reported earnings per share of $1.84. On a constant currency basis, EBITDA was up 20%, and earnings per share was up 9% compared to the prior year. This is now our 11th consecutive quarter of top and bottom line growth. 
Let me give you some additional color, specifically on Connected Car division. Q1 came in 19% top line on constant currency; Q2, 9%; first half, 14%. You may recall we guided you for 13% on constant currency, and we are up already ahead of our guidance, and we feel pretty good about our second half. If further gets validated, in fiscal '15, you may recall, we booked $6.2 billion worth of automotive orders. Year-to-date, we booked $2 billion, that is $8.2 billion of orders in the last 18 months. We never had any momentum like that, and I don't think anybody else had in the industry. Take rates are expanding, continue to expand and to expedite nonlinear take rate expansion, which we all are hoping and waiting to see soon. We have done some big moves transformation. We acquired Symphony Teleca for end-to-end connectivity services in the car. We acquired Redbend. We acquired TowerSec for cybersecurity because of there is no autonomous or connected car without cybersecurity, you should be asking that question to other people. No one is thinking about it, but we got strong vote of confidence from our automakers. At CES, everyone validated and we have tremendous enthusiasm. So I don't know what market's move is, I'm feeling damn good. 
So with that, let me just go on to talk about other divisions. In our Consumer business, we had a very strong holiday season as a result of the growing consumer demand for our family of portable speakers, including the recently launched JBL Xtreme, JBL Flip 3, JBL Pulse 2, our expanded global distribution channels together with prime shelf space and marketing initiatives are paying huge dividends. In addition, our partnership with Media Markt in Germany and Fnac in France delivered very strong sales growth. You may recall we became the leading audio partner in Media Markt stores a year ago. In the automotive business, OEMs are rapidly investing in connected and autonomous car technology along with smart audio solutions. We are well positioned to capitalize on this demand. Take rates for connected car and car audio solutions continue to rise. At the end of fiscal '15, we had an industry-leading backlog of $23 billion. Since then, we have secured another $2 billion of new automotive awards year-to-date, and I'll remind this is a double-digit operating margin business. 
So before I dive into the details of the division, let me recap some of the headlines we made at CES earlier this month. As some of you know firsthand, our exhibit hall was packed, and this is a high-quality audience strictly by invitation only with our current and potential customers, the entire 4 days of the show. It was great seeing so many of you at the investor event. HARMAN's innovations were standout, earning a company-best and industry-best 13 CES Innovation Awards, America's Choice Award for our new co-branded JBL Under Armour headphones, which I will talk about in a minute, and a Best of CES Award for voice audio. HARMAN is partnering with the most innovative companies in the world. Our announcements with Google, Microsoft and Under Armour gained broad attention, and I'll go into the detail in a second. We also demonstrated HARMAN's newest technology for the connected and intelligent car, Life-Enhancing Intelligent Vehicle Solutions. We call it LIVS, L-I-V-S. HARMAN has integrated the industry's most complete end-to-end system to provide drivers intelligent, adaptable and personalized solution in the car. We have built a suite of integrated technologies encompassing not only infotainment, which includes navigation, multimedia and radio and television tuners, to now include telematics, safety and cybersecurity features on one compute platform. This compute platform is scalable and modular to allow OEMs and consumers maximum flexibility. Again, this is very forward-looking and strong validation for leading automakers. 
This is what we call LIVS. On top of that, we are the only supplier who can provide a full suite of connected services that leverage cloud and data analytics, increasingly becoming important for auto industry. We are all aware of the benefits of the connected car. At the same time, we cannot sacrifice security for functionality. To complete HARMAN's 5+1 security network, which is already the most comprehensive in the industry, we announced acquisition of TowerSec. TowerSec is a global automotive cybersecurity company specializing in network protection for connected vehicles. TowerSec's technology will be integrated into HARMAN's 5+1 security architecture aimed at protecting the critical points of vulnerability in the connected and autonomous car. We expect to close this transaction shortly. This will be our second Israeli-based cybersecurity acquisition. As a reminder, Redbend gave us  2 of the critical elements of the 5+1 architecture, the hypervisor layer and the over-the-air update technology, and now we brought in 2 TowerSec network protection control. 
Let me take a closer look at our divisions and review some recent notable achievements, starting with Connected Car division, which is highlighted on Slide 6 of our investor presentation. HARMAN launched embedded infotainment solutions on a number of new vehicle models, including the new Genesis luxury brand for Hyundai. The system is now available in Korea, onboard the Genesis EQ900, and will be available in Europe, North America by mid-2016. The Connected Car division also received follow-on business from Subaru. Our first award, if you remember, across our line entry, mid- and high worldwide, we received sometime earlier and it is expected to go in SOP mode in fiscal year 2017. Additionally, HARMAN announced a strategic partnership with Microsoft to bring new mobile and cloud-based services to the automotive market. That's a first for the industry. The first implementation of this partnership is to integrate key elements of the Microsoft Office 365 productivity suite. Working with Microsoft is a natural fit for HARMAN as we continue our track record of partnering to integrate the best solutions into cars for consumers. 
Now turning to the Lifestyle Audio division, which is starting to become my second favorite. Some of our recent notable achievements are highlighted on Slide 7 of the investor presentations. We had an extremely strong holiday season in consumer audio. As I mentioned earlier, we are experiencing phenomenal success with our award-winning line of portable speakers. On top of that, our headphones are also gaining momentum in the market. You may know, HARMAN is already #1 worldwide in the sports headphones. In November, HARMAN debuted the JBL Everest wireless headphones exclusively for the 3 largest consumer electronics retailers: Best Buy in the United States, Fnac in France and Media Markt in Germany. Our strategic partnership with Under Armour, fastest-growing apparel and health and wellness and fitness company, will bring to market new and meaningful innovations in the fast-growing connected health and connected fitness space. It's all about connectivity. At CES, we introduced our first 2 co-branded products, wireless headphones and the new JBL Under Armour Bluetooth headphones with heart rate monitoring. The heart rate headphones won a CES 2016 Editor's Choice Award. 
And now turning to car audio. Audio is an essential part of the connected car experience. It's no more than just having a great music experience. You need it for connectivity. An award-winning car audio solutions and powerful portfolio of brands continue to resonate with drivers, leading to another strong quarter of growth. [indiscernible] have a 20-plus percent EBIT margin business going up on a top line basis. HARMAN secured new car audio awards from Audi, BMW, Geely and Volvo, among others. In addition, HARMAN secured the first customer award for industry-first Individual Sound Zones technology. You might have seen that last year at our CES booth, and we have secured an order from a European OEM. That's a strong proof point of HARMAN's excellence in car audio engineering and product design. 
Our car audio solutions continue to expand across car lines globally. The Branded Audio solutions that launched during the quarter included Harley-Davidson Road Glide with Harman Kardon, Toyota Prius with JBL, Lexus GS with Mark Levinson and Hyundai Equus with Lexicon. As you may recall, last year, we acquired Bang & Olufsen's automotive audio business. And we have now integrated HARMAN technologies into the Bang & Olufsen product line. As a result, we're winning new awards and industry recognitions. We are also gaining traction with B&O PLAY, a second brand targeting the mass market. Our Bang & Olufsen's car audio solution in the Audi A7 -- or Q7, forgive me, won the best sound system Readers' Choice Award from Autobild in Germany. 
At CES, we showcased our new Summit Car audio platform, representing the pinnacle of car audio, addressing the growing demand for personalization and adaptability through flexible software solutions. This scalable platform integrates the best of HARMAN's sound processing and sound management technologies such as Quantum Logic Surround Sound, Individual Sound Zones and Clarifi, along with new features like Connected Jukebox and Virtual Venues, to create an unprecedented in-car audio experience for drivers. We also introduced the industry-first Infinity Voyager Drive, which seamlessly integrates Lifestyle Audio for the home, car and on the go. The Voyager Drive won the Best of CES Award -- I mean, Best of CES Award. With Summit and Voyager Drive, we now have scalable car audio platform, system-on-chip, total flexibility, marginal and scalable that can serve an entire spectrum of the car audio market from high-end luxury to entry level. 
Now turning to Professional Solutions division, highlighted on Slide 8 of the investor presentation. During the quarter, we were selected by leading systems integrators and installers around the world. Some notable projects include the Dubai Opera House, Newport Naval Station, the USC School of Business and ESPN Studios in Mexico City. HARMAN's products also followed a wide range of events including New Year's Eve in Times Square and the World AIDS Day concert in Carnegie Hall.  Division launched our 12 new major products during the quarter, several of which were recognized by industry associations. 
Now let me update you on the 2 important strategic initiatives we are implementing in this division to take the performance to a whole new level. First, our go-to-market approach. On October 1, our sales structure was realigned to better capitalize on our unique end-to-end solution including audio, video, lighting and control of enterprise and control systems for enterprise segment and entertainment segments. With this new structure, we are better positioned to bring complete and tailored solutions to different vertical markets. This is happening. It takes a little bit of a time to adjust with our distributors and master dealers and reps, but it's going very well. And I personally visited many of the customers' end points. Second initiative, we are on track to complete our plans to improve our European manufacturing footprints, which will significantly bring our costs down. We are consolidating our professional product manufacturing centers in Denmark and the U.K. into a single, more cost-efficient Hungarian facility. The first of those consolidation was completed in December, while the second one is well underway and expected to be fully operational by end of March. That is right on plan. As I mentioned previously, we expect to realize the full benefit from these strategic initiatives in our fiscal 2017. 
Now turning to the Connected Services division, highlighted on Slide 9 of the investor presentation. During the quarter, HARMAN began providing software product development services to new customers, including InterDigital and Reliance Jio. Connected Services also secured follow-on business from Nielsen, Polycom, Renault in Renault car company and Dealertrack, also the major automotive dealer network in the United States. Now that is part of cost automotive. In addition, we continued building the backlog for our industry-leading OTA software update technology, winning awards with Honda in Japan, Jaguar Land Rover, et cetera. Our OTA solutions are not only updating infotainment systems, but also other non-HARMAN ECUs in the car.  In the case of Jaguar Land Rover, we'll be updating the telematics control unit of ECU. As you can see, we're gaining momentum with our OTA business. Building with our success with Daimler and Subaru in automotive and KDDI in mobile in Japan, we now have secured over $100 million worth of OTA business over the last 12 months and expect to continue this momentum. This is again a very pleasant news for us, and that's exactly what we expected. 
During the quarter, Connected Services was recognized as a top global R&D services provider by the respected advisory firm, Zinnov. Zinnov placed HARMAN in the Leadership Zone, the highest category across multiple industry verticals. In addition, several of HARMAN's aftermarket products won CES Innovation Awards, including the JBL Legend, Infinity K5, JBL Smartbase and JBL Trip. At CES, we showcased our cloud-based end-to-end service delivery platform for the connected car. This platform allows automakers and service providers to introduce and easily deploy new enterprise cloud services to connected vehicles. With our service delivery platform, HARMAN will partner with OEMs to provide a number of new service offerings, including updating interesting features and adding new software features after the car is being sold. Connecting vehicle data to predict part failures, forecasting for preventative maintenance and enabling OEMs and dealers to address software issues in the field more efficiently without making a vehicle recall. This industry-first service delivery platform, and I repeat, this is the industry's first service delivery platform, addresses the existing and future demands for scalability, security and flexibility in the provisioning of connected car services for automakers and their customers. 
Additionally, Google selected HARMAN to be the first system integration partner for Brillo, its Android-based IoT developer platform. They were also selected HARMAN as the first partner for Weave, Google's communications protocol for IoT devices. This positions HARMAN as the technology partner of choice for device manufacturers to design and develop products for a range of key IoT applications, serving the smart home, consumer, automotive and enterprise segments. Let me remind you, our collaboration with Google spans over a decade, from the development and scaling of Android-based ecosystem across mobile devices and consumer equipment as a member of the Open Handset Alliance to automotive, as a member of Google's Open Automotive Alliance, and now IoT. Our partnership with market leaders like Microsoft and Google will allow us to expand our customer base across automotive, mobile and communications and enterprise. 
In summary, I am extremely pleased with our strong financial results for the first half, which are in line with our expectations. As you would expect, we are closely monitoring recent macroeconomic headwinds, but at this point, we are on track to deliver on our full year plan. In addition, we are seeing good momentum in building our backlog. Finally, I am energized by our continued innovation. That has been differentiating HARMAN from anybody else. In addition, several of HARMAN's other initiatives, which are in place. Innovation and the strong partnerships that we have formed this year, that will drive further growth. All of these factors position HARMAN for sustainable long-term growth. 
Now I will turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Sandy Rowland, who will give you additional color on our financial results for the quarter."

Let me walk you through our financial highlights for the quarter. As a reminder, most of my financial remarks are provided on an operational basis, which excludes restructuring, nonrecurring and acquisition-related items. I want to point out that the majority of the difference between our GAAP and operational results is due to the noncash amortization of intangible assets recognized as a result of our recent acquisitions. The full reconciliation of our GAAP to operational results is included in the press release that we issued this morning.
This quarter, our revenues were $1.8 billion, an increase of 12% compared to the prior year or 19% excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and FX, our net sales increased 12%. Revenue in our Connected Car division increased 2% versus the prior year or 9% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. The increase in net sales was due to higher take rates, stronger automotive production and the expansion of recently launched platforms. 
Revenue in our Lifestyle Audio division increased 20% compared to the prior year or 26% excluding foreign exchange. The increase in net sales was primarily due to new product introductions and expanded global distribution channels in consumer audio. In our car audio business, the increase in sales was driven by the acquisition of the Bang & Olufsen car audio business and higher take rates. 
Revenue in our Professional Solutions division decreased 7% compared to the prior year or 4% excluding foreign exchange, mainly due to weakness in emerging markets, particularly Brazil and Russia. Revenue in our Connected Services division was $170 million in the quarter compared to $74 million a year ago. The increase in revenue was primarily due to the expansion of our services portfolio as a result of the acquisition of Symphony Teleca. Total company gross margin increased 60 basis points to 30.8%. The improvement was primarily due to improved leverage of fixed costs as a result of higher sales volume as well as the expansion of our services portfolio. Connected Car gross margin increased 60 basis points to 25%, primarily due to better leverage of fixed costs and lower warranty costs. Lifestyle Audio gross margin increased 50 basis points to 32.7%, primarily due to improved operating leverage as a result of higher sales volume. Professional Solutions gross margin increased 100 basis points to 41.4%, driven by lower manufacturing expenses. And Connected Services gross margins were 33.2%. 
Our SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales increased 30 basis points from the prior year to 20.3% due to higher investments in research and development. Connected Car SG&A declined 30 basis points to 13%, and Lifestyle Audio SG&A decreased 110 basis points to 18.2%, both due to improved operating leverage on higher sales. SG&A expense in Professional Solutions increased 190 basis points to 29.9% due to lower sales volume. Connected Services SG&A as a percentage of sales was 22.2%. And finally, corporate SG&A as a percentage of sales remained relatively flat compared to the prior year. Consolidated operating income was $186 million compared to $162 million in the prior year, a 15% increase or 21% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Our EPS was $1.84 compared to $1.79 in the prior year, up 3% or 9% excluding FX. 
Now let me provide you with a few updates on capital allocation. Fiscal year-to-date, we have repurchased approximately 495,000 shares at a cost of $50 million. We have approximately $450 million remaining on our board-authorized share repurchase program. While our liquidity position continues to be strong, we have sufficient cash and access to our revolving credit facility to make the second payment for Symphony Teleca and to close the TowerSec acquisition, which we anticipate closing shortly. In light of current market conditions, we do expect to repurchase additional shares in the second half of this fiscal year. As Dinesh said earlier, we are on track to deliver on our revenue and earnings targets for our core business. Assuming our acquisition of TowerSec closes as expected over the next few weeks, it will be dilutive to earnings by approximately $0.05 as it is a bolt-on technology investment. Let me also remind you of the traditional seasonality in our businesses. Production tends to be slower in our fiscal third quarter, and the annual price reductions in the automotive businesses also occurs in this quarter. We also have a higher interest payments as a result of making the second payment on Symphony Teleca and closing the TowerSec acquisition. 
Overall, we are very pleased with our strong first-half results. Despite the foreign currency headwinds and broad macroeconomic uncertainty, we have performed well and are well positioned for continued growth in our core businesses. 
Thank you for your attention. Dinesh and I are now happy to take your questions."

In thinking about that deceleration though in organic growth from 1Q to 2Q, I'm curious if you could point to anything that could have caused that. So for example, a customer or segment mix shift that might have impacted you, maybe being more exposed to vehicles in China with over 1.6 liter engines not eligible for government tax incentives or something like. And then, was that deceleration always contemplated when you issued your full year guidance? I know you don't guide quarterly, but is there anything we should take into account when thinking about cadence through the rest of the year?"

China has started to turn the corner and we are seeing the production going up. But that's affecting qualitatively the very entry-level car and we will start to see some pickup for us in the second half, most likely I would say third and fourth quarter, more on fourth quarter as mid- and high-end cars start to come in. And we will also expect our second half is more back-loaded with SOPs and extensions. So we will also see that. So all in all, we guided 13% for the full year. We're running at 14% on a constant currency basis first half. We expect to meet our guidance, and we're very comfortable with that."

And what's working very well in tandem, as we have been saying for a number of years, that as you build the brand for consumers, high-end business, protocols and others, it is really helping us improve the take rate. So consumer business really performed extremely well, and you know us by now, we do not take this business sacrificing our bottom line. So Consumer business was holding up our expected profitability and still growing the top line and car audio basically is a very robust profitable business. It is growing $2 billion. Actually, $1 billion of that came from car audio, so now we have, as of last year fiscal close, we have 6 million -- $6.2 billion was in car audio backlog, now we have added another $1 billion. So for the revenue of a $1 billion dollars business, we are sitting with $7-plus billion high-margin business, I'm really excited. So this is how Connected Car will come alive, the more and more we are seeing audio, tuner, audio management, connectivity, safety, security and end-to-end services being pulled in. So all these new awards, they will not be placed based on single-point solutions, that you have this with that. In total solutions, we're bringing value.

We do have now over $2.2 billion of hedges in place that will run for the next several years, and for fiscal year '17, we also have about the same amount of hedges that we have in place for this year at a very constant rate. So I'd say overall, we're very pleased with the performance of our hedges and glad we have put them in on a long-term basis."

We guided the market for 13% growth in fiscal '16 over last year on a constant currency basis, and we are 14% year-to-date. And as I said, we reiterate that we will meet this, and we feel comfortable. In terms of breakdown of embedded infotainment system, if you look around all the cars, about 25% have full-blown embedded system, and 50% of the car -- let me go straight to the biggest opportunity area, the 50% of the cars are coming out either nothing, just a whole, or they take in some of the deal. That is a business which is turning into an opportunity for us. And either it will grow into a full embedded system or it will grow into -- we call it Display Audio. Display Audio would be a smart display unit, but it would allow the smart links like Baidu's CarLife, Apple's CarPlay, Google's Android -- Google Link -- Automotive Link and many others. So we are seeing the convergence, that 50%, and moving very fast into fully embedded with everything or into Display Audio. So -- and you also asked about our revenue. While we don't break out, majority of our business is mid-segment and high-end. We also do -- in all of these cars where customers are asking, we are integrating in both Google Link, CarPlay as well as Baidu's CarLife. We were actually the first company to integrate Baidu CarLife ever in the industry. So that is just on top of it. It is not in lieu of that. However, when I mentioned earlier to Brian's question, very many entry-level car in China being produced, they just don't have anything. So you might see the production from -- when you look at IHS or LMC report, production going up, but they don't have anything. Where we gain, when cars from Japan, Korea, China, United -- I mean, not China -- United States or Germany, when they are shipped to China or even produced there, there you will see our systems, whether it's entry system, medium system or high-end system."

We are running 14% right now, so we're happy. But we also keep in mind that Q3, which we are in, traditionally, as we -- that's hit with the annual price reductions, so that's already built into our guidance. And so that would have an impact, but we will meet or beat. Right now, we are saying we're going to meet our guidance for the margins. So that looks good. And the other part of the question was related to -- let's see. I'm just -- the churn levels, right, how is the development happening. Well, first of all, as you know very well, the high-end cars where we have very strong position worldwide, that's very high to begin with. So we rely on the production increase. As that grows, we will gain because not so much take rate improvement. The biggest take rate improvement is coming from mid-segment where we are a very strong player. In fact, majority of our backlog today is in mid-segment. Even if it is coming from general automakers, because they also make mid-segment cars, like X3 or BMW 3 Series or C-Class or what have you. So that all makes sense. Of course, Hyundai, we have Subaru Forester line. We have [indiscernible]. Then of course, the world's largest automaker who's also in Detroit, that's also, I would say, mostly mid-segment. Entry, we have also Parrot starting to penetrate either through entry systems or also Display Audio. So take -- majority of the take rate improvement, I would expect to come from mid-segment where the money is, and we will also play in entry, into this part of our existing customers, or to wherever is everybody else, like Subaru. So whether it's a cross-car line, they do every single car in every single geography. They're in high, they are in mid, they are in entry, and they also have some Display Audio type of arrangement. So we do all. So majority of the growth, to put it all together, is going to come from mid-segment."

So we go back to history, and we also do business in other parts of their business or product lines, so we are partners. And Google, we also go back 10 years either directly HARMAN systems as well as our services business, Connected Services. They are actually a very strong services partner for product development. And we are the member of Open Handset Alliance, we are the member of Open Automotive Alliance, and we are the only company to date doing a commercial-level development of Android-based hybrid infotainment system, which will be future-proof. You can personalize it. You can keep it up-to-date, current with 4G LTE built into it. So we are very happy with that. So experience-wise, I think they're learning a lot, something that you might have seen in terms of press release from one of the Bay Area company who was making a lot of headlines. They just had some headwinds and saw some freeze on hiring in automotive states. Well, we're all learning. The automotive industry is complex. We had been saying for a long time that it will require players like HARMAN with very comprehensive ecosystem knowledge and investing in innovation of cybersecurity, connectivity and also end-to-end services, plus credibility of delivering projects which have zero bug unlike the headsets or handsets we launched then with hundreds of bug in the system on a weekly basis. You can't do that. So with that said, I think automakers have renewed confidence in companies like HARMAN, and our orders speak for it. And as I said, I can just underscore what CES this year was. This was the best CES ever for HARMAN. We were tact with our customers, with our new customers. Some of them came twice. And with a lot of activity out there, we were very busy right now, and that's a good thing."

First, Dinesh, you haven't talked much about the Connected Services business, and we don't really know the seasonality of this. But to hit the guidance for the year, you would have to have significantly greater revenues in the second half than the first half. So is that something that we should expect on a seasonal basis? Second one, Sandy, you mentioned a little bit on FX, but can you remind us what the transactional FX headwind is to EBIT or EBITDA this year? And then your comments about a similar amount of hedges next year, does that mean that the headwind next year on FX, all else being equal, should be about the same as the headwind this year? Or does the headwind get worse or better next year? And then the last one, more strategic, Dinesh, so in the last few weeks, Ford clearly have gotten very aggressive, announcing at CES they're basically making infotainment standard on every car, and then I guess, AT&T announced a couple of days ago that they're going to embed LTE on every Ford vehicle. So we're seeing at least Ford take this from an option to something that's more standard fit. And obviously, that's not a big customer of your Connected Car business, but you kind of have the other 2 big U.S. manufacturers who are. So I'm wondering what you're hearing from them in terms of competitive response or kind of anything in the industry that you think maybe Ford could be a tipping point here to move that attach rate up significantly from the smaller increases we've seen the last couple of years."

The very first one was Connected Services business seasonality first half versus second half. Yes, this business has seasonality, and typically, second half in the business is stronger, and exactly, that's how we see it. We do carry a little bit of a backlog, but we do not report that. So the backlog which we report does not have anything to do with -- has nothing to do with services, but we track that backlog, we have it. So second half is stronger and will meet the guidance we have given you and we feel good about. It's growing actually. Then you asked -- you mentioned about customers in U.S. You mentioned Ford. You mentioned GM, AT&T. I actually see it very positively, to just validate what you said. This is where it's going, and that's why you might have seen us pushing full integration of telematics, and we're investing in telematics as well. And that's why we acquired Redbend because Redbend -- in Honda car actually, we will be -- and JLR actually, we'll be updating ECUs through telematics. And we're investing in telematics. We are doing second-generation telematics solution end to end for Daimler cars right now. So telematics will be big for us, and telematics will drive connectivity and higher penetration, whether we do telematics for someone else, but we have an offering, and we are investing. So I see it as a very important announcement coming from Ford. And by the way, you mentioned GM, that they have also announced that they have 4G LTE built into every single car. So I'm very pleased that automakers are recognizing and making the right investment to have the connectivity secure upfront. And once you have the secure conductivity in the car with OTA, we will be able to bring latest feature functionality even when the car has left the dealership and keep it current, update the firmware, software applications. Even people like you and I can personalize our experience. We can buy when we want what we want to buy. A lot of that is happening. So telematics is a big piece, and we are right in the middle of it."

And when I look forward out on our situation for fiscal year '17, yes, we have the same dollar value of hedges in place for both '16 in '17. So the variation will be we expect some growth in our business, but we also get productivity out of our suppliers. So those will have -- these would have offsetting impacts. And then the uncertainty is around, call it, the 25% that we don't hedge. This year, we're running right around the USD 1.10 to euro exchange rate that we had planned. It could be a higher rate next year, and then we see a tailwind. If it dips again, we see a headwind.

So it is true, when we acquired Redbend, they were already engaged with multiple Tier 1s like HARMAN and HARMAN's competitors. First, thing we did, I myself joined the incoming CEO to talk to various deal wins, to tell them that we will keep it at arm's length just like we did many years ago when we used to own QNX because this is an industry solution. We don't need to monopolize that, and we want everybody to benefit. And it's not just infotainment. It actually will update firmware, software on various other ECUs supplied by many other Tier 1s. And that is already happening and will happen, and I hope it will happen because it is by far the best over-the-air upgrade technology. Now coming back to monetization, it is -- it goes -- first of all, as I said, I reiterate we have booked $100 million worth of business. That is the old software. So when it starts to go to the bottom -- to the revenue conversion, it's a very high-margin business, as you would expect. In terms of how we charge, it is either licensing model. Sometimes it's a car license to the warranty as OEMs may want to have it all and with subscription. Sometimes it's a -- by model. So it's a different, different packaging as Redbend before we acquired had been doing. Right now, we are trying to streamline and also working with the major automakers when we have bigger opportunity, how do we sort of do create a model. It's a basically annuity stream. So recurring revenue will come once the Redbend is in there. It's a server as well as a client, which is in the fitting in the car, so just like anything which needs to be kept always alive and you get paid for. So we see a big opportunity because now you may start to get into a term that no one has talked yet. It's called data. Whoever manages the data is the big winner. We will manage data through our Connected Services division, and Redbend will provide the data exchange. So whether you have AT&T, Verizon, China Mobile, Vodafone, we'll provide the plumbing, and we are the mechanism for secure data exchange and updates of the data. So we will be having data, and that data will go to OEMs, to dealers for the diagnostics, for consumer behavior, to insurance companies, to wellness, health. So we will be doing that data management, so we feel very good about. And that's where Redbend is part of our Connected Services division, where we have our cloud management applications, we have our analytics division, very strong analytics engine. Combine that with Redbend, you've got a powerful services business, and that's where our services business is calling on HARMAN competitors as well as car companies directly."

All you could do, that we can say, look, HARMAN will start the package cybersecurity 5 plus 1 and including Redbend technology in every single new offering will come out from now on. And that will be priced in as a bundle. But that will be our differentiation, and that's the way I like to think you maintain price/performance ratio. You maintain -- going forward, you do not lose the pricing. You maintain the pricing power, but you keep adding features, feature functionality exponentially. So that said, you keep your margins and continue to build margin, and your leverage will give you the better margin. So we will go probably both ways. Some customers who do not do business with us from infotainment to car audio, they are already using our Redbend and cybersecurity technology. They will pay us on a license basis. Those who are buying complete system from us, it will be totally embedded, so they will get the whole offering, and we'll get paid for the system. And one more thing, you might have seen HARMAN has always commanded better price for our infotainment system in the industry, because we have always been on the cutting edge of technology, and this is cutting-edge.

We had $4.3 billion worth of infotainment awards and $1 billion -- $1.9 billion in car audio. So put it all together, that was like $6.2 billion, phenomenal, for a revenue of $4 billion. So we had a bumper year. You don't expect that here as we guided this year, that this year may not be because we always have visibility in RFQs and what orders will close. So for this year, we have $2 billion already in the bag. And that's -- the 50%, $1 billion, came from infotainment, and $1 billion came from car audio. And we're not done yet, you know that. So we are very happy with the development this year. It's actually on plan, slightly ahead of plan, in terms of order bookings."

And then my -- the second question I have, and I'm sort of struggling with this, infotainment revenues, Connected Car went down quarter-over-quarter. It seems like European production was up quarter-over-quarter, and North America was flat. And I'm sort of piggybacking on Ryan's question, but is there something unusual? I mean, are you guys like gearing the plants up for launches? Or is there something that you could provide a little bit more detail related to that?"

In fact, if you look at the global production, we guided, what, 3.5% for the whole world as a weighted average for all the regions. And we're pretty closely tracking global production. Even some puts and takes, it's the same. So we have seen, in China particularly, a slight softening for the high-end luxury cars, which is -- we believe, is a temporary shift or actually postponement of the purchases. That's the view of our car company, our customers. So they'll come back. I don't think it has anything to do with E.U. production going up or North America flat or declining. It's just to do with SOP timing, SOP expansion. Q1, we had pretty strong SOP launches and ramp-ups, and that we benefited. Now they are flat or still growing but -- so we are seeing some improvement, and Q3, Q4, we have a number of SOPs coming in. And that's why I said earlier that we will deliver on our guidance we gave in spite of some of the headwinds we are seeing in China or Russia in particular."

I will give you my view as I see, and this is by no means a guidance for any expectations.

I will give you my view as I see, and this is by no means a guidance for any expectations. Look, everybody talks about, whether it's IHS, whether it's LMC or customers, every research, that's 65%, 70% take rates. And obviously, whether it 's going to happen in 3 years or 5 years, so you're right, it's going to happen in 3 to 5 years, not going to be beyond 5 years. It's happening in that period. If that happens, right now, industry average this year is supposed to be around 27%, 28% take rates. So this number goes up to 65%, 70%. Guess who's going to benefit most? It's HARMAN because we are working with 9, 10 of the large OEMs, of the 15 sitting with $23 billion backlog plus $2 billion we have booked this year. That backlog is based on current take rates. So you could double that thing if take rates just double from 27%, 28% to 55% if the number goes up. That's why I get excited, in 3 to 5 years' time, potentially if everything goes well as the industry says, HARMAN could see our revenue doubling again. And that's why I said when I was in -- opening our new center, that is not our guidance because we don't know more than 1 year at a time. We only have visibility 1 year, but 5 years out, is it possible? You bet it's possible. Plus, I think another very important piece which will drive take rates is Connected Services. Currently, OEM is struggling with one thing: they don't know or they are not quite figuring out how to create the back-end connectivity to servers, the upload of data, the download of data, analytics, and make sense out of it. And that Connected Services piece, as I just wrote right after our acquisition, but that was a transformational move we made. And after that, few people have also thought of going in that direction. But there are not too many targets like Symphony Teleca. And so we're very excited about that. So I've been very optimistic. It's not my theory. I think it's the reality because embedded is here, embedded is winning the day, embedded is not pushing out Baidu, Apple and Android phones. They will also be integrated. But the way car industry is going is full embedded, and we will gain from that."

And we have clearly shown the last 4, 5 years, margin expansion, top line expansion and further growth. Whatever we have said, we have delivered. Our team is solid.

Our perfo",2623,"Thank you, Yijing, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I'm very pleased to report that earlier this morning, we released solid results for the second quarter. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, net sales increased 19% to $1.8 billion. Our performance on the top line again resulted in double-digit EBITDA growth. We expanded our operating margins and generated $225 million in EBITDA and reported earnings per share of $1.84. On a constant currency basis, EBITDA was up 20%, and earnings per share was up 9% compared to the prior year. This is now our 11th consecutive quarter of top and bottom line growth. 
Let me give you some additional color, specifically on Connected Car division. Q1 came in 19% top line on constant currency; Q2, 9%; first half, 14%. You may recall we guided you for 13% on constant currency, and we are up already ahead of our guidance, and we feel pretty good about our second half. It further gets validated, in fiscal '15, you may recall, we booked $6.2 billion worth of automotive orders. Year-to-date, we booked $2 billion, that is $8.2 billion of orders in the last 18 months. We never had any momentum like that, and I don't think anybody else had in the industry. Take rates are expanding, continue to expand and to expedite nonlinear take rate expansion, which we all are hoping and waiting to see soon. We have done some big moves transformation. We acquired Symphony Teleca for end-to-end connectivity services in the car. We acquired Redbend. We acquired TowerSec for cybersecurity because of there is no autonomous or connected car without cybersecurity, you should be asking that question to other people. No one is thinking about it. But we got strong vote of confidence from our automakers. At CES, everyone validated and we have tremendous enthusiasm. So I don't know what market's mood is, I'm feeling damn good. 
So with that, let me just go on to talk about other divisions. In our Consumer business, we had a very strong holiday season as a result of the growing consumer demand for our family of portable speakers, including the recently launched JBL Xtreme, JBL Flip 3, JBL Pulse 2, our expanded global distribution channels together with prime shelf space and marketing initiatives are paying huge dividends. In addition, our partnership with Media Markt in Germany and Fnac in France delivered very strong sales growth. You may recall we became the leading audio partner in Media Markt stores a year ago. 
In the automotive business, OEMs are rapidly investing in connected and autonomous car technology along with smart audio solutions. We are well positioned to capitalize on this demand. Take rates for connected car and car audio solutions continue to rise. At the end of fiscal '15, we had an industry-leading backlog of $23 billion. Since then, we have secured another $2 billion of new automotive awards year-to-date, and I'll remind this is a double-digit operating margin business. 
So before I dive into the details of the division, let me recap some of the headlines we made at CES earlier this month. As some of you know firsthand, our exhibit hall was packed, and this is a high-quality audience, strictly by invitation only with our current and potential customers, the entire 4 days of the show. It was great seeing so many of you at the investor event. HARMAN's innovations were standouts, earning a company-best and industry-best 13 CES Innovation Awards, America's Choice Award for our new co-branded JBL Under Armour headphones, which I will talk about in a minute, and a Best of CES Award for voice audio. HARMAN is partnering with the most innovative companies in the world. Our announcements with Google, Microsoft and Under Armour gained broad attention, and I'll go into the detail in a second. We also demonstrated HARMAN's newest technology for the connected and intelligent car, Life-Enhancing Intelligent Vehicle Solutions. We call it LIVS, L-I-V-S. HARMAN has integrated the industry's most complete end-to-end system to provide drivers intelligent, adaptable and personalized solution in the car. We have built a suite of integrated technologies encompassing not only infotainment, which includes navigation, multimedia and radio and television tuners, to now include telematics, safety and cybersecurity features on one compute platform. This compute platform is scalable and modular to allow OEMs and consumers maximum flexibility. Again, this is very forward-looking and strong validation from leading automakers. 
This is what we call LIVS. On top of that, we are the only supplier who can provide a full suite of connected services that leverage cloud and data analytics, increasingly becoming important for auto industry. We are all aware of the benefits of the connected car. At the same time, we cannot sacrifice security for functionality. To complete HARMAN's 5+1 security network, which is already the most comprehensive in the industry, we announced acquisition of TowerSec. TowerSec is a global automotive cybersecurity company specializing in network protection for connected vehicles. TowerSec's technology will be integrated into HARMAN's 5+1 security architecture aimed at protecting the critical points of vulnerability in the connected and autonomous car. We expect to close this transaction shortly. This will be our second Israeli-based cybersecurity acquisition. As a reminder, Redbend gave us 2 of the critical elements of the 5+1 architecture, the hypervisor layer and the over-the-air update technology, and now we brought in 2 TowerSec network protection control. 
Let me take a closer look at our divisions and review some recent notable achievements, starting with Connected Car division, which is highlighted on Slide 6 of our investor presentation. HARMAN launched embedded infotainment solutions on a number of new vehicle models, including the new Genesis luxury brand for Hyundai. The system is now available in Korea, onboard the Genesis EQ900, and will be available in Europe, North America by mid-2016. The Connected Car division also received follow-on business from Subaru. Our first award, if you remember, across car line, entry, mid- and high, worldwide, we received sometime earlier and it is expected to go in SOP mode in fiscal year 2017. Additionally, HARMAN announced a strategic partnership with Microsoft to bring new mobile and cloud-based services to the automotive market. That's a first for the industry. The first implementation of this partnership is to integrate key elements of the Microsoft Office 365 productivity suite. Working with Microsoft is a natural fit for HARMAN as we continue our track record of partnering to integrate the best solutions into cars for consumers. 
Now turning to the Lifestyle Audio division, which is starting to become my second favorite. Some of our recent notable achievements are highlighted on Slide 7 of the investor presentations. We had an extremely strong holiday season in consumer audio. As I mentioned earlier, we are experiencing phenomenal success with our award-winning line of portable speakers. On top of that, our headphones are also gaining momentum in the market. You may know, HARMAN is already #1 worldwide in the sports headphones. In November, HARMAN debuted the JBL Everest wireless headphones exclusively for the 3 largest consumer electronics retailers: Best Buy in the United States, Fnac in France and Media Markt in Germany. Our strategic partnership with Under Armour, fastest-growing apparel and health and wellness and fitness company, will bring to market new and meaningful innovations in the fast-growing connected health and connected fitness space. It's all about connectivity. At CES, we introduced our first 2 co-branded products, wireless headphones and the new JBL Under Armour Bluetooth headphones with heart rate monitoring. The heart rate headphones won a CES 2016 Editor's Choice Award. 
And now turning to car audio. Audio is an essential part of the connected car experience. It's no more than just having a great music experience. You need it for connectivity. An award-winning car audio solutions and powerful portfolio of brands continue to resonate with drivers, leading to another strong quarter of growth. It isn't hard to have a 20-plus percent EBIT margin business going up on a top line basis. HARMAN secured new car audio awards from Audi, BMW, Geely and Volvo, among others. In addition, HARMAN secured the first customer award for industry-first Individual Sound Zones technology. You might have seen that last year at our CES booth, and we have secured an order from a European OEM. That's a strong proof point of HARMAN's excellence in car audio engineering and product design. 
Our car audio solutions continue to expand across car lines globally. The Branded Audio solutions that launched during the quarter included Harley-Davidson Road Glide with Harman Kardon, Toyota Prius with JBL, Lexus GS with Mark Levinson and Hyundai Equus with Lexicon. As you may recall, last year, we acquired Bang & Olufsen's automotive audio business. And we have now integrated HARMAN technologies into the Bang & Olufsen product line. As a result, we're winning new awards and industry recognitions. We are also gaining traction with B&O PLAY, a second brand targeting the mass market. Our Bang & Olufsen's car audio solution in the Audi A7 -- or Q7, forgive me, won the best sound system Readers' Choice Award from Autobild in Germany. 
At CES, we showcased our new Summit Car audio platform, representing the pinnacle of car audio, addressing the growing demand for personalization and adaptability through flexible software solutions. This scalable platform integrates the best of HARMAN's sound processing and sound management technologies such as Quantum Logic Surround Sound, Individual Sound Zones and Clari-Fi, along with new features like Connected Jukebox and Virtual Venues, to create an unprecedented in-car audio experience for drivers. We also introduced the industry-first Infinity Voyager Drive, which seamlessly integrates Lifestyle Audio for the home, car and on the go. The Voyager Drive won the Best of CES Award -- I mean, Best of CES Award. With Summit and Voyager Drive, we now have scalable car audio platform, system-on-chip, total flexibility, modular and scalable that can serve an entire spectrum of the car audio market from high-end luxury to entry level. 
Now turning to Professional Solutions division, highlighted on Slide 8 of the investor presentation. During the quarter, we were selected by leading systems integrators and installers around the world. Some notable projects include the Dubai Opera House, Newport Naval Station, the USC School of Business and ESPN Studios in Mexico City. HARMAN's products also followed a wide range of events including New Year's Eve in Times Square and the World AIDS Day concert in Carnegie Hall.  Division launched our 12 new major products during the quarter, several of which were recognized by industry associations. 
Now let me update you on the 2 important strategic initiatives we are implementing in this division to take the performance to a whole new level. First, our go-to-market approach. On October 1, our sales structure was realigned to better capitalize on our unique end-to-end solution including audio, video, lighting and control of enterprise and control systems for enterprise segment and entertainment segments. With this new structure, we are better positioned to bring complete and tailored solutions to different vertical markets. This is happening. It takes a little bit of a time to adjust with our distributors and master dealers and reps, but it's going very well. And I personally visited many of the customers' end points. Second initiative, we are on track to complete our plans to improve our European manufacturing footprints, which will significantly bring our costs down. We are consolidating our professional product manufacturing centers in Denmark and the U.K. into a single, more cost-efficient Hungarian facility. The first of those consolidation was completed in December, while the second one is well underway and expected to be fully operational by end of March. That is right on plan. As I mentioned previously, we expect to realize the full benefit from these strategic initiatives in our fiscal 2017. 
Now turning to the Connected Services division, highlighted on Slide 9 of the investor presentation. During the quarter, HARMAN began providing software product development services to new customers, including InterDigital and Reliance Jio. Connected Services also secured follow-on business from Nielsen, Polycom, Renault in Renault car company and Dealertrack, also the major automotive dealer network in the United States, now that is part of Cox Automotive. In addition, we continued building the backlog for our industry-leading OTA software update technology, winning awards with Honda in Japan, Jaguar Land Rover, et cetera. Our OTA solutions are not only updating infotainment systems, but also other non-HARMAN ECUs in the car. In the case of Jaguar Land Rover, we'll be updating the telematics control unit of ECU. As you can see, we're gaining momentum with our OTA business. Building with our success with Daimler and Subaru in automotive and KDDI in mobile in Japan, we now have secured over $100 million worth of OTA business over the last 12 months and expect to continue this momentum. This is again a very pleasant news for us, and that's exactly what we expected. 
During the quarter, Connected Services was recognized as a top global R&D services provider by the respected advisory firm, Zinnov. Zinnov placed HARMAN in the Leadership Zone, the highest category across multiple industry verticals. In addition, several of HARMAN's aftermarket products won CES Innovation Awards, including the JBL Legend, Infinity K5, JBL Smartbase and JBL Trip. At CES, we showcased our cloud-based end-to-end service delivery platform for the connected car. This platform allows automakers and service providers to introduce and easily deploy new enterprise cloud services to connected vehicles. With our service delivery platform, HARMAN will partner with OEMs to provide a number of new service offerings, including updating existing features and adding new software features after the car has being sold. Connecting vehicle data to predict part failures, forecasting for preventative maintenance and enabling OEMs and dealers to address software issues in the field more efficiently without making a major recall. This industry first service delivery platform, and I repeat, this is the industry's first service delivery platform, addresses the existing and future demands for scalability, security and flexibility in the provisioning of connected car services for automakers and their customers. 
Additionally, Google selected HARMAN to be the first system integration partner for Brillo, its Android-based IoT developer platform. Google also selected HARMAN as the first partner for Weave, Google's communications protocol for IoT devices. This positions HARMAN as the technology partner of choice for device manufacturers to design and develop products for a range of key IoT applications, serving the smart home, consumer, automotive and enterprise segments. Let me remind you, our collaboration with Google spans over a decade, from the development and scaling of Android-based ecosystem across mobile devices and consumer equipment as a member of the Open Handset Alliance to automotive, as a member of Google's Open Automotive Alliance, and now IoT. Our partnership with market leaders like Microsoft and Google will allow us to expand our customer base across automotive, mobile and communications and enterprise. 
In summary, I am extremely pleased with our strong financial results for the first half, which are in line with our expectations. As you would expect, we are closely monitoring recent macroeconomic headwinds, but at this point, we are on track to deliver on our full year plan. In addition, we are seeing good momentum in building our backlog. Finally, I am energized by our continued innovation. That has been differentiating HARMAN from anybody else. In addition, several of HARMAN's other initiatives, which are in place. Innovation and the strong partnerships that we have formed this year, that will drive further growth. All of these factors position HARMAN for sustainable long-term growth. 
Now I will turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Sandy Rowland, who will give you additional color on our financial results for the quarter."

Let me walk you through our financial highlights for the quarter. As a reminder, most of my financial remarks are provided on an operational basis, which excludes restructuring, nonrecurring and acquisition-related items. I want to point out that the majority of the difference between our GAAP and operational results is due to the noncash amortization of intangible assets recognized as a result of our recent acquisitions. The full reconciliation of our GAAP to operational results is included in the press release that we issued this morning.
This quarter, our revenues were $1.8 billion, an increase of 12% compared to the prior year or 19% excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and FX, our net sales increased 12%. Revenue in our Connected Car division increased 2% versus the prior year or 9% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. The increase in net sales was due to higher take rates, stronger automotive production and the expansion of recently launched platforms. 
Revenue in our Lifestyle Audio division increased 20% compared to the prior year or 26% excluding foreign exchange. The increase in net sales was primarily due to new product introductions and expanded global distribution channels in consumer audio. In our car audio business, the increase in sales was driven by the acquisition of the Bang & Olufsen car audio business and higher take rates. 
Revenue in our Professional Solutions division decreased 7% compared to the prior year or 4% excluding foreign exchange, mainly due to weakness in emerging markets, particularly Brazil and Russia. Revenue in our Connected Services division was $170 million in the quarter compared to $74 million a year ago. The increase in revenue was primarily due to the expansion of our services portfolio as a result of the acquisition of Symphony Teleca. Total company gross margin increased 60 basis points to 30.8%. The improvement was primarily due to improved leverage of fixed costs as a result of higher sales volume as well as the expansion of our services portfolio. Connected Car gross margin increased 60 basis points to 25%, primarily due to better leverage of fixed costs and lower warranty costs. Lifestyle Audio gross margin increased 50 basis points to 32.7%, primarily due to improved operating leverage as a result of higher sales volume. Professional Solutions gross margin increased 100 basis points to 41.4%, driven by lower manufacturing expenses. And Connected Services gross margins were 33.2%. 
Our SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales increased 30 basis points from the prior year to 20.3% due to higher investments in research and development. Connected Car SG&A declined 30 basis points to 13%, and Lifestyle Audio SG&A decreased 110 basis points to 18.2%, both due to improved operating leverage on higher sales. SG&A expense in Professional Solutions increased 190 basis points to 29.9% due to lower sales volume. Connected Services SG&A as a percentage of sales was 22.2%. And finally, corporate SG&A as a percentage of sales remained relatively flat compared to the prior year. Consolidated operating income was $186 million compared to $162 million in the prior year, a 15% increase or 21% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Our EPS was $1.84 compared to $1.79 in the prior year, up 3% or 9% excluding FX. 
Now let me provide you with a few updates on capital allocation. Fiscal year-to-date, we have repurchased approximately 495,000 shares at a cost of $50 million. We have approximately $450 million remaining on our board-authorized share repurchase program. While our liquidity position continues to be strong, we have sufficient cash and access to our revolving credit facility to make the second payment for Symphony Teleca and to close the TowerSec acquisition, which we anticipate closing shortly. In light of current market conditions, we do expect to repurchase additional shares in the second half of this fiscal year. As Dinesh said earlier, we are on track to deliver on our revenue and earnings targets for our core business. Assuming our acquisition of TowerSec closes as expected over the next few weeks, it will be dilutive to earnings by approximately $0.05 as it is a bolt-on technology investment. Let me also remind you of the traditional seasonality in our businesses. Production tends to be slower in our fiscal third quarter, and the annual price reductions in the automotive businesses also occurs in this quarter. We also have a higher interest payments as a result of making the second payment on Symphony Teleca and closing the TowerSec acquisition. 
Overall, we are very pleased with our strong first-half results. Despite the foreign currency headwinds and broad macroeconomic uncertainty, we have performed well and are well positioned for continued growth in our core businesses. 
Thank you for your attention. Dinesh and I are now happy to take your questions."

In thinking about that deceleration though in organic growth from 1Q to 2Q, I'm curious if you could point to anything that could have caused that. So for example, a customer or segment mix shift that might have impacted you, maybe being more exposed to vehicles in China with over 1.6 liter engines not eligible for government tax incentives or something like. And then, was that deceleration always contemplated when you issued your full year guidance? I know you don't guide quarterly, but is there anything we should take into account when thinking about cadence through the rest of the year?"

China has started to turn the corner and we are seeing the production going up. But that's affecting positively the very entry-level car and we will start to see some pickup for us in the second half, most likely I would say third and fourth quarter, more in fourth quarter as mid- and high-end cars start to come in. And we will also expect our second half is more back-loaded with SOPs and expansion. So we will also see that. So all in all, we guided 13% for the full year. We're running at 14% on a constant currency basis first half. We expect to meet our guidance, and we're very comfortable with that."

And what's working very well in tandem, as we have been saying for a number of years, that as you build the brand for consumers, high-end business, protocols and others, it is really helping us improve the take rate. So consumer business really performed extremely well, and you know us by now, we do not take business sacrificing our bottom line. So Consumer business was holding up our expected profitability and still growing the top line and car audio basically is a very robust profitable business. It is growing -- on $2 billion, actually, $1 billion of that came from car audio, so now we have, as of last year fiscal close, we have 6 million -- $6.2 billion was in car audio backlog, now we have added another $1 billion. So for the revenue of a $1 billion dollars business, we are sitting with $7-plus billion high-margin business, I'm really excited. So this is how Connected Car will come alive, the more and more we are seeing audio, tuner, audio management, connectivity, safety, security and end-to-end services being pulled in. So all these new awards, they will not be placed based on single-point solutions, that you have this with that. In total solutions, we're bringing value.

We guided the market for 13% growth in fiscal '16 over last year on a constant currency basis, and we are 14% year-to-date. And as I said, we reiterate that we will meet this, and we feel comfortable. In terms of breakdown of embedded infotainment system, if you look around all the cars, about 25% have full-blown embedded system, and 50% of the car -- let me go straight to the biggest opportunity area, the 50% of the cars are coming out either nothing, just a hole, or basic AM/FM radio. That is a business which is turning into an opportunity for us. And either it will grow into a full embedded system or it will grow into -- we call it Display Audio. Display Audio would be a smart display unit, but it would allow the smart links like Baidu's CarLife, Apple's CarPlay, Google's Android -- Google Link -- Automotive Link and many others. So we are seeing the convergence, that 50%, and moving very fast into fully embedded with everything or into Display Audio. 
So -- and you also asked about our revenue. While we don't break out, majority of our business is mid-segment and high-end. We also do -- in all of these cars where customers are asking, we are integrating Android Google Link, CarPlay as well as Baidu's CarLife. We were actually the first company to integrate Baidu CarLife ever in the industry. So that is just on top of it. It is not in lieu of that. However, when I mentioned earlier to Brian's question, very many entry-level car in China being produced, they just don't have anything. So you might see the production from -- when you look at IHS or LMC report, production going up, but they don't have anything. Where we gain, when cars from Japan, Korea, China, United -- I mean, not China -- United States or Germany, when they are shipped to China or even produced there, there you will see our systems, whether it's entry system, medium system or high-end system."

We are running 14% right now, so we're happy. But we also keep in mind that Q3, which we are in, traditionally every year gets hit with the annual price reductions, so that's already built into our guidance. And so that would have an impact, but we will meet or beat. Right now, we are saying we're going to make our guidance for the margins. So that looks good. 
And the other part of the question was related to -- let's see. I'm just -- the churn levels, right, how is the development happening. Well, first of all, as you know very well, the high-end cars where we have very strong position worldwide, that's pretty high to begin with. So we rely on the production increase. As that grows, we will gain because not so much take rate improvement. The biggest take rate improvement is coming from mid-segment where we are a very strong player. In fact, majority of our backlog today is in mid-segment. Even if it is coming from German automakers, because they also make mid-segment cars, like X3 or BMW 3 Series or C-Class or what have you. So that all mid-segment. Of course, Hyundai, we have Subaru across car line. We have Fiat Chrysler very strong account and of course, the world's largest automaker who's also in Detroit, that's also, I would say, mostly mid-segment. 
Entry, we have also -- starting to penetrate either through entry systems or also Display Audio. So take -- majority of the take rate improvement, I would expect to come from mid-segment where the money is, and we will also play in entry, into this part of our existing customers, or to wherever is everybody else, like Subaru. Subaru is across car line, they do every single car in every single geography. They're in high, they are in mid, they are in entry, and they also have some Display Audio type of arrangement. So we do all. So majority of the growth, to put it all together, is going to come from mid-segment."

And Google, we also go back 10 years either directly HARMAN systems as well as our services business, Connected Services. They are actually a very strong services partner for product development. And you know we are the member of Open Handset Alliance, we are the member of Open Automotive Alliance, and we are the only company to date doing a commercial-level development of Android-based hybrid infotainment system, which will be future-proof. You can personalize it. You can keep it up-to-date, current with 4G LTE built into it. So we are very happy with that. So experience-wise, I think they're learning a lot, something that you might have seen in terms of press release from one of the Bay Area company who was making a lot of headlines. They just had some headwinds and saw some freeze on hiring in automotive space. Well, we're all learning. The automotive industry is complex. We had been saying for a long time that it will require players like HARMAN with very comprehensive ecosystem knowledge and investing in innovation of cybersecurity, connectivity and also end-to-end services, plus credibility of delivering projects which have zero bug unlike the headsets or handsets we launched then with hundreds of bug and we fix them on a weekly basis. You can't do that. So with that said, I think automakers have renewed confidence in companies like HARMAN, and our orders speak for it. And as I said, I can just underscore what CES this year was. This was the best CES ever for HARMAN. We were packed with our customers, with our new customers. Some of them came twice. And with a lot of activity out there, we were very busy right now, and that's a good thing."

First, Dinesh, you haven't talked much about the Connected Services business, and we don't really know the seasonality of this. But to hit the guidance for the year, you would have to have significantly greater revenues in the second half than the first half. So is that something that we should expect on a seasonal basis? .
Second one, Sandy, you mentioned a little bit on FX, but can you remind us what the transactional FX headwind is to EBIT or EBITDA this year? And in your comments about a similar amount of hedges next year, does that mean that the headwind next year on FX, all else being equal, should be about the same as the headwind this year? Or does the headwind get worse or better next year? 
And then the last one, more strategic, Dinesh, so in the last few weeks, Ford clearly have gotten very aggressive, announcing at CES they're basically making infotainment standard on every car, and then I guess, AT&T announced a couple of days ago that they're going to embed LTE on every Ford vehicle. So we're seeing at least Ford take this from an option to something that's more standard fit. And obviously, that's not a big customer of your Connected Car business, but you kind of have the other 2 big U.S. manufacturers who are. So I'm wondering what you're hearing from them in terms of competitive response or kind of anything in the industry that you think maybe Ford could be a tipping point here to move that attach rate up significantly from the smaller increases we've seen the last couple of years."

The very first one was Connected Services business seasonality first half versus second half. Yes, this business has seasonality, and typically, second half in the business is stronger, and exactly, that's how we see it. We do carry a little bit of a backlog, but we do not report that. So the backlog which we report does not have anything to do with -- has nothing to do with services, but we track that backlog, we have it. So second half is stronger and will make the guidance we have given you and we feel good about. It's growing actually. 
Then you asked -- you mentioned about customers in U.S. You mentioned Ford. You mentioned GM, AT&T. I actually see it very positively, to just validate what you said. This is where it's going, and that's why you might have seen us pushing full integration of telematics, and we're investing in telematics as well. And that's why we acquired Redbend because Redbend -- in Honda car actually, we will be -- and JLR actually, we'll be updating ECUs through telematics. And we're investing in telematics. We are doing second-generation telematics solution end to end for Daimler cars right now. So telematics will be big for us, and telematics will drive connectivity and higher penetration, whether we do telematics for someone else, but we have an offering, and we are investing. So I see it as a very important announcement coming from Ford. And by the way, you mentioned GM, that they have also announced that they have 4G LTE built into every single car. So I'm very pleased that automakers are recognizing and making the right investment to have the connectivity secure upfront. And once you have the secure conductivity in the car with OTA, we will be able to bring latest feature functionality even when the car has left the dealership and keep it current, update the firmware, software applications. Even people like you and I can personalize our experience. We can buy when we want what we want to buy. A lot of that is happening. So telematics is a big piece, and we are right in the middle of it."

So the variation will be we expect some growth in our business, but we also get productivity out of our suppliers. So those will be sort of offsetting impacts. And then the uncertainty is around, call it, the 25% that we don't hedge. This year, we're running right around the $1.10 to euro exchange rate that we had planned. It could be a higher rate next year, and then we see a tailwind. If it dips again, we see a headwind.

It's a great one. It is emerging, and I'll tell you where we are. So it is true, when we acquired Redbend, they were already engaged with multiple Tier 1s like HARMAN and HARMAN's competitors. First, thing we",498,"Chris, first of all, thank you for joining us. It's a great one. It is emerging, and I'll tell you where we are. So it is true, when we acquired Redbend, they were already engaged with multiple Tier 1s like HARMAN and HARMAN's competitors. First, thing we did, I myself joined the incoming CEO to talk to various deal wins, to tell them that we will keep it at arm's length just like we did many years ago when we used to own QNX because this is an industry solution. We don't need to monopolize that, and we want everybody to benefit. And it's not just infotainment. It actually will update firmware, software on various other ECUs supplied by many other Tier 1s. And that is already happening and will happen, and I hope it will happen because it is by far the best over-the-air upgrade technology. Now coming back to monetization, it is -- it goes -- first of all, as I said, I reiterate we have booked $100 million worth of business. That is all software. So when it starts to go to the bottom -- to the revenue conversion, it's a very high-margin business, as you would expect. In terms of how we charge, it is either licensing model. Sometimes it's a car license to the warranty as OEMs may want to have it all and with subscription. Sometimes it's a -- by model. So it's a different, different packaging as Redbend before we acquired had been doing. Right now, we are trying to streamline and also working with the major automakers when we have bigger opportunity, how do we sort of do create a model. It's a basically annuity stream. So recurring revenue will come once the Redbend is in there. It's a server as well as a client, which is in the fitting in the car, so just like anything which needs to be kept always alive and you get paid for. So we see a big opportunity because now you may start to get into a term that no one has talked yet. It's called data. Whoever manages the data is the big winner. We will manage data through our Connected Services division, and Redbend will provide the data exchange. So whether you have AT&T, Verizon, China Mobile, Vodafone, they'll provide the plumbing, and we are the mechanism for secure data exchange and updates of the data. So we will be having data, and that data will go to OEMs, to dealers for the diagnostics, for consumer behavior, to insurance companies, to wellness, health. So we will be doing that data management, so we feel very good about. And that's where Redbend is part of our Connected Services division, where we have our cloud management applications, we have our analytics division, very strong analytics engine. Combine that with Redbend, you've got a powerful services business, and that's where our services business is calling on HARMAN competitors as well as car companies directly."

One attempt -- one way we can do is to have a per car basis charge for 5+1 cybersecurity framework we have because we believe that's a total solution, most comprehensive. So you can price it, and carmakers will pay for it without a doubt. We are already seeing that. Or you could do, that we can say, look, HARMAN will start the package cybersecurity 5+1 and, including Redbend technology, in every single new offering will come out from now on. And that will be priced in as a bundle. But that will be our differentiation, and that's the way I like to think you maintain price/performance ratio. You maintain -- going forward, you do not lose the pricing. You maintain the pricing power, but you keep adding features, feature functionality exponentially. So that said, you keep your margins and continue to build margin, and your leverage will give you the better margin. So we will go probably both ways. Some customers who do not do business with us from infotainment to car audio, they are already using our Redbend and cybersecurity technology. They will pay us on a license basis. Those who are buying complete system from us, it will be totally embedded, so they will get the whole offering, and we'll get paid for the system. And one more thing, you might have seen HARMAN has always commanded better price for our infotainment system in the industry, because we have always been on the cutting edge of technology, and this is cutting-edge. So when you start to price it in, we'll continue to have better pricing."

As you know very well, auto orders are never smooth on a quarterly basis or even year-over-year basis. Last year was a jumbo year, I call it. We had $4.3 billion worth of infotainment awards and $1 billion -- $1.9 billion in car audio. So put it all together, that was like $6.2 billion, phenomenal, for a revenue of $4 billion. So we had a bumper year. You don't expect that year every year, and we guided this year, that this year may not be because we always have visibility in RFQs and what orders will close. So for this year, we have $2 billion already in the bag. And that's -- the 50%, $1 billion, came from infotainment, and $1 billion came from car audio. And we're not done yet, you know that. So we are very happy with the development this year. It's actually on plan, slightly ahead of plan, in terms of order bookings."

So we have seen, in China particularly, a slight softening for the high-end luxury cars, which is -- we believe, is a temporary shift or actually postponement of the purchases. That's the view of our car company, our customers. So they'll come back. I don't think it has anything to do with E.U. production going up or North America flat or declining. It's just to do with SOP timing, SOP expansion. Q1, we had pretty strong SOP launches and ramp-ups, and that we benefited. Now they are flat or still growing but -- so we are seeing some improvement, and Q3, Q4, we have a number of SOPs coming in.

I will give you my view as I see, and this is by no means a guidance for any expectations. Look, everybody talks about, whether it's IHS, whether it's LMC or customers, every research, that's 65%, 70% take rates in out years, whether it's going to happen in 3 years or 5 years, so you're right, it's going to happen in 3 to 5 years, it's not going to be beyond 5 years. It's happening in that period. If that happens, right now, industry average this year is supposed to be around 27%, 28% take rates. So this number goes up to 65%, 70%. Guess who's going to benefit most? It's HARMAN because we are working with 9, 10 of the large OEMs, of the 15 sitting with $23 billion backlog plus $2 billion we have booked this year. That backlog is based on current take rates. So you could double that thing if take rates just double from 27%, 28% to 55% if the number goes up. That's why I get excited, in 3 to 5 years' time, potentially if everything goes well as the industry says, HARMAN could see our revenue doubling again. And that's why I said when I was in -- opening our new center, that is not our guidance because we don't know more than 1 year at a time. We only have visibility 1 year, but 5 years out, is it possible? You bet it's possible. Plus, I think another very important piece which will drive take rates is Connected Services. Currently, OEM is struggling with one thing: they don't know or they have not quite figured out how to create the back-end connectivity to servers, the upload of data, the download of data, analytics, and make sense out of it. And that Connected Services piece, as IHS wrote right after our acquisition, that that was a transformational move we made. And after that, few people have also thought of going in that direction. But there are not too many targets like Symphony Teleca. And so we're very excited about that. So I have been very optimistic. It's not my theory. I think it's the reality because embedded is here, embedded is winning the day, embedded is not pushing out, by the way, Apple and Android phones. They will also be integrated. But the way car industry is going is full embedded, and we will gain from that."

This morning, we reported our 12th consecutive quarter of top and bottom line growth and delivered an impressive 26% year-over-year improvement in EBITDA. However, the results across the divisions",2062,"Thank you, Yijing, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. This morning, we reported our 12th consecutive quarter of top and bottom line growth and delivered an impressive 26% year-over-year improvement in EBITDA. However, the results across the divisions were mixed. Our Connected Car and Lifestyle Audio businesses continued to perform well, and I'm extremely excited about the new award we have secured, particularly a breakthrough infotainment award for the entry market in the display/audio category. I'll provide additional color on this in a minute. 
At the same time, we continue to face some macroeconomic and transitional challenges in our Professional Solutions and Connected Services divisions. We have already decisive steps in our Professional Solutions division to better position us for growth and improve our cost structure. We are confident that we are taking the right actions to put us on a path for future growth in Professional Solutions and to restore margins to historic high levels of profitability. 
For the total company, net sales increased 11% to $1.6 billion. Our performance on the top line and rigorous cost-improvement efforts resulted in strong double-digit EBITDA. We expected -- we expanded our operating margins and generated $198 million in EBITDA -- I repeat, $189 million in EBITDA, again, an increase of 26% and reported earnings per share of $1.36. EPS was up 11% compared to the prior year. The overall results in our 2 largest divisions, representing 75% of our company's revenue that is Connected Car and Lifestyle Audio, were strong. Typically, our third quarter has the weakest margin in our automotive businesses. However, we were able to better align the timing of savings from our supplier base with the timing of annual price reductions. On top of that, our quality initiatives helped to reduce warranty expense, and we realized further leverage and scale in our automotive businesses. 
When you put together additional measures we have shown with operational excellence, including procurement, savings and quality with greater scale, the result is an over 200 basis point expansion in EBITDA margin. While I'm very encouraged by our performance on the bottom line, the top line and Connected Car was lighter than the anticipated. As the quarter unfolded, certain customers shifted out production schedules to allow dealers to adjust inventory levels. Let me be very clear. We're not seeing any dropoff in take rates. In fact, demand for embedded solutions continue to gain traction. 
During the quarter, I spent a number of weeks discussing connected car technology with top executives at our OEM customer base here in North America, Germany, Japan and China. This is one common theme we always heard that they all emphasized the absolute requirement for an embedded solutions that delivers a seamless, secure and personalized in vehicle experience. They look to HARMAN as a proven partner, and we are delivering on these increasing demands, with the most robust compute platform for embedded infotainment systems as well as unrivaled portfolio of audio brands and sound management solutions. 
At the end of fiscal 2015, we had an industry-leading backlog of $23 billion, and we have secured $3.5 billion of new automotive awards year-to-date. This is on top of the record $6.2 billion of new awards we announced last fiscal year. That's almost $10 billion of new automotive awards over the last 7 quarters. I think that's clearly indicating a strong momentum towards what the team we have been saying for a number of years. 
I want to take a moment to remind you about the evolving nature of the infotainment market. At our Investor Day last August, you may recall we spoke about how the market breaks down. Roughly 25% of car produced today have an embedded infotainment solution. This is where we are already the market leader. Another 25% of the cars produced today have a display audio solution, which you can think of as a connector radio, but without any onboard navigation capabilities. The remaining 50% of the market ships from the factory with either a simple AM/FM radio or with no radio at all. We agree with industry experts and automakers that this 50% of the market will migrate upward to embedded solutions. HARMAN has been developing solutions for both of these categories. And for those of you who have attended CES or the Geneva Auto Show will know that HARMAN offers scalable platform solutions that cover the full range of automobile classes, from luxury to entry models. That's why I'm so pleased to share the news with you today that we have received our first major infotainment award in the display audio category. This win is significant for us for 2 reasons: First, the customer is new to HARMAN in the connected car category, and the award is a competitive replacement; secondly, this will underscores HARMAN's ability to effectively address multiple segments of the global market to our scalable platform strategy. 
Notwithstanding the good work and the progress in our Connected Car and Lifestyle Audio divisions, we did experience challenges in the performance of our other 2 businesses. First, in our Professional Solutions division. Brazil and certain European markets continue to be soft. In addition, we have been rationalizing our channels to support the transition from a product-based approach to a solutions-based, go-to-market strategy. Last October, we introduced the structure, focusing particularly on end-to-end solutions for targeted vertical segments within enterprise and entertainment markets. To accomplish this, we have put considerable effort in aligning our internal resources, training or replacing our sales team, along with the distribution channel partners they work through. We absolutely believe this is the right structure. However, it is a complex change and it takes time. While I'm not satisfied with this performance or the timeline, I believe we have built the strongest portfolio in the industry. Our total solution approach allows us to cross-sell audio, lighting, radio switching and enterprise automation. 
On the cost side, we did complete the consolidation of our European manufacturing locations into single best-cost facility in Hungary. While the migration of 2 high-cost sites in Europe took an additional quarter to complete due to complexities of European labor laws, the plant in Hungary is now fully operational, manufacturing both mixers and lighting products. We expect to realize the benefits from these actions during fiscal year 2017.
In our Connected Services division, there are 2 factors impacting our top line. First, the aftermarket audio business that we moved from our Lifestyle division has a large exposure in Brazil and Russia. Second, in our engineering services business, we have been prioritizing our own mediation on strategic customers with the highest growth opportunities in the verticals where we have competitive advantage, specifically, automotive, mobile and communications and enterprise. That is really at the expense of short-term revenue. We're walking away from smaller accounts that do not have the ability to scale up. On top of that, we're investing in over-the-air update technology that we acquired from Redbend at an accelerated rate. Over-the-air updates is the foundation technology for the connected car, allowing automakers to quickly enable new features, fix bugs, upgrade firmware and offer a rich suite of end-to-end services. 
The legacy Symphony Teleca business we acquired continues to generate margins in the mid-teens, which is in line with our expectations.
As a result of some of these headwinds, particularly in our Professional Solutions division as well as the impact from the earthquake in Japan, we are modestly revising our full year guidance. Our Chief Financial Officer, Sandy Rowland, will provide you with a more detailed walk in our remarks. 
Let me take a closer look at our divisions and review some recent notable achievements. Let's start with our Connected Car division, which is highlighted on Slide 7 of our investor presentation. In Connected Car, we continue to expand and diversify our customer base and act to our industry-leading backlog. In addition to the new display audio infotainment award I mentioned earlier, we won a new global platform expansion award for a European automaker to support higher take rates as well as a platform refresh for their 2017 vehicles. 
In addition, we received a follow-on award to expand the next-generation integrated telematics program for Daimler. HARMAN launched embedded infotainment solutions in number of new vehicles from leading car companies, including Audi, Volkswagen Group's Fiat and Fiat Chrysler automotive group's Maserati. In Japan, HARMAN launched an embedded infotainment system from Suzuki, featuring Apple CarPlay. We also launched model refreshes and line extensions, featuring our embedded infotainment solutions in several Porsche and Mercedes-Benz vehicles. In March, we completed the acquisition of TowerSec. The leading automotive cybersecurity solutions will be integrated into HARMAN's 5+1 cybersecurity framework. The acquisitions we have made, including Redbend, OTA, best positions HARMAN to be leader in automotive cybersecurity and truly connected car.
Now turning to the Lifestyle Audio division. Some of our recent notable achievements are highlighted on Slide 8 of the investor presentation. During the quarter, we secured new car audio awards from Lincoln, Toyota and Subaru. We also launched Harman Kardon and Bowers & Wilkins-branded solutions with Fiat Chrysler automotives Maserati and Alpha Romeo, level-branded solutions with Lincoln and JBL solutions with Ferrari. In March, we inaugurated new global product development center in Suzhou, China. The facility is now our largest comprehensive R&D center for car audio products worldwide. HARMAN is the only car audio supplier to have full value-chain capabilities in China, including sourcing, R&D, engineering, production, technical support and distribution. And this will pay off big time in long run.
Turning to consumer audio. I'm pleased to share that HARMAN's award-winning AKG active noise-canceling headphones will replace both on all of Lufthansa business-class seats around the world. This new and strategic multiyear agreement with Lufthansa begins in September 2016. 
Finally, I should note that our consumer audio products were again recognized for their excellence in design and innovation, winning a record 23 Red Dot awards. Ladies and gentlemen, I remind you, consumer audio tightly support our car audio growth, and we are seeing them in tandem. And this is a great news for the company and our shareholders.
Now turning to the Professional Solutions division, highlighted on Slide 9 of the investor presentation. During the quarter, new enterprise installations included NFL Stadium in Tampa Bay, a new ship for Norwegian Cruise lines, and corporate facilities across the globe for eBay and Societe Generale. Our solutions also powered the Super Bowl 50 halftime show and 58th Annual Grammy Awards and several artists concert tours. 
Now turning to the Connected Services division, highlighted on Slide 10 of the investor presentation. During the quarter, we secured follow-on business to provide product development services for Blackberry, Dell, Intel, British Telecom and Sony, among others. HARMAN continues to strengthen its partnership with Google in device management, software certification and system integration. In addition, HARMAN continued to capitalize on its industry-leading OTA software update technology, winning a cross car line award with a global automaker. I'm extremely pleased to share with you now our backlog of OTA awards is just over $150 million, and this is all software business. We are winning very rapidly in the space. 
In conjunction with our services delivery platform, we introduced our automotive service provider program. This will facilitate the integration of a variety of enterprise and vehicle-centric applications and services from leading providers for OEMs. We added 10 new data, workflow and content service providers for our open platform, which enables automakers to provide a wide range of context-based services, including real-time traffic and location-based services. Let me remind you that our service delivery platform and our partnership program are the first of their kind in the industry. We're defining the cloud-based end-to-end service delivery platform for the connected car industry. In addition, HARMAN received recognition for its software engineering services capabilities from respected advisory firm, including and HFS.
In summary, I'm pleased with the performance of our Connected Car and Lifestyle Audio divisions, and I'm also encouraged by the trends in the industry and the new business we have secured. Where we face challenges, we're taking aggressive actions. We will continue to focus on relentless execution across all of our divisions to deliver above market top and bottom line growth. 
Now I will turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Sandy Rowland, who will give you additional color on our financial results for the quarter."

Let me walk you through our financial highlights for the quarter. As a reminder, most of my financial remarks are provided on an operational basis, which excludes restructuring, nonrecurring and acquisition-related items. I want to point out that the majority of the difference between our GAAP and operational results is due to the noncash amortization of intangible assets recognized as a result of our recent acquisitions. The full reconciliation of our GAAP to our operational results is included in the press release that we issued this morning.
This quarter, our revenues were $1.6 billion, an increase of 11% compared to the prior year. Revenue in our Connected Car division increased 5% versus the prior year, primarily due to higher take rates. Revenue in our Lifestyle Audio division increased 11% compared to the prior year. The increase in net sales was primarily due to the acquisition of Bang & Olufsen's automotive business, higher car audio take rates and higher consumer audio sales. Revenue in our Professional Solutions division decreased 4% compared to the prior year, mainly due to lower demand in Brazil and certain European markets as well as the channel rationalization to support a solutions-based go-to-market structure. 
Revenue in our Connected Services division was $166 million in the quarter compared to $67 million a year ago. The increase in revenue was primarily due to the expansion of our services portfolio as a result of the acquisition of Symphony Teleca. Total company gross margin increased 160 basis points to 30.4%. The improvement was primarily due to improved leverage of fixed costs on higher sales volume and lower warranty costs. Connected Car and Lifestyle Audio gross margins both increased 370 basis points to 26.4% and 35.5%, respectively. Both divisions benefited from better leverage of fixed costs, lower warranty expenses as a result of better quality and supplier productivity. As Dinesh mentioned earlier, we better aligned the timing of savings from our supplier base with the timing of annual price reductions from OEMs, resulting in strong margin performance this quarter.
Professional Solutions gross margin decreased 780 basis points to 33.7%, driven by discounts on older inventory and to partially offset foreign currency impacts at the distribution level. In addition, we incurred incremental costs associated with relocating manufacturing to Hungary and had reduced operating leverage as a result of lower sales. Connected Services gross margins were 28.7%.
Our SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 30 basis points from the prior year to 21.3%. Connected Car SG&A increased 110 basis points to 13.6% due to higher information technology costs to support future business. Lifestyle Audio SG&A increased 250 basis points to 22% due to higher research and development to support new car audio awards. SG&A expense in Professional Solutions decreased 190 basis points to 30.6%, driven by tight expense control. Connected Services SG&A as a percentage of sales was 20.3%. And finally, corporate SG&A as a percentage of sales declined by 60 basis points to 2.2%. As you would expect, we are managing our expenses across all of our divisions and corporate functions tightly due to some of the macroeconomic headwinds. 
Putting it all together, our consolidated operating income was $148 million compared to $114 million in the prior year, a 30% increase. EPS was $1.36 compared to $1.22 in the prior year, up 11%.
Now let me provide you with a few updates on capital allocation. In the quarter, we increased our borrowings under our revolving credit facility and used the cash to make the second payment for the Symphony Teleca acquisition in the amount of $216 million. In addition, we funded the TowerSec acquisition with $41 million of cash on hand. 
On top of that, we were active in the market. We spent $25 million to repurchase approximately 309,000 shares. Year-to-date, we have now repurchased approximately 803,000 shares at a cost of $75 million. We now have approximately $425 million remaining on our board-authorized share repurchase program, which runs until October 2017. 
In addition, we expect strong cash flow generation in the fourth quarter, consistent with our historical trend. 
Now let me walk you through our revised outlook. We now forecast fiscal 2016 revenue of approximately $6.825 billion. Of the $175 million shortfall compared to the guidance that we issued in August, approximately $100 million is related to Professional Solutions, $85 million is related to Connected Car and $60 million is from Connected Services. Approximately $70 million in higher revenues in Lifestyle Audio partially offset these impacts. Included in our outlook is a $30 million to $40 million reduction in our fourth quarter revenue as a result of supply constraints caused by the recent earthquakes in Japan. Approximately 80% of the impact is in our Connected Car division, and the remaining 20% is in our Lifestyle Audio division.
Turning to EPS. We now forecast operational earnings per share of $6.20. We guided you to EPS of $6.50 back in August. As we discussed last quarter, our acquisition of TowerSec will be dilutive to earnings by approximately $0.05 as it is a bolt-on technology investment. The remaining $0.25 of the EPS shortfall is related to weakness in our Professional Solutions division. 
While we are slightly behind in our Connected Services earnings targets, we expect that there were corporate costs and slightly lower below-the-line costs will offset the shortfall. We expect that both the Lifestyle Audio and Connected Car divisions will achieve their earnings targets that we established in August. Higher profitability as a percentage of sales in Connected Car will offset the shortfall in revenue. 
In summary, our 2 largest divisions representing 75% of our company, Connected Car and Lifestyle Audio, continue to perform well. We are addressing the challenges in our 2 smaller divisions to better position these businesses for long-term sustainable growth. 
Thank you for your attention, and now Dinesh and I are happy to take your questions."

And then second, related to the timing of productivity versus price down. So you did a great job there this quarter. So is the implication that the magnitude of improvement over the next 3 quarters should not be as great? And is this sort of a more sustainable procedure you put in place on a go-forward basis as well?"

Let me take that one. So first of all, revenue shortfall in Connected Car. Frankly, we did not expect and we did not know when we announced our second quarter result in January that some of the OEMs, which happened ended up pushing their production out. Now we hope all of that push will be realized in Q4, but that is to be seen. How much would that be realized and how much would that not be realized entirely. As an example, North America, FCA production was down 7% in the quarter and Chrysler actually stopped 200 -- Chrysler 200 complete production. So those were the impacts, which were not known at the beginning and that was one factor. Another factor is China, as we have quoted, the luxury car sales seriously suffered in Q2. And we said we expect momentum to shift, and momentum has shifted. We actually saw pretty good pickup in Q3, and we think it will continue in that direction, slightly get better in Q4, but still below our high level of growth we have seen in China. So it's the right direction. That's one part. Second piece you asked about timing of aligning our productivity improvement due to supply chain to annual price reductions. This is something I call process improvement, which we like to stay with and hopefully, we'll repeat that. But that is really not onetime. I mean, you have to spread it over a full year as we don't give a guidance quarter-over-quarter. However, I must remind this Q3 was very strong performance from profitability point of view, which we're very happy. But Q4 may come in right around 14 -- just over 14%. That will still put us for full year profitability slightly ahead of what we guided the market for, which I'm very happy about. So that's pretty much what I wanted to say that to guidance was 13.6%. That is 13.6% guidance, and will probably come in higher than that, both in absolute EBITDA and in percent margin. And that really is very important for our shareholders to know that cost control, the discipline of getting the orders we take and how we deliver is really sticking, and its margin expansion is constantly evolving quarter after quarter."

So business in the company called Symphony Teleca we acquired, that business actually holding up for the plan. But we have merged HARMAN's aftermarket audio business, which is slow growth, lower margin. That used to be part of the Lifestyle Audio, and we transferred that so that diluted done. On top of that, Redbend, over the year technology we moved and that's still a development. When we acquired the businesses, we're losing about $10 million, and we actually accelerated the development $15 million to $16 million drain on the bottom line for that reason. So when you add it all together, that affects the bottom line. However, we should still come out this business to be double-digit margin, right around 13% EBITDA for the full year, which is below my expectation of 15%. But when you factor in a $16 million, $16 million loss in Redbend and lower-margin aftermarket audio business, it's holding up quite well in the core business of Connected Services."

I mean, we have lifted a lot of mountains in our automotive, car audio and infotainment, and we know the playbook how it works. So this is fixable. It has taken a little longer. Q4 has seasonal leverage, as always, so Q4 will be definitely much better than Q2 and Q3. However, from the gross point of view, I am not expecting so much of an improvement. It should come in right around where the growth was in Q3. That is still about 5% below last year's quarter. But the profitability will come back up. It should be, as we have seen always, it is in the high -- is in the teens. But all in all, coming back to that cost-reduction actions we have taken, yes, you should expect $10 million to $15 million falling to the bottom line due to the 2 of the high-cost factories in Europe. We already moved them, and this is all done behind us. It took us an extra quarter, but it still, we will see the profitability improvement in fiscal '17. The top line might take a little more, 1 or 2 quarter extra than I anticipated. I admit, because the culture change of moving people from product-selling mindset to solution-selling mindset is proving to be a little harder than we thought. And that means we're training harder, and we're also not holding ourself from replacing and finding people from outside those who are good in solution selling. And we are seeing good signs. We're taking orders. You might have seen some of the enterprise orders we have recently booked. They're not converted into revenue are very encouraging. I'm very happy to see. So all in all, it's going in the right direction. And you can count on Sandy and I and the rest of the management team is truly focused on growth because this is one area we know how to fix and we'll fix it. So timing. So fiscal '17 should be a lot better than fiscal '16."

Connected Car and Lifestyle both are performing extremely well. I remind all of us are that it's 75% of the company, and that's the core. Supplier productivity alignment, I think David's Love and his team, they've done a great job in bringing mind, tremendous discipline and working with our suppliers with IT. That's another area we invested in our IT division so that we can really see things happening with our suppliers. And lower warranty cost is actually a discipline also in quality. We have been doing a lot of work in product execution and quality improvement, so that is sustainable, I believe. Scale matters a lot in this business. So car audio and infotainment have achieved a scale, and we are seeing margins really swelling that you saw 370 basis point improvement in gross margin for both divisions. Coincidentally, both divisions and saw that. And R&D, I think, is getting a lot more efficient in this quarter particularly, we did benefit slightly from the stronger reimbursement from our customers. But again, I would not like you to think that this is one-off. It is not because the R&D reimbursement vary quarter-to-quarter. We always try to maximize. So 15.2% EBITDA margin, by the way, is the record EBITDA margin for any quarter for Connected Car. We do expect for full year to be around just 14% or slightly north of 14% EBITDA. That's still ahead of what we guided the market back in August. So this is very positive. And last I'll say, look, we are going beyond what market we have been leading. We've gotten into successfully in display audio infotainment, and we have won a sizable business from a North American OEM, replacing a competitor and adding a new in our business. So this is another great to development for the company."

We described that pie chart horizontal line to divide the pie into 2. And then the top pie gets divided into other 25, 25 percentile. 20% is the fully embedded infotainment system. That is your telematics, that's your navigation, multimedia and what have you. And then the other 25% is display audio, which I would like to describe in a simplistic word, that is really your radio with a large screen without inbuilt navigation capability. The bottom half of the pie is really your very low-end traditional AM/FM radio or nothing at all. So what's happening, the growth in the top 2 quartile of the pie, the fully embedded and display audio. Display audio has further evolved into 2 basic display unit for some CarPlay capability. That's again, as I described, not inbuilt navigation capability, but bring your own device. So that happens and we are doing that. So those 2 are fastest-growing, and people say that no bright lines all in between these 2 because what I think and just based on what I'm hearing that the lines will further sort of get blurred between display audio and fully embedded. But if you think and if you believe in what's going to happen for the connected car. What would be required in semi-autonomous car? You will have lot more sense of fusion. You will have lot more safety security, active safety, telematics, full-blown navigation, built into it otherwise you cannot rely on car. So I think display audio will actually move more and more towards the fully embedded, and this would be in phases. Because people who buy entry-level car will perhaps start with that, and they will demand from technology providers do you have a path to upgrade my system online once I have bought the car? And that's fair. What has been holding up the take rates from going 4% to 3% linearly to nonlinear is there was no mechanism to over their baked technology. Only one car company in the Bay Area area started doing it and by the way, we are doing that, too, over-the-air update. So now with OTA technology, we've acquired from Redbend, and we have already signed up more than 6 OEM worldwide to use that technology. This will expedite feature refresh upgrade applications. That's why we signed up 10 providers for technology. So I think we're going to give users -- they can now customize. They can start with something if they don't have enough fun to begin with. But all, mid to luxury cars would be going more and more fully embedded systems. So I think as we go towards more and more autonomous driving, you will not see the bottom of the pie left that nothing. That nothing will not serve because that's the pressure everybody has. And that's what I thought I heard from all the OEMs I visited extensively, Germany, Japan, China, United States. And we're hearing the same thing the high take rates. In fact, our display audio award we have received, it had extremely high penetration rates. And I believe in it because that would be the base for the all entry systems going forward."

I'm just trying to make sure that the display audio wind that you have calling it display audio. But hearing it actually, sounds like if I look back to Page 7 of your Investor Day deck, almost mid-system minus up down, minus GPS and app download, which is actually provided through the smartphone."

And by the way, they're all already available in our fully embedded systems. So this is the aspiration. This is the step -- first step for those who could never buy embedded system. By the way, since you mentioned 2 or 3 times the different definition, I'm also hearing different definitions competitors are using cockpit, whether its instrument cluster or anything else as loosely navigation or infotainment. That is not correct. In fact, those are the standard instrument clusters. They are merging. They are getting into similar space. That's also driving it, but from capability point of view, infotainment remains very clearly well defined."

I actually don't think that the soft patch which I'm worried about. I think overall, this business of Connected Car will still be coming out for the full year right around 10%, 11% top line. And that Lifestyle car audio business is also really firing on all cylinders. Most importantly, the indication I see what is happening in other activity? And I'm very, very happy with that because that's the forward trend. That $22 billion was the backlog as of last year, fiscal '15. Since then, we have already booked $3.5 billion and $2.3 billion of that came from Connected Car. And we're not done yet because Q4 is running up to be again a pretty strong quarter for our order activity. So I think OEMs are coming in and placing large orders. They cannot avoid if there are some inventories here and there. And take rates, that's the key point for you and I to talk about because if take rates are soft, I'll be worried. But I'm not. Take rates are holding up quite well. We're tracking very well with what we guided. So between production and take rates, this quarter was 65% take rate and 35% production. So even if production is modest development over the next couple 3 years, take rate will start to get nonlinear. I absolutely believe whether it's '17 we're not giving guidance right now but in '17, i don't know. But one thing for sure, every OEM is saying it's not going to take 5 years to get to 65% penetration. It may not happen first 2 years, but linear to nonlinear is going to happen anywhere from one cycle -- one life cycle. That's 2 to 3 years. 2 years may be out. So that's my take on it, but we'll have more color when we give guidance for fiscal '17 in August."

Order activity is always lumpy. You should never expect every year to be the same. Last year, as an example, was a phenomenal and by the way, record year for the industry and record year for HARMAN. We booked $6.2 billion. No other company has ever booked that much. We were the first one to book that high. And we actually thought that next year might be just $2 billion or $3 billion. We already booked $3.5 billion. So we're very happy. And so if you think now in different form, in last 7 quarters, 4 quarters of '15, 3 quarters of this year, we have booked $10 billion business. I mean, our second biggest competitor has not even booked $5 billion. So we have amazing momentum going in that direction. That makes me very confident that we're on a very good path. As long as we keep cost low and continue to innovate, which we are doing. And by the way, we should not forget, our Connected Car business will grow because we've invested in Services business, in end-to-end service delivery, over-the-air update, cybersecurity. Other competitors have lots of catching up to do because these are the requirements towards autonomous driving, towards higher penetration rate. So I'm very convinced that we're going in the right direction quarter-to-quarter fluctuations, I don't like it. I understand. But we have to live it."

Remember, the color on this business. 2, 3 years ago, we had almost $0.5 billion worth of professional audio business. We were growing about 3%, 4% a year, and we were generating 15%, 16% EBITDA margin. And at that point, we clearly saw that there was a need to create a bigger solution, audio, video switching, lighting and automation to tie it all together to create a total solution. The businesses we acquired they came in significantly lower profitability, and the footprint was in very high-cost countries. Whether United States, Switzerland, Denmark and U.K. So that actually diluted the margins in the first place. And now we had to do the work while we were integrating the IT systems, the payrolls and what have you, we had to build the sales force so that we can sell not products, but the total solution. That's going on. So we do expect once we are done with this sales channel rationalization, which means not only retaining our salespeople, bringing some new people and also adjusting to new distribution channels, including going direct in some markets, and we are doing that, by the way. We should hit mid-single digit to even high in 2 years, 3 years' time growth. But that's most important thing is profitability. Profitability already next year, I would like to see coming into 14%, 15% profitability for the whole division because we'll have this faster consolidation coming in. In addition, we have identified some more cost rationalization, which we will drive in fiscal '17 already. So if I can sort of speak ahead of guidance, fiscal '17, we expect right around mid-teen EBITDA margin, 14%, 15%, around that if everything goes. And '17, we should be looking at 16%, 17% even because we will have somewhere cost reduction rationalization. I would like to invite our CFO to also weigh on some of inventory and some of the other things."

This morning, we reported our 12th consecutive quarter of top and bottom line growth and delivered an impressive 26% year-over-year improvement in EBITDA. However, the results across the divisions",2064,"Thank you, Yijing, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. This morning, we reported our 12th consecutive quarter of top and bottom line growth and delivered an impressive 26% year-over-year improvement in EBITDA. However, the results across the divisions were mixed. Our Connected Car and Lifestyle Audio businesses continued to perform well, and I'm extremely excited about the new award we have secured, particularly a breakthrough infotainment award for the entry market in the display/audio category. I'll provide additional color on this in a minute.
At the same time, we continue to face some macroeconomic and transitional challenges in our Professional Solutions and Connected Services divisions. We have already taken decisive steps in our Professional Solutions division to better position us for growth and improve our cost structure. We're confident that we are taking the right actions to put us on a path for future growth in Professional Solutions and to restore margins to historic high levels of profitability.
For the total company, net sales increased 11% to $1.6 billion. Our performance on the top line and rigorous cost-improvement efforts resulted in the strong double-digit EBITDA. We expected -- we expanded our operating margins and generated $198 million in EBITDA -- I repeat, $189 million in EBITDA, again, an increase of 26%, and reported earnings per share of $1.36. EPS was up 11% compared to the prior year.
The overall results in our 2 largest divisions, representing 75% of our company's revenue, that is Connected Car and Lifestyle Audio, were strong. Typically, our third quarter has the weakest margin in our automotive businesses. However, we were able to better align the timing of savings from our supplier base with the timing of annual price reductions. On top of that, our quality initiatives helped to reduce warranty expense, and we realized further leverage and scale in our automotive businesses.
When you put together additional measures we have shown with operational excellence, including procurement, savings and quality, with greater scale, the result is an over 200 basis point expansion in EBITDA margin.
While I'm very encouraged by our performance on the bottom line, the top line and Connected Car was lighter than we anticipated. As the quarter unfolded, certain customers shifted out production schedules to allow dealers to adjust inventory levels. Let me be very clear. We're not seeing any dropoff in take rates. In fact, demand for embedded solutions continue to gain traction.
During the quarter, I spent a number of weeks discussing connected car technology with top executives at our OEM customer base here in North America, Germany, Japan and China. This is one common theme we always heard that they all emphasize, the absolute requirement for an embedded solution that delivers a seamless, secure and personalized in vehicle experience. They look to HARMAN as a proven partner, and we are delivering on these increasing demands, with the most robust compute platform for embedded infotainment systems as well as unrivaled portfolio of audio brands and sound management solutions.
At the end of fiscal 2015, we had an industry-leading backlog of $23 billion, and we have secured $3.5 billion of new automotive awards year-to-date. This is on top of the record $6.2 billion of new awards we announced last fiscal year. That's almost $10 billion of new automotive awards over the last 7 quarters. I think that's clearly indicating a strong momentum towards what the theme we have been saying for a number of years.
I want to take a moment to remind you about the evolving nature of the infotainment market. At our Investor Day last August, you may recall we spoke about how the market breaks down. Roughly 25% of cars produced today have an embedded infotainment solution. This is where we are already the market leader. Another 25% of the cars produced today have a display audio solution, which you can think of as a connector radio but without any onboard navigation capabilities. The remaining 50% of the market ships from the factory with either a simple AM/FM radio or with no radio at all. We agree with industry experts and automakers that this 50% of the market will migrate upward to embedded solutions. HARMAN has been developing solutions for both of these categories. And for those of you who have attended CES or the Geneva Auto Show will know that HARMAN offers scalable platform solutions that cover the full range of automobile classes, from luxury to entry models.
That's why I'm so pleased to share the news with you today that we have received our first major infotainment award in the display audio category. This win is significant for us for 2 reasons. First, the customer is new to HARMAN in the connected car category, and the award is a competitive replacement. Secondly, this will underscore HARMAN's ability to effectively address multiple segments of the global market through our scalable platform strategy.
Notwithstanding the good work and the progress in our Connected Car and Lifestyle Audio divisions, we did experience challenges in the performance of our other 2 businesses. First, in our Professional Solutions division. Brazil and certain European markets continue to be soft. In addition, we have been rationalizing our channels to support the transition from a product-based approach to a solutions-based go-to-market strategy. Last October, we introduced this structure, focusing particularly on end-to-end solutions for targeted vertical segments within enterprise and entertainment markets. To accomplish this, we have put considerable effort in aligning our internal resources, training or replacing our sales team, along with the distribution channel partners they work through. We absolutely believe this is the right structure. However, it is a complex change, and it takes time. While I'm not satisfied with this performance or the timeline, I believe we have built the strongest portfolio in the industry. Our total solution approach allows us to cross-sell audio, lighting, video switching and enterprise automation.
On the cost side, we did complete the consolidation of our European manufacturing locations into single best-cost facility in Hungary. While the migration of 2 high-cost sites in Europe took an additional quarter to complete due to complexities of European labor laws, the plant in Hungary is now fully operational, manufacturing both mixers and lighting products. We expect to realize the benefits from these actions during fiscal year 2017.
In our Connected Services division, there are 2 factors impacting our top line. First, the aftermarket audio business that we moved from our Lifestyle division has a large exposure in Brazil and Russia. Second, in our engineering services business, we have been prioritizing our accommodation on strategic customers with the highest growth opportunities in the verticals where we have competitive advantage, specifically, automotive, mobile and communications and enterprise. That is really at the expense of short-term revenue. We're walking away from smaller accounts that do not have the ability to scale up. On top of that, we're investing in over-the-air update technology that we acquired from Redbend at an accelerated rate. Over-the-air updates is the foundation technology for the connected car, allowing automakers to quickly enable new features, fix bugs, upgrade firmware and offer a rich suite of end-to-end services.
The legacy Symphony Teleca business we acquired continues to generate margins in the mid-teens, which is in line with our expectations.
As a result of some of these headwinds, particularly in our Professional Solutions division as well as the impact from the earthquake in Japan, we are modestly revising our full year guidance. Our Chief Financial Officer, Sandy Rowland, will provide you with a more detailed walk in our remarks.
Let me take a closer look at our divisions and review some recent notable achievements. Let's start with our Connected Car division, which is highlighted on Slide 7 of our investor presentation. In Connected Car, we continue to expand and diversify our customer base and act to our industry-leading backlog. In addition to the new display audio infotainment award I mentioned earlier, we won a new global platform expansion award for a European automaker to support higher take rates as well as a platform refresh for their 2017 vehicles. In addition, we received a follow-on award to expand the next-generation integrated telematics program for Daimler.
HARMAN launched embedded infotainment solutions in a number of new vehicles from leading car companies, including Audi, Volkswagen Group's Fiat and Fiat Chrysler Automotive Group's Maserati. In Japan, HARMAN launched an embedded infotainment system from Suzuki, featuring Apple CarPlay. We also launched model refreshes and line extensions, featuring our embedded infotainment solutions in several Porsche and Mercedes-Benz vehicles. In March, we completed the acquisition of TowerSec. The leading automotive cybersecurity solutions will be integrated into HARMAN's 5+1 cybersecurity framework. The acquisitions we have made, including Redbend, OTA, best positions HARMAN to be leader in automotive cybersecurity and truly connected car.
Now turning to the Lifestyle Audio division. Some of our recent notable achievements are highlighted on Slide 8 of the investor presentation. During the quarter, we secured new car audio awards from Lincoln, Toyota and Subaru. We also launched Harman Kardon and Bowers & Wilkins-branded solutions with Fiat Chrysler Automotive's Maserati and Alfa Romeo, Revel-branded solutions with Lincoln and JBL Pro-branded solutions with Ferrari.
In March, we inaugurated new global product development center in Suzhou, China. The facility is now our largest comprehensive R&D center for car audio products worldwide. HARMAN is the only car audio supplier to have full value chain capabilities in China, including sourcing, R&D, engineering, production, technical support and distribution. And this will pay off big time in the long run.
Turning to consumer audio. I'm pleased to share that HARMAN's award-winning AKG active noise-canceling headphones will replace booth on all Lufthansa's business-class seats around the world. This new and strategic multiyear agreement with Lufthansa begins in September 2016.
Finally, I should note that our consumer audio products were again recognized for their excellence in design and innovation, winning a record 23 Red Dot awards. Ladies and gentlemen, I remind you, consumer audio tightly supports our car audio growth, and we are seeing them in tandem. And this is a great news for the company and our shareholders.
Now turning to the Professional Solutions division highlighted on Slide 9 of the investor presentation. During the quarter, new enterprise installations included NFL Stadium in Tampa Bay, a new ship for Norwegian Cruise Lines and corporate facilities across the globe for eBay and Societe Generale. Our solutions also powered the Super Bowl 50 Halftime Show and 58th Annual GRAMMY Awards and several artist concert tours.
Now turning to the Connected Services division highlighted on Slide 10 of the investor presentation. During the quarter, we secured follow-on business to provide product development services for Blackberry, Dell, Intel, British Telecom and Sony, among others. HARMAN continues to strengthen its partnership with Google in device management, software certification and system integration. In addition, HARMAN continued to capitalize on its industry-leading OTA software update technology, winning a cross-car line award with a global automaker. I'm extremely pleased to share with you, now our backlog of OTA awards is just over $150 million, and this is all software business. We are winning very rapidly in the space.
In conjunction with our services delivery platform, we introduced our automotive service provider program. This will facilitate the integration of a variety of enterprise and vehicle-centric applications and services from leading providers for OEMs. We added 10 new data, workflow and content service providers for our open platform, which enables automakers to provide a wide range of context-based services, including real-time traffic and location-based services. Let me remind you that our service delivery platform and our partnership program are the first of their kind in the industry. We're defining the cloud-based end-to-end service delivery platform for the connected car industry. In addition, HARMAN received recognition for its software engineering services capabilities from respected advisory firm, including Zinnov and HfS.
In summary, I'm pleased with the performance of our Connected Car and Lifestyle Audio divisions, and I'm also encouraged by the trends in the industry and the new business we have secured. Where we face challenges, we're taking aggressive actions. We will continue to focus on relentless execution across all of our divisions to deliver above-market top and bottom line growth.
Now I will turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Sandy Rowland, who will give you additional color on our financial results for the quarter."

Let me walk you through our financial highlights for the quarter. As a reminder, most of my financial remarks are provided on an operational basis, which excludes restructuring, nonrecurring and acquisition-related items. I want to point out that the majority of the difference between our GAAP and operational results is due to the noncash amortization of intangible assets recognized as a result of our recent acquisitions. The full reconciliation of our GAAP to our operational results is included in the press release that we issued this morning.
This quarter, our revenues were $1.6 billion, an increase of 11% compared to the prior year. Revenue in our Connected Car division increased 5% versus the prior year, primarily due to higher take rates. Revenue in our Lifestyle Audio division increased 11% compared to the prior year. The increase in net sales was primarily due to the acquisition of Bang & Olufsen's automotive business, higher car audio take rates and higher consumer audio sales.
Revenue in our Professional Solutions division decreased 4% compared to the prior year, mainly due to lower demand in Brazil and certain European markets as well as the channel rationalization to support a solutions-based go-to-market structure.
Revenue in our Connected Services division was $166 million in the quarter compared to $67 million a year ago. The increase in revenue was primarily due to the expansion of our services portfolio as a result of the acquisition of Symphony Teleca.
Total company gross margin increased 160 basis points to 30.4%. The improvement was primarily due to improved leverage of fixed costs on higher sales volume and lower warranty costs.
Connected Car and Lifestyle Audio gross margins both increased 370 basis points to 26.4% and 35.5%, respectively. Both divisions benefited from better leverage of fixed costs, lower warranty expenses as a result of better quality and supplier productivity. As Dinesh mentioned earlier, we better aligned the timing of savings from our supplier base with the timing of annual price reductions from OEMs, resulting in strong margin performance this quarter.
Professional Solutions gross margin decreased 780 basis points to 33.7%, driven by discounts on older inventory and to partially offset foreign currency impacts at the distribution level. In addition, we incurred incremental costs associated with relocating manufacturing to Hungary and had reduced operating leverage as a result of lower sales. Connected Services gross margins were 28.7%.
Our SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales increased 30 basis points from the prior year to 21.3%. Connected Car SG&A increased 110 basis points to 13.6% due to higher information technology costs to support future business. Lifestyle Audio SG&A increased 250 basis points to 22% due to higher research and development to support new car audio awards. SG&A expense in Professional Solutions decreased 190 basis points to 30.6%, driven by tight expense control. Connected Services SG&A as a percentage of sales was 20.3%. And finally, corporate SG&A as a percentage of sales declined by 60 basis points to 2.2%. As you would expect, we are managing our expenses across all of our divisions and corporate functions tightly due to some of the macroeconomic headwinds.
Putting it all together, our consolidated operating income was $148 million compared to $114 million in the prior year, a 30% increase. EPS was $1.36 compared to $1.22 in the prior year, up 11%.
Now let me provide you with a few updates on capital allocation. In the quarter, we increased our borrowings under our revolving credit facility and used the cash to make the second payment for the Symphony Teleca acquisition in the amount of $216 million. In addition, we funded the TowerSec acquisition with $41 million of cash on hand.
On top of that, we were active in the market. We spent $25 million to repurchase approximately 309,000 shares. Year-to-date, we have now repurchased approximately 803,000 shares at a cost of $75 million. We now have approximately $425 million remaining on our board-authorized share repurchase program, which runs until October 2017.
In addition, we expect strong cash flow generation in the fourth quarter, consistent with our historical trend.
Now let me walk you through our revised outlook. We now forecast fiscal 2016 revenue of approximately $6.825 billion. Of the $175 million shortfall compared to the guidance that we issued in August, approximately $100 million is related to Professional Solutions, $85 million is related to Connected Car and $60 million is from Connected Services. Approximately $70 million in higher revenues in Lifestyle Audio partially offset these impacts. Included in our outlook is a $30 million to $40 million reduction in our fourth quarter revenue as a result of supply constraints caused by the recent earthquakes in Japan. Approximately 80% of the impact is in our Connected Car division, and the remaining 20% is in our Lifestyle Audio division.
Turning to EPS. We now forecast operational earnings per share of $6.20. We guided you to EPS of $6.50 back in August. As we discussed last quarter, our acquisition of TowerSec will be dilutive to earnings by approximately $0.05 as it is a bolt-on technology investment. The remaining $0.25 of the EPS shortfall is related to weakness in our Professional Solutions division.
While we are slightly behind in our Connected Services earnings targets, we expect that lower corporate costs and slightly lower below-the-line costs will offset the shortfall. We expect that both the Lifestyle Audio and Connected Car divisions will achieve their earnings targets that we established in August. Higher profitability as a percentage of sales in Connected Car will offset the shortfall in revenue.
In summary, our 2 largest divisions representing 75% of our company, Connected Car and Lifestyle Audio, continue to perform well. We are addressing the challenges in our 2 smaller divisions to better position these businesses for long-term sustainable growth.
Thank you for your attention, and now Dinesh and I are happy to take your questions."

Let me take that one. So first of all, revenue shortfall in Connected Car. Frankly, we did not expect and we did not know when we announced our second quarter result in January that some of the OEMs, which happened, ended up pushing the production out. Now we hope all of that push will be realized in Q4, but that is to be seen, how much would that be realized and how much would that not be realized entirely. As an example, North America, FCA production was down 7% in the quarter, and Chrysler actually stopped 200 -- Chrysler 200 complete production. So those were the impacts which were not known at the beginning, and that was one factor. Another factor is China. As we have quoted, the luxury car sales seriously suffered in Q2. And we said we expect momentum to shift, and momentum has shifted. We actually saw pretty good pickup in Q3, and we think it will continue in that direction, slightly get better into Q4, but still below our high level of growth we have seen in China. So it's the right direction. That's one part. Second piece, you asked about timing of aligning our productivity improvement due to supply chain to annual price reductions. This is something I call process improvement, which we like to stay with, and hopefully, we'll repeat that. But that is really not a onetime. I mean, you have to spread it over the full year as we don't give a guidance quarter-over-quarter. However, I must remind, this Q3 was very strong performance from profitability point of view, which we're very happy. But Q4 may come in right around 14% -- just over 14%. That will still put us for full year profitability slightly ahead of what we guided the market for, which I'm very happy about. So that's pretty much what I wanted to say that the guidance was 13.6%. That is 13.6% guidance and will probably come in higher than that, both in absolute EBITDA and in percent margin. And that really is very important for our shareholders to know that cost control, the discipline of getting the orders we take and how we deliver is really sticking, and margin expansion is constantly evolving quarter after quarter."

And on top of that, Redbend over-the-air technology we moved in, that's still a development. When we acquired the businesses, we were losing about $10 million, and we actually accelerated the development, so $15 million to $16 million drain on the bottom line for that reason. So when you add it all together, that affects the bottom line. However, we should still come out -- this business to be double-digit margin, right around 13% EBITDA for the full year, which is below my expectation of 15%. But when you factor in a $15 million, $16 million loss in Redbend and lower-margin aftermarket audio business, it's holding up quite well in the core business of Connected Services."

I mean, we have lifted a lot of mountains in our automotive, car audio and infotainment, and we know the playbook how it works. So this is fixable. It has taken a little longer. Q4 has seasonal leverage, as always, so Q4 will be definitely much better than Q2 and Q3. However, from the gross point of view, I am not expecting so much of an improvement. It should come in right around where the growth was in Q3. That is still about 5% below last year's quarter. But the profitability will come back up. It should be, as we have seen always, in the high -- it's in the teens. But all in all, coming back to all that cost-reduction actions we have taken, yes, you should expect $10 million to $15 million falling to the bottom line due to 2 of the high-cost factories in Europe. We already moved them, and this is all done behind us. It took us an extra quarter, but still, we will see the profitability improvement in fiscal '17. The top line might take a little more, 1 or 2 quarter extra than I anticipated, I admit, because the culture change of moving people from product-selling mindset to solution-selling mindset is proving to be a little harder than we thought. And that means we're training harder, and we're also not holding ourselves from replacing and finding people from outside, those who are good in solution selling. And we are seeing good signs. We're taking orders. You might have seen some of the enterprise orders we have recently booked, they're not converted into revenue, are very encouraging. I'm very happy to see. So all in all, it's going in the right direction. And you can count on -- that Sandy and I and the rest of the management team is truly focused on growth because this is one area we know how to fix, and we'll fix it. So timing.

Ryan, I'm glad that you reminded that because we did not want to let go excellent development in Connected Car to be washed away from Professional lack of expectation performance. Connected Car and Lifestyle both are performing extremely well. I remind all of us that it's 75% of the company, that's the core. Supplier productivity alignment, I think David Slump and his team, they've done a great job in bringing set of mind, tremendous discipline and working with our suppliers with IT. And that's another area we invested in our IT division so that we can really see things happening with our suppliers. And lower warranty cost is actually a discipline also in quality. We have been doing a lot of work in product execution and quality improvement, so that is sustainable, I believe. Scale matters a lot in this business. So car audio and infotainment have achieved the scale, and we are seeing margins really swelling that you saw a 370 basis point improvement in gross margin for both divisions. Coincidentally, both divisions saw that. And R&D, I think, is getting a lot more efficient. In this quarter particularly, we did benefit slightly from the stronger reimbursement from our customers. But again, I would not like you to think that this is one-off, it is not, because the R&D reimbursement vary quarter-to-quarter. We always try to maximize. So 15.2% EBITDA margin, by the way, is the record EBITDA margin for any quarter for Connected Car. We do expect for full year to be around just 14% or slightly north of 14% EBITDA. That's still ahead of what we guided the market back in August. So this is very positive. And last I'll say, look, we are going beyond what market we have been leading. We've gotten into successfully in display audio infotainment, and we have won a sizable business from a North American OEM, replacing a competitor, and adding a new logo in our business. So this is another [indiscernible] to development for the company."

We think at the end of the day, it's most likely a mixed bag. There will be some production that likely gets shifted into Q1. But on the other hand, if the shortfall is from some of the higher-content materials and the OEMs take the decision to de-content a little bit to keep production going, then that won't carry over and benefit us in Q1. So at the end of the day, our best estimate is that it's between $30 million and $40 million impacting Q4. We think it will be contained all within Q4 and should be a mixed bag on how it splits out."

We described that a pie chart, draw a horizontal line to divide the pie into 2. And then the top pie gets divided into another 25, 25 percentile. 25% is the fully embedded infotainment system. That is your telematics, that's your navigation, multimedia and what have you. And then the other 25% is display audio, which I would like to describe in a simplistic word, that is really your radio with a large screen without inbuilt navigation capability. The bottom half of the pie is really your very low-end traditional AM/FM radio or nothing at all. So what's happening, the growth in the top 2 quartile of the pie, the fully embedded and display audio. Display audio has further evolved into 2 basic display unit for some CarPlay capability. That's again, as I described, not inbuilt navigation capability but bring your own device. So that happens, and we are doing that. So those 2 are fastest-growing, and people say that no bright lines align between these 2 because what I think and I just base on what I'm hearing that the lines will further sort of get blurred between display audio and fully embedded. But if you think and if you believe in, what's going to happen to fully connected car? What's -- what would be required in semi-autonomous car? You will have a lot more sense of fusion. You will have a lot more safety security, active safety, ATOS, telematics, full-blown navigation, built into it. Otherwise you cannot rely on car. So I think display audio will actually move more and more towards the fully embedded, and this would be in phases because people who buy entry-level car will perhaps start with that, and they will demand from technology providers, do you have a path to upgrade my system online once I have bought the car? And that's fair. What has been holding up the take rates from going 4% or 3% linearly to nonlinear is there was no mechanism to  over-the-air update technology. Only one car company in the Bay Area started doing it. And by the way, we are doing that, too, over-the-air update. So now with OTA technology we've acquired from Redbend, and we have already signed up more than 6 OEMs worldwide to use that technology. This will expedite feature refresh upgrade applications. That's why we signed up 10 providers for technology. So I think we're going to give users -- they can now customize. They can start with something if they don't have enough fund to begin with. But the all -- mid to luxury cars would be going more and more fully embedded systems. So I think as we go towards more and more autonomous driving, you will not see the bottom of the pie left that nothing, that nothing will not serve because that's the pressure everybody has. And that's what I thought I heard from all OEMs I visited extensively, Germany, Japan, China, United States. And we're hearing the same thing, the high take rates. In fact, our display audio award we have received, it had extremely high penetration rate. And I believe in it because that would be the base for the all-entry systems going forward."

This is the step -- first step for those who could never buy embedded system. By the way, since you mentioned 2 or 3 times the different definition, I'm also hearing different definitions. In fact, some of the competitors are using cockpit, whether it's instrument cluster or anything else, as loosely as navigation or infotainment. That is not correct. In fact, those are the standard instrument clusters. They are merging. They are getting into similar space. That's why they're also driving it, but from a capability point of view, infotainment remains very clearly well defined."

And that lifestyle car audio business is also really firing on all cylinders. Most importantly, the indication I see, what is happening in order activity? And I'm very, very happy with that because that's the forward trend. That $22 billion was the backlog as of last year, fiscal '15. Since then, we have already booked $3.5 billion, and $2.3 billion of that came from Connected Car. And we're not done yet because Q4 is lining up to be, again, a pretty strong quarter for our order activity. So I think OEMs are coming in and placing large orders. They cannot avoid if there are some inventories here and there. And take rates, that's the key point for you and I to talk about because if take rates were soft, I'll be worried. But I'm not. Take rates are holding up quite well. We're tracking very well what we guided. So between production and take rates, this quarter was 65% take rate and 35% production. So even if production is modest development over the next couple of 3 years, take rate will start to get nonlinear. I absolutely believe, whether it's '17, I -- we're not giving guidance right now, but in '17, I don't know. But one thing for sure, every OEM is saying it's not going to take 5 years to get to 65% penetration. It may not happen first 2 years, but linear to nonlinear is going to happen anywhere from one cycle -- one life cycle. That's 2 to 3 years. 2 years may be out. So that's my take on it, but we'll have more color when we give guidance for fiscal '17 in August."

We booked $6.2 billion. No other company has ever booked that much. We were the first one to book that high. And we actually thought that next year might be just $2 billion or $3 billion. We already booked $3.5 billion. So we're very happy. And so if you think now in different form, in last 7 quarters, 4 quarters of '15, 3 quarters of this year, we have booked $10 billion business. I mean, our second biggest competitor has not even booked $5 billion. So we have an amazing momentum going in that direction. That makes me very confident that we're on a very good path as long as we keep costs low and continue to innovate, which we are doing. And by the way, we should not forget, our connected car business will grow because we've invested in services business, in end-to-end service delivery, over-the-air update, cybersecurity. Other competitors have a lot of catching up to do because these are the requirements towards autonomous driving, towards higher penetration rate.

Remember the color on this business. 2, 3 years ago, we had almost $0.5 billion worth of professional audio business. We were growing about 3%, 4% a year, and we were generating 15%, 16% EBITDA margin. And at that point, we clearly saw there was a need to create a bigger solution, audio, video switching, lighting and automation, to tie it all together to create a total solution. The businesses we acquired, they came in significantly lower profitability, and the footprint was in very, very high-cost countries, whether United States, Switzerland, Denmark and U.K. So that actually diluted the margins in the first place. And now we had to do the work. While we were integrating the IT systems, the payrolls and what have you, we had to build the sales force so that we can sell not products, but the total solution. That's going on. So we do expect once we are done with this sales channel rationalization, which means not only retraining our salespeople, bringing some new people and also adjusting to new distribution channels, including going direct in some markets, and we are doing that, by the way, we should hit mid-single digit to even high, in 2 years, 3 years' time, growth. But that's more -- most important thing is profitability. Profitability, already next year, I would like to see coming into 14%, 15% profitability for the whole division because we will have this faster consolidation already coming in. In addition, we have identified some more cost rationalization, which we will drive in fiscal '17 already. So if I can sort of speak ahead of guidance, fiscal '17, we expect right around mid-teen EBITDA margin, 14%, 15%, around that if everything goes. And '17, we should be looking at 16%, 17% even because we will have some more cost reduction rationalization. I would like to invite our CFO to also weigh on some of the inventory and some of the other things."

When you look at the year-over-year margin performance, there were 3 major factors that impacted the margin. The first that -- first, we continued doing some discounting, not only to clear out some older inventory, but we need to support our global distribution partners. Some of those partners are still impacted by currency impacts due to the continued strong dollar. And then the second point is leverage. Once we get the top line going in this business, we get very good leverage on the top line. And the third factor was we did incur some incremental costs this quarter that were largely associated with migrating our footprint out of the U.K. and Denmark into our site into Hungary."

We have said 50% of the car market has either basic AM/FM radio or nothing at all. That would move towards fully embedded system, what we are world leader at, or some sort of a hybrid, which is the name industry has given a display audio. In fact, I don't even like it because it's not the audio, it's actually infotainment. And that has capabilities pretty much what you would expect in an entry system, what we had been doing without inbuilt navigation. We have always said that that's the entry system. We have been doing entry system. But this time, it is a system which does not have a built-in navigation, which you can bring your own device. We have always been consistent on that. And I'll repeat what I said earlier in the call. I believe, towards semi-autonomous and autonomous driving experience, display audio is not your answer. Full stop. This is the beginning. This is what you get people started with, and then they can grow their system, or the first-generation car you buy, either you upgrade it, which we will develop our service offering or you'll buy a next car, which is a lot more embedded. That has been very consistent explanation from me and my management team. And we still believe that's the way it's going. The good thing is we're playing in both sides because our customers, existing customers, the Germans, Japanese, Americans, are asking that they want both solutions because no car would be left behind, either entry car or mid- and high, and we have solution for all 3, entry, mid- and high."

This morning, we reported our 12th consecutive quarter of top and bottom line growth and delivered an impressive 26% year-over-year improvement in EBITDA. However, the results across the divisions",2064,"Thank you, Yijing, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. This morning, we reported our 12th consecutive quarter of top and bottom line growth and delivered an impressive 26% year-over-year improvement in EBITDA. However, the results across the divisions were mixed. Our Connected Car and Lifestyle Audio businesses continued to perform well, and I'm extremely excited about the new award we have secured, particularly a breakthrough infotainment award for the entry market in the display/audio category. I'll provide additional color on this in a minute.
At the same time, we continue to face some macroeconomic and transitional challenges in our Professional Solutions and Connected Services divisions. We have already taken decisive steps in our Professional Solutions division to better position us for growth and improve our cost structure. We're confident that we are taking the right actions to put us on a path for future growth in Professional Solutions and to restore margins to historic high levels of profitability.
For the total company, net sales increased 11% to $1.6 billion. Our performance on the top line and rigorous cost-improvement efforts resulted in the strong double-digit EBITDA. We expected -- we expanded our operating margins and generated $198 million in EBITDA -- I repeat, $189 million in EBITDA, again, an increase of 26%, and reported earnings per share of $1.36. EPS was up 11% compared to the prior year.
The overall results in our 2 largest divisions, representing 75% of our company's revenue, that is Connected Car and Lifestyle Audio, were strong. Typically, our third quarter has the weakest margin in our automotive businesses. However, we were able to better align the timing of savings from our supplier base with the timing of annual price reductions. On top of that, our quality initiatives helped to reduce warranty expense, and we realized further leverage and scale in our automotive businesses.
When you put together additional measures we have shown with operational excellence, including procurement, savings and quality, with greater scale, the result is an over 200 basis point expansion in EBITDA margin.
While I'm very encouraged by our performance on the bottom line, the top line in Connected Car was lighter than we anticipated. As the quarter unfolded, certain customers shifted out production schedules to allow dealers to adjust inventory levels. Let me be very clear. We're not seeing any dropoff in take rates. In fact, demand for embedded solutions continue to gain traction.
During the quarter, I spent a number of weeks discussing connected car technology with top executives at our OEM customer base here in North America, Germany, Japan and China. This is one common theme we always heard that they all emphasize; the absolute requirement for an embedded solution that delivers a seamless, secure and personalized in vehicle experience. They look to HARMAN as a proven partner, and we are delivering on these increasing demands, with the most robust compute platform for embedded infotainment systems as well as unrivaled portfolio of audio brands and sound management solutions.
At the end of fiscal 2015, we had an industry-leading backlog of $23 billion, and we have secured $3.5 billion of new automotive awards year-to-date. This is on top of the record $6.2 billion of new awards we announced last fiscal year. That's almost $10 billion of new automotive awards over the last 7 quarters. I think that's clearly indicating a strong momentum towards what the theme we have been saying for a number of years.
I want to take a moment to remind you about the evolving nature of the infotainment market. At our Investor Day last August, you may recall we spoke about how the market breaks down. Roughly 25% of cars produced today have an embedded infotainment solution. This is where we are already the market leader. Another 25% of the cars produced today have a display audio solution, which you can think of as a connected radio but without any onboard navigation capabilities. The remaining 50% of the market ships from the factory with either a simple AM/FM radio or with no radio at all. We agree with industry experts and automakers that this 50% of the market will migrate upward to embedded solutions. HARMAN has been developing solutions for both of these categories. And for those of you who have attended CES or the Geneva Auto Show will know that HARMAN offers scalable platform solutions that cover the full range of automobile classes, from luxury to entry models.
That's why I'm so pleased to share the news with you today that we have received our first major infotainment award in the display audio category. This win is significant for us for 2 reasons. First, the customer is new to HARMAN in the connected car category, and the award is a competitive replacement. Secondly, this will underscore HARMAN's ability to effectively address multiple segments of the global market through our scalable platform strategy.
Notwithstanding the good work and the progress in our Connected Car and Lifestyle Audio divisions, we did experience challenges in the performance of our other 2 businesses. First, in our Professional Solutions division. Brazil and certain European markets continue to be soft. In addition, we have been rationalizing our channels to support the transition from a product-based approach to a solutions-based go-to-market strategy. Last October, we introduced this structure, focusing particularly on end-to-end solutions for targeted vertical segments within enterprise and entertainment markets. To accomplish this, we have put considerable effort in aligning our internal resources, training or replacing our sales team, along with the distribution channel partners they work through. We absolutely believe this is the right structure. However, it is a complex change, and it takes time. While I'm not satisfied with this performance or the timeline, I believe we have built the strongest portfolio in the industry. Our total solution approach allows us to cross-sell audio, lighting, video switching and enterprise automation.
On the cost side, we did complete the consolidation of our European manufacturing locations into single best-cost facility in Hungary. While the migration of 2 high-cost sites in Europe took an additional quarter to complete due to complexities of European labor laws, the plant in Hungary is now fully operational, manufacturing both mixers and lighting products. We expect to realize the benefits from these actions during fiscal year 2017.
In our Connected Services division, there are 2 factors impacting our top line. First, the aftermarket audio business that we moved from our Lifestyle division has a large exposure in Brazil and Russia. Second, in our engineering services business, we have been prioritizing our organization on strategic customers with the highest growth opportunities in the verticals where we have competitive advantage, specifically, automotive, mobile and communications and enterprise. That is really at the expense of short-term revenue. We're walking away from smaller accounts that do not have the ability to scale up. On top of that, we're investing in over-the-air update technology that we acquired from Redbend at an accelerated rate. Over-the-air updates is the foundation technology for the connected car, allowing automakers to quickly enable new features, fix bugs, upgrade firmware and offer a rich suite of end-to-end services.
The legacy Symphony Teleca business we acquired continues to generate margins in the mid-teens, which is in line with our expectations.
As a result of some of these headwinds, particularly in our Professional Solutions division as well as the impact from the earthquake in Japan, we are modestly revising our full year guidance. Our Chief Financial Officer, Sandy Rowland, will provide you with a more detailed walk in her remarks.
Let me take a closer look at our divisions and review some recent notable achievements. Let's start with our Connected Car division, which is highlighted on Slide 7 of our investor presentation. In Connected Car, we continue to expand and diversify our customer base and add to our industry-leading backlog. In addition to the new display audio infotainment award I mentioned earlier, we won a new global platform expansion award for a European automaker to support higher take rates as well as a platform refresh for their 2017 vehicles. In addition, we received a follow-on award to expand the next-generation integrated telematics program for Daimler.
HARMAN launched embedded infotainment solutions in a number of new vehicles from leading car companies, including Audi, Volkswagen Group's Fiat and Fiat Chrysler Automotive Group's Maserati. In Japan, HARMAN launched an embedded infotainment system from Suzuki, featuring Apple CarPlay. We also launched model refreshes and line extensions, featuring our embedded infotainment solutions in several Porsche and Mercedes-Benz vehicles. In March, we completed the acquisition of TowerSec. Their leading automotive cybersecurity solutions will be integrated into HARMAN's 5+1 cybersecurity framework. The acquisitions we have made, including Redbend, OTA, best positions HARMAN to be leader in automotive cybersecurity and truly connected car.
Now turning to the Lifestyle Audio division. Some of our recent notable achievements are highlighted on Slide 8 of the investor presentation. During the quarter, we secured new car audio awards from Lincoln, Toyota and Subaru. We also launched Harman Kardon and Bowers & Wilkins-branded solutions with Fiat Chrysler Automotive's Maserati and Alfa Romeo, Revel-branded solutions with Lincoln and JBL Pro-branded solutions with Ferrari.
In March, we inaugurated new global product development center in Suzhou, China. The facility is now our largest comprehensive R&D center for car audio products worldwide. HARMAN is the only car audio supplier to have full value chain capabilities in China, including sourcing, R&D, engineering, production, technical support and distribution. And this will pay off big time in the long run.
Turning to consumer audio. I'm pleased to share that HARMAN's award-winning AKG active noise-canceling headphones will replace Bose on all Lufthansa's business-class seats around the world. This new and strategic multiyear agreement with Lufthansa begins in September 2016.
Finally, I should note that our consumer audio products were again recognized for their excellence in design and innovation, winning a record 23 Red Dot awards. Ladies and gentlemen, I remind you, consumer audio tightly supports our car audio growth, and we are seeing them in tandem. And this is a great news for the company and our shareholders.
Now turning to the Professional Solutions division highlighted on Slide 9 of the investor presentation. During the quarter, new enterprise installations included NFL Stadium in Tampa Bay, a new ship for Norwegian Cruise Lines and corporate facilities across the globe for eBay and Societe Generale. Our solutions also powered the Super Bowl 50 Halftime Show and 58th Annual GRAMMY Awards and several artist concert tours.
Now turning to the Connected Services division highlighted on Slide 10 of the investor presentation. During the quarter, we secured follow-on business to provide product development services for Blackberry, Dell, Intel, British Telecom and Sony, among others. HARMAN continues to strengthen its partnership with Google in device management, software certification and system integration. In addition, HARMAN continued to capitalize on its industry-leading OTA software update technology, winning a cross-car line award with a global automaker. I'm extremely pleased to share with you, now our backlog of OTA awards is just over $150 million, and this is all software business. We are winning very rapidly in the space.
In conjunction with our services delivery platform, we introduced our automotive service provider program. This will facilitate the integration of a variety of enterprise and vehicle-centric applications and services from leading providers for OEMs. We added 10 new data, workflow and content service providers for our open platform, which enables automakers to provide a wide range of context-based services, including real-time traffic and location-based services. Let me remind you that our service delivery platform and our partnership program are the first of their kind in the industry. We're defining the cloud-based end-to-end service delivery platform for the connected car industry. In addition, HARMAN received recognition for its software engineering services capabilities from respected advisory firms, including Zinnov and HfS.
In summary, I'm pleased with the performance of our Connected Car and Lifestyle Audio divisions, and I'm also encouraged by the trends in the industry and the new business we have secured. Where we face challenges, we're taking aggressive actions. We will continue to focus on relentless execution across all of our divisions to deliver above-market top and bottom line growth.
Now I will turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Sandy Rowland, who will give you additional color on our financial results for the quarter."

Let me walk you through our financial highlights for the quarter. As a reminder, most of my financial remarks are provided on an operational basis, which excludes restructuring, nonrecurring and acquisition-related items. I want to point out that the majority of the difference between our GAAP and operational results is due to the noncash amortization of intangible assets recognized as a result of our recent acquisitions. The full reconciliation of our GAAP to our operational results is included in the press release that we issued this morning.
This quarter, our revenues were $1.6 billion, an increase of 11% compared to the prior year. Revenue in our Connected Car division increased 5% versus the prior year, primarily due to higher take rates. Revenue in our Lifestyle Audio division increased 11% compared to the prior year. The increase in net sales was primarily due to the acquisition of Bang & Olufsen's automotive business, higher car audio take rates and higher consumer audio sales.
Revenue in our Professional Solutions division decreased 4% compared to the prior year, mainly due to lower demand in Brazil and certain European markets as well as the channel rationalization to support a solutions-based go-to-market structure.
Revenue in our Connected Services division was $166 million in the quarter compared to $67 million a year ago. The increase in revenue was primarily due to the expansion of our services portfolio as a result of the acquisition of Symphony Teleca.
Total company gross margin increased 160 basis points to 30.4%. The improvement was primarily due to improved leverage of fixed costs on higher sales volume and lower warranty costs.
Connected Car and Lifestyle Audio gross margins both increased 370 basis points to 26.4% and 35.5%, respectively. Both divisions benefited from better leverage of fixed costs, lower warranty expenses as a result of better quality and supplier productivity. As Dinesh mentioned earlier, we better aligned the timing of savings from our supplier base with the timing of annual price reductions from OEMs, resulting in strong margin performance this quarter.
Professional Solutions gross margin decreased 780 basis points to 33.7%, driven by discounts on older inventory and to partially offset foreign currency impacts at the distribution level. In addition, we incurred incremental costs associated with relocating manufacturing to Hungary and had reduced operating leverage as a result of lower sales. Connected Services gross margins were 28.7%.
Our SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales increased 30 basis points from the prior year to 21.3%. Connected Car SG&A increased 110 basis points to 13.6% due to higher information technology costs to support future business. Lifestyle Audio SG&A increased 250 basis points to 22% due to higher research and development to support new car audio awards. SG&A expense in Professional Solutions decreased 190 basis points to 30.6%, driven by tight expense control. Connected Services SG&A as a percentage of sales was 20.3%. And finally, corporate SG&A as a percentage of sales declined by 60 basis points to 2.2%. As you would expect, we are managing our expenses across all of our divisions and corporate functions tightly due to some of the macroeconomic headwinds.
Putting it all together, our consolidated operating income was $148 million compared to $114 million in the prior year, a 30% increase. EPS was $1.36 compared to $1.22 in the prior year, up 11%.
Now let me provide you with a few updates on capital allocation. In the quarter, we increased our borrowings under our revolving credit facility and used the cash to make the second payment for the Symphony Teleca acquisition in the amount of $216 million. In addition, we funded the TowerSec acquisition with $41 million of cash on hand.
On top of that, we were active in the market. We spent $25 million to repurchase approximately 309,000 shares. Year-to-date, we have now repurchased approximately 803,000 shares at a cost of $75 million. We now have approximately $425 million remaining on our board-authorized share repurchase program, which runs until October 2017.
In addition, we expect strong cash flow generation in the fourth quarter, consistent with our historical trend.
Now let me walk you through our revised outlook. We now forecast fiscal 2016 revenue of approximately $6.825 billion. Of the $175 million shortfall compared to the guidance that we issued in August, approximately $100 million is related to Professional Solutions, $85 million is related to Connected Car and $60 million is from Connected Services. Approximately $70 million in higher revenues in Lifestyle Audio partially offset these impacts. Included in our outlook is a $30 million to $40 million reduction in our fourth quarter revenue as a result of supply constraints caused by the recent earthquakes in Japan. Approximately 80% of the impact is in our Connected Car division, and the remaining 20% is in our Lifestyle Audio division.
Turning to EPS. We now forecast operational earnings per share of $6.20. We guided you to EPS of $6.50 back in August. As we discussed last quarter, our acquisition of TowerSec will be dilutive to earnings by approximately $0.05 as it is a bolt-on technology investment. The remaining $0.25 of the EPS shortfall is related to weakness in our Professional Solutions division.
While we are slightly behind in our Connected Services earnings targets, we expect that lower corporate costs and slightly lower below-the-line costs will offset the shortfall. We expect that both the Lifestyle Audio and Connected Car divisions will achieve their earnings targets that we established in August. Higher profitability as a percentage of sales in Connected Car will offset the shortfall in revenue.
In summary, our 2 largest divisions representing 75% of our company, Connected Car and Lifestyle Audio, continue to perform well. We are addressing the challenges in our 2 smaller divisions to better position these businesses for long-term sustainable growth.
Thank you for your attention, and now Dinesh and I are happy to take your questions."

So is the implication that the magnitude of improvement over the next 3 quarters should not be as great? And is this sort of a more sustainable procedure you put in place on a go-forward basis as well?"

Let me take that one. So first of all, revenue shortfall in Connected Car. Frankly, we did not expect and we did not know when we announced our second quarter result in January that some of the OEMs which happened, ended up pushing the production out. Now we hope all of that push will be realized in Q4, but that is to be seen, how much would that be realized and how much would that not be realized entirely. As an example, North America, FCA production was down 7% in the quarter, and Chrysler actually stopped 200 -- Chrysler 200 complete production. So those were the impacts which were not known at the beginning, and that was one factor. Another factor is China. As we have quoted, the luxury car sales seriously suffered in Q2. And we said we expect momentum to shift, and momentum has shifted. We actually saw pretty good pickup in Q3, and we think it will continue in that direction, slightly get better into Q4, but still below our high level of growth we have seen in China. So it's the right direction. That's one part. Second piece, you asked about timing of aligning our productivity improvement due to supply chain to annual price reductions. This is something I call process improvement, which we like to stay with, and hopefully, we'll repeat that. But that is really not a onetime. I mean, you have to spread it over the full year as we don't give a guidance quarter-over-quarter. However, I must remind, this Q3 was very strong performance from profitability point of view, which we're very happy. But Q4 may come in right around 14% -- just over 14%. That will still put us for full year profitability slightly ahead of what we guided the market for, which I'm very happy about. So that's pretty much what I wanted to say that the guidance was 13.6%. That is 13.6% guidance and will probably come in higher than that, both in absolute EBITDA and in percent margin. And that really is very important for our shareholders to know that cost control, the discipline of getting the orders we take and how we deliver is really sticking, and margin expansion is constantly evolving quarter after quarter."

So business in -- the company called Symphony Teleca we acquired, that business is actually holding up per the plan. But we have merged HARMAN's aftermarket audio business, which is slow growth, lower margin. That used to be part of the Lifestyle Audio, and we transferred that so that diluted down. And on top of that, Redbend over-the-air technology we moved in, that's still a developmental. When we acquired the businesses, we were losing about $10 million, and we actually accelerated the development, so it will be $15 million to $16 million drain on the bottom line for that reason. So when you add it all together, that affects the bottom line. However, we should still come out -- this business to be double-digit margin, right around 13% EBITDA for the full year, which is below my expectation of 15%. But when you factor in a $15 million, $16 million loss in Redbend and lower-margin in aftermarket audio business, it's holding up quite well in the core business of Connected Services."

I mean, we have lifted a lot of mountains in our automotive, car audio and infotainment, and we know the playbook how it works. So this is fixable. It has taken a little longer. Q4 has seasonal leverage, as always, so Q4 will be definitely much better than Q2 and Q3. However, from the growth point of view, I am not expecting so much of an improvement. It should come in right around where the growth was in Q3. That is still about 5% below last year's quarter. But the profitability will come back up. It should be, as we have seen always, in the high -- it's in the teens. But all in all, coming back to all the cost-reduction actions we have taken, yes, you should expect $10 million to $15 million falling to the bottom line due to 2 of the high-cost factories in Europe. We already moved them, and this is all done, behind us. It took us an extra quarter, but still, we will see the profitability improvement in fiscal '17. The top line might take a little more, 1 or 2 quarter extra than I anticipated, I admit, because the culture change of moving people from product-selling mindset to solution-selling mindset is proving to be a little harder than we thought. And that means we're training harder, and we're also not holding ourselves from replacing and finding people from outside, those who are good in solution selling. And we are seeing good signs. We're taking orders. You might have seen some of the enterprise orders we have recently booked, they're not converted into revenue, are very encouraging. I'm very happy to see. So all in all, it's going in the right direction. And you can count on -- that Sandy and I and the rest of the management team is truly focused on growth because this is one area we know how to fix it, and we'll fix it. So timing. So fiscal '17 should be a lot better than fiscal '16."

Ryan, I'm glad that you reminded that because we did not want to let go excellent development in Connected Car to be washed away from Professional lack of expectation performance. Connected Car and Lifestyle both are performing extremely well. I remind all of us that it's 75% of the company, that's the core. Supplier productivity alignment, I think David Slump and his team, they've done a great job in bringing strength of mind, tremendous discipline and working with our suppliers with IT. And that's another area we invested in our IT division so that we can really see things happening with our suppliers. And lower warranty cost is actually a discipline also in quality. We have been doing a lot of work in product execution and quality improvement, so that is sustainable, I believe. Scale matters a lot in this business. So car audio and infotainment have achieved the scale, and we are seeing margins really swelling that you saw a 370 basis point improvement in gross margin for both divisions. Coincidentally, both divisions saw that. And R&D, I think, is getting a lot more efficient. In this quarter particularly, we did benefit slightly from the stronger reimbursement from our customers. But again, I would not like you to think that this is one-off, it is not, because the R&D reimbursement vary quarter-to-quarter. We always try to maximize. So 15.2% EBITDA margin, by the way, is the record EBITDA margin for any quarter for Connected Car. We do expect for full year to be around just 14% or slightly north of 14% EBITDA. That's still ahead of what we guided the market back in August. So this is very positive. And last I'll say, look, we are going beyond what market we have been leading. We've gotten into successfully in display audio infotainment, and we have won a sizable business from a North American OEM, replacing a competitor, and adding a new lever in our business. So this is another very positive development for the company."

We described that in a pie chart, draw a horizontal line to divide the pie into 2. And then the top pie gets divided into another 25, 25 percentile. 25% is the fully embedded infotainment system. That is your telematics, that's your navigation, multimedia and what have you. And then the other 25% is display audio, which I would like to describe in a simplistic word; that is really your radio with a large screen without inbuilt navigation capability. The bottom half of the pie is really your very low-end traditional AM/FM radio or nothing at all. So what's happening, the growth in the top 2 quartile of the pie, the fully embedded and display audio. Display audio has further evolved into 2 basic display unit with some CarPlay capability. That's again, as I described, not inbuilt navigation capability but bring your own device. So that happens, and we are doing that. So those 2 are fastest-growing, and people say that no bright [ph] lines align between these 2 because what I think, and I just base on what I'm hearing, that the lines will further sort of get blurred between display audio and fully embedded. But if you think and if you believe in, what's going to happen to fully connected car? What's -- what would be required in semi-autonomous car? You will have a lot more sense of fusion. You will have a lot more safety security, active safety, ATOS, telematics, full-blown navigation, built into it. Otherwise you cannot rely [ph] on car. So I think display audio will actually move more and more towards the fully embedded, and this would be in phases because people who buy entry-level car will perhaps start with that, and they will demand from technology providers, do you have a path to upgrade my system online once I have bought the car? And that's fair. What has been holding up the take rates from going 4% or 3% linearly to nonlinear is there was no mechanism to  over-the-air update technology. Only one car company in the Bay Area started doing it. And by the way, we are doing that, too, over-the-air update. So now with OTA technology we've acquired from Redbend, and we have already signed up more than 6 OEMs worldwide to use that technology. This will expedite feature refresh upgrade applications. That's why we signed up 10 providers for technology. So I think we're going to give users -- they can now customize. They can start with something if they don't have enough fund to begin with. But the all -- mid to luxury cars would be going more and more fully embedded systems. So I think as we go towards more and more autonomous driving, you will not see the bottom of the pie left at nothing, that nothing will not serve because that's the pressure everybody has. And that's what I thought I heard from all OEMs I visited extensively, Germany, Japan, China, United States. And we're hearing the same thing, the high take rates. In fact, our display audio award we have received, it had extremely high penetration rate. And I believe in it because that would be the base for the all-entry systems going forward."

In fact, some of the competitors are using cockpit, whether it's instrument cluster or anything else, as loosely as navigation or infotainment. That is not correct. In fact, those are the standard instrument clusters. They are merging. They are getting into similar space. That's why they're also driving it, but from a capability point of view, infotainment remains very clearly well defined."

I actually don't think that it's a soft patch which I'm worried about. I think, overall, this business of connected car will still be coming out for the full year right around 10%, 11% top line. And lifestyle car audio business is also really firing on all cylinders. Most importantly, the indication I see, what is happening in order activity? And I'm very, very happy with that because that's the forward trend. That $23 billion was the backlog as of last year, fiscal '15. Since then, we have already booked $3.5 billion, and $2.3 billion of that came from Connected Car. And we're not done yet because Q4 is lining up to be, again, a pretty strong quarter for our order activity. So I think OEMs are coming in and placing large orders. They cannot avoid if there are some inventory issues here and there. And take rates, that's the key point for you and I to talk about because if take rates were soft, I'd be worried. But I'm not. Take rates are holding up quite well. We're tracking very well what we guided. So between production and take rates, this quarter was 65% take rate and 35% production. So even if production is modest development over the next couple of 3 years, take rate will start to get nonlinear. I absolutely believe, whether it's in '17, I -- we're not giving guidance right now, but is it '17, I don't know. But one thing for sure, every OEM is saying it's not going to take 5 years to get to 65% penetration. It may not happen first 2 years, but linear to nonlinear is going to happen anywhere from one cycle -- one life cycle. That's 2 to 3 years. 2 years may be out. So that's my take on it, but we'll have more color when we give guidance for fiscal '17 in August."

Order activity is always lumpy. You should never expect every year to be the same. Last year, as an example, was a phenomenal and, by the way, record year for the industry and record year for HARMAN. We booked $6.2 billion. No other company has ever booked that much. We were the first one to book that high. And we actually thought that next year might be just $2 billion or $3 billion. We already booked $3.5 billion. So we're very happy. And so if you think now in different form, in last 7 quarters, 4 quarters of '15, 3 quarters of this year, we have booked $10 billion business. I mean, our second biggest competitor has not even booked $5 billion. So we have an amazing momentum going in that direction. That makes me very confident that we're on a very good path as long as we keep costs low and continue to innovate, which we are doing. And by the way, we should not forget, our connected car business will grow because we've invested in services business, in end-to-end service delivery, over-the-air update, cybersecurity. Other competitors have a lot of catching up to do because these are the requirements towards autonomous driving, towards higher penetration rate. So I'm very convinced that we're going in the right direction. Quarter-to-quarter fluctuations, I don't like it, I understand, but we have to live with it."

But it has further opportunity to grow another few hundred million dollars worldwide. So we already got the umbrella contract done. We just have to do some local parts. And in terms of its SOP, we're not allowed to give timing, but this is a pretty fast development. It's a scalable platform, and we will be able to use a lot of technology from the platform. We use this based on Orinoco, which you saw we launched at CES '15. We're happy that platform has taken on and taken off. So this would be, well, fiscal '18 or beginning fiscal '19, I cannot judge on it. But this is good. And on the back of this success, I think we have a number of other similar pursuit in the works."

So let me take the first part here. We have a lot of color on this business. 2, 3 years ago, we had almost $0.5 billion worth of professional audio business. We were growing about 3%, 4",352,"So there are a number of things, and I think Sandy and I will answer. So let me take the first part here. We have a lot of color on this business. 2, 3 years ago, we had almost $0.5 billion worth of professional audio business. We were growing about 3%, 4% a year, and we were generating 15%, 16% EBITDA margin. And at that point, we clearly saw there was a need to create a bigger solution, audio, video switching, lighting and automation, to tie it all together to create a total solution. The businesses we acquired, they came in significantly lower profitability, and the footprint was in very, very high-cost countries, whether United States, Switzerland, Denmark and U.K. So that actually diluted the margins in the first place. And now we had to do the work. While we were integrating the IT systems, the payrolls and what have you, we had to build the sales force so that we can sell not products, but the total solution. That's going on. So we do expect once we are done with this sales channel rationalization, which means not only retraining our salespeople, bringing some new people and also adjusting to new distribution channels, including going direct in some markets, and we are doing that, by the way, we should hit mid-single digit to even high, in 2 years, 3 years' time, growth. But that's more -- most important thing is profitability. Profitability, already next year, I would like to see coming into 14%, 15% profitability for the whole division because we will have this faster consolidation already coming in. In addition, we have identified some more cost rationalization, which we will drive in fiscal '17 already. So if I can sort of speak ahead of guidance, fiscal '17, we expect right around mid-teen EBITDA margin, 14%, 15%, around that if everything goes. And '17, we should be looking at 16%, 17% even because we will have some more cost reduction rationalization. I would like to invite our CFO to also weigh on some of the inventory and some of the other things."

When you look at the year-over-year margin performance, there were 3 major factors that impacted the margin. The first that -- first, we continued doing some discounting, not only to clear out some older inventory, but we need to support our global distribution partners. Some of those partners are still impacted by currency impacts due to the continued strong dollar. And then the second point is leverage. Once we get the top line going in this business, we get very good leverage on the top line. And the third factor was we did incur some incremental costs this quarter that were largely associated with migrating our footprint out of the U.K. and Denmark into our site into Hungary."

We have said 50% of the car market has either basic AM/FM radio or nothing at all.

And that has capabilities pretty much what you would expect in an entry system, what we had been doing without inbuilt navigation. We have always said that that's the entry system. We have been doing entry system. But this time, it is a system which does not have a built-in navigation, which you can bring your own device. We have always been consistent on that. And I'll repeat what I said earlier in the call. I believe, towards semi-autonomous and autonomous driving experience, display audio is not your answer. Full stop. This is the beginning. This is what you get people started with, and then they can grow their system, or the first-generation car you buy, either you upgrade it, which we will develop our service offerings or you'll buy a next car, which is a lot more embedded. That has been very consistent explanation from me and my management team. And we still believe that's the way it's going.

This morning, we reported our 12th consecutive quarter of top and bottom line growth and delivered an impressive 26% year-over-year improvement in EBITDA. However, the results across the divisions",2064,"Thank you, Yijing, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. This morning, we reported our 12th consecutive quarter of top and bottom line growth and delivered an impressive 26% year-over-year improvement in EBITDA. However, the results across the divisions were mixed. Our Connected Car and Lifestyle Audio businesses continued to perform well, and I'm extremely excited about the new award we have secured, particularly a breakthrough infotainment award for the entry market in the display/audio category. I'll provide additional color on this in a minute.
At the same time, we continue to face some macroeconomic and transitional challenges in our Professional Solutions and Connected Services divisions. We have already taken decisive steps in our Professional Solutions division to better position us for growth and improve our cost structure. We're confident that we are taking the right actions to put us on a path for future growth in Professional Solutions and to restore margins to historic high levels of profitability.
For the total company, net sales increased 11% to $1.6 billion. Our performance on the top line and rigorous cost-improvement efforts resulted in the strong double-digit EBITDA. We expected -- we expanded our operating margins and generated $198 million in EBITDA -- I repeat, $189 million in EBITDA, again, an increase of 26%, and reported earnings per share of $1.36. EPS was up 11% compared to the prior year.
The overall results in our 2 largest divisions, representing 75% of our company's revenue, that is Connected Car and Lifestyle Audio, were strong. Typically, our third quarter has the weakest margin in our automotive businesses. However, we were able to better align the timing of savings from our supplier base with the timing of annual price reductions. On top of that, our quality initiatives helped to reduce warranty expense, and we realized further leverage and scale in our automotive businesses.
When you put together additional measures we have shown with operational excellence, including procurement, savings and quality, with greater scale, the result is an over 200 basis point expansion in EBITDA margin.
While I'm very encouraged by our performance on the bottom line, the top line in Connected Car was lighter than we anticipated. As the quarter unfolded, certain customers shifted out production schedules to allow dealers to adjust inventory levels. Let me be very clear. We're not seeing any drop-off in take rates. In fact, demand for embedded solutions continue to gain traction.
During the quarter, I spent a number of weeks discussing connected car technology with top executives at our OEM customer base here in North America, Germany, Japan and China. This is one common theme we always heard that they all emphasize; the absolute requirement for an embedded solution that delivers a seamless, secure and personalized in vehicle experience. They look to HARMAN as a proven partner, and we are delivering on these increasing demands, with the most robust compute platform for embedded infotainment systems as well as unrivaled portfolio of audio brands and sound management solutions.
At the end of fiscal 2015, we had an industry-leading backlog of $23 billion, and we have secured $3.5 billion of new automotive awards year-to-date. This is on top of the record $6.2 billion of new awards we announced last fiscal year. That's almost $10 billion of new automotive awards over the last 7 quarters. I think that's clearly indicating a strong momentum towards what the theme we have been saying for a number of years.
I want to take a moment to remind you about the evolving nature of the infotainment market. At our Investor Day last August, you may recall we spoke about how the market breaks down. Roughly 25% of cars produced today have an embedded infotainment solution. This is where we are already the market leader. Another 25% of the cars produced today have a display audio solution, which you can think of as a connected radio but without any onboard navigation capabilities. The remaining 50% of the market ships from the factory with either a simple AM/FM radio or with no radio at all. We agree with industry experts and automakers that this 50% of the market will migrate upward to embedded solutions. HARMAN has been developing solutions for both of these categories. And for those of you who have attended CES or the Geneva Auto Show will know that HARMAN offers scalable platform solutions that cover the full range of automobile classes, from luxury to entry models.
That's why I'm so pleased to share the news with you today that we have received our first major infotainment award in the display audio category. This win is significant for us for 2 reasons. First, the customer is new to HARMAN in the connected car category, and the award is a competitive replacement. Secondly, this will underscore HARMAN's ability to effectively address multiple segments of the global market through our scalable platform strategy.
Notwithstanding the good work and the progress in our Connected Car and Lifestyle Audio divisions, we did experience challenges in the performance of our other 2 businesses. First, in our Professional Solutions division. Brazil and certain European markets continue to be soft. In addition, we have been rationalizing our channels to support the transition from a product-based approach to a solutions-based go-to-market strategy. Last October, we introduced this structure, focusing particularly on end-to-end solutions for targeted vertical segments within enterprise and entertainment markets. To accomplish this, we have put considerable effort in aligning our internal resources, training or replacing our sales team, along with the distribution channel partners they work through. We absolutely believe this is the right structure. However, it is a complex change, and it takes time. While I'm not satisfied with this performance or the timeline, I believe we have built the strongest portfolio in the industry. Our total solution approach allows us to cross-sell audio, lighting, video switching and enterprise automation.
On the cost side, we did complete the consolidation of our European manufacturing locations into single best-cost facility in Hungary. While the migration of 2 high-cost sites in Europe took an additional quarter to complete due to complexities of European labor laws, the plant in Hungary is now fully operational, manufacturing both mixers and lighting products. We expect to realize the benefits from these actions during fiscal year 2017.
In our Connected Services division, there are 2 factors impacting our top line. First, the aftermarket audio business that we moved from our Lifestyle division has a large exposure in Brazil and Russia. Second, in our engineering services business, we have been prioritizing our organization on strategic customers with the highest growth opportunities in the verticals where we have competitive advantage, specifically, automotive, mobile and communications and enterprise. That is really at the expense of short-term revenue. We're walking away from smaller accounts that do not have the ability to scale up. On top of that, we're investing in over-the-air update technology that we acquired from Redbend at an accelerated rate. Over-the-air updates is the foundation technology for the connected car, allowing automakers to quickly enable new features, fix bugs, upgrade firmware and offer a rich suite of end-to-end services.
The legacy Symphony Teleca business we acquired continues to generate margins in the mid-teens, which is in line with our expectations.
As a result of some of these headwinds, particularly in our Professional Solutions division as well as the impact from the earthquake in Japan, we are modestly revising our full year guidance. Our Chief Financial Officer, Sandy Rowland, will provide you with a more detailed walk in her remarks.
Let me take a closer look at our divisions and review some recent notable achievements. Let's start with our Connected Car division, which is highlighted on Slide 7 of our investor presentation. In Connected Car, we continue to expand and diversify our customer base and add to our industry-leading backlog. In addition to the new display audio infotainment award I mentioned earlier, we won a new global platform expansion award for a European automaker to support higher take rates as well as a platform refresh for their 2017 vehicles. In addition, we received a follow-on award to expand the next-generation integrated telematics program for Daimler.
HARMAN launched embedded infotainment solutions in a number of new vehicles from leading car companies, including Audi, Volkswagen Group's Fiat and Fiat Chrysler Automotive Group's Maserati. In Japan, HARMAN launched an embedded infotainment system from Suzuki, featuring Apple CarPlay. We also launched model refreshes and line extensions, featuring our embedded infotainment solutions in several Porsche and Mercedes-Benz vehicles. In March, we completed the acquisition of TowerSec. Their leading automotive cybersecurity solutions will be integrated into HARMAN's 5+1 cybersecurity framework. The acquisitions we have made, including Redbend, OTA, best positions HARMAN to be leader in automotive cybersecurity and truly connected car.
Now turning to the Lifestyle Audio division. Some of our recent notable achievements are highlighted on Slide 8 of the investor presentation. During the quarter, we secured new car audio awards from Lincoln, Toyota and Subaru. We also launched Harman Kardon and Bowers & Wilkins-branded solutions with Fiat Chrysler Automotive's Maserati and Alfa Romeo, Revel-branded solutions with Lincoln and JBL Pro-branded solutions with Ferrari.
In March, we inaugurated new global product development center in Suzhou, China. The facility is now our largest comprehensive R&D center for car audio products worldwide. HARMAN is the only car audio supplier to have full value chain capabilities in China, including sourcing, R&D, engineering, production, technical support and distribution. And this will pay off big time in the long run.
Turning to consumer audio. I'm pleased to share that HARMAN's award-winning AKG active noise-canceling headphones will replace Bose on all Lufthansa's business-class seats around the world. This new and strategic multiyear agreement with Lufthansa begins in September 2016.
Finally, I should note that our consumer audio products were again recognized for their excellence in design and innovation, winning a record 23 Red Dot awards. Ladies and gentlemen, I remind you, consumer audio tightly supports our car audio growth, and we are seeing them in tandem. And this is a great news for the company and our shareholders.
Now turning to the Professional Solutions division highlighted on Slide 9 of the investor presentation. During the quarter, new enterprise installations included NFL Stadium in Tampa Bay, a new ship for Norwegian Cruise Lines and corporate facilities across the globe for eBay and Societe Generale. Our solutions also powered the Super Bowl 50 Halftime Show and 58th Annual GRAMMY Awards and several artist concert tours.
Now turning to the Connected Services division highlighted on Slide 10 of the investor presentation. During the quarter, we secured follow-on business to provide product development services for Blackberry, Dell, Intel, British Telecom and Sony, among others. HARMAN continues to strengthen its partnership with Google in device management, software certification and system integration. In addition, HARMAN continued to capitalize on its industry-leading OTA software update technology, winning a cross-car line award with a global automaker. I'm extremely pleased to share with you, now our backlog of OTA awards is just over $150 million, and this is all software business. We are winning very rapidly in the space.
In conjunction with our services delivery platform, we introduced our automotive service provider program. This will facilitate the integration of a variety of enterprise and vehicle-centric applications and services from leading providers for OEMs. We added 10 new data, workflow and content service providers for our open platform, which enables automakers to provide a wide range of context-based services, including real-time traffic and location-based services. Let me remind you that our service delivery platform and our partnership program are the first of their kind in the industry. We're defining the cloud-based end-to-end service delivery platform for the connected car industry. In addition, HARMAN received recognition for its software engineering services capabilities from respected advisory firms, including Zinnov and HfS.
In summary, I'm pleased with the performance of our Connected Car and Lifestyle Audio divisions, and I'm also encouraged by the trends in the industry and the new business we have secured. Where we face challenges, we're taking aggressive actions. We will continue to focus on relentless execution across all of our divisions to deliver above-market top and bottom line growth.
Now I will turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Sandy Rowland, who will give you additional color on our financial results for the quarter."

Let me walk you through our financial highlights for the quarter. As a reminder, most of my financial remarks are provided on an operational basis, which excludes restructuring, nonrecurring and acquisition-related items. I want to point out that the majority of the difference between our GAAP and operational results is due to the noncash amortization of intangible assets recognized as a result of our recent acquisitions. The full reconciliation of our GAAP to our operational results is included in the press release that we issued this morning.
This quarter, our revenues were $1.6 billion, an increase of 11% compared to the prior year. Revenue in our Connected Car division increased 5% versus the prior year, primarily due to higher take rates. Revenue in our Lifestyle Audio division increased 11% compared to the prior year. The increase in net sales was primarily due to the acquisition of Bang & Olufsen's automotive business, higher car audio take rates and higher consumer audio sales.
Revenue in our Professional Solutions division decreased 4% compared to the prior year, mainly due to lower demand in Brazil and certain European markets as well as the channel rationalization to support a solutions-based go-to-market structure.
Revenue in our Connected Services division was $166 million in the quarter compared to $67 million a year ago. The increase in revenue was primarily due to the expansion of our services portfolio as a result of the acquisition of Symphony Teleca.
Total company gross margin increased 160 basis points to 30.4%. The improvement was primarily due to improved leverage of fixed costs on higher sales volume and lower warranty costs.
Connected Car and Lifestyle Audio gross margins both increased 370 basis points to 26.4% and 35.5%, respectively. Both divisions benefited from better leverage of fixed costs, lower warranty expenses as a result of better quality and supplier productivity. As Dinesh mentioned earlier, we better aligned the timing of savings from our supplier base with the timing of annual price reductions from OEMs, resulting in strong margin performance this quarter.
Professional Solutions gross margin decreased 780 basis points to 33.7%, driven by discounts on older inventory and to partially offset foreign currency impacts at the distribution level. In addition, we incurred incremental costs associated with relocating manufacturing to Hungary and had reduced operating leverage as a result of lower sales. Connected Services gross margins were 28.7%.
Our SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales increased 30 basis points from the prior year to 21.3%. Connected Car SG&A increased 110 basis points to 13.6% due to higher information technology costs to support future business. Lifestyle Audio SG&A increased 250 basis points to 22% due to higher research and development to support new car audio awards. SG&A expense in Professional Solutions decreased 190 basis points to 30.6%, driven by tight expense control. Connected Services SG&A as a percentage of sales was 20.3%. And finally, corporate SG&A as a percentage of sales declined by 60 basis points to 2.2%. As you would expect, we are managing our expenses across all of our divisions and corporate functions tightly due to some of the macroeconomic headwinds.
Putting it all together, our consolidated operating income was $148 million compared to $114 million in the prior year, a 30% increase. EPS was $1.36 compared to $1.22 in the prior year, up 11%.
Now let me provide you with a few updates on capital allocation. In the quarter, we increased our borrowings under our revolving credit facility and used the cash to make the second payment for the Symphony Teleca acquisition in the amount of $216 million. In addition, we funded the TowerSec acquisition with $41 million of cash on hand.
On top of that, we were active in the market. We spent $25 million to repurchase approximately 309,000 shares. Year-to-date, we have now repurchased approximately 803,000 shares at a cost of $75 million. We now have approximately $425 million remaining on our board-authorized share repurchase program, which runs until October 2017.
In addition, we expect strong cash flow generation in the fourth quarter, consistent with our historical trend.
Now let me walk you through our revised outlook. We now forecast fiscal 2016 revenue of approximately $6.825 billion. Of the $175 million shortfall compared to the guidance that we issued in August, approximately $100 million is related to Professional Solutions, $85 million is related to Connected Car and $60 million is from Connected Services. Approximately $70 million in higher revenues in Lifestyle Audio partially offset these impacts. Included in our outlook is a $30 million to $40 million reduction in our fourth quarter revenue as a result of supply constraints caused by the recent earthquakes in Japan. Approximately 80% of the impact is in our Connected Car division, and the remaining 20% is in our Lifestyle Audio division.
Turning to EPS. We now forecast operational earnings per share of $6.20. We guided you to EPS of $6.50 back in August. As we discussed last quarter, our acquisition of TowerSec will be dilutive to earnings by approximately $0.05 as it is a bolt-on technology investment. The remaining $0.25 of the EPS shortfall is related to weakness in our Professional Solutions division.
While we are slightly behind in our Connected Services earnings targets, we expect that lower corporate costs and slightly lower below-the-line costs will offset the shortfall. We expect that both the Lifestyle Audio and Connected Car divisions will achieve their earnings targets that we established in August. Higher profitability as a percentage of sales in Connected Car will offset the shortfall in revenue.
In summary, our 2 largest divisions representing 75% of our company, Connected Car and Lifestyle Audio, continue to perform well. We are addressing the challenges in our 2 smaller divisions to better position these businesses for long-term sustainable growth.
Thank you for your attention, and now Dinesh and I are happy to take your questions."

Let me take that one. So first of all, revenue shortfall in Connected Car. Frankly, we did not expect and we did not know when we announced our second quarter result in January that some of the OEMs which happened, ended up pushing the production out. Now we hope all of that push will be realized in Q4, but that is to be seen, how much would that be realized and how much would that not be realized entirely. As an example, North America, FCA production was down 7% in the quarter, and Chrysler actually stopped 200 -- Chrysler 200 complete production. So those were the impacts which were not known at the beginning, and that was one factor. Another factor is China. As we have quoted, the luxury car sales seriously suffered in Q2. And we said we expect momentum to shift, and momentum has shifted. We actually saw pretty good pickup in Q3, and we think it will continue in that direction, slightly get better into Q4, but still below our high level of growth we have seen in China. So it's the right direction. That's one part. Second piece, you asked about timing of aligning our productivity improvement due to supply chain to annual price reductions. This is something I call process improvement, which we like to stay with, and hopefully, we'll repeat that. But that is really not a onetime. I mean, you have to spread it over the full year as we don't give a guidance quarter-over-quarter. However, I must remind, this Q3 was very strong performance from profitability point of view, which we're very happy. But Q4 may come in right around 14% -- just over 14%. That will still put us for full year profitability slightly ahead of what we guided the market for, which I'm very happy about. So that's pretty much what I wanted to say that the guidance was 13.6%. That is 13.6% guidance and will probably come in higher than that, both in absolute EBITDA and in percent margin. And that really is very important for our shareholders to know that cost control, the discipline of getting the orders we take and how we deliver is really sticking, and margin expansion is constantly evolving quarter after quarter."

And on top of that, Redbend over-the-air technology we moved in, that's still a developmental. When we acquired the businesses, we were losing about $10 million, and we actually accelerated the development, so it will be $15 million to $16 million drain on the bottom line for that reason. So when you add it all together, that affects the bottom line. However, we should still come out -- this business to be double-digit margin, right around 13% EBITDA for the full year, which is below my expectation of 15%. But when you factor in a $15 million, $16 million loss in Redbend and lower-margin in aftermarket audio business, it's holding up quite well in the core business of Connected Services."

I mean, we have lifted a lot of mountains in our automotive, car audio and infotainment, and we know the playbook how it works. So this is fixable. It has taken a little longer. Q4 has seasonal leverage, as always, so Q4 will be definitely much better than Q2 and Q3. However, from the growth point of view, I am not expecting so much of an improvement. It should come in right around where the growth was in Q3. That is still about 5% below last year's quarter. But the profitability will come back up. It should be, as we have seen always, in the high -- it's in the teens. But all in all, coming back to all the cost-reduction actions we have taken, yes, you should expect $10 million to $15 million falling to the bottom line due to 2 of the high-cost factories in Europe. We already moved them, and this is all done, behind us. It took us an extra quarter, but still, we will see the profitability improvement in fiscal '17. The top line might take a little more, 1 or 2 quarter extra than I anticipated, I admit, because the culture change of moving people from product-selling mindset to solution-selling mindset is proving to be a little harder than we thought. And that means we're training harder, and we're also not holding ourselves from replacing and finding people from outside, those who are good in solution selling. And we are seeing good signs. We're taking orders. You might have seen some of the enterprise orders we have recently booked, they're not converted into revenue, are very encouraging. I'm very happy to see. So all in all, it's going in the right direction. And you can count on -- that Sandy and I and the rest of the management team is truly focused on growth because this is one area we know how to fix it, and we'll fix it. So timing. So fiscal '17 should be a lot better than fiscal '16."

Ryan, I'm glad that you reminded that because we did not want to let go excellent development in Connected Car to be washed away from Professional lack of expectation performance. Connected Car and Lifestyle both are performing extremely well. I remind all of us that it's 75% of the company, that's the core. Supplier productivity alignment, I think David Slump and his team, they've done a great job in bringing strength of mind, tremendous discipline and working with our suppliers with IT. And that's another area we invested in our IT division so that we can really see things happening with our suppliers. And lower warranty cost is actually a discipline also in quality. We have been doing a lot of work in product execution and quality improvement, so that is sustainable, I believe. Scale matters a lot in this business. So car audio and infotainment have achieved the scale, and we are seeing margins really swelling that you saw a 370 basis point improvement in gross margin for both divisions. Coincidentally, both divisions saw that. And R&D, I think, is getting a lot more efficient. In this quarter particularly, we did benefit slightly from the stronger reimbursement from our customers. But again, I would not like you to think that this is one-off, it is not, because the R&D reimbursement vary quarter-to-quarter. We always try to maximize. So 15.2% EBITDA margin, by the way, is the record EBITDA margin for any quarter for Connected Car. We do expect for full year to be around just 14% or slightly north of 14% EBITDA. That's still ahead of what we guided the market back in August. So this is very positive. And last I'll say, look, we are going beyond what market we have been leading. We've gotten into successfully in display audio infotainment, and we have won a sizable business from a North American OEM, replacing a competitor, and adding a new lever in our business. So this is another very positive development for the company."

We think at the end of the day, it's most likely a mixed bag. There will be some production that likely gets shifted into Q1. But on the other hand, if the shortfall is from some of the higher-content materials and the OEMs take the decision to de-content a little bit to keep production going, then that won't [ph] carry over and benefit us in Q1. So at the end of the day, our best estimate is that it's between $30 million and $40 million impacting Q4. We think it will be contained all within Q4 and should be a mixed bag on how it splits out."

That takes us back to our August Investor Day presentation. We described that in a pie chart, draw a horizontal line to divide the pie into 2.

We described that in a pie chart, draw a horizontal line to divide the pie into 2. And then the top pie gets divided into another 25, 25 percentile. 25% is the fully embedded infotainment system. That is your telematics, that's your navigation, multimedia and what have you. And then the other 25% is display audio, which I would like to describe in a simplistic word; that is really your radio with a large screen without inbuilt navigation capability. The bottom half of the pie is really your very low-end traditional AM/FM radio or nothing at all. So what's happening, the growth in the top 2 quartile of the pie, the fully embedded and display audio. Display audio has further evolved into 2 basic display unit with some CarPlay capability. That's again, as I described, not inbuilt navigation capability but bring your own device. So that happens, and we are doing that. So those 2 are fastest-growing, and people say that no bright [ph] lines align between these 2 because what I think, and I just base on what I'm hearing, that the lines will further sort of get blurred between display audio and fully embedded. But if you think and if you believe in, what's going to happen to fully connected car? What's -- what would be required in semi-autonomous car? You will have a lot more sense of fusion. You will have a lot more safety security, active safety, ATOS, telematics, full-blown navigation, built into it. Otherwise you cannot rely [ph] on car. So I think display audio will actually move more and more towards the fully embedded, and this would be in phases because people who buy entry-level car will perhaps start with that, and they will demand from technology providers, do you have a path to upgrade my system online once I have bought the car? And that's fair. What has been holding up the take rates from going 4% or 3% linearly to nonlinear is there was no mechanism to  over-the-air update technology. Only one car company in the Bay Area started doing it. And by the way, we are doing that, too, over-the-air update. So now with OTA technology we've acquired from Redbend, and we have already signed up more than 6 OEMs worldwide to use that technology. This will expedite feature refresh upgrade applications. That's why we signed up 10 providers for technology. So I think we're going to give users -- they can now customize. They can start with something if they don't have enough fund to begin with. But the all -- mid to luxury cars would be going more and more fully embedded systems. So I think as we go towards more and more autonomous driving, you will not see the bottom of the pie left at nothing, that nothing will not serve because that's the pressure everybody has. And that's what I thought I heard from all OEMs I visited extensively, Germany, Japan, China, United States. And we're hearing the same thing, the high take rates. In fact, our display audio award we have received, it had extremely high penetration rate. And I believe in it because that would be the base for the all-entry systems going forward."

This is the step -- first step for those who could never buy embedded system. By the way, since you mentioned 2 or 3 times the different definition, I'm also hearing different definitions. In fact, some of the competitors are using cockpit, whether it's instrument cluster or anything else, as loosely as navigation or infotainment. That is not correct. In fact, those are the standard instrument clusters. They are merging. They are getting into similar space. That's why they're also driving it, but from a capability point of view, infotainment remains very clearly well defined."

I actually don't think that it's a soft patch which I'm worried about. I think, overall, this business of connected car will still be coming out for the full year right around 10%, 11% top line. And lifestyle car audio business is also really firing on all cylinders. Most importantly, the indication I see, what is happening in order activity? And I'm very, very happy with that because that's the forward trend. That $23 billion was the backlog as of last year, fiscal '15. Since then, we have already booked $3.5 billion, and $2.3 billion of that came from Connected Car. And we're not done yet because Q4 is lining up to be, again, a pretty strong quarter for our order activity. So I think OEMs are coming in and placing large orders. They cannot avoid if there are some inventory issues here and there. And take rates, that's the key point for you and I to talk about because if take rates were soft, I'd be worried. But I'm not. Take rates are holding up quite well. We're tracking very well what we guided. So between production and take rates, this quarter was 65% take rate and 35% production. So even if production is modest development over the next couple of 3 years, take rate will start to get nonlinear. I absolutely believe, whether it's in '17, I -- we're not giving guidance right now, but is it '17, I don't know. But one thing for sure, every OEM is saying it's not going to take 5 years to get to 65% penetration. It may not happen first 2 years, but linear to nonlinear is going to happen anywhere from one cycle -- one life cycle. That's 2 to 3 years. 2 years may be out. So that's my take on it, but we'll have more color when we give guidance for fiscal '17 in August."

Order activity is always lumpy. You should never expect every year to be the same. Last year, as an example, was a phenomenal and, by the way, record year for the industry and record year for HARMAN. We booked $6.2 billion. No other company has ever booked that much. We were the first one to book that high. And we actually thought that next year might be just $2 billion or $3 billion. We already booked $3.5 billion. So we're very happy. And so if you think now in different form, in last 7 quarters, 4 quarters of '15, 3 quarters of this year, we have booked $10 billion business. I mean, our second biggest competitor has not even booked $5 billion. So we have an amazing momentum going in that direction. That makes me very confident that we're on a very good path as long as we keep costs low and continue to innovate, which we are doing. And by the way, we should not forget, our connected car business will grow because we've invested in services business, in end-to-end service delivery, over-the-air update, cybersecurity. Other competitors have a lot of catching up to do because these are the requirements towards autonomous driving, towards higher penetration rate.

We have a lot of color on this business. 2, 3 years ago, we had almost $0.5 billion worth of professional audio business. We were growing about 3%, 4% a year, and we were generating 15%, 16% EBITDA margin. And at that point, we clearly saw there was a need to create a bigger solution, audio, video switching, lighting and automation, to tie it all together to create a total solution. The businesses we acquired, they came in significantly lower profitability, and the footprint was in very, very high-cost countries, whether United States, Switzerland, Denmark and U.K. So that actually diluted the margins in the first place. And now we had to do the work. While we were integrating the IT systems, the payrolls and what have you, we had to build the sales force so that we can sell not products, but the total solution. That's going on. So we do expect once we are done with this sales channel rationalization, which means not only retraining our salespeople, bringing some new people and also adjusting to new distribution channels, including going direct in some markets, and we are doing that, by the way, we should hit mid-single digit to even high, in 2 years, 3 years' time, growth. But that's more -- most important thing is profitability. Profitability, already next year, I would like to see coming into 14%, 15% profitability for the whole division because we will have this faster consolidation already coming in. In addition, we have identified some more cost rationalization, which we will drive in fiscal '17 already. So if I can sort of speak ahead of guidance, fiscal '17, we expect right around mid-teen EBITDA margin, 14%, 15%, around that if everything goes. And '17, we should be looking at 16%, 17% even because we will have some more cost reduction rationalization. I would like to invite our CFO to also weigh on some of the inventory and some of the other things."

We have said 50% of the car market has either basic AM/FM radio or nothing at all. That would move towards fully embedded system, what we are world leader at, or some sort of a hybrid, which is the name industry has given is display audio. In fact, I don't even like it because it's not audio, it's actually infotainment. And that has capabilities pretty much what you would expect in an entry system, what we had been doing without inbuilt navigation. We have always said that that's the entry system. We have been doing entry system. But this time, it is a system which does not have a built-in navigation, which you can bring your own device. We have always been consistent on that. And I'll repeat what I said earlier in the call. I believe, towards semi-autonomous and autonomous driving experience, display audio is not your answer. Full stop. This is the beginning. This is what you get people started with, and then they can grow their system, or the first-generation car you buy, either you upgrade it, which we will develop our service offerings or you'll buy a next car, which is a lot more embedded. That has been very consistent explanation from me and my management team. And we still believe that's the way it's going. The good thing is we're playing in both sides because our customers, existing customers, the Germans, Japanese, Americans, are asking that they want both solutions because no car would be left behind, either entry car or mid- and high, and we have solution for all 3, entry, mid- and high."

I am pleased that this morning we announced very strong results for the fourth quarter and full year. Our fourth quarter results came in stronger than our forecast with net sales interesting 12% to $1.9 billion. We expanded our operating margins and delivered a 20% year-over-year improvement in EBITDA and a 14% year-over-year improvement in earnings per share. We successfully mitigated the supply chain disruption in our automotive business following the recent in Japan and they capitalized on increased demand for our consumer audio products in May and June. In addition, our business in China had a strong finish With record full year revenue of approximately $800 million, up nearly 20% from the prior year. I'm also pleased that the Professional Solutions division achieved our Q4 target on top and bottom line. 
The fourth quarter caps and other for HARMAN. Revenue, EBITDA and earnings per share all reached record highs. We exceeded $6.9 billion in revenue and increased up 16%, excluding foreign exchange. EBITDA improved 23% to $836 million and we grew earnings per share by 13% to $6.2. 
I am pleased to report that our automotive backlog now stands at $24.1 billion. Our technology leadership and ability to successfully deploy intelligent connector solutions for the car that are safe and secure is resonating with customers. Not only did we prevent next-generation business from existing customers, we added new automakers to our customer list. Over the last 2 years, we have added $11 billion of new automotive That is momentum. Our record automotive backlog of more than $24 billion provides HARMAN strong foundation for long-term growth. 
Now let me take a closer look at our division and review some recent notable achievements. Let's start with Connected Car division, which is highlighted on Slide 7 of your investor presentation. During the quarter, we secured several new and follow-on awards to provide Connected Car solutions for customers, including Harley-Davidson, Porsche, Toyota and a North American automaker. Advancing our Telematics strategy, we secured an award from a premium German automaker for an industry-first solution for the main gateway into the path, providing a unique connectivity platform. This solution integrates the power -- this solution integrate the powers that expended telematics features and enables system diagnostics, remote control capabilities and system software updates. The automaker will also employ HARMAN's cloud-based over-the-air update technology, ensuring that critical software fixes feature-additions and upgrades can be easily and squarely and safely transmitted and added to the vehicle while on the road. Not only for HARMAN had units but also for on-board from other Tier 1 suppliers. This comprehensive gateway platform is an industry first. HARMAN is the only supplier that these property technologies to create this end-to-end solutions. A product like this is a perfect example of how our bolt-on acquisitions are paying off. We strategically expanded our capabilities in over-the-air update technology, cybersecurity, cloud applications and data analytics. And when we combine this with our own deep expertise in connectivity technology, we can create unique solutions for our customers that are smart, safe, secure and real-time We continue to receive accolades for our industry leadership. In June, HARMAN was named Supplier of the Year at the Automotive Interior Expo in Germany, highlighting our competence in embedded infotainment and telematics solutions. Also, in Consumer Reports, most recent guide to infotainment system, the highest rated system is designed and built by HARMAN as well. 
Now turning to Lifestyle Audio division. Some of our recent notable achievements are highlighted on Slide 8 of the investor presentation. During the quarter, HARMAN won new business awards with Hyundai, Kia, Audi, Lexus, Subaru, in China and Toyota. In addition, we secured our first award for our premium Summit audio platform with an electric vehicle company. This scalable Summit platform provides the foundation to integrate the best of HARMAN's sound processing and sound management technologies along with new features like Connected Jukebox and Virtual Venues to create an unprecedented in-car audio experience. As further proof of HARMAN's leadership in the industry, we won a Ford Excellence award for our audio system in Lincoln vehicles. 
Turning to consumer audio. As I mentioned earlier, we finished a very strong quarter with increasing demand of our award-winning products due to great design and expanded distribution channels. For Lydia, we won a total of 56 design and innovation awards across our consumer audio portfolio. Let me also remind you that we have been selected by Lufthansa to provide our noise cancellation headphones across their fleet. 
Now turning to the Professional Solutions division. In May, we appointed Mohit as the President for the division. Mohit is a seasoned leader with more than 20 years of experience growing audio, video and system business throughout Asia, Middle East and Europe. Mohit brings a new level of energy and sense of urgency to Professional Solutions business. Last year, we implemented our enterprise and entertainment solutions-based go-to-market strategy and we took cost actions in Europe. This year, we are focused on taking additional steps to improve cost structure in North America. We're already seeing encouraging signs of momentum in the enterprise segment. Not only have we booked several significant awards in corporate, government and education markets, we will also launch a number of integrated solutions to support these focused verticals. We expect these actions will help restore Professional to historic levels of growth and profitably. Some of the notable wins and events for the quarter are highlighted on Slide 9 of the investor presentation. 
Now turning to the Connected Services division highlighted on Slide 10, of your presentation. During the quarter, we secured several awards to provide software services for BMW, FCA, Microsoft, BSA and Reliance. In addition, we partnered with NXP Semiconductors to jointly offer new software gateway solutions to the automotive market. We continued to capitalize on our industry-leading cloud-based OTA software update technology, winning awards from leading OEMs, such as FCA, Porsche and Subaru. We now have over $150 million in OTA software auto backlog. And about half of it is in the automotive space covering over a dozen OEMs and growing. 
In summary, this was a year of record across the board at HARMAN. Our success in 2016 demonstrates our team's ability to execute and deliver profitable growth. You would recall, in 2013, we set out an ambitious plan to grow HARMAN revenues to $6 billion by '16. Today, we reported almost $7 billion in revenue and more than doubled our 2013 EBITDA. This morning, we've also provided financial guidance for 2017 and presented a longer-term outlook. Our CFO Sandy Rowland will provide you the details later. 
As we look forward, we see significant growth opportunities across all the divisions. In the automotive space, the industry is experiencing an unprecedented social and technological transformation fueled by increasing intelligent connectivity and supported by autonomous vehicles, and urban mobility. The car is getting an upgrade as never seen before. HARMAN is well-positioned to capitalize on each of these trends. Let me remind you of our portfolio of integrated technologies now include embedded infotainment solutions ranging from display audio to an compute platform addressing entry, mid and high-vehicle classes; enhanced telematics products and gateway resolutions; industry-leading cybersecurity; and OTA products for all ECUs, whether HARMAN supplied or non-HARMAN supplied; superior automotive audio technology like individual sound zones, HALOsonic and Summit; data analytics and back end software services to complement aid our development in the industry. And a number of innovation is still in our pipeline. We have an end-to-end value proposition that automakers are looking for. Building on our strong backlog of awarded business and track record of execution, we expect continued growth in our automotive revenue. At the same time, due to the timing of various automotive program launches and roll-offs, we expect to see lower growth in 2018 followed by strong growth in 2019 and beyond. This is a cycle that is common in our business. We have experienced it before as recently of 2013, as shown on Slide 14 of our presentation. We experienced accelerated growth for several years after the transition year in 2013. In fiscal 2018, we will continue to ramp up new programs and make R&D investments both to deliver on the contracts we have won and to capitalize on the bigger trends we discussed earlier. 
Longer-term, we have confident that we will see accelerated revenue expansion from our automotive backlog, higher-margin automotive services and the increasing market demand for Connected Car and autonomous driving technologies. On top of that, there are additional reasons to be excited. With autonomous driving, the in-car audio experience or sound management becomes even more essential. With our record $6.6 billion of car audio backlog and continued growth in take rates, we expect car audio continue to lead the company in profitability and grow faster than the company average. In addition, we have confident in the turnaround of our professional business. With all the action we have taken, we're optimistic that we can return margins to historical levels over the medium term. Together with the continued growth in our consumer audio business and increasing opportunities in Connected Services, we are squarely on the path towards achieving our goal of $11 billion in revenue by 2021. 
Now I will turn the call over to Sandy, who will give you additional color on our financial results."

Let me walk you through our financial highlights for the quarter and provide additional detail on our outlook for fiscal year 2017 and beyond. As a reminder, most of my financial remarks are provided on an op",1104,"Thank you, Dinesh, and good morning, everyone. Let me walk you through our financial highlights for the quarter and provide additional detail on our outlook for fiscal year 2017 and beyond. As a reminder, most of my financial remarks are provided on an operational basis, which excludes acquisition-related items, restructuring and nonrecurring charges. The full reconciliation of our GAAP to our operational results is included in the press release that we issued this morning. This quarter, our revenues were $1.9 billion, an increase of 12% compared to the prior year. Revenue in our Connected Car division increased 11% versus the prior year, primarily due to higher take rates and stronger production. Revenue in our Lifestyle Audio division increased 25% compared to the prior year. The increase in net sales was primarily due to higher take rates and the acquisition of Bang & Olufsen automotive in car audio and higher consumer audio sales driven by continued strong demand for smart audio solutions. Revenue in our Professional Solutions division increased 1% compared to the prior year. Revenue in our Connected Services division increased 7% to $185 million in the quarter compared to $173 million a year ago, primarily due to higher demand for engineering services. Total company gross margin increased 110 basis points to 30.5% primacy to do due to the impact of higher sales volume, leveraging a more efficient fixed production cost based and productivity initiative. Connected Car growth margin increased 300 basis points to 25.5% and Lifestyle Audio gross margin increased 380 basis points to 35.1%, both benefiting from better leverage of fixed cost, lower warranty expenses and manufacturing productivity. Professional Solutions gross margin decreased 340 basis points to 36.7%, driven by product mix and new factory startup cost in Hungary. 
In Connected Services, the timing of booked revenue is tied to specific milestone and longer-term engineering projects, while expenses are recognized as incurred. This can result in margin volatility. As a result, for the fourth quarter, Connected Services growth margin declined 850 basis points to 28.2%. Beginning in fiscal 2017, we used percentage of accounting for significant new contracts. This is expected to reduce some of the volatility. 
Our SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 20 basis points from the prior year to 20.7%. Connected Car SG&A increased a 110 basis points to 14.1% and Lifestyle Audio SG&A increased 20 basis points to 20.2%, both due to do higher research and development cost to support awarded business. 
SG&A expense in Professional Solutions remained in line with our prior year. Connected Services SG&A as a percentage of sales decreased 180 basis points to 18.2% due to better leverage on higher sales. Finally, corporate SG&A as a percentage of sales declined by 10 basis points to 2.3%. Putting it all together, our consolidated operating income was $185 million compared to $115 million in the prior year, a 24% increase. But all the line, we had higher income tax expenses in the quarter due to an increase in U.S. tax from deemed income on foreign earnings and jurisdictional mix resulting in higher than forecasted effective tax rate. EPS was $1.57 compared to a $1.37 in the prior year, up 14%. 
Now turning to the full year and fiscal year 2016 revenue, EBITDA and EPS, all reached record highs for HARMAN. Revenue was $6.9 billion, an increase of 16% excluding foreign exchange. And EBITDA reached $836 million, a 23% increase excluding foreign exchange, and we grew EPS from $5.71 to $6.24, a 13% increase excluding foreign exchange. 
Now let me spend a few minutes on cash and capital allocation. In fiscal 2016, we generated nearly $450 million of cash flow from operations driven by strong earnings and affective working capital management and we invested approximately $200 million in capital expenditures. In the fiscal year, we repurchased approximately 1.6 million shares at a cost of $140 million. Combined with $100 million in dividend, we returned a record $240 million to our shareholders over half of our cash generated from operations. We ended the fiscal year with $602 million in cash. Across the board, this wraps up a solid fiscal year for HARMAN. 
Now let's turn to our guidance for fiscal 2017. First, we are making a slight adjustment to our divisional reporting structure. We will move our aftermarket car audio business from the Connected Services division to the lifestyle audio division as this product line shares our consumers go-to-market organization and the consumer product innovation center in China. 
Slide 16 shows the impact is approximately $60 million in revenue on the full year basis. 
As Dinesh indicated, we are targeting between $7.3 million and $7.5 billion in revenue for fiscal 2017 and between $900 million and $940 million in EBITDA. Our forecast is based on a number of keys namely global GDP growth of approximately 2.5%, global automotive production growth between 2% and 3%, global industry embedded infotainment take rates increasing from about 27% to 30%, and a euro to dollar exchange rate of 1.10. We expect top line growth and EBITDA expansion across all four division. Furthermore, we expect about $180 million in depreciation and amortization expenses, between $50 million and $60 million in interest expense and charges and we estimate that our tax rate will be between 27.5% and 28% and we have assumed a similar level of share repurchase as fiscal 2016. Assuming approximately 72 million shares outstanding, our EPS will be between $6.75 and $7. We will remain opportunistic in buying back our shares incrementally to our current plan. We have approximately $360 million remaining on our board authorized shares repurchase program, which runs until October 2017. This morning we also provided a longer-term outlook. Our regarding the macroeconomic and automotive production environment are similar to our 2017 guidance assumption. We are targeting a high single-digit revenue CAGR over the next 3 years approximately $8.6 billion in revenue by fiscal 2019. In addition, we expect to grow our EBITDA margins to about 13.5% in fiscal '19, representing a 140 basis point improvement compared to fiscal year 2016. As Dinesh pointed out, we do expect to lower revenue growth in fiscal 2018 due to the timing of various automotive program launches and loss. In subsequent years, we will have a number of new programs reaching full-scale, positioning us for accelerated growth. 
In summary, we are pleased with our fiscal 2016 performance, we have set robust target for fiscal 2017 and the next 3 years and we are focus on innovation and execution to deliver against these target. Thank you for your attention. Dinesh and I are now happy to take your questions."

Yes, first of all, we're very happy with 2016 record revenue and EBITDA and EPS. And with the great backlog we have, especially I repeat, $11 billion order bookings in the last 2 years, that gives us momentum. So we're very confident about out years. As we dedicated 2018 outlook is a slower growth, and in fact, flattish Connected Car revenue. And that is primarily due to rolling off of some of the programs while we're still ramping up the last programs about in Europe and North America. But they will not fully at scale. So that's what is reflected in '19 and 2021, double-digit growth, and we have number of North American and even Asian programs coming up, which also have very good margins. So we feel very good about '19, '21. Also '18 is actually a very good year. We are still growing and we are still expanding our margins. Let me also mention one highlight, which is reflected in our guidance and has impacted '18 slower growth. As you all know, that in North America, we have a great customer in FCA, Automotive, and we still supply to them as last part of infotainment comes from HARMAN. In fact, we are the primary supplier of audio. And in fact in June, the consumer reports even named it as a top infotainment, what is using from HARMAN. Having said that, there are multiple suppliers of infotainment to FCA, which I have said in my earlier call. Based on FCAs current sourcing strategy, our infotainment volume in fiscal '18 may be lower. And it is reflected in our 2018 guidance and beyond. As you are aware, we have won a couple of follow-on awards as well as over update awards with them for across the car line globally. On top of that, we are also continuing to ship audio and infotainment. And with that said, our strong relationship with FCA, we're well-positioned for the next-generation infotainment program, which we expect to be available for bidding in next 12 to 18 months."

And then my next and last question is on the impact if any that you see to HARMAN from the potential litigious of Fiat Chrysler business by Samsung Electronics. I don't think there is much overlap between your 2 business currently, but there has been some speculation that Samsung could perhaps be interested in using some sort of launchpad to get into automotive infotainment. So what you can say about the barriers to entry on the embedded side or what competitive advantages that you have that you think you keep newer entrants at bay on the embedded side? And then if were to get into more connected audio sort of our Apple extent to that which is not necessarily a competitive threat?"

In fact, similar to another smaller sort of player in North America, which was up for the sale, which people have has also tried to sell their infotainment business over the last several years. And we have worked with them often on, but they really make a viable player as is. And especially when you think about how fast the space is changing, it's not about traditional instrument plus thorough infotainment or basic amplification and the speakers, it has moved on to a full connectivity, intelligence, over-the-air update, cybersecurity, scalable end-to-end service platform. It's all about analytics, which will partner with the companies like Mobileye. I think the sensors information and create information. So it's a scale, it's the technology, it's the R&D power. So we will see what that means if that acquisition happens. But we see almost no impact on our current or in our near to midterm future."

So let's start with Professional Solutions business, then I talk about Connected Services. So first of all, this is a good business. We have a built a robust portfolio of audio, video, lighting and automation, and we have expanded our customer segment to corporate, government and education beyond traditional recording studios and sound. This does has a four-pronged turnaround strategy, which I feel very comfortable with. The number 1 starts with leadership, sense of urgency. We have fixed that. #2, we're addressing that channels. Channels, we're going some market direct, some we're going indirect, but we're training the channels to sell the solutions to enterprise and entertainment segment. And the third is, cross leadership. You know us in HARMAN, we are really paranoid about cost every year, and automotive is a good training ground. So we already took some very strong actions last year. We shut down 2 factories in Europe in high cost and we moved into a brand-new factory in Hungary. And that we already saved over 100 basis point to bottom line improvement, which is already starting to happen. So we will have that this year. It will improve. And then, of course, we have whole slew of new integrated products being launched this year, which absolutely are going to fix the segment strategy for our corporate, government, education and entertainment enterprise. So with that said, 130 basis point improvement in fiscal '17 is a very reasonable, and 3% top line growth, this is after we already the business in Q4, we feel very comfortable. Now moving on to connector services business. That business actually, if you peel the onion and just take what we acquired in is actually grew almost 14% and actually had margins EBITDA also around 14%, 15%. What we did last year, we had 2 features added to that business. One was our aftermarket car audio, which actually really belong to consumer audio. If you take that out, this business moves up to nearly 13%, actually nearly 14% EBITDA, which we have already shown in our slide deck. On top of that, we also acquired last year a company called Redbend, and that company is a great technology and we've business but is in development mode, and we took about $12 million to $15 million bottom line hit for that. So if you adjust for that, our service business actually performed exactly to our deal turns and our expectation nearly 15%. So expecting 15% margins in '17 and expecting 8% growth is very reasonable target. In midterm, I expect this business to grow at double-digit and also perform mid-to high teens bottom line."

And there we see good improvement in take rate. So that will continue to drive. Then we also expect, as we already have 14% EBITDA in our Connected Services business with Redbend not making losses hopefully in '17, we will be close to 0, breakeven point. That would bring us nearly 15% EBITDA in Connected Services. So it's a reasonable to expect in '18 another 100 basis point improvement in the bottom line. Then the third business is professional. This year we feel pretty good about 3% top line and hitting margin improvement of almost 13.7% or nearly 14%. That business should also reach it's historic levels of mid-teens and EBITDA. So all 3 businesses performing quite well and the fourth one also performing very well the Connected Car, only thing is it will not have the same scale effect, although the same profitability, same good leverage and continue to invest in our R&D on the new programs, which will be ramping up fully in end of '18 and beginning of '19.

And China has started to show great development in terms of their appetite for American branded consumer audio products. So all in all, it did quite well. Q4 came in very strong. Now reminding you as we go forward, with a $1 billion base in consumer audio, we can grow. If you want 20% a year or we can choose where we want to grow to protect the margin. And I would go for the protecting margins. We are reaching close to 10% now in our consumer audio and almost 20% in car audio. So for blended it's 15%. I want to push more margin-driven growth. That's why our gross targets we've given are very balanced."

And if you divide the pie into half, the bottom half of the pie basically traditional AM/MF radio or really nothing. Just a hole. And the top off of the pie, you divide into 2 quadrant. The left quadrant, we have traditionally said, it is the embedded navigation infotainment, and other quadrant is the display audio. So what we're witnessing and we already saw similar development last year. The bottom half of the pie is transforming either into display audio or into embedded infotainment. My personal thesis is, based on lot of discussions with OEM. If we all believe that we're going towards autonomous or driving, cars cannot be run from devices in your hand or in the pocket. Then you will need to have a strong compute platform in the car, sensors, technology and various other things in it. Therefore, even display audio is a intermediate step to go towards fully embedded system. So in the near-term or midterm, 5, 7 years, display audio will actually almost come from the nothing AM/FM and so will embedded infotainment, or 60%, 65% embedded infotainment in 4 to 5 years is pretty much everybody's take right now. So we would actually benefit and enjoy both set type size of the pie growing. But we are into display audio. We are also into entry system, mid systems and the high systems. So we will grow both. While at the same time, you mentioned CarPlay. We're actually implementing CarPlay. We're implementing drive Google AutoLink. We are also implementing CarLife and few other things.

So I think that is definitely going to be the case for the next few years. But lets not forget, in addition, there's a whole lot more going in these car. So the display audio might be a system architecture but there still has lot of software, so they are looking for over-the-air technology. They are looking for other sense of fusion. They are looking for telematics. So telematics is another new area where the new ground is being broken with a gateway approach, which is where we just won a major award with a German automaker.

We have 1500 data scientists in our company, which a lot of people don't realize. We are powerhouse in data. And data analytics will be big deal in automotive industry. Second, Redbend we acquired, put it in our services business. I said earlier, we have already over $150 million software backlog, with 75% of operating margin in it as a start to go to the bottom end to the revenue line, you will see margin expansion. And by the way, this is a very fast development of orders. We have almost more than a dozen OEMs signing up for OTA technology. And half of those dozen are directly HARMAN customers. Other half are actually going through other Tier 1s because this technology to any So all in all, service looks pretty promising.

I am pleased that this morning we announced very strong results for the fourth quarter and full year. Our fourth quarter results came in stronger than our forecast, with net sales increasing 12% to $1.9 billion. We expanded our operating margins and delivered a 20% year-over-year improvement in EBITDA and a 14% year-over-year improvement in earnings per share. 
We successfully mitigated the supply chain disruption in our automotive business following the recent earthquake in Japan, and we capitalized on increased demand for our consumer audio products in May and June. In addition, our business in China had a strong finish, with record full year revenue of approximately $800 million, up nearly 20% from the prior year. I'm also pleased that the Professional Solutions division achieved our Q4 target on top and bottom line. 
The fourth quarter caps another banner year for HARMAN. Revenue, EBITDA and earnings per share all reached record highs. We exceeded $6.9 billion in revenue, an increased of 16%, excluding foreign exchange. EBITDA improved 23% to $836 million, and we grew earnings per share by 13% to $6.24. 
I am pleased to report that our automotive backlog now stands at $24.1 billion. Our technology leadership and ability to successfully deploy intelligent connected solutions for the car that are safe and secure is resonating with customers. Not only did we win next-generation business from existing customers, we added new automakers to our customer list. Over the last 2 years, we have added $11 billion of new automotive awards. That is momentum. Our record automotive backlog of more than $24 billion provides HARMAN a strong foundation for long-term growth. 
Now let me take a closer look at our divisions and review some recent notable achievements. Let's start with our Connected Car division, which is highlighted on Slide 7 of your investor presentation. During the quarter, we secured several new and follow-on awards to provide connected car solutions for customers, including Harley-Davidson, Porsche, Toyota and a North American automaker. Advancing our telematics strategy, we secured an award from a premium German automaker for an industry-first solution for the main gateway to the car, providing a unique connectivity platform. 
This solution integrates the power expended -- this solution integrates, that -- powers the expanded telematics features and enables system diagnostics, remote control capabilities and system software updates. The automaker will also employ HARMAN's cloud-based over-the-air update technology, ensuring that critical software fixes, feature additions and upgrades can be easily and squarely and safely transmitted and added to the vehicle while on the road, not only for HARMAN head units but also for onboard ECUs from other Tier 1 suppliers. This comprehensive gateway platform is an industry first. HARMAN is the only supplier with these proprietary technologies to create this end-to-end solution. 
A product like this is a perfect example of how our bolt-on acquisitions are paying off. We strategically expanded our capabilities in over-the-air update technology, cybersecurity, cloud applications and data analytics. And when we combine these with our own deep expertise in connectivity technologies, we can create unique solutions for our customers that are smart, safe, secure and real-time updatable. 
We continue to receive accolades for our industry leadership. In June, HARMAN was named Supplier of the Year at the Automotive Interior Expo, in Stuttgart, Germany, highlighting our competence in embedded infotainment and telematics solutions. Also, in Consumer Reports' most recent guide to infotainment systems, the highest rated system is designed and built by HARMAN as well. 
Now turning to Lifestyle Audio division. Some of our recent notable achievements are highlighted on Slide 8 of the investor presentation. During the quarter, HARMAN won new business awards with Hyundai, Kia, Audi, Lexus, Subaru, SGM Wuling in China and Toyota. In addition, we secured our first award for our premium Summit audio platform with an electric vehicle company. This scalable Summit platform provides the foundation to integrate the best of HARMAN's sound processing and sound management technologies, along with new features like Connected Jukebox and Virtual Venues, to create an unprecedented in-car audio experience. As further proof of HARMAN's leadership in the industry, we won a Ford World Excellence Award for our Revel audio system in Lincoln vehicles. 
Turning to consumer audio. As I mentioned earlier, we finished a very strong quarter, with increasing demand of our award-winning products due to great design and expanded distribution channels. For the year, we won a total of 56 design and innovation awards across our consumer audio portfolio. Let me also remind you that we have been selected by Lufthansa to provide our noise-canceling headphones across their fleet. 
Now turning to the Professional Solutions division. In May, we appointed  Mohit Parasher as the President for the division. Mohit is a seasoned leader with more than 20 years of experience growing audio, video and system business throughout Asia, Middle East and Europe. Mohit brings a new level of energy and sense of urgency to Professional Solutions business. 
Last year, we implemented our enterprise and entertainment solutions-based go-to-market strategy, and we took cost actions in Europe. This year, we are focused on taking additional steps to improve cost structure in North America. We are already seeing encouraging signs of momentum in the enterprise segment. Not only have we booked several significant awards in corporate, government and education markets, we will also launch a number of integrated solutions to support these focused verticals. We expect these actions will help restore professional to historic levels of growth and profitably. Some of the notable wins and events for the quarter are highlighted on Slide 9 of the investor presentation. 
Now turning to the Connected Services division, highlighted on Slide 10 of your presentation. During the quarter, we secured several awards to provide software services for BMW, FCA, Microsoft, PSA and Reliance. In addition, we partnered with NXP Semiconductors to jointly offer new software gateway solutions to the automotive market. We continued to capitalize on our industry-leading, cloud-based OTA software update technology, winning awards from leading OEMs, such as FCA, Porsche and Subaru. We now have over $150 million in OTA software auto backlog, and about half of it is in the automotive space covering over a dozen OEMs and growing. 
In summary, this was a year of record across the board at HARMAN. Our success in 2016 demonstrates our team's ability to execute and deliver profitable growth. You will recall, in 2013, we set out an ambitious plan to grow HARMAN revenues to $6 billion by '16. Today, we reported almost $7 billion in revenue and more than doubled our 2013 EBITDA. This morning, we have also provided financial guidance for 2017 and presented a longer-term outlook. Our CFO, Sandy Rowland, will provide you the details later. 
As we look forward, we see significant growth opportunities across all the divisions. In the automotive space, the industry is experiencing an unprecedented social and technological transformation, fueled by increasing intelligent connectivity and supported by autonomous vehicles, electrification, and urban mobility. The car is getting an upgrade as never seen before. HARMAN is well positioned to capitalize on each of these trends. 
Let me remind you, our portfolio of integrated technologies now include embedded infotainment solutions ranging from Display Audio to an intelligent compute platform addressing entry, mid and high vehicle classes; enhanced telematics products and gateway solutions; industry-leading cybersecurity; and OTA products for all ECUs, whether HARMAN supplied or non-HARMAN supplied; superior automotive audio technologies like Individual Sound Zones, HALOsonic and Summit; data analytics and back-end software services to complement ADAS development in the industry; and a number of innovations still in our pipeline. We have an end-to-end value proposition that automakers are looking for. Building on our strong backlog of awarded business and track record of execution, we expect continued growth in our automotive revenue. 
At the same time, due to the staggered timing of various automotive program launches and roll-offs, we expect to see lower growth in 2018, followed by strong growth in 2019 and beyond. This is a cycle that is common in our business. We have experienced it before, as recently as 2013. As shown on Slide 14 of our presentation, we experienced accelerated growth for several years after the transition year in 2013. In fiscal 2018, we will continue to ramp up new programs and make R&D investments, both to deliver on the contracts we have won and to capitalize on the major trends we discussed earlier. 
Longer term, we are confident that we will see accelerated revenue expansion from our automotive backlog, higher-margin automotive services and the increasing market demand for Connected Car and autonomous driving technologies. On top of that, there are additional reasons to be excited. With autonomous driving, the in-car audio experience or sound management becomes even more essential. With our record $6.6 billion of car audio backlog and continued growth in take rates, we expect car audio to continue to lead the company in profitability and grow faster than the company average. 
In addition, we have confidence in the turnaround of our professional business. With all the actions we have taken, we are optimistic that we can return margins to historical levels over the medium term. Together with the continued growth in our consumer audio business and increasing opportunities in Connected Services, we are squarely on the path towards achieving our goal of $11 billion in revenue by 2021. 
Now I will turn the call over to Sandy, who will give you additional color on our financial results."
29279,371684769,1025608,"Harman International Industries, Incorporated, Q4 2016 Earnings Call, Aug 04, 2016",2016-08-04,"Earnings Calls","Harman International Industries, Incorporated","Executives","Thank you, Dinesh, and good morning, everyone. Let me walk you through our financial highlights for the quarter and provide additional detail on our outlook for fiscal year 2017 and beyond. As a reminder, most of my financial remarks are provided on an op",1103,"Thank you, Dinesh, and good morning, everyone. Let me walk you through our financial highlights for the quarter and provide additional detail on our outlook for fiscal year 2017 and beyond. As a reminder, most of my financial remarks are provided on an operational basis, which excludes acquisition-related items, restructuring and nonrecurring charges. The full reconciliation of our GAAP to our operational results is included in the press release that we issued this morning. This quarter, our revenues were $1.9 billion, an increase of 12% compared to the prior year. Revenue in our Connected Car division increased 11% versus the prior year primarily due to higher take rates and stronger production. Revenue in our Lifestyle Audio division increased 25% compared to the prior year. The increase in net sales was primarily due to higher take rates and the acquisition of Bang & Olufsen automotive in-car audio and higher consumer audio sales driven by continued strong demand for smart audio solutions. Revenue in our Professional Solutions division increased 1% compared to the prior year. Revenue in our Connected Services division increased 7% to $185 million in the quarter compared to $173 million a year ago, primarily due to higher demand for engineering services. 
Total company gross margin increased 110 basis points to 30.5% primarily due to the impact of higher sales volume, leveraging a more efficient fixed production cost based and productivity initiatives. Connected Car gross margin increased 300 basis points to 25.5% and Lifestyle Audio gross margin increased 380 basis points to 35.1%, both benefiting from better leverage of fixed costs, lower warranty expenses and manufacturing productivity. 
Professional Solutions gross margin decreased 340 basis points to 36.7%, driven by product mix and new factory start-up costs in Hungary. In Connected Services, the timing of booked revenue is tied to specific milestones in longer-term engineering projects while expenses are recognized as incurred. This can result in margin volatility. As a result, for the fourth quarter, Connected Services gross margin declined 850 basis points to 28.2%. Beginning in fiscal 2017, we will use percentage of completion accounting for significant new contracts. This is expected to reduce some of the volatility. 
Our SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales increased 20 basis points from the prior year to 20.7%. Connected Car SG&A increased 110 basis points to 14.1% and Lifestyle Audio SG&A increased 20 basis points to 20.2%, both due to higher research and development costs to support awarded business. SG&A expense in Professional Solutions remained in line with the prior year. Connected Services SG&A as a percentage of sales decreased 180 basis points to 18.2% due to better leverage on higher sales. Finally, corporate SG&A as a percentage of sales declined by 10 basis points to 2.3%. 
Putting it all together, our consolidated operating income was $185 million compared to $150 million in the prior year, a 24% increase. Below the line, we had higher income tax expenses in the quarter due to an increase in U.S. tax from deemed income on foreign earnings and jurisdictional mix, resulting in a higher-than-forecasted effective tax rate. EPS was $1.57 compared to a $1.37 in the prior year, up 14%. 
Now turning to the full year. In fiscal year 2016, revenue, EBITDA and EPS all reached record highs for HARMAN. Revenue was $6.9 billion, an increase of 16% excluding foreign exchange. And EBITDA reached $836 million, a 23% increase excluding foreign exchange, and we grew EPS from $5.71 to $6.24, a 13% increase excluding foreign exchange. 
Now let me spend a few minutes on cash and capital allocation. In fiscal 2016, we generated nearly $450 million of cash flow from operations, driven by strong earnings and effective working capital management, and we invested approximately $200 million in capital expenditures. In the fiscal year, we repurchased approximately 1.6 million shares at a cost of $140 million. Combined with $100 million in dividends, we returned a record $240 million to our shareholders, over half of our cash generated from operations. We ended the fiscal year with $602 million in cash. Across the board, this wraps up a solid fiscal year for HARMAN. 
Now let's turn to our guidance for fiscal 2017. First, we are making a slight adjustment to our divisional reporting structure. We will move our aftermarket car audio business from the Connected Services division to the Lifestyle Audio division as this product line shares our consumer go-to-market organization and the consumer product innovation center in Shenzhen China. Slide 16 shows the impact is approximately $60 million in revenue on a full year basis. 
As Dinesh indicated, we are targeting between $7.3 billion and $7.5 billion in revenue for fiscal 27 -- '17 and between $900 million and $940 million in EBITDA. Our forecast is based on a number of key assumptions, namely: global GDP growth of approximately 2.5%, global automotive production growth between 2% and 3%, global industry embedded infotainment take rates increasing from about 27% to 30% and a euro-to-dollar exchange rate of 1.10. We expect top line growth and EBITDA expansion across all 4 division. Furthermore, we expect about $180 million in depreciation and amortization expenses, between $50 million and $60 million in interest expense and miscellaneous charges. And we estimate that our tax rate will be between 27.5% and 28%, and we have assumed a similar level of share repurchase as fiscal 2016. 
Assuming approximately 72 million shares outstanding, our EPS will be between $6.75 and $7. We will remain opportunistic in buying back our shares incrementally to our current plan. We have approximately $360 million remaining on our board-authorized share repurchase program, which runs until October 2017. 
This morning, we also provided a longer-term outlook. Our assumptions regarding the macroeconomic and automotive production environment are similar to our 2017 guidance assumptions. We are targeting a high single-digit revenue CAGR over the next 3 years reaching approximately $8.6 billion in revenue by fiscal 2019. In addition, we expect to grow our EBITDA margins to about 13.5% in fiscal '19, representing a 140 basis point improvement compared to fiscal year 2016. As Dinesh pointed out, we do expect lower revenue growth in fiscal 2018 due to the staggered timing of various automotive program launches and roll-offs. In subsequent years, we'll have a number of new programs reaching full scale, positioning us for accelerated growth. 
In summary, we are pleased with our fiscal 2016 performance. We have set robust targets for fiscal 2017 and the next 3 years, and we are focused on innovation and execution to deliver against these targets. 
Thank you for your attention. Dinesh and I are now happy to take your questions."

So yes, first of all, we're very happy with 2016 record revenue and EBITDA and EPS. And with the great backlog we have, especially, I repeat, $11 billion order bookings in the last 2 years, that gives us momentum. So we are very confident about out years. As we indicated, 2018 directional outlook is a slower growth and, in fact, flattish Connected Car revenue. And that is primarily due to rolling off of some of the programs while we're still ramping up the large programs both in Europe and North America. But they will not be fully at scale. So that's what is reflected in '19 and 2021, double-digit growth, and we have number of North American and even Asian programs coming up, which also have very good margins. So we feel very good about '19, '21. Also, '18 is actually still a good year. We are still growing and still expanding our margins. Let me also mention one highlight which is reflected in our guidance and has impacted '18 slower growth. As you all know, that in North America, we have a great customer in FCA, Fiat Chrysler automotive, and we still supply to them, a large part of infotainment comes from HARMAN. In fact, we are the primary supplier of audio. And in fact, in June, the Consumer Reports even named it as a top infotainment, what Chrysler is using from HARMAN. Having said that, there are multiple suppliers of infotainment to FCA, which I have said in my earlier calls. Based on FCA's current sourcing strategy, our infotainment volume in fiscal '18 may be lower, and it is reflected in our 2018 guidance and beyond. As you are aware, we have won a couple of follow-on awards as well as, over the year, update awards with them for across the car line globally. On top of that, we are also continuing to ship audio and infotainment. And with that said, our strong relationship with FCPA -- FCA, we are well positioned for the next-generation infotainment program, which we expect to be available for bidding in the next 12 to 18 months."

And then my next and last question is on the impact, if any, that you see to HARMAN from the potential acquisition of Fiat Chrysler's Magneti Marelli business by Samsung Electronics. I don't think there is much overlap between your 2 businesses currently, but there has been some speculation that Samsung could perhaps be interested in using Magneti as some sort of launchpad to get into automotive infotainment. So what can you say about the barriers to entry on the embedded side? Or what competitive advantages do you have that you think can keep newer entrants at bay on the embedded side? And then if they were to get into more connected audio, sort of à la Apple, the extent to which that is not necessarily a competitive threat."

The Magneti Marelli is a large Tier 1 and very small player in infotainment. In fact, similar to another smaller sort of player in North America, which was up for the sale, which people have passed, Magneti Marelli  has also tried to sell their infotainment business over the last several years. And we have worked with them often on, but they really don't really make a viable player as is. And especially when you think about how fast the space is changing, it's not about traditional instrument cluster or infotainment or basic amplification and speakers. It has moved on to a full connectivity intelligence, over-the-air update, cybersecurity, a scalable end-to-end service platform. It's all about analytics, which we'll partner with the companies like Mobileye, take their sensors' information and create information. So it's the scale, it's the technology, it's the R&D power. So we will see what that means if that acquisition happens, but we see almost no impact on our current or in our near to midterm future."

So let's start with Professional Solutions business, then I'd talk about Connected Services. So first of all, this is a good business. We have built a robust portfolio of audio, video, lighting and automation, and we have expanded our customer segment to corporate, government and education beyond traditional recording studios and touring sound. This does -- this has a 4-pronged turnaround strategy, which I feel very comfortable with. The number one starts with leadership, sense of urgency. We have fixed that. Number two, we are addressing channels. Channels, we are going in some markets direct; some, we are going indirect. But we are training the channels to sell the solutions to enterprise and entertainment segment. And the third is cost leadership. You know us in HARMAN. We are really paranoid about cost every year, and automotive is a good training ground. So we already took some very strong actions last year. We shut down 2 factories in Europe in high cost, and we moved into a brand-new factory in Hungary. And that, we already said over 100 basis point of bottom line improvement, which is already starting to happen. So we will have that this year. It will improve. And then, of course, we have whole slew of new integrated products being launched this year, which absolutely are going to fit the segment strategy for corporate, government, education and entertainment and enterprise. So with that said, 130 basis point improvement in fiscal '17 is very reasonable. And 3% top line growth, this is after we already stabilize the business in Q4, we feel very comfortable. Now moving on to Connected Services business. That business actually, if you peel the onion and just take what we acquired in Symphony Teleca, this actually grew almost 14% and actually had margins, EBITDA, also around 14%, 15%. What we did last year, we had 2 pieces added to that business. One was our aftermarket car audio, which actually really belonged to consumer audio. Because if you take that out, this business moves up to nearly 13% -- actually nearly 14% EBITDA, which we have already shown in our slide deck. On top of that, we also acquired last year a company called Redbend, and that company is a great technology within internal business but is in development mode. And we took about $12 million, $15 million bottom line hit for that. So if you adjust for that, our service business actually performed exactly to our deal turns and our expectation, nearly 15%. So expecting 15% margins in '17 and expecting 8% growth is very reasonable target. In midterm, I expect this business to grow at mid -- double digit and also perform mid to high teens bottom line."

And there, we see good improvement in take rate, so that will continue to drive. Then we also expect, as we already have 14% EBITDA in our Connected Services business, with Redbend not making losses, hopefully, in '17, we'll be close to 0, breakeven point. That would bring us nearly 15% EBITDA in Connected Services. So it's reasonable to expect in '18 another 100 basis point improvement in the bottom line. Then the third business is professional. This year, we feel pretty good about 3% top line and hitting margin improvement of almost 13.7% or nearly 14%. That business should also reach its historic levels of mid-teens in EBITDA. So all 3 businesses performing quite well. And the fourth one, also performing very well, the Connected Car. Only thing is it will not have the same scale effect, although the same profitability, same good leverage and continue to invest in our R&D on the new programs, which will be ramping up fully in end of '18 and beginning of '19.

Now reminding you, as we go forward, with a $1 billion base in consumer audio, we can grow, if you want, 20% a year. Or we can choose where we want to grow to protect the margin.

Second question, you touched upon your assumptions around embedded nav -- embedded infotainment, but you also mentioned the growth of Display Audio. If a scenario develops where take rates on upper-end Display Audio improve at the expense of, say, mid-level infotainment with embedded nav, because I could argue with that. Sort Display Audio, optional nav coming through Apple CarPlay gets you pretty close to mid-level infotainment with embedded nav. Just how are you positioned for that trend? What do you have in each category? And what kind of assumptions are you making vis-à-vis kind of the OEM kind of the showroom mix around those products in 2018, 2019?"

So Brian, first of all, let's go back to our picture, which we have been sharing with you. There's a pie. And if you divide the pie into half, the bottom half of the pie is basically traditional AM/FM radio or really nothing, just a hole. And the to",304,"Okay. So Brian, first of all, let's go back to our picture, which we have been sharing with you. There's a pie. And if you divide the pie into half, the bottom half of the pie is basically traditional AM/FM radio or really nothing, just a hole. And the top half of the pie, you divide into 2 quadrants. The left quadrant, we have traditionally said it is the embedded infotainment, and other quadrant is the Display Audio. So what we are witnessing, and we already saw a similar development last year, the bottom half of the pie is transforming either into Display Audio or into embedded infotainment. My personal thesis is, based on a lot of discussions with OEM, if we all believe that we're going towards autonomous or semi-autonomous driving, cars cannot be run from devices in your hand or in the pocket. Then you will need to have a strong compute platform in the car, sensors, technology and various other things in it. Therefore, even Display Audio is a intermediate step to go towards fully embedded system. So in the near term or midterm, 5, 7 years, Display Audio will actually almost come from the nothing, AM/FM and so will an embedded infotainment. 60%, 65% embedded infotainment in 4 to 5 years is pretty much everybody's take right now. So we would actually benefit and enjoy both types -- size of the pie growing. We are into Display Audio. We are also into entry systems, mid systems and the high systems. So we'll grow both. While, at the same time, you mentioned CarPlay. We are actually implementing CarPlay. We are implementing and tried Google AutoLink. We are also implementing Baidu CarLife and few other things. So these are all smart apps we'll implement on all the systems as we go forward."

So that is basically the optionality, which means it will be from AM/FM or nothing in the car to Display Audio, where you have optionality to either ask for nav or bring your own nav, which we actually support, which is an incremental business for us because we have traditionally been in fully embedded nav and everything else. And we still do that. In addition, we are doing Display Audio. We have almost $1 billion award from a North American customer for Display Audio, and we have miscellaneous other awards from Asia. So I think that is definitely going to be the case for the next few years. But let's not forget, in addition, there's a whole lot more going in these cars. So the Display Audio might be a system architecture, but it still has a lot of software. So they're looking for over-the-air technology. They're looking for other sense of fusion. They're looking for telematics. So telematics is another new area where the new ground is being broken with a gateway approach, which is where we just won a major award with a German automaker. And that's also going to be playing out both in Display Audio segment as well as fully embedded nav segment. So market is expanding."

It sounds like you're getting some wins when we start looking out to '19 and can start to actually see some real revenue and some real adoption of these technologies. Could you talk a little bit more about that curve as this moves from a little bit pie in the sky to reality in terms of moving just from a ""nice to have"" to a ""must have"" and what the real evidence of that adoption curve looks like and then also, your desire to utilize that technology beyond even the auto sector?"

Then we have also 2 other verticals, the telecom, which is also kind of merging more and more into auto side. And then we have enterprise software development. But staying with the overall connected business, analytics is going to play big. We have 1,500 data scientists in our company, which a lot of people don't realize. We're a powerhouse in data. And data analytics will be big deal in automotive industry. Second, Redbend we acquired, put it in our services business. I said earlier we have already over $150 million software backlog, with 75% of operating margin in it. As you start to go to the bottom and to the revenue line, you will see margin expansion. And by the way, this is a very fast development of orders. We have almost more than a dozen OEMs signing up for OTA technology. And half of those dozen are directly HARMAN customers. Other half are actually going through other Tier 1s because this technology is agnostic to any ECU. So all in all, Connected Services looks pretty promising, and that was the rationale we had. And I think we are seeing great opportunities for growth."

I am pleased that this morning we announced very strong results for the fourth quarter and full year. Our fourth quarter results came in stronger than our forecast, with net sales increasing 12% to $1.9 billion. We expanded our operating margins and delivered a 20% year-over-year improvement in EBITDA and a 14% year-over-year improvement in earnings per share. 
We successfully mitigated the supply chain disruption in our automotive business following the recent earthquake in Japan, and we capitalized on increased demand for our consumer audio products in May and June. In addition, our business in China had a strong finish, with record full year revenue of approximately $800 million, up nearly 20% from the prior year. I'm also pleased that the Professional Solutions division achieved our Q4 target on top and bottom line. 
The fourth quarter caps another banner year for HARMAN. Revenue, EBITDA and earnings per share all reached record highs. We exceeded $6.9 billion in revenue, an increase of 16%, excluding foreign exchange. EBITDA improved 23% to $836 million, and we grew earnings per share by 13% to $6.24. 
I am pleased to report that our automotive backlog now stands at $24.1 billion. Our technology leadership and ability to successfully deploy intelligent connected solutions for the car that are safe and secure is resonating with customers. Not only did we win next-generation business from existing customers, we added new automakers to our customer list. Over the last 2 years, we have added $11 billion of new automotive awards. That is momentum. Our record automotive backlog of more than $24 billion provides HARMAN a strong foundation for long-term growth. 
Now let me take a closer look at our divisions and review some recent notable achievements. Let's start with our Connected Car division, which is highlighted on Slide 7 of your investor presentation. During the quarter, we secured several new and follow-on awards to provide connected car solutions for customers, including Harley-Davidson, Porsche, Toyota and a North American automaker. Advancing our telematics strategy, we secured an award from a premium German automaker for an industry-first solution for the main gateway to the car, providing a unique connectivity platform. 
This solution integrates the power expended -- this solution integrates, that -- powers the expanded telematics features and enables system diagnostics, remote control capabilities and system software updates. The automaker will also employ HARMAN's cloud-based over-the-air update technology, ensuring that critical software fixes, feature additions and upgrades can be easily and squarely and safely transmitted and added to the vehicle while on the road, not only for HARMAN head units but also for onboard ECUs from other Tier 1 suppliers. This comprehensive gateway platform is an industry first. HARMAN is the only supplier with these proprietary technologies to create this end-to-end solution. 
A product like this is a perfect example of how our bolt-on acquisitions are paying off. We strategically expanded our capabilities in over-the-air update technology, cybersecurity, cloud applications and data analytics. And when we combine these with our own deep expertise in connectivity technologies, we can create unique solutions for our customers that are smart, safe, secure and real-time updatable. 
We continue to receive accolades for our industry leadership. In June, HARMAN was named Supplier of the Year at the Automotive Interior Expo, in Stuttgart, Germany, highlighting our competence in embedded infotainment and telematics solutions. Also, in Consumer Reports' most recent guide to infotainment systems, the highest rated system is designed and built by HARMAN as well. 
Now turning to Lifestyle Audio division. Some of our recent notable achievements are highlighted on Slide 8 of the investor presentation. During the quarter, HARMAN won new business awards with Hyundai, Kia, Audi, Lexus, Subaru, SGM Wuling in China and Toyota. In addition, we secured our first award for our premium Summit audio platform with an electric vehicle company. This scalable Summit platform provides the foundation to integrate the best of HARMAN's sound processing and sound management technologies, along with new features like Connected Jukebox and Virtual Venues, to create an unprecedented in-car audio experience. As further proof of HARMAN's leadership in the industry, we won a Ford World Excellence Award for our Revel audio system in Lincoln vehicles. 
Turning to consumer audio. As I mentioned earlier, we finished a very strong quarter, with increasing demand of our award-winning products due to great design and expanded distribution channels. For the year, we won a total of 56 design and innovation awards across our consumer audio portfolio. Let me also remind you that we have been selected by Lufthansa to provide our noise-canceling headphones across their fleet. 
Now turning to the Professional Solutions division. In May, we appointed Mohit Parasher as the President for the division. Mohit is a seasoned leader with more than 20 years of experience growing audio, video and systems business throughout Asia, Middle East and Europe. Mohit brings a new level of energy and sense of urgency to Professional Solutions business. 
Last year, we implemented our enterprise and entertainment solutions-based go-to-market strategy, and we took cost actions in Europe. This year, we are focused on taking additional steps to improve cost structure in North America. We are already seeing encouraging signs of momentum in the enterprise segment. Not only have we booked several significant awards in corporate, government and education markets, we will also launch a number of integrated solutions to support these focused verticals. We expect these actions will help restore Professional to historic levels of growth and profitably. Some of the notable wins and events for the quarter are highlighted on Slide 9 of the investor presentation. 
Now turning to the Connected Services division, highlighted on Slide 10 of your presentation. During the quarter, we secured several awards to provide software services for BMW, FCA, Microsoft, PSA and Reliance. In addition, we partnered with NXP Semiconductors to jointly offer new software gateway solutions to the automotive market. We continued to capitalize on our industry-leading, cloud-based OTA software update technology, winning awards from leading OEMs, such as FCA, Porsche and Subaru. We now have over $150 million in OTA software auto backlog, and about half of it is in the automotive space covering over a dozen OEMs and growing. 
In summary, this was a year of records across the board at HARMAN. Our success in 2016 demonstrates our team's ability to execute and deliver profitable growth. You will recall, in 2013, we set out an ambitious plan to grow HARMAN revenues to $6 billion by '16. Today, we reported almost $7 billion in revenue and more than doubled our 2013 EBITDA. This morning, we have also provided financial guidance for 2017 and presented a longer-term outlook. Our CFO, Sandy Rowland, will provide you the details later. 
As we look forward, we see significant growth opportunities across all the divisions. In the automotive space, the industry is experiencing an unprecedented social and technological transformation, fueled by increasing intelligent connectivity and supported by autonomous vehicles, electrification, and urban mobility. The car is getting an upgrade as never seen before. HARMAN is well positioned to capitalize on each of these trends. 
Let me remind you, our portfolio of integrated technologies now includes embedded infotainment solutions ranging from Display Audio to an intelligent compute platform addressing entry, mid and high vehicle classes; enhanced telematics products and gateway solutions; industry-leading cybersecurity; and OTA products for all ECUs, whether HARMAN supplied or non-HARMAN supplied; superior automotive audio technologies like Individual Sound Zones, HALOsonic and Summit; data analytics and back-end software services to complement ADAS development in the industry; and a number of innovations still in our pipeline. We have the end-to-end value proposition that automakers are looking for. Building on our strong backlog of awarded business and track record of execution, we expect continued growth in our automotive revenue. 
At the same time, due to the staggered timing of various automotive program launches and roll-offs, we expect to see lower growth in 2018, followed by strong growth in 2019 and beyond. This is a cycle that is common in our business. We have experienced it before, as recently as 2013. As shown on Slide 14 of our presentation, we experienced accelerated growth for several years after the transition year in 2013. In fiscal 2018, we will continue to ramp up new programs and make R&D investments, both to deliver on the contracts we have won and to capitalize on the major trends we discussed earlier. 
Longer term, we are confident that we will see accelerated revenue expansion from our automotive backlog, higher-margin automotive services and the increasing market demand for Connected Car and autonomous driving technologies. On top of that, there are additional reasons to be excited. With autonomous driving, the in-car audio experience or sound management becomes even more essential. With our record $6.6 billion of car audio backlog and continued growth in take rates, we expect car audio to continue to lead the company in profitability and grow faster than the company average. 
In addition, we have confidence in the turnaround of our Professional business. With all the actions we have taken, we are optimistic that we can return margins to historical levels over the medium term. Together with the continued growth in our consumer audio business and increasing opportunities in Connected Services, we are squarely on the path towards achieving our goal of $11 billion in revenue by 2021. 
Now I will turn the call over to Sandy, who will give you additional color on our financial results."

Let me walk you through our financial highlights for the quarter and provide additional detail on our outlook for fiscal year 2017 and beyond. As a reminder, most of my financial remarks are provided on an op",1103,"Thank you, Dinesh, and good morning, everyone. Let me walk you through our financial highlights for the quarter and provide additional detail on our outlook for fiscal year 2017 and beyond. As a reminder, most of my financial remarks are provided on an operational basis, which excludes acquisition-related items, restructuring and nonrecurring charges. The full reconciliation of our GAAP to our operational results is included in the press release that we issued this morning. This quarter, our revenues were $1.9 billion, an increase of 12% compared to the prior year. Revenue in our Connected Car division increased 11% versus the prior year primarily due to higher take rates and stronger production. Revenue in our Lifestyle Audio division increased 25% compared to the prior year. The increase in net sales was primarily due to higher take rates and the acquisition of Bang & Olufsen automotive in-car audio and higher consumer audio sales driven by continued strong demand for smart audio solutions. Revenue in our Professional Solutions division increased 1% compared to the prior year. Revenue in our Connected Services division increased 7% to $185 million in the quarter compared to $173 million a year ago, primarily due to higher demand for engineering services. 
Total company gross margin increased 110 basis points to 30.5% primarily due to the impact of higher sales volume, leveraging a more efficient fixed production cost base and productivity initiatives. Connected Car gross margin increased 300 basis points to 25.5% and Lifestyle Audio gross margin increased 380 basis points to 35.1%, both benefiting from better leverage of fixed costs, lower warranty expenses and manufacturing productivity. 
Professional Solutions gross margin decreased 340 basis points to 36.7%, driven by product mix and new factory start-up costs in Hungary. In Connected Services, the timing of booked revenue is tied to specific milestones in longer-term engineering projects while expenses are recognized as incurred. This can result in margin volatility. As a result, for the fourth quarter, Connected Services gross margin declined 850 basis points to 28.2%. Beginning in fiscal 2017, we will use percentage of completion accounting for significant new contracts. This is expected to reduce some of the volatility. 
Our SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales increased 20 basis points from the prior year to 20.7%. Connected Car SG&A increased 110 basis points to 14.1% and Lifestyle Audio SG&A increased 20 basis points to 20.2%, both due to higher research and development costs to support awarded business. SG&A expense in Professional Solutions remained in line with the prior year. Connected Services SG&A as a percentage of sales decreased 180 basis points to 18.2% due to better leverage on higher sales. Finally, corporate SG&A as a percentage of sales declined by 10 basis points to 2.3%. 
Putting it all together, our consolidated operating income was $185 million compared to $150 million in the prior year, a 24% increase. Below the line, we had higher income tax expenses in the quarter due to an increase in U.S. tax from deemed income on foreign earnings and jurisdictional mix, resulting in a higher-than-forecasted effective tax rate. EPS was $1.57 compared to a $1.37 in the prior year, up 14%. 
Now turning to the full year. In fiscal year 2016, revenue, EBITDA and EPS all reached record highs for HARMAN. Revenue was $6.9 billion, an increase of 16% excluding foreign exchange. And EBITDA reached $836 million, a 23% increase excluding foreign exchange, and we grew EPS from $5.71 to $6.24, a 13% increase excluding foreign exchange. 
Now let me spend a few minutes on cash and capital allocation. In fiscal 2016, we generated nearly $450 million of cash flow from operations, driven by strong earnings and effective working capital management, and we invested approximately $200 million in capital expenditures. In the fiscal year, we repurchased approximately 1.6 million shares at a cost of $140 million. Combined with $100 million in dividends, we returned a record $240 million to our shareholders, over half of our cash generated from operations. We ended the fiscal year with $602 million in cash. Across the board, this wraps up a solid fiscal year for HARMAN. 
Now let's turn to our guidance for fiscal 2017. First, we are making a slight adjustment to our divisional reporting structure. We will move our aftermarket car audio business from the Connected Services division to the Lifestyle Audio division as this product line shares our consumer go-to-market organization and the consumer product innovation center in Shenzhen, China. Slide 16 shows the impact is approximately $60 million in revenue on a full year basis. 
As Dinesh indicated, we are targeting between $7.3 billion and $7.5 billion in revenue for fiscal 27 -- '17 and between $900 million and $940 million in EBITDA. Our forecast is based on a number of key assumptions, namely: global GDP growth of approximately 2.5%, global automotive production growth between 2% and 3%, global industry embedded infotainment take rates increasing from about 27% to 30% and a euro-to-dollar exchange rate of 1.10. We expect top line growth and EBITDA expansion across all 4 divisions. Furthermore, we expect about $180 million in depreciation and amortization expenses, between $50 million and $60 million in interest expense and miscellaneous charges. And we estimate that our tax rate will be between 27.5% and 28%, and we have assumed a similar level of share repurchase as fiscal 2016. 
Assuming approximately 72 million shares outstanding, our EPS will be between $6.75 and $7. We will remain opportunistic in buying back our shares incrementally to our current plan. We have approximately $360 million remaining on our board-authorized share repurchase program, which runs until October 2017. 
This morning, we also provided a longer-term outlook. Our assumptions regarding the macroeconomic and automotive production environment are similar to our 2017 guidance assumptions. We are targeting a high single-digit revenue CAGR over the next 3 years reaching approximately $8.6 billion in revenue by fiscal 2019. In addition, we expect to grow our EBITDA margins to about 13.5% in fiscal '19, representing a 140 basis point improvement compared to fiscal year 2016. As Dinesh pointed out, we do expect lower revenue growth in fiscal 2018 due to the staggered timing of various automotive program launches and roll-offs. In subsequent years, we'll have a number of new programs reaching full scale, positioning us for accelerated growth. 
In summary, we are pleased with our fiscal 2016 performance. We have set robust targets for fiscal 2017 and the next 3 years, and we are focused on innovation and execution to deliver against these targets. 
Thank you for your attention. Dinesh and I are now happy to take your questions."

So yes, first of all, we're very happy with 2016 record revenue and EBITDA and EPS. And with the great backlog we have, especially, I repeat, $11 billion order bookings in the last 2 years, that gives us momentum. So we are very confident about out years. As we indicated, 2018 directional outlook is a slower growth and, in fact, flattish Connected Car revenue. And that is primarily due to rolling off of some of the programs while we're still ramping up the large programs both in Europe and North America. But they will not be fully at scale. So that's what is reflected in '19 and 2021, double-digit growth, and we have a number of North American and even Asian programs coming up, which also have very good margins. So we feel very good about '19, '21. Also, '18 is actually still a good year. We are still growing and still expanding our margins. Let me also mention one highlight which is reflected in our guidance and has impacted '18 slower growth. As you all know, that in North America, we have a great customer in FCA, Fiat Chrysler Automotive, and we still supply to them, a large part of infotainment comes from HARMAN. In fact, we are the primary supplier of audio. And in fact, in June, the Consumer Reports even named it as a top infotainment, what Chrysler is using from HARMAN. Having said that, there are multiple suppliers of infotainment to FCA, which I have said in my earlier calls. Based on FCA's current sourcing strategy, our infotainment volume in fiscal '18 may be lower, and it is reflected in our 2018 guidance and beyond. As you are aware, we have won a couple of follow-on awards as well as, over the year, update awards with them for across the car line globally. On top of that, we are also continuing to ship audio and infotainment. And with that said, our strong relationship with FCPA -- FCA, we are well positioned for their next-generation infotainment program, which we expect to be available for bidding in the next 12 to 18 months."

And then my next and last question is on the impact, if any, that you see to HARMAN from the potential acquisition of Fiat Chrysler's Magneti Marelli business by Samsung Electronics. I don't think there is much overlap between your 2 businesses currently, but there has been some speculation that Samsung could perhaps be interested in using Magneti as some sort of launchpad to get into automotive infotainment. So what can you say about the barriers to entry on the embedded side? Or what competitive advantages you have that you think can keep newer entrants at bay on the embedded side? And then if they were to get into more connected audio, sort of à la Apple, the extent to which that is not necessarily a competitive threat."

The Magneti Marelli is a large Tier 1 and very small player in infotainment. In fact, similar to another smaller sort of player in North America, which was up for the sale, which people had passed, Magneti Marelli has also tried to sell their infotainment business over the last several years. And we have worked with them off and on, but they really don't really make a viable player as is. And especially when you think about how fast the space is changing, it's not about traditional instrument cluster or infotainment or basic amplification and speakers. It has moved on to a full connectivity intelligence, over-the-air update, cybersecurity, a scalable end-to-end service platform. It's all about analytics, which we'll partner with the companies like Mobileye, take their sensors' information and create information. So it's the scale, it's the technology, it's the R&D power. So we will see what that means if that acquisition happens, but we see almost no impact on our current or in our near to midterm future."

So let's start with Professional Solutions business, then I'll talk about Connected Services. So first of all, this is a good business. We have built a robust portfolio of audio, video, lighting and automation, and we have expanded our customer segment to corporate, government and education beyond traditional recording studios and touring sound. This business has a 4-pronged turnaround strategy, which I feel very comfortable with. The number one starts with leadership, sense of urgency. We have fixed that. Number two, we are addressing our channels. Channels, we are going some markets direct; some, we are going indirect. But we are training the channels to sell the solutions to enterprise and entertainment segment. And the third is cost leadership. You know us in HARMAN. We are really paranoid about cost every year, and automotive is a good training ground. So we already took some very strong actions last year. We shut down 2 factories in Europe in high cost, and we moved into a brand-new factory in Hungary. And that, we already said over 100 basis point of bottom line improvement, which is already starting to happen. So we will have that this year. It will improve. And then, of course, we have whole slew of new integrated products being launched this year, which absolutely are going to fit the segment strategy for corporate, government, education and entertainment and enterprise. So with that said, 130 basis point improvement in fiscal '17 is very reasonable. And 3% top line growth, this is after we already stabilized the business in Q4, we feel very comfortable. Now moving on to Connected Services business. That business actually, if you peel the onion and just take what we acquired in Symphony Teleca, this actually grew almost 14% and actually had margins, EBITDA, also around 14%, 15%. What we did last year, we had 2 pieces added to that business. One was our aftermarket car audio, which actually really belonged to consumer audio. Because if you take that out, this business moves up to nearly 13% -- actually nearly 14% EBITDA, which we have already shown in our slide deck. On top of that, we also acquired last year a company called Redbend, and that company is a great technology and we're winning a ton of business, but is in development mode. And we took about $12 million, $15 million bottom line hit for that. So if you adjust for that, our service business actually performed exactly to our deal turns and our expectation, nearly 15%. So expecting 15% margins in '17 and expecting 8% growth is a very reasonable target. In midterm, I expect this business to grow at mid -- double digit and also perform mid to high teens bottom line."

Then we also expect, as we already have 14% EBITDA in our Connected Services business, with Redbend not making losses, hopefully, in '17, we'll be close to 0, breakeven point. That would bring us nearly 15% EBITDA in Connected Services. So it's reasonable to expect in '18 another 100 basis point improvement in the bottom line. Then the third business is professional. This year, we feel pretty good about 3% top line and hitting margin improvement of almost 13.7% or nearly 14%. That business should also reach its historic levels of mid-teens in EBITDA. So all 3 businesses performing quite well. And the fourth one, also performing very well, the Connected Car. Only thing is it will not have the same scale effect, although the same profitability, same good leverage and continue to invest in our R&D on the new programs, which will be ramping up fully in end of '18 and beginning of '19.

Now reminding you, as we go forward, with a $1 billion base in consumer audio, we can grow, if you want, 20% a year. Or we can choose where we want to grow to protect the margin. And I would go for the protecting margins. We are reaching close to 10% now in our consumer audio and almost 20% in car audio. So call them, blended, it's 15%. I want to push more margin-driven growth. That's why our growth targets we have given are very balanced."

If a scenario develops where take rates on upper-end Display Audio improve at the expense of, say, mid-level infotainment with embedded nav, because I could argue with that sort Display Audio, optional nav coming through Apple CarPlay gets you pretty close to mid-level infotainment with embedded nav.

And what kind of assumptions are you making vis-à-vis kind of the OEM kind of the showroom mix around those products in 2018, 2019?"

So Brian, first of all, let's go back to our picture, which we have been sharing with you. There's a pie. And if you divide the pie into half, the bottom half of the pie is basically traditional AM/FM radio or really nothing, just a hole. And the top half of the pie, you divide into 2 quadrants. The left quadrant, we have traditionally said it is the embedded infotainment, and other quadrant is the Display Audio. So what we are witnessing, and we already saw a similar development last year, the bottom half of the pie is transforming either into Display Audio or into embedded infotainment. My personal thesis is, based on a lot of discussions with OEMs, if we all believe that we're going towards autonomous or semi-autonomous driving, cars cannot be run from devices in your hand or in the pocket. Then you will need to have a strong compute platform in the car, sensors, technology and various other things in it. Therefore, even Display Audio is an intermediate step to go towards s fully embedded system. So in the near term or midterm, 5, 7 years, Display Audio will actually almost come from the nothing, AM/FM and so will embedded infotainment. Where 60%, 65% embedded infotainment in 4 to 5 years is pretty much everybody's take right now. So we would actually benefit and enjoy both types -- slice of the pie growing. Where we are into Display Audio, we are also into entry systems, mid systems and the high systems. So we'll grow both. While, at the same time, you mentioned CarPlay. We are actually implementing CarPlay. We are implementing and Android Google AutoLink. We are also implementing Baidu CarLife and few other things. So these are all smart apps we'll implement on all the systems as we go forward."

So that is basically the optionality, which means it will be from AM/FM or nothing in the car to Display Audio, where you have optionality to either ask for nav or bring your own nav, which we actually support, which is an incremental business for us because we have traditionally been in fully embedded nav and everything else. And we still do that. In addition, we are doing Display Audio. We have almost $1 billion award from a North American customer for Display Audio, and we have miscellaneous other awards from Asia, others. So I think that is definitely going to be the case for the next few years. But let's not forget, in addition, there's a whole lot more going in these cars. So the Display Audio might be a system architecture, but it still has a lot of software. So they're looking for over-the-air technology. They're looking for other sensor fusion. They're looking for telematics. So telematics is another new area where the new ground is being broken with a gateway approach, which is where we just won a major award with a German automaker. And that's also going to be playing out both in Display Audio segment as well as fully embedded nav segment. So market is expanding."

Then we have also 2 other verticals, telecom, which is also kind of merging more and more into auto side. And then we have enterprise software development. But staying with the overall connected business, analytics is going to play big. We have 1,500 data scientists in our company, which a lot of people don't realize. We're a powerhouse in data. And data analytics will be a big deal in automotive industry. Second, Redbend we acquired, put it in our services business. I said earlier we have already over $150 million software backlog, with 75% of operating margin in it. As you start to go to the bottom and to the revenue line, you will see margin expansion. And by the way, this is a very fast development of orders. We have almost more than a dozen OEMs signing up for OTA technology. And half of those dozen are directly HARMAN customers. Other half are actually going through other Tier 1s because this technology is agnostic to any ECU. So all in all, Connected Services looks pretty promising, and that was the rationale we had.

I am pleased that this morning we announced very strong results for the fourth quarter and full year. Our fourth quarter results came in stronger than our forecast, with net sales increasing 12% to $1.9 billion. We expanded our operating margins and delivered a 20% year-over-year improvement in EBITDA and a 14% year-over-year improvement in earnings per share. 
We successfully mitigated the supply chain disruption in our automotive business following the recent earthquake in Japan, and we capitalized on increased demand for our consumer audio products in May and June. In addition, our business in China had a strong finish, with record full year revenue of approximately $800 million, up nearly 20% from the prior year. I'm also pleased that the Professional Solutions division achieved our Q4 target on top and bottom line. 
The fourth quarter caps another banner year for HARMAN. Revenue, EBITDA and earnings per share all reached record highs. We exceeded $6.9 billion in revenue, an increase of 16%, excluding foreign exchange. EBITDA improved 23% to $836 million, and we grew earnings per share by 13% to $6.24. 
I am pleased to report that our automotive backlog now stands at $24.1 billion. Our technology leadership and ability to successfully deploy intelligent connected solutions for the car that are safe and secure is resonating with customers. Not only did we win next-generation business from existing customers, we added new automakers to our customer list. Over the last 2 years, we have added $11 billion of new automotive awards. That is momentum. Our record automotive backlog of more than $24 billion provides HARMAN a strong foundation for long-term growth. 
Now let me take a closer look at our divisions and review some recent notable achievements. Let's start with our Connected Car division, which is highlighted on Slide 7 of your investor presentation. During the quarter, we secured several new and follow-on awards to provide connected car solutions for customers, including Harley-Davidson, Porsche, Toyota and a North American automaker. Advancing our telematics strategy, we secured an award from a premium German automaker for an industry-first solution for the main gateway to the car, providing a unique connectivity platform. 
This solution integrates the power expended -- this solution integrates, that -- powers the expanded telematics features and enables system diagnostics, remote control capabilities and system software updates. The automaker will also employ HARMAN's cloud-based over-the-air update technology, ensuring that critical software fixes, feature additions and upgrades can be easily and squarely and safely transmitted and added to the vehicle while on the road, not only for HARMAN head units but also for onboard ECUs from other Tier 1 suppliers. This comprehensive gateway platform is an industry first. HARMAN is the only supplier with these proprietary technologies to create this end-to-end solution. 
A product like this is a perfect example of how our bolt-on acquisitions are paying off. We strategically expanded our capabilities in over-the-air update technology, cybersecurity, cloud applications and data analytics. And when we combine these with our own deep expertise in connectivity technologies, we can create unique solutions for our customers that are smart, safe, secure and real-time updatable. 
We continue to receive accolades for our industry leadership. In June, HARMAN was named Supplier of the Year at the Automotive Interior Expo, in Stuttgart, Germany, highlighting our competence in embedded infotainment and telematics solutions. Also, in Consumer Reports' most recent guide to infotainment systems, the highest rated system is designed and built by HARMAN as well. 
Now turning to Lifestyle Audio division. Some of our recent notable achievements are highlighted on Slide 8 of the investor presentation. During the quarter, HARMAN won new business awards with Hyundai, Kia, Audi, Lexus, Subaru, SGM Wuling in China and Toyota. In addition, we secured our first award for our premium Summit audio platform with an electric vehicle company. This scalable Summit platform provides the foundation to integrate the best of HARMAN's sound processing and sound management technologies, along with new features like Connected Jukebox and Virtual Venues, to create an unprecedented in-car audio experience. As further proof of HARMAN's leadership in the industry, we won a Ford World Excellence Award for our Revel audio system in Lincoln vehicles. 
Turning to consumer audio. As I mentioned earlier, we finished a very strong quarter, with increasing demand of our award-winning products due to great design and expanded distribution channels. For the year, we won a total of 56 design and innovation awards across our consumer audio portfolio. Let me also remind you that we have been selected by Lufthansa to provide our noise-canceling headphones across their fleet. 
Now turning to the Professional Solutions division. In May, we appointed Mohit Parasher as the President for the division. Mohit is a seasoned leader with more than 20 years of experience growing audio, video and systems business throughout Asia, Middle East and Europe. Mohit brings a new level of energy and sense of urgency to Professional Solutions business. 
Last year, we implemented our enterprise and entertainment solutions-based go-to-market strategy, and we took cost actions in Europe. This year, we are focused on taking additional steps to improve cost structure in North America. We are already seeing encouraging signs of momentum in the enterprise segment. Not only have we booked several significant awards in corporate, government and education markets, we will also launch a number of integrated solutions to support these focused verticals. We expect these actions will help restore Professional to historic levels of growth and profitably. Some of the notable wins and events for the quarter are highlighted on Slide 9 of the investor presentation. 
Now turning to the Connected Services division, highlighted on Slide 10 of your presentation. During the quarter, we secured several awards to provide software services for BMW, FCA, Microsoft, PSA and Reliance. In addition, we partnered with NXP Semiconductors to jointly offer new software gateway solutions to the automotive market. We continued to capitalize on our industry-leading, cloud-based OTA software update technology, winning awards from leading OEMs, such as FCA, Porsche and Subaru. We now have over $150 million in OTA software auto backlog, and about half of it is in the automotive space covering over a dozen OEMs and growing. 
In summary, this was a year of records across the board at HARMAN. Our success in 2016 demonstrates our team's ability to execute and deliver profitable growth. You will recall, in 2013, we set out an ambitious plan to grow HARMAN revenues to $6 billion by '16. Today, we reported almost $7 billion in revenue and more than doubled our 2013 EBITDA. This morning, we have also provided financial guidance for 2017 and presented a longer-term outlook. Our CFO, Sandy Rowland, will provide you the details later. 
As we look forward, we see significant growth opportunities across all the divisions. In the automotive space, the industry is experiencing an unprecedented social and technological transformation, fueled by increasing intelligent connectivity and supported by autonomous vehicles, electrification, and urban mobility. The car is getting an upgrade as never seen before. HARMAN is well positioned to capitalize on each of these trends. 
Let me remind you, our portfolio of integrated technologies now includes embedded infotainment solutions ranging from Display Audio to an intelligent compute platform addressing entry, mid and high vehicle classes; enhanced telematics products and gateway solutions; industry-leading cybersecurity; and OTA products for all ECUs, whether HARMAN supplied or non-HARMAN supplied; superior automotive audio technologies like Individual Sound Zones, HALOsonic and Summit; data analytics and back-end software services to complement ADAS development in the industry; and a number of innovations still in our pipeline. We have the end-to-end value proposition that automakers are looking for. Building on our strong backlog of awarded business and track record of execution, we expect continued growth in our automotive revenue. 
At the same time, due to the staggered timing of various automotive program launches and roll-offs, we expect to see lower growth in 2018, followed by strong growth in 2019 and beyond. This is a cycle that is common in our business. We have experienced it before, as recently as 2013. As shown on Slide 14 of our presentation, we experienced accelerated growth for several years after the transition year in 2013. In fiscal 2018, we will continue to ramp up new programs and make R&D investments, both to deliver on the contracts we have won and to capitalize on the major trends we discussed earlier. 
Longer term, we are confident that we will see accelerated revenue expansion from our automotive backlog, higher-margin automotive services and the increasing market demand for Connected Car and autonomous driving technologies. On top of that, there are additional reasons to be excited. With autonomous driving, the in-car audio experience or sound management becomes even more essential. With our record $6.6 billion of car audio backlog and continued growth in take rates, we expect car audio to continue to lead the company in profitability and grow faster than the company average. 
In addition, we have confidence in the turnaround of our Professional business. With all the actions we have taken, we are optimistic that we can return margins to historical levels over the medium term. Together with the continued growth in our consumer audio business and increasing opportunities in Connected Services, we are squarely on the path towards achieving our goal of $11 billion in revenue by 2021. 
Now I will turn the call over to Sandy, who will give you additional color on our financial results."

Let me walk you through our financial highlights for the quarter and provide additional detail on our outlook for fiscal year 2017 and beyond. As a reminder, most of my financial remarks are provided on an op",1103,"Thank you, Dinesh, and good morning, everyone. Let me walk you through our financial highlights for the quarter and provide additional detail on our outlook for fiscal year 2017 and beyond. As a reminder, most of my financial remarks are provided on an operational basis, which excludes acquisition-related items, restructuring and nonrecurring charges. The full reconciliation of our GAAP to our operational results is included in the press release that we issued this morning. This quarter, our revenues were $1.9 billion, an increase of 12% compared to the prior year. Revenue in our Connected Car division increased 11% versus the prior year primarily due to higher take rates and stronger production. Revenue in our Lifestyle Audio division increased 25% compared to the prior year. The increase in net sales was primarily due to higher take rates and the acquisition of Bang & Olufsen automotive in-car audio and higher consumer audio sales driven by continued strong demand for smart audio solutions. Revenue in our Professional Solutions division increased 1% compared to the prior year. Revenue in our Connected Services division increased 7% to $185 million in the quarter compared to $173 million a year ago, primarily due to higher demand for engineering services. 
Total company gross margin increased 110 basis points to 30.5% primarily due to the impact of higher sales volume, leveraging a more efficient fixed production cost base and productivity initiatives. Connected Car gross margin increased 300 basis points to 25.5% and Lifestyle Audio gross margin increased 380 basis points to 35.1%, both benefiting from better leverage of fixed costs, lower warranty expenses and manufacturing productivity. 
Professional Solutions gross margin decreased 340 basis points to 36.7%, driven by product mix and new factory start-up costs in Hungary. In Connected Services, the timing of booked revenue is tied to specific milestones in longer-term engineering projects while expenses are recognized as incurred. This can result in margin volatility. As a result, for the fourth quarter, Connected Services gross margin declined 850 basis points to 28.2%. Beginning in fiscal 2017, we will use percentage of completion accounting for significant new contracts. This is expected to reduce some of the volatility. 
Our SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales increased 20 basis points from the prior year to 20.7%. Connected Car SG&A increased 110 basis points to 14.1% and Lifestyle Audio SG&A increased 20 basis points to 20.2%, both due to higher research and development costs to support awarded business. SG&A expense in Professional Solutions remained in line with the prior year. Connected Services SG&A as a percentage of sales decreased 180 basis points to 18.2% due to better leverage on higher sales. Finally, corporate SG&A as a percentage of sales declined by 10 basis points to 2.3%. 
Putting it all together, our consolidated operating income was $185 million compared to $150 million in the prior year, a 24% increase. Below the line, we had higher income tax expenses in the quarter due to an increase in U.S. tax from deemed income on foreign earnings and jurisdictional mix, resulting in a higher-than-forecasted effective tax rate. EPS was $1.57 compared to a $1.37 in the prior year, up 14%. 
Now turning to the full year. In fiscal year 2016, revenue, EBITDA and EPS all reached record highs for HARMAN. Revenue was $6.9 billion, an increase of 16% excluding foreign exchange. And EBITDA reached $836 million, a 23% increase excluding foreign exchange, and we grew EPS from $5.71 to $6.24, a 13% increase excluding foreign exchange. 
Now let me spend a few minutes on cash and capital allocation. In fiscal 2016, we generated nearly $450 million of cash flow from operations, driven by strong earnings and effective working capital management, and we invested approximately $200 million in capital expenditures. In the fiscal year, we repurchased approximately 1.6 million shares at a cost of $140 million. Combined with $100 million in dividends, we returned a record $240 million to our shareholders, over half of our cash generated from operations. We ended the fiscal year with $602 million in cash. Across the board, this wraps up a solid fiscal year for HARMAN. 
Now let's turn to our guidance for fiscal 2017. First, we are making a slight adjustment to our divisional reporting structure. We will move our aftermarket car audio business from the Connected Services division to the Lifestyle Audio division as this product line shares our consumer go-to-market organization and the consumer product innovation center in Shenzhen, China. Slide 16 shows the impact is approximately $60 million in revenue on a full year basis. 
As Dinesh indicated, we are targeting between $7.3 billion and $7.5 billion in revenue for fiscal 27 -- '17 and between $900 million and $940 million in EBITDA. Our forecast is based on a number of key assumptions, namely: global GDP growth of approximately 2.5%, global automotive production growth between 2% and 3%, global industry embedded infotainment take rates increasing from about 27% to 30% and a euro-to-dollar exchange rate of 1.10. We expect top line growth and EBITDA expansion across all 4 divisions. Furthermore, we expect about $180 million in depreciation and amortization expenses, between $50 million and $60 million in interest expense and miscellaneous charges. And we estimate that our tax rate will be between 27.5% and 28%, and we have assumed a similar level of share repurchase as fiscal 2016. 
Assuming approximately 72 million shares outstanding, our EPS will be between $6.75 and $7. We will remain opportunistic in buying back our shares incrementally to our current plan. We have approximately $360 million remaining on our board-authorized share repurchase program, which runs until October 2017. 
This morning, we also provided a longer-term outlook. Our assumptions regarding the macroeconomic and automotive production environment are similar to our 2017 guidance assumptions. We are targeting a high single-digit revenue CAGR over the next 3 years reaching approximately $8.6 billion in revenue by fiscal 2019. In addition, we expect to grow our EBITDA margins to about 13.5% in fiscal '19, representing a 140 basis point improvement compared to fiscal year 2016. As Dinesh pointed out, we do expect lower revenue growth in fiscal 2018 due to the staggered timing of various automotive program launches and roll-offs. In subsequent years, we'll have a number of new programs reaching full scale, positioning us for accelerated growth. 
In summary, we are pleased with our fiscal 2016 performance. We have set robust targets for fiscal 2017 and the next 3 years, and we are focused on innovation and execution to deliver against these targets. 
Thank you for your attention. Dinesh and I are now happy to take your questions."

So yes, first of all, we're very happy with 2016 record revenue and EBITDA and EPS. And with the great backlog we have, especially, I repeat, $11 billion order bookings in the last 2 years, that gives us momentum. So we are very confident about out years. As we indicated, 2018 directional outlook is a slower growth and, in fact, flattish Connected Car revenue. And that is primarily due to rolling off of some of the programs while we're still ramping up the large programs both in Europe and North America. But they will not be fully at scale. So that's what is reflected in '19 and 2021, double-digit growth, and we have a number of North American and even Asian programs coming up, which also have very good margins. So we feel very good about '19, '21. Also, '18 is actually still a good year. We are still growing and still expanding our margins. Let me also mention one highlight which is reflected in our guidance and has impacted '18 slower growth. As you all know, that in North America, we have a great customer in FCA, Fiat Chrysler Automotive, and we still supply to them, a large part of infotainment comes from HARMAN. In fact, we are the primary supplier of audio. And in fact, in June, the Consumer Reports even named it as a top infotainment, what Chrysler is using from HARMAN. Having said that, there are multiple suppliers of infotainment to FCA, which I have said in my earlier calls. Based on FCA's current sourcing strategy, our infotainment volume in fiscal '18 may be lower, and it is reflected in our 2018 guidance and beyond. As you are aware, we have won a couple of follow-on awards as well as, over the year, update awards with them for across the car line globally. On top of that, we are also continuing to ship audio and infotainment. And with that said, our strong relationship with FCPA -- FCA, we are well positioned for their next-generation infotainment program, which we expect to be available for bidding in the next 12 to 18 months."

And then my next and last question is on the impact, if any, that you see to HARMAN from the potential acquisition of Fiat Chrysler's Magneti Marelli business by Samsung Electronics. I don't think there is much overlap between your 2 businesses currently, but there has been some speculation that Samsung could perhaps be interested in using Magneti as some sort of launchpad to get into automotive infotainment. So what can you say about the barriers to entry on the embedded side? Or what competitive advantages you have that you think can keep newer entrants at bay on the embedded side? And then if they were to get into more connected audio, sort of à la Apple, the extent to which that is not necessarily a competitive threat."

The Magneti Marelli is a large Tier 1 and very small player in infotainment. In fact, similar to another smaller sort of player in North America, which was up for the sale, which people had passed, Magneti Marelli has also tried to sell their infotainment business over the last several years. And we have worked with them off and on, but they really don't really make a viable player as is. And especially when you think about how fast the space is changing, it's not about traditional instrument cluster or infotainment or basic amplification and speakers. It has moved on to a full connectivity intelligence, over-the-air update, cybersecurity, a scalable end-to-end service platform. It's all about analytics, which we'll partner with the companies like Mobileye, take their sensors' information and create information. So it's the scale, it's the technology, it's the R&D power. So we will see what that means if that acquisition happens, but we see almost no impact on our current or in our near to midterm future."

So let's start with Professional Solutions business, then I'll talk about Connected Services. So first of all, this is a good business. We have built a robust portfolio of audio, video, lighting and automation, and we have expanded our customer segment to corporate, government and education beyond traditional recording studios and touring sound. This business has a 4-pronged turnaround strategy, which I feel very comfortable with. The number one starts with leadership, sense of urgency. We have fixed that. Number two, we are addressing our channels. Channels, we are going some markets direct; some, we are going indirect. But we are training the channels to sell the solutions to enterprise and entertainment segment. And the third is cost leadership. You know us in HARMAN. We are really paranoid about cost every year, and automotive is a good training ground. So we already took some very strong actions last year. We shut down 2 factories in Europe in high cost, and we moved into a brand-new factory in Hungary. And that, we already said over 100 basis point of bottom line improvement, which is already starting to happen. So we will have that this year. It will improve. And then, of course, we have whole slew of new integrated products being launched this year, which absolutely are going to fit the segment strategy for corporate, government, education and entertainment and enterprise. So with that said, 130 basis point improvement in fiscal '17 is very reasonable. And 3% top line growth, this is after we already stabilized the business in Q4, we feel very comfortable. Now moving on to Connected Services business. That business actually, if you peel the onion and just take what we acquired in Symphony Teleca, this actually grew almost 14% and actually had margins, EBITDA, also around 14%, 15%. What we did last year, we had 2 pieces added to that business. One was our aftermarket car audio, which actually really belonged to consumer audio. Because if you take that out, this business moves up to nearly 13% -- actually nearly 14% EBITDA, which we have already shown in our slide deck. On top of that, we also acquired last year a company called Redbend, and that company is a great technology and we're winning a ton of business, but is in development mode. And we took about $12 million, $15 million bottom line hit for that. So if you adjust for that, our service business actually performed exactly to our deal turns and our expectation, nearly 15%. So expecting 15% margins in '17 and expecting 8% growth is a very reasonable target. In midterm, I expect this business to grow at mid -- double digit and also perform mid to high teens bottom line."

And there, we see good improvement in take rate, so that will continue to drive. Then we also expect, as we already have 14% EBITDA in our Connected Services business, with Redbend not making losses, hopefully, in '17, we'll be close to 0, breakeven point. That would bring us nearly 15% EBITDA in Connected Services. So it's reasonable to expect in '18 another 100 basis point improvement in the bottom line. Then the third business is professional. This year, we feel pretty good about 3% top line and hitting margin improvement of almost 13.7% or nearly 14%. That business should also reach its historic levels of mid-teens in EBITDA. So all 3 businesses performing quite well. And the fourth one, also performing very well, the Connected Car. Only thing is it will not have the same scale effect, although the same profitability, same good leverage and continue to invest in our R&D on the new programs, which will be ramping up fully in end of '18 and beginning of '19.

Lifestyle has 2 businesses, almost same, equal, $1 billion each roughly. Our car audio business is our profit king in the company. And there, we have nearly -- well, $6.6 billion going into $7 billion auto backlog. And here, entry to -- barrier to entry is very high. Once you are in, you are really in with the kind of technology. So there, we continue to see, as take rates improvement happen, margin improvement will continue to help, EPS accretive. And then second business is almost $1 billion also, which is a great scale for consumer audio. Now consumer audio, we have created our own niche. We have smart audio, and smart audio means all wireless, all intelligent, all cloud-based speakers and home audio headphones. And that business has evolved very well. As a matter of fact, just last month, our JBL portable speaker ranked #1 in Europe by research company GfK. And China has started to show great development in terms of their appetite for American branded consumer audio products. So all in all, it did quite well. Q4 came in very strong. Now reminding you, as we go forward, with a $1 billion base in consumer audio, we can grow, if you want, 20% a year. Or we can choose where we want to grow to protect the margin. And I would go for the protecting margins. We are reaching close to 10% now in our consumer audio and almost 20% in car audio. So call them, blended, it's 15%. I want to push more margin-driven growth. That's why our growth targets we have given are very balanced."

If a scenario develops where take rates on upper-end Display Audio improve at the expense of, say, mid-level infotainment with embedded nav, because I could argue with that sort Display Audio, optional nav coming through Apple CarPlay gets you pretty close to mid-level infotainment with embedded nav. Just how are you positioned for that trend? What do you have in each category? And what kind of assumptions are you making vis-à-vis kind of the OEM kind of the showroom mix around those products in 2018, 2019?"

So Brian, first of all, let's go back to our picture, which we have been sharing with you. There's a pie. And if you divide the pie into half, the bottom half of the pie is basically traditional AM/FM radio or really nothing, just a hole. And the top half of the pie, you divide into 2 quadrants. The left quadrant, we have traditionally said it is the embedded infotainment, and other quadrant is the Display Audio. So what we are witnessing, and we already saw a similar development last year, the bottom half of the pie is transforming either into Display Audio or into embedded infotainment. My personal thesis is, based on a lot of discussions with OEMs, if we all believe that we're going towards autonomous or semi-autonomous driving, cars cannot be run from devices in your hand or in the pocket. Then you will need to have a strong compute platform in the car, sensors, technology and various other things in it. Therefore, even Display Audio is an intermediate step to go towards s fully embedded system. So in the near term or midterm, 5, 7 years, Display Audio will actually almost come from the nothing, AM/FM and so will embedded infotainment. Where 60%, 65% embedded infotainment in 4 to 5 years is pretty much everybody's take right now. So we would actually benefit and enjoy both types -- slice of the pie growing. Where we are into Display Audio, we are also into entry systems, mid systems and the high systems. So we'll grow both. While, at the same time, you mentioned CarPlay. We are actually implementing CarPlay. We are implementing and Android Google AutoLink. We are also implementing Baidu CarLife and few other things. So these are all smart apps we'll implement on all the systems as we go forward."

So that is basically the optionality, which means it will be from AM/FM or nothing in the car to Display Audio, where you have optionality to either ask for nav or bring your own nav, which we actually support, which is an incremental business for us because we have traditionally been in fully embedded nav and everything else. And we still do that. In addition, we are doing Display Audio. We have almost $1 billion award from a North American customer for Display Audio, and we have miscellaneous other awards from Asia, others. So I think that is definitely going to be the case for the next few years. But let's not forget, in addition, there's a whole lot more going in these cars. So the Display Audio might be a system architecture, but it still has a lot of software. So they're looking for over-the-air technology. They're looking for other sensor fusion. They're looking for telematics. So telematics is another new area where the new ground is being broken with a gateway approach, which is where we just won a major award with a German automaker. And that's also going to be playing out both in Display Audio segment as well as fully embedded nav segment. So market is expanding."

Display Audio does not require complex R&D, and Display Audio is pretty much a final result of our scalable platform approach. So we develop our platform, and we can actually implement that on multiple programs with some adaptation. So we are able to protect our margins, and we have done that over the years. However, coming back to our sweet spot is actually mid-segment. That's where we supply fully blown -- full-blown embedded systems with many other things. Now we are also adding to that telematics and many other products. And that's where margins are good because we are bringing a lot of value and new technology. So all in all, if you look at our total backlog of just Connected Car, that is double-digit profit margin in that. And when you start to flush it through the revenue line, scale does help. And by the way, we continue to take cost-reduction programs, which is a way of life. There's nothing new we announced. So with that said, we feel very comfortable in further margin expansion in this business, and also, we are selective what we take. We don't necessarily take any business. We'll generally walk away if the business does not meet our requirement. And you have heard that from me many, many times, and we have actually shown that in our results, that we are very margin savvy and protective."

Then we have also 2 other verticals, telecom, which is also kind of merging more and more into auto side. And then we have enterprise software development. But staying with the overall connected business, analytics is going to play big. We have 1,500 data scientists in our company, which a lot of people don't realize. We're a powerhouse in data. And data analytics will be a big deal in automotive industry. Second, Redbend we acquired, put it in our services business. I said earlier we have already over $150 million software backlog, with 75% of operating margin in it. As you start to go to the bottom and to the revenue line, you will see margin expansion. And by the way, this is a very fast development of orders. We have almost more than a dozen OEMs signing up for OTA technology. And half of those dozen are directly HARMAN customers. Other half are actually going through other Tier 1s because this technology is agnostic to any ECU. So all in all, Connected Services looks pretty promising, and that was the rationale we had. And I think we are seeing great opportunities for growth."

I'm pleased to report that our fiscal year is off to a very good start, the solid results for the first quarter. Net sales increased 8% to $1.8 billion. We expanded our operating margins and delivered a 15% year-over-year improvement in EBITDA. This puts our EBITDA margin at a company record of 12.9%, and we achieved 27% year-over-year improvement in earnings per share. 
I'm particularly pleased with the strong results in our Lifestyle Audio division, which posted 19% year-over-year revenue growth and 50% EBITDA growth. Our unmatched brand portfolio and product innovations are paying off. We're gaining market share against competition for our award-winning consumer audio products, and we're building a lot of momentum and increasing take rates for our car audio and sound management solutions. 
I'm very excited to report that we have been successful in keeping up the momentum in new automotive business wins. During the quarter, we secured over $2 billion of awards, complementing our year-end $24 billion auto backlog. 
In the automotive business, we're witnessing a very interesting trend. HARMAN is not only supplying a compute platform with cutting-edge technology, but also a full suite of car audio and sound management solutions. As you all know, we are the market leader in both of these areas, and we're the only company that can deliver this integrated offering. With our innovation, we have been displacing several competitors over the last few years. As we continue to gain market share, the gap between HARMAN and its competitors has been widening at a faster pace. We have broken this down for you on Page 6 of the slide deck. 
If you release -- if you quickly look at slide deck, you will see since the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we have recognized over $9 billion in automotive revenues. During the same period, we booked over $13 billion of new awards. This means our awards are growing faster than our revenue, and our book-to-bill ratio is 1.4:1. 
In our most profitable business, that is car audio and sound management, the awards grew even faster, with a book-to-bill ratio of 2:1. 
Let me talk a little more about our recent wins in the car audio and sound management business. Following the successful launch of the Revel brand in Lincoln vehicles, I'm pleased to announce the expansion of our business with Ford, another long-term partnership we will supply B&O PLAY-branded car audio systems to Ford's vehicles, cost car line globally. 
In the Connected Car division, we had wins across geographies and vehicle categories, including autos for high-end, fully embedded compute platforms to entry-level display audio systems, covering wide spectrum of offerings. We are seeing growing demand from our customers for expanded portfolio of connected car solutions, including telematics, cybersecurity, over-the-air updates and advanced safety features. We continue to integrate third-party ADAS offerings while at the same time, developing proprietary solutions such as ADAS, object detection, vision algorithms and surround view software solutions, to name a few. 
In Connected Services, we achieved a new milestone for our over-the-air update software business. As we speak, more than 1 million vehicles on the road are using HARMAN OTA, and this number is growing rapidly. Automakers' response for this offering has been overwhelmingly positive. Not only have we already secured awards from over a dozen OEMs across 3 continents, half of these awards were secured through other Tier 1s. This demonstrates how our OTA solution is on its way to become the industry standard. These wins are strong evidence that automakers and consumers continue to demand an enhanced in-car experience. We are addressing this trend and winning in the marketplace with a unique portfolio of solutions across Connected Car, Lifestyle Audio and Connected Services. 
Before I talk about divisions in more details, let me briefly discuss our rapid growth in China, which I'm extremely proud of. You may recall in 2009, our revenue in China was less than $50 million. Last year, our revenue reached $800 million. That is 50% cumulative annual growth over the last 7 years. This quarter, we grew our revenue in China over 40%, and we have more than $4 billion of automotive order backlog. Needless to say, we have been taking market share left and right in China from our competition. We're growing our automotive business through imports and with the Chinese OEMs as well. We have a very strong foundation in China, with more than 3,000 people and growing to -- and growing. We have 2 world-class manufacturing plants, multiple state-of-the-art research and development centers, engineering and design centers. China is an important long-term growth market. We are winning in automotive, and our iconic brands are boosting our consumer and professional growth. 
Now let me take a closer look at our divisions and review some recent notable achievements. Let's start with our Connected Car division, which is highlighted on Slide 7 of our investor presentation. During the quarter, we secured new and follow-on awards to provide connected car solutions for customers, including Audi, Geely, Maruti Suzuki in India, Mercedes-Benz, Porsche and heavy-truck manufacturer, MAN of Volkswagen Group. During the quarter, we launched embedded infotainment solutions in Land Rover, Audi, Toyota, Porsche and Skoda vehicles. We also began delivering embedded infotainment solutions to the commercial truck market, launching solutions in Volkswagen Group's MAN and Scania trucks. MAN's infotainment system, developed by HARMAN, includes expanded telematics features like digital radio, hands-free telephony and truck-specific navigations. The HARMAN system for Scania includes innovations such as dual mobile phone connectivity, real-time navigation and cloud-based connectivity to fleet management systems. I'm particularly excited about this potential of growth for HARMAN solutions in the commercial fee space. This is a growing market and provides us with an enormous growth opportunity globally unlike any other Tier 1. 
Building on our momentum in winning telematics business, we entered a strategic partnership with AT&T to support the telematics ecosystem. HARMAN's telematics control unit was selected by AT&T for its Mobile Broadband Accelerator program. This pre-certified solution enables rapid deployment of our offering in the industry. 
We continue to receive accolades for our industry-leading innovation, winning a CTIA wireless award for our pupil-based monitoring software and Best in Category awards from Germany's Connect Magazine for our Connected Car systems. HARMAN was the first company to develop a comprehensive cybersecurity framework for automakers. 
We doubled down on research and development investments and acquisitions in the space over the last 2 years. We are setting the industry standard in cybersecurity. And ladies and gentlemen, there will be no autonomous car without the protection of cybersecurity. You have heard me say that many times. Validating our leadership, I'm very proud to share with you first time these following extensive third-party evaluations conducted by NHTSA and the University of Michigan, HARMAN's suite of intrusion detection and mitigation technologies was rated best in class. That is incredible news for the whole industry. 
Now turning to the Lifestyle Audio division, some of our recent notable achievements are highlighted on Slide 8 of the investor presentation. Audio and sound management are essential parts of the connected car experience, and our award-winning car audio solutions continue to resonate with drivers, leading to another strong quarter of double-digit growth in the car audio business. OEMs are recognizing the growing importance of audio and sound management solutions, both in current vehicle design as well as a critical part of the in-car experience in semi-autonomous and fully autonomous vehicles. This trend is validated by our recent wins and our growing audio backlog. I already mentioned the Ford expansion. On top of that, we secured additional awards with Lincoln, Maserati of FCA Group and Toyota. 
During the quarter, we launched car audio solutions in Toyota, Lexus and Alfa Romeo vehicles. And HALOsonic and advanced transducer audio solutions in the Mercedes-AMG E-Class vehicles. 
And now turning to consumer audio. We grew double digits in the quarter due to strong demand for connected and personalized smart audio products. We continue to take market share. In fact, the most recent data from future source confirms HARMAN added over 300 basis points in market share from early 2015 to summer of 2016. This signals that demand for our award-winning products is growing and our design, technology, brands and distribution strategies are working. 
And we are not stopping here. We continue to bring new award-winning products to the market. At the IFA conference in Berlin last September, we launched 33 new products, including a new wireless headphone lineup, a new waterproof portable speaker series. This fall, we also launched JBL-Under Armour co-branded wireless heart rate monitoring headphones. This was the second product introduced as part of the strategic partnership. Most recently, we announced the JBL Playlist audio speaker featuring Google Cast technology. It connects via WiFi and streams directly from the cloud to the speaker, without requiring Bluetooth pairing. This obviously simplifies the user experience while dramatically improving the audio quality. 
Now turning to the Professional Solutions division, highlighted on Slide 9 of the investor presentation. Over the last couple quarters, we have been implementing a series of strategic initiatives. On the cost side, we have completed our European consolidation into Hungary, and we are currently executing additional footprint actions in the U.S. On the top line, we have committed to leveraging the strength of our portfolio to better serve our enterprise and entertainment customers through solutions tailored for focused vertical markets. As an example, HARMAN and IBM announced an exciting strategic partnership last week at the World of Watson conference to bring together HARMAN's end-to-end solution with IBM Watson's cognitive computing capability. Together, HARMAN and IBM will integrate artificial intelligence and smart connectivity, enabling IoT in HARMAN's audio, video and lighting products. We have a successful pilot running at Thomas Jefferson Hospital in Philadelphia that allows patients to use voice commands to alter the temperature in the room, turn off the lights or even ask whether their test results have come in yet. The voice-activated assistant can address many of their nonmedical needs, freeing up medical professionals when they're needed most. Additional applications for HARMAN and IBM Watson extend to hotel, conference room, education. But you can also imagine the possibilities throughout the enterprise and entertainment markets.  It's very exciting. Transformational projects like this are exactly why we reorganized our Professional Solutions division. 
Turning specifically to the quarter, HARMAN's entertainment and enterprise solutions were selected by eBay Corporation, Dubai Parks and Resorts, London Business School and the U.S. presidential inauguration to be held in January. As a matter of fact, we're starting to see some nice order pickup, which will convert into revenue in the coming quarters. 
Some notable installations during the quarter include the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., Sky Harbour Airport in Phoenix and the U.S. Naval command center in San Diego. HARMAN solutions also powered a wide range of high-profile special events, including the Tony award-winning musical Hamilton, G20 Gala in China as well as World Tours for the bands like Metallica and Coldplay. Yes, hard rock bands, Metallica and Coldplay. We remain confident in our strategy for the Professional Solutions division. Our integrated vertical market strategy is gaining traction, and we are focused on new product innovation and cost leadership. We expect to return to growth on a sustainable basis starting next quarter. 
Now turning to the Connected Services division, highlighted on Slide 10 of the investor presentation. During the quarter, we secured awards to provide software services for Honeywell, Intel and Microsoft, among others. We continue to win business with our cloud-based over-the-air software update solutions, including awards from Daimler and LG Electronics. In addition, HARMAN received recognition for its software engineering services capabilities from Cisco and market advisory from Xenon. 
In summary, we are off to a solid start to deliver on our fiscal 2017 targets. We achieved record EBITDA and record earnings per share in the quarter, added over $2 billion of new automotive and software services award and continued to execute on our backlog successfully. We remain focused on innovation, execution and driving cost leadership, which have become hallmark of this company's success. And that is applying to all our businesses. 
Now I will turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Sandy Rowland, who will give you additional color on our financial results for the quarter."

Let me walk you through our financial highlights for the quarter. As a reminder, most of my financial remarks are provided on an operational basis, which excludes acquisition-related items, restructuring and nonrecurring charges. The full reconciliation of our GAAP to our operational results is included in the press release that we issued this morning. 
This quarter, our revenues were $1.8 billion, an increase of 8% compared to the prior year. Revenue in our Connected Car division increased 6% versus the prior year, primarily due to higher take rates and stronger production. Revenue in our Lifestyle Audio division increased 19% compared to the prior year. The increase in net sales was primarily due to higher consumer audio sales, driven by continued strong demand for smart audio solutions and higher take rates in car audio. Revenue in our Connected Services division increased 4% compared to a year ago, primarily due to higher demand for automotive services, while revenue in our Professional Solutions division decreased 3% compared to the prior year. 
Total company gross margin increased 80 basis points to 30.8%, primarily due to the impact of higher sales volume, leveraging a more efficient fixed production cost base and productivity initiatives. Connected Car gross margin increased 110 basis points to 24.8%, benefiting from better leverage of fixed costs and manufacturing productivity. Lifestyle Audio gross margin increased 290 basis points to 35.4%, primarily due to margin expansion in car audio as a result of operating leverage and manufacturing excellence. Professional Solutions gross margin decreased 240 basis points to 39.2%, driven by product mix. 
We are seeing manufacturing cost savings from our footprint migration initiatives. However, as we continue to focus on bringing down our inventory levels in this division, we have lower fixed cost absorption, impacting gross margin in the near term. 
Connected Services gross margin declined 280 basis points to 31.1%, primarily due to higher revenue recognition of high-margin engineering change orders in the prior year. 
We have started to use percentage of completion accounting for significant new contracts, which is expected to reduce some of the volatility. 
Our SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales decreased 20 basis points from the prior year to 20.1%. Connected Car SG&A increased 60 basis points to 12.6% to support growth in awarded business. 
While R&D expense in car audio increased to support our expanding backlog, Lifestyle Audio SG&A decreased 70 basis points to 20.2% due to better leverage on higher sales. SG&A expense in Professional Solutions increased 20 basis points compared to the prior year. Connected Services SG&A expense decreased 200 basis points to 19.3% as a result of footprint migration initiatives related to the integration of Redbend. 
Finally, corporate SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased by 10 basis points to 2.1%. 
Putting it all together, our consolidated operating income was $187 million compared to $158 million in the prior year, a 19% increase. Below the line, we had an effective tax rate of 25.2%, which is lower than our guidance of 27.5% to 28% for the full year. Our guidance takes into account potential tax law changes that we are actively monitoring. And at this time, we are maintaining our tax rate guidance. 
Finally, EPS was $1.87 compared to $1.48 in the prior year, up 27%. 
Let me spend a few minutes on cash and capital allocation. We generated $36 million of free cash flow, which we define as cash flow from operations less CapEx, an improvement of approximately $185 million, driven by strong earnings and effective working capital management. 
During the quarter, we were active buyers of our stock. We repurchased approximately 450,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of $35 million. We now have approximately $325 million remaining on our board authorized share repurchase program, and we will continue to be opportunistic buyers of our stock. 
We are pleased to be off to a good start in fiscal year 2017. We are on track to deliver on our full year guidance, and we look forward to speaking to you about our business at upcoming investor conferences and seeing you in January at our CES technology event. 
Thank you for your attention. Dinesh and I are now happy to take your questions."

When it comes to proliferation of car audio take rates, yes, of course, China, starting points are very low, low single-digit penetration, if you look at whole China. So there, of course, the Chinese consumers, or I would say Asian consumers are very brand hungry. They want American iconic brands to be in their car, and our car company customers continue to find overwhelmingly market research that branded car audio is helping them differentiate their own cars. Having said that, we're actually seeing the penetration of car audio across the world. I mentioned to you we expanded our relationship with Ford, which is a fantastic news. It's a very good business with Ford. Now we replaced a competitor at the high-end Lincoln. We also replaced a competitor for cross car line for Ford worldwide, with both brands coming from HARMAN. In addition, we won business with other German and Asian automakers for car audio. And you saw that I was extremely pleased to share with you our order backlogs for car audio the book-and-bill has gone 2:1 ratio, which means our future is even better.

But as you think about what they've done, do you see that spreading to other OEMs? And then also, is that good news for HARMAN in terms of maybe increasing the take rates at the high end by taking away that objection of I don't need embedded nav? Or bad news of us even if that happens, there is loss of markup on the nav?"

Let me sort of bring it all together. So first of all, what's happening, as you have heard before and that if you look at the whole pie, the whole market, so nearly 50% of the business, the bottom half of the pie has been nothing or simple AM/FM radio. Top half of the pie was split equally 25-25 into fully embedded, navigation-based infotainment system and another one was display audio, which means, to put simply -- simply put, it's full embedded system minus navigation. So you can bring your own kind of a thing. What we are witnessing, the bottom half of the pie is very fast moving into both quarters of the top 5, which means either going to us display audio or going into embedded audio. My firm belief, supported by big OEMs worldwide, is that you will see fast migration at equal pace. But very soon, in couple years, you will see even display audio consumers will start to migrate towards fully embedded. Because it's not clear that if cars are going to be autonomous or semi-autonomous, you can't run them from a handheld device. This is a post-device era we are talking about. The very distributed strong compute platform, which HARMAN is leader in, will actually be part of the car and better system and cloud applications. So that's what we are seeing, and we are happy that we're playing on both sides of display audio as well as embedded audio and winning in both sides. Then you also know what else is happening is OTA. The over-the-air update technology is something which is just emerging, and we have the unique patented technology with 15 years of R&D. And we have one more than a dozen OEMs, including FCA, every single car line FCA received an order for our system as well as non-HARMAN systems to be updated by our OTA technology. And as far as the large screen, Brian, that seem to be sort of personal choice, and more and more people are asking for it. Therefore, display unit is becoming very important part. The user interface, the contextual and the smart user interface, their display devices, display units will play bigger role. Consolidation of industry here is even likely to happen more because nearly, 1/3 of COG -- cost of goods sold is getting to close to display unit. We are supplying large display units. As you mentioned, you connect, that is the HARMAN system has been. It won actually in 2016 Best Infotainment System award by Consumer Report. And we are seeing similarly in our Mercedes S class BMW 7 series, Audi A8, those cars we're also seen large screen. And I guess, Asian consumers will definitely offer large screen. So I think that seem to be the trend."

Whether you're in display audio or full embedded system, the only difference is navigation, which is a component of multiple parts come together to create compute platform. So we're providing choices of using any nav, whether you use 3D high-definition maps, which we supply to our customers or you can use a simple 2D Google Maps or what have you. So choices are there available to you. But imagine, it's still the whole multimedia, the tuner technology, the hands-free telephony, the interface with other ECUs in the car, that still has to be done even for display audio. And that's what our system for Ford is all about, highly integrated display audio, large-screen, but still would have the choice. And eventually, the system can also integrate onboard navigation or you can bring it your own. And we are gaining ground as far as the penetration of the take rates. Traditionally, we had seen about 300 basis point year-over-year improvement in take rate, where the display audio embedded. We are playing on both, and we're seeing the same take rate improvement. In fact, slightly more for us because we are working with the customers where the take rates are higher. So I think runway for HARMAN for take rate is pretty strong with nearly $24 billion, $25 billion order backlog. I think we have perhaps the fastest opportunity to grow this business the next 5 to 10 years."

So based on that knowledge, do you expect any material change in your gross margin or operating margin profile in the Connected Car division as that mix changes towards Display Audio going forward? And then secondly, I wonder if you could discuss a little bit the kind of the sensitivity to the model. If we get a decline in auto production next year given investor concerns right now, maybe a bit of an explanation of how the cost structure's changed since the last recession. If you don't any sensitivity analysis on if you are to get a 5% decline of production, what that would mean for the business and cost structure."

Having said that, Display Audio is a good business. It meets our margin requirements. It's not dilutive. Actually, it's accretive all in all. When it comes to sensitivity to the market production, as we guided for the full '17, 2% to 3%. Actually, that -- the production guidance still holds because we guided China to be around 3%, 3.5%. China is tracking over 6%. We guided Europe to be right around 0% to 1%. Europe came in slightly weaker. U.S. is holding. So all in all, global production for our fiscal year is in line, and we feel good about our full year guidance. Hypothetically, if production becomes flat or even lower than that, I think that's where the cost advantage and the baseline cost comes in. And let Sandy give some color."

I think the way to break it down is if you look at our portfolio of businesses, remember that we have business that's outside of the automotive space. So overall, about 65% of our revenues across connected car and car audio come from automotive. So it's about 65% of our company's exposure, which is right around $4.7 billion. So each point of production is worth somewhere between $45 million and $50 million to the top line. And if you look at it from a leverage standpoint, we've typically said that we get about 20% operating leverage on the upside. And it works that way on the downside as well, typically between 20% to 25%. And if it stays down longer, we'll take -- continue to take cost actions to mitigate any of the erosion."

All 3 are totally worked on the new leader of the division, who brings tremendous sense of urgency. We already consolidated our European footprint, which is flowing through our bottom line, almost 100 basis point improvement in the margins this year, which we confirmed to you last time. This year, we have already announced and we are working on execution of couple U.S. sites, which will also add another 50 to 100 basis point improvement once we are done by end of this year. On top of that, brand-new -- many new products will be launched, and you will see some of them coming out at NAM, which is North America Professional Audio Society January 2017. So new products being launched to fulfill the solution needs for enterprise and entertainment. Another great example for that was IBM Watson, the strategic partnership, how we are enabling IoT in professional audio video lighting, first-time any company doing that's HARMAN. And third go-to-market, sales training for our own people and our channels, distributors and reps is undergoing very well. We are seeing traction. In fact, orders we have booked in Q1 are very encouraging to me. And the way we see it, October sales is already in, so we have a little better visibility. Q2 should be a growth quarter. And from this point on, you should expect growth. And in the end, I will say this business is a great business, has been good business for HARMAN, and we expect this business to return to double-digit margin soon, and then from there on, be a good contributor to the company."

So cybersecurity, unless you missed my opening comments, I shared with you one of the breaking news that, together with University of Michigan, conducted a third-party research and evaluation of available cybersecurity intrusion detection and mitigation solutions and HARMAN ranked #1, absolutely best-in-class. And this is extremely encouraging for me personally because we actually double [ph] down years ago when no one talked about cybersecurity we said without cybersecurity, you should not even dream of autonomous or semi-autonomous. As soon as you connect your car, you got bad guys coming in your car. So we are actually leading that space. And just like we did for QNX, making a standard, we are doing for OTA, Redbend technology, and we think our cybersecurity will become industry standard. So we're very happy about it, and we have number of customers right now in RFQ phase where our cybersecurity would be integral part of the offerings. Turning to QNX. QNX is one of the several operating systems out there. And HARMAN used to own QNX, and we have incredible competence and we used QNX still in some of our systems.

It's a great question, and it is a strategic question, which I hope gets asked all the time because I think we have clearly broken out from the pack of other Tier 1s. So in connected car, with what is different dating HARMAN from rest is we're only company who has the most powerful compute platform with wide integration capability of multiple ECUs supplied by various other Tier 1s. And we're the one who worked agnostically with all silicon memory suppliers whether it's Intel, Samsung, STI, Nvidia, QUALCOMM NXP. And we created what for them designed a unique solution for automotive and then we deploy that. In addition, we are also the company who has broken out in telematics space, we have been doing telematics for multiples generations in Germany and in the United States. Now we have launched very first order industries first, I repeat, gateway-based telematics for a German OEM, which we believe will become another trend. And the third is cybersecurity and ADAS solutions. Cybersecurity been doubling down and also, OTA, we have clear market lead on that. We have 1 14 [ph] car companies already, 6 or 7 through directly to HARMAN and others through other competitors. And ADAS, you heard me say we integrate some of the best of the best, whether it's coming from more work or, and we also develop our own object detection, vision algorithms and camera 360s surround view, implementing in Asia as well as the German automakers. So that's the differentiation in connected car. In car audio, our key differentiation is having the access to the world's best brand. That is differentiating the top luxury cars from the other premium cars. And then when it comes to creating next-generation solutions, I mentioned, imagine you're sitting in a shared economy in a car with 3 other passengers you don't know you're sitting with, you will need to have your own individual sound video zone. That's HARMAN patented technology. So we are doing a we are doing ambient noise cancellation. We are doing engine auto cancellation. We are doing individual sound zones. So combine it with unique market-leading iconic brand and sound management system, that put us apart from anybody. And by the way, I repeat, worthily company-wide that power of car audio and sound management and Connected Car. No other Tier 1 can boast that."

I'm pleased to report that our fiscal year is off to a very good start, the solid results for the first quarter. Net sales increased 8% to $1.8 billion. We expanded our operating margins and delivered a 15% year-over-year improvement in EBITDA. This puts our EBITDA margin at a company record of 12.9%, and we achieved 27% year-over-year improvement in earnings per share. 
I'm particularly pleased with the strong results in our Lifestyle Audio division, which posted 19% year-over-year revenue growth and 50% EBITDA growth. Our unmatched brand portfolio and product innovations are paying off. We're gaining market share against competition for our award-winning consumer audio products, and we're building a lot of momentum and increasing take rates for our car audio and sound management solutions. 
I'm very excited to report that we have been successful in keeping up the momentum in new automotive business wins. During the quarter, we secured over $2 billion of awards, complementing our year-end $24 billion auto backlog. 
In the automotive business, we're witnessing a very interesting trend. HARMAN is not only supplying a compute platform with cutting-edge technology, but also a full suite of car audio and sound management solutions. As you all know, we are the market leader in both of these areas, and we're the only company that can deliver this integrated offering. With our innovation, we have been displacing several competitors over the last few years. As we continue to gain market share, the gap between HARMAN and its competitors has been widening at a faster pace. We have broken this down for you on Page 6 of the slide deck. 
If you release -- if you quickly look at slide deck, you will see since the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we have recognized over $9 billion in automotive revenues. During the same period, we booked over $13 billion of new awards. This means our awards are growing faster than our revenue, and our book-to-bill ratio is 1.4:1. 
In our most profitable business, that is car audio and sound management, the awards grew even faster, with a book-to-bill ratio of 2:1. 
Let me talk a little more about our recent wins in the car audio and sound management business. Following the successful launch of the Revel brand in Lincoln vehicles, I'm pleased to announce the expansion of our business with Ford, another long-term partnership we will supply B&O PLAY-branded car audio systems to Ford's vehicles, cross-car line globally. 
In the Connected Car division, we had wins across geographies and vehicle categories, including autos for high-end, fully embedded compute platforms to entry-level display audio systems, covering wide spectrum of offerings. We are seeing growing demand from our customers for expanded portfolio of connected car solutions, including telematics, cybersecurity, over-the-air updates and advanced safety features. We continue to integrate third-party ADAS offerings while at the same time, developing proprietary solutions such as ADAS, object detection, vision algorithms and surround view software solutions, to name a few. 
In Connected Services, we achieved a new milestone for our over-the-air update software business. As we speak, more than 1 million vehicles on the road are using HARMAN OTA, and this number is growing rapidly. Automakers' response for this offering has been overwhelmingly positive. Not only have we already secured awards from over a dozen OEMs across 3 continents, half of these awards were secured through other Tier 1s. This demonstrates how our OTA solution is on its way to become the industry standard. These wins are strong evidence that automakers and consumers continue to demand an enhanced in-car experience. We are addressing this trend and winning in the marketplace with a unique portfolio of solutions across Connected Car, Lifestyle Audio and Connected Services. 
Before I talk about divisions in more details, let me briefly discuss our rapid growth in China, which I'm extremely proud of. You may recall in 2009, our revenue in China was less than $50 million. Last year, our revenue reached $800 million. That is 50% cumulative annual growth over the last 7 years. This quarter, we grew our revenue in China over 40%, and we have more than $4 billion of automotive order backlog. Needless to say, we have been taking market share left and right in China from our competition. We're growing our automotive business through imports and with the Chinese OEMs as well. We have a very strong foundation in China, with more than 3,000 people and growing to -- and growing. We have 2 world-class manufacturing plants, multiple state-of-the-art research and development centers, engineering and design centers. China is an important long-term growth market. We are winning in automotive, and our iconic brands are boosting our consumer and professional growth. 
Now let me take a closer look at our divisions and review some recent notable achievements. Let's start with our Connected Car division, which is highlighted on Slide 7 of our investor presentation. During the quarter, we secured new and follow-on awards to provide connected car solutions for customers, including Audi, Geely, Maruti Suzuki in India, Mercedes-Benz, Porsche and heavy-truck manufacturer, MAN of Volkswagen Group. During the quarter, we launched embedded infotainment solutions in Land Rover, Audi, Toyota, Porsche and Skoda vehicles. We also began delivering embedded infotainment solutions to the commercial truck market, launching solutions in Volkswagen Group's MAN and Scania trucks. MAN's infotainment system, developed by HARMAN, includes expanded telematics features like digital radio, hands-free telephony and truck-specific navigations. The HARMAN system for Scania includes innovations such as dual mobile phone connectivity, real-time navigation and cloud-based connectivity to fleet management systems. I'm particularly excited about this potential of growth for HARMAN solutions in the commercial fee space. This is a growing market and provides us with an enormous growth opportunity globally unlike any other Tier 1. 
Building on our momentum in winning telematics business, we entered a strategic partnership with AT&T to support the telematics ecosystem. HARMAN's telematics control unit was selected by AT&T for its Mobile Broadband Accelerator program. This pre-certified solution enables rapid deployment of our offering in the industry. 
We continue to receive accolades for our industry-leading innovation, winning a CTIA wireless award for our pupil-based monitoring software and Best in Category awards from Germany's Connect Magazine for our Connected Car systems. HARMAN was the first company to develop a comprehensive cybersecurity framework for automakers. 
We doubled down on research and development investments and acquisitions in the space over the last 2 years. We are setting the industry standard in cybersecurity. And ladies and gentlemen, there will be no autonomous car without the protection of cybersecurity. You have heard me say that many times. Validating our leadership, I'm very proud to share with you first time these following extensive third-party evaluations conducted by NHTSA and the University of Michigan, HARMAN's suite of intrusion detection and mitigation technologies was rated best in class. That is incredible news for the whole industry. 
Now turning to the Lifestyle Audio division, some of our recent notable achievements are highlighted on Slide 8 of the investor presentation. Audio and sound management are essential parts of the connected car experience, and our award-winning car audio solutions continue to resonate with drivers, leading to another strong quarter of double-digit growth in the car audio business. OEMs are recognizing the growing importance of audio and sound management solutions, both in current vehicle design as well as a critical part of the in-car experience in semi-autonomous and fully autonomous vehicles. This trend is validated by our recent wins and our growing audio backlog. I already mentioned the Ford expansion. On top of that, we secured additional awards with Lincoln, Maserati of FCA Group and Toyota. 
During the quarter, we launched car audio solutions in Toyota, Lexus and Alfa Romeo vehicles. And HALOsonic and advanced transducer audio solutions in the Mercedes-AMG E-Class vehicles. 
And now turning to consumer audio. We grew double digits in the quarter due to strong demand for connected and personalized smart audio products. We continue to take market share. In fact, the most recent data from future source confirms HARMAN added over 300 basis points in market share from early 2015 to summer of 2016. This signals that demand for our award-winning products is growing and our design, technology, brands and distribution strategies are working. 
And we are not stopping here. We continue to bring new award-winning products to the market. At the IFA conference in Berlin last September, we launched 33 new products, including a new wireless headphone lineup, a new waterproof portable speaker series. This fall, we also launched JBL-Under Armour co-branded wireless heart rate monitoring headphones. This was the second product introduced as part of the strategic partnership. Most recently, we announced the JBL Playlist audio speaker featuring Google Cast technology. It connects via WiFi and streams directly from the cloud to the speaker, without requiring Bluetooth pairing. This obviously simplifies the user experience while dramatically improving the audio quality. 
Now turning to the Professional Solutions division, highlighted on Slide 9 of the investor presentation. Over the last couple quarters, we have been implementing a series of strategic initiatives. On the cost side, we have completed our European consolidation into Hungary, and we are currently executing additional footprint actions in the U.S. On the top line, we have committed to leveraging the strength of our portfolio to better serve our enterprise and entertainment customers through solutions tailored for focused vertical markets. As an example, HARMAN and IBM announced an exciting strategic partnership last week at the World of Watson conference to bring together HARMAN's end-to-end solution with IBM Watson's cognitive computing capability. Together, HARMAN and IBM will integrate artificial intelligence and smart connectivity, enabling IoT in HARMAN's audio, video and lighting products. We have a successful pilot running at Thomas Jefferson Hospital in Philadelphia that allows patients to use voice commands to alter the temperature in the room, turn off the lights or even ask whether their test results have come in yet. The voice-activated assistant can address many of their nonmedical needs, freeing up medical professionals when they're needed most. Additional applications for HARMAN and IBM Watson extend to hotel, conference room, education. But you can also imagine the possibilities throughout the enterprise and entertainment markets. It's very exciting. Transformational projects like this are exactly why we reorganized our Professional Solutions division. 
Turning specifically to the quarter, HARMAN's entertainment and enterprise solutions were selected by eBay Corporation, Dubai Parks and Resorts, London Business School and the U.S. presidential inauguration to be held in January. As a matter of fact, we're starting to see some nice order pickup, which will convert into revenue in the coming quarters. 
Some notable installations during the quarter include the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., Sky Harbor Airport in Phoenix and the U.S. Naval Command Center in San Diego. HARMAN solutions also powered a wide range of high-profile special events, including the Tony Award-winning musical Hamilton, G20 gala in China as well as world tours for the bands like Metallica and Coldplay. Yes, hard rock bands, Metallica and Coldplay. We remain confident in our strategy for the Professional Solutions division. Our integrated vertical market strategy is gaining traction, and we are focused on new product innovation and cost leadership. We expect to return to growth on a sustainable basis starting next quarter. 
Now turning to the Connected Services division, highlighted on Slide 10 of the investor presentation. During the quarter, we secured awards to provide software services for Honeywell, Intel and Microsoft, among others. We continue to win business with our cloud-based over-the-air software update solutions, including awards from Daimler and LG Electronics. In addition, HARMAN received recognition for its software engineering services capabilities from Cisco and market advisory firm, Zinnov. 
In summary, we are off to a solid start to deliver on our fiscal 2017 targets. We achieved record EBITDA and record earnings per share in the quarter, added over $2 billion of new automotive and software services award and continued to execute on our backlog successfully. We remain focused on innovation, execution and driving cost leadership, which have become hallmark of this company's success. And that is applying to all our businesses. 
Now I will turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Sandy Rowland, who will give you additional color on our financial results for the quarter."

Let me walk you through our financial highlights for the quarter. As a reminder, most of my financial remarks are provided on an operational basis, which excludes acquisition-related items, restructuring and nonrecurring charges. The full reconciliation of our GAAP to our operational results is included in the press release that we issued this morning. 
This quarter, our revenues were $1.8 billion, an increase of 8% compared to the prior year. Revenue in our Connected Car division increased 6% versus the prior year, primarily due to higher take rates and stronger production. Revenue in our Lifestyle Audio division increased 19% compared to the prior year. The increase in net sales was primarily due to higher consumer audio sales, driven by continued strong demand for smart audio solutions and higher take rates in car audio. Revenue in our Connected Services division increased 4% compared to a year ago, primarily due to higher demand for automotive services, while revenue in our Professional Solutions division decreased 3% compared to the prior year. 
Total company gross margin increased 80 basis points to 30.8%, primarily due to the impact of higher sales volume, leveraging a more efficient fixed production cost base and productivity initiatives. Connected Car gross margin increased 110 basis points to 24.8%, benefiting from better leverage of fixed costs and manufacturing productivity. Lifestyle Audio gross margin increased 290 basis points to 35.4%, primarily due to margin expansion in car audio as a result of operating leverage and manufacturing excellence. Professional Solutions gross margin decreased 240 basis points to 39.2%, driven by product mix. 
We are seeing manufacturing cost savings from our footprint migration initiatives. However, as we continue to focus on bringing down our inventory levels in this division, we have lower fixed cost absorption, impacting gross margin in the near term. 
Connected Services gross margin declined 280 basis points to 31.1%, primarily due to higher revenue recognition of high-margin engineering change orders in the prior year. 
We have started to use percentage of completion accounting for significant new contracts, which is expected to reduce some of the volatility. 
Our SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales decreased 20 basis points from the prior year to 20.1%. Connected Car SG&A increased 60 basis points to 12.6% to support growth in awarded business. 
While R&D expense in car audio increased to support our expanding backlog, Lifestyle Audio SG&A decreased 70 basis points to 20.2% due to better leverage on higher sales. SG&A expense in Professional Solutions increased 20 basis points compared to the prior year. Connected Services SG&A expense decreased 200 basis points to 19.3% as a result of footprint migration initiatives related to the integration of Redbend. Finally, corporate SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased by 10 basis points to 2.1%. 
Putting it all together, our consolidated operating income was $187 million compared to $158 million in the prior year, a 19% increase. Below the line, we had an effective tax rate of 25.2%, which is lower than our guidance of 27.5% to 28% for the full year. Our guidance takes into account potential tax law changes that we are actively monitoring. And at this time, we are maintaining our tax rate guidance. Finally, EPS was $1.87 compared to $1.48 in the prior year, up 27%. 
Let me spend a few minutes on cash and capital allocation. We generated $36 million of free cash flow, which we define as cash flow from operations less CapEx, an improvement of approximately $185 million, driven by strong earnings and effective working capital management. 
During the quarter, we were active buyers of our stock. We repurchased approximately 450,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of $35 million. We now have approximately $325 million remaining on our board-authorized share repurchase program, and we will continue to be opportunistic buyers of our stock. 
We are pleased to be off to a good start in fiscal year 2017. We are on track to deliver on our full year guidance, and we look forward to speaking to you about our business at upcoming investor conferences and seeing you in January at our CES technology event. 
Thank you for your attention. Dinesh and I are now happy to take your questions."

Same thing we are doing in car audio. So back to your question, we have roughly -- this division is split pretty much equally in both, but we saw very good development of our consumer business -- consumer audio business grew nearly 25%, and our car audio business grew 15-plus percent in this quarter, which we're extremely pleased with."

When it comes to the proliferation of car audio take rates, yes, of course, China, starting points are very low, low single-digit penetration if you look at whole China. So there, of course, the Chinese consumers, or I would say Asian consumers are very brand hungry. They want American iconic brands to be in their car, and our car company customers continue to find overwhelmingly market research that branded car audio is helping them differentiate their own cars. Having said that, we're actually seeing the penetration of car audio across the world. I mentioned to you we expanded our relationship with Ford, which is a fantastic news. It's a very good business with Ford. Now we replaced a competitor at the high-end Lincoln. We also replaced a competitor for cross-car line globally for Ford worldwide, with both brands coming from HARMAN. In addition, we won business with other German and Asian automakers for car audio. And you saw that I was extremely pleased to share with you our order backlogs for car audio the book-and-bill has gone 2:1 ratio, which means our future is even better. Margins in our backlogs are getting better every quarter, every year."

But interesting what they're doing in the market is offering the big-screen you connect, as we understand it, as with or without embedded nav, which could take away some of what we -- well, the question is that I can see the consumer appeal there for younger people who don't believe in embedded nav and believe in their smartphones, especially as now Google lets you preload your local maps, reducing data usage. But as you think about what they've done, do you see that spreading to other OEMs? And then also, is that good news for HARMAN in terms of maybe increasing the take rates at the high end by taking away that objection of I don't need embedded nav? Or bad news because even if that happens, there's loss of markup on the nav?"

So first of all, what's happening, as you have heard before that if you look at the whole pie, the whole market, so nearly 50% of the business, the bottom half of the pie has been nothing or simple AM/FM",467,"Good, Brian. Let me sort of bring it all together. So first of all, what's happening, as you have heard before that if you look at the whole pie, the whole market, so nearly 50% of the business, the bottom half of the pie has been nothing or simple AM/FM radio. The top half of the pie was split equally 25-25 into fully embedded, navigation-based infotainment system and another one was display audio, which means, to put simply -- simply put, it's full embedded system minus navigation. So you can bring your own kind of a thing. What we are witnessing, the bottom half of the pie is very fast moving into both quarters of the top 5, which means either going towards display audio or going into embedded audio. My firm belief, supported by big OEMs worldwide, is that you will see fast migration at equal pace. But very soon, in a couple years, you will see even display audio consumers will start to migrate towards fully embedded. Because it's not clear that if cars are going to be autonomous or semi-autonomous, you can't run them from a handheld device. This is a post-device era we are talking about. The very distributed strong compute platform, which HARMAN is leader in, will actually be part of the car embedded system, the cloud applications. So that's what we are seeing, and we are happy that we're playing on both sides of display audio as well as embedded audio and winning in both sides. Then you also know what else is happening is OTA. The over-the-air update technology is something which is just emerging, and we have the unique patented technology with 15 years of R&D. And we have one more than a dozen OEMs, including FCA, every single cross-car line FCA received an order for our systems as well as non-HARMAN systems to be updated by our OTA technology. And as far as the large screen, Brian, that seemed to be sort of personal choice, and more and more people are asking for it. Therefore, display unit is becoming a very important part. The user interface, the contextual and the smart user interface, their display devices, display units will play a bigger role. Consolidation of industry here is even likely to happen more because nearly 1/3 of COG, cost of goods sold, is getting to close to display unit. We are supplying large display units. As you mentioned, Uconnect, that is a HARMAN system, has been. It won actually in 2016 Best Infotainment System award by Consumer Report. And we are seeing similarly in our Mercedes S-Class BMW 7 Series, Audi A8, those cars we're also seeing large screen. And I guess, Asian consumers will definitely offer large screen. So I think that seemed to be the trend."

So we're providing choices of using any nav, whether you use 3D high-definition maps, which we supply to our customers or you can use a simple 2D Google Maps or what have you. So choices are there available to you. But imagine, it's still the whole multimedia, the tuner technology, the hands-free telephony, the interface with other ECUs in the car, that still has to be done even for display audio. And that's what our system for Ford is all about, highly integrated display audio, large screen, but you still would have the choice. And eventually, the system can also integrate onboard navigation. Or you can bring it your own. And we are gaining ground as far as the penetration of the take rates. Traditionally, we had seen about 300 basis point year-over-year improvement in take rate, whether it's display audio or fully embedded. We're playing on both and we're seeing same take rate improvement. In fact, slightly more for us because we are working with the customers where the take rates are higher. So I think runway for HARMAN for take rate is pretty strong with nearly $24 billion, $25 billion of order backlog.

The first quarter this year, we actually were very pleased with incredible growth, 25%. And we expect Q2 to be similar or even better. Second half is slightly weaker because you have the seasonality. But we think our strength is not just coming because of what you just mentioned with the company, but we are seeing incredible penetration of smart portables. We actually became #1 supplier in the world by GfK, a market tracking agency, in smart portable wireless speakers, and we are seeing similar growth now in our smart headphones. Some of the headphones are even now updated over-the-air with the firmware, software, so the incredible technology we're bringing. So Under Armour is a third piece. As an example, the strategic partnerships like Under Armour in consumer audio or IBM Watson in professional audio will continue to bring more momentum. So Under Armour is a great brand. We're developing jointly products. The product which we just launched called in-ear heart rate monitoring. And let me stress that. This is one of a kind product. It's a military-grade heart rate monitoring, absolutely accurate. So this is designed for athletes, but priced for mass market. So we expect it to also take off very nicely. And you will see some incredible product launches at IFA -- I mean, at CES in January in Las Vegas. So we feel good about this division to continue the great momentum we have."

I think all 4 divisions are developing well. Professional division, you heard me say that Q2 should be a growth quarter for us. And then from there on, we should see sustainable growth development. So we feel good about in Connected Services. You also mentioned, for Connected Service, typically, our Q4 is the most strongest quarter.

Yes, we are market leader with a 25% of the world market and then rest is sharing 75%, so we win obviously a lot of business, but we also walk away from others. Having said that, Display Audio is a good business. It meets our margin requirements. It's not dilutive, actually, it's accretive, all in all. When it comes to sensitivity to the market production, as we guided for the full '17, 2% to 3%. Actually, that -- the production guidance still holds because we guided China to be around 3%, 3.5%. China is tracking over 6%. We guided Europe to be right around 0% to 1%. Europe came in slightly weaker. U.S. is holding. So all in all, global production for our fiscal year is in line, and we feel good about our full year guidance.

All 3 are totally worked on as the new leader of the division, who brings tremendous sense of urgency. We already consolidated our European footprint, which is flowing through our bottom line, almost 100 basis point improvement in the margins this year, which we confirmed to you last time. This year, we have already announced and we are working on execution of couple U.S. sites, which will also add another 50 to 100 basis point improvement once we are done by end of this year. On top of that, brand-new -- many new products will be launched, and you will see some of them coming out at NAMM, which is North America Professional Audio Society, January 2017.

It's a great question, and it is a strategic question, which I hope gets asked all the time because I think we have clearly broken out from the pack of other Tier 1s. So in Connected Car, what is differentiating HARMAN from rest is we're the only company who has the most powerful compute platform with wide integration capability of multiple ECUs supplied by various other Tier 1s. And we're the one who worked agnostically with all silicon or memory suppliers whether it's Intel, Samsung, TI, NVIDIA, Qualcomm, NXP. And we create -- we worked with them, designed a unique solution for automotive and then we deploy that. In addition, we are also the company who has broken out in telematics space. We have been doing telematics for multiple generations in Germany and in the United States. Now we have launched very first order industries first, I repeat, gateway-based telematics for a German OEM, which we believe will become another trend. And the third is cybersecurity and ADAS solutions. Cybersecurity had been doubling down and also, OTA, we have clear market lead on that. We have won 14 car companies already, 6 or 7 of them through directly to HARMAN and others through other competitors. And ADAS, you heard me say we integrate some of the best of the best, whether it's coming from Mobileye or from somewhere else. And we also develop our own object detection, vision algorithms and that camera 360s surround view, implementing in Asia as well as the German automakers. So that's our differentiation in connected car. In car audio, our key differentiation is having the access to the world's best brand. That is differentiating the top luxury cars from the other premium cars. And then when it comes to creating next-generation solutions, I mentioned, imagine you're sitting in a shared economy in a car with 3 other passengers you don't know you're sitting with, you will need to have your own individual sound/video zone. That's HARMAN's patented technology. So we are doing road noise cancellation. We are doing ambient noise cancellation. We are doing engine noise cancellation. We are doing individual sound zones. So combine it with unique market-leading iconic brand and sound management system, that put us apart from anybody.

I am pleased to report that our fiscal year is off to a very good start, with solid results for the first quarter. Net sales increased 8% to $1.8 billion. We expanded our operating margins and delivered a 15% year-over-year improvement in EBITDA. This puts our EBITDA margin at a company record of 12.9%, and we achieved 27% year-over-year improvement in earnings per share. 
I'm particularly pleased with the strong results in our Lifestyle Audio division, which posted 19% year-over-year revenue growth and 50% EBITDA growth. Our unmatched brand portfolio and product innovations are paying off. We're gaining market share against competition for our award-winning consumer audio products, and we're building a lot of momentum and increasing take rates for our car audio and sound management solutions. 
I'm very excited to report that we have been successful in keeping up the momentum in new automotive business wins. During the quarter, we secured over $2 billion of awards, complementing our year-end $24 billion auto backlog. 
In the automotive business, we're witnessing a very interesting trend. HARMAN is not only supplying a compute platform with cutting-edge technology, but also a full suite of car audio and sound management solutions. As you all know, we are the market leader in both of these areas, and we're the only company that can deliver this integrated offering. With our innovation, we have been displacing several competitors over the last few years. As we continue to gain market share, the gap between HARMAN and its competitors has been widening at a faster pace. We have broken this down for you on Page 6 of the slide deck. 
If you release -- if you quickly look at slide deck, you will see since the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we have recognized over $9 billion in automotive revenues. During the same period, we booked over $13 billion of new awards. This means our awards are growing faster than our revenue, and our book-to-bill ratio is 1.4:1. 
In our most profitable business, that is car audio and sound management, the awards grew even faster, with a book-to-bill ratio of 2:1. 
Let me talk a little more about our recent wins in the car audio and sound management business. Following the successful launch of the Revel brand in Lincoln vehicles, I'm pleased to announce the expansion of our business with Ford. Under this long-term partnership we will supply B&O PLAY-branded car audio systems to Ford's vehicles, cross car line globally. 
In the Connected Car division, we had wins across geographies and vehicle categories, including orders for high-end, fully-embedded compute platforms to entry-level display audio systems, covering wide spectrum of offerings. We are seeing growing demand from our customers for expanded portfolio of connected car solutions, including telematics, cybersecurity, over-the-air updates and advanced safety features. We continue to integrate third-party ADAS offerings while at the same time, developing proprietary solutions such as ADAS, object detection, vision algorithms and surround view software solutions, to name a few. 
In Connected Services, we achieved a new milestone for our over-the-air update software business. As we speak, more than 1 million vehicles on the road are using HARMAN OTA, and this number is growing rapidly. Automakers' response for this offering has been overwhelmingly positive. Not only have we already secured awards from over a dozen OEMs across 3 continents, half of these awards were secured through other Tier 1s. This demonstrates how our OTA solution is on its way to become the industry standard. These wins are strong evidence that automakers and consumers continue to demand an enhanced in-car experience. We are addressing this trend and winning in the marketplace with a unique portfolio of solutions across Connected Car, Lifestyle Audio and Connected Services. 
Before I talk about divisions in more details, let me briefly discuss our rapid growth in China, which I'm extremely proud of. You may recall in 2009, our revenue in China was less than $50 million. Last year, our revenue reached $800 million. That is 50% cumulative annual growth over the last 7 years. This quarter, we grew our revenue in China over 40%, and we have more than $4 billion of automotive order backlog. Needless to say, we have been taking market share left and right in China from our competition. We're growing our automotive business through imports and with the Chinese OEMs as well. We have a very strong foundation in China, with more than 3,000 people and growing to -- and growing. We have 2 world-class manufacturing plants, multiple state-of-the-art research and development centers, engineering and design centers. China is an important long-term growth market. We are winning in automotive, and our iconic brands are boosting our consumer and professional growth. 
Now let me take a closer look at our divisions and review some recent notable achievements. Let's start with our Connected Car division, which is highlighted on Slide 7 of our investor presentation. During the quarter, we secured new and follow-on awards to provide connected car solutions for customers, including Audi, Geely, Maruti Suzuki in India, Mercedes-Benz, Porsche and heavy-truck manufacturer, MAN of Volkswagen Group. During the quarter, we launched embedded infotainment solutions in Land Rover, Audi, Toyota, Porsche and Skoda vehicles. We also began delivering embedded infotainment solutions to the commercial truck market, launching solutions in Volkswagen Group's MAN and Scania trucks. MAN's infotainment system, developed by HARMAN, includes expanded telematics features like digital radio, hands-free telephony and truck-specific navigations. The HARMAN system for Scania includes innovations such as dual mobile phone connectivity, real-time navigation and cloud-based connectivity to fleet management systems. I'm particularly excited about this potential of growth for HARMAN solutions in the commercial fee space. This is a growing market and provides us with an enormous growth opportunity globally unlike any other Tier 1. 
Building on our momentum in winning telematics business, we entered a strategic partnership with AT&T to support the telematics ecosystem. HARMAN's telematics control unit was selected by AT&T for its Mobile Broadband Accelerator program. This pre-certified solution enables rapid deployment of our offering in the industry. 
We continue to receive accolades for our industry-leading innovation, winning a CTIA wireless award for our pupil-based monitoring software and Best in Category award from Germany's Connect Magazine for our Connected Car systems. HARMAN was the first company to develop a comprehensive cybersecurity framework for automakers. 
We doubled down on research and development investments and acquisitions in the space over the last 2 years. We are setting the industry standard in cybersecurity. And ladies and gentlemen, there would be no autonomous car without the protection of cybersecurity. You have heard me say that many times. Validating our leadership, I'm very proud to share with you first time the following extensive third-party evaluations conducted by NHTSA and the University of Michigan: HARMAN's suite of intrusion detection and mitigation technologies was rated best in class. That is incredible news for the whole industry. 
Now turning to the Lifestyle Audio division, some of our recent notable achievements are highlighted on Slide 8 of the investor presentation. Audio and sound management are essential parts of the connected car experience, and our award-winning car audio solutions continue to resonate with drivers, leading to another strong quarter of double-digit growth in the car audio business. OEMs are recognizing the growing importance of audio and sound management solutions, both in current vehicle design as well as a critical part of the in-car experience in semi-autonomous and fully autonomous vehicles. This trend is validated by our recent wins and our growing audio backlog. I already mentioned the Ford expansion. On top of that, we secured additional awards with Lincoln, Maserati of FCA Group and Toyota. 
During the quarter, we launched car audio solutions in Toyota, Lexus and Alfa Romeo vehicles, and HALOsonic and advanced transducer audio solutions in the Mercedes-AMG E-Class vehicles. 
And now turning to consumer audio. We grew double digits in the quarter due to strong demand for connected and personalized smart audio products. We continue to take market share. In fact, the most recent data from Futuresource confirms HARMAN added over 300 basis points in market share from early 2015 to summer of 2016. This signals that demand for our award-winning products is growing and our design, technology, brands and distribution strategies are working. 
And we are not stopping here. We continue to bring new award-winning products to the market. At the IFA conference in Berlin last September, we launched 33 new products, including a new wireless headphone lineup, a new waterproof portable speaker series. This fall, we also launched JBL-Under Armour co-branded wireless heart rate monitoring headphones. This was the second product introduced as part of a strategic partnership. Most recently, we announced the JBL Playlist audio speaker featuring Google Cast technology. It connects via WiFi and streams directly from the cloud to the speaker, without requiring Bluetooth pairing. This obviously simplifies the user experience while dramatically improving the audio quality. 
Now turning to the Professional Solutions division, highlighted on Slide 9 of the investor presentation. Over the last couple of quarters, we have been implementing a series of strategic initiatives. On the cost side, we have completed our European consolidation into Hungary, and we are currently executing additional footprint actions in the U.S. On the top line, we have committed to leveraging the strength of our portfolio to better serve our enterprise and entertainment customers through solutions tailored for focused vertical markets. As an example, HARMAN and IBM announced an exciting strategic partnership last week at the World of Watson conference to bring together HARMAN's end-to-end solution with IBM Watson's cognitive computing capability. Together, HARMAN and IBM will integrate artificial intelligence and smart connectivity, enabling IoT in HARMAN's audio, video and lighting products. We have a successful pilot running at Thomas Jefferson Hospital in Philadelphia that allows patients to use voice commands to alter the temperature in the room, turn out the lights or even ask whether their test results have come in yet. The voice-activated assistant can address many of their nonmedical needs, freeing up medical professionals when they are needed most. Additional applications for HARMAN and IBM Watson extend to hotel, conference room, education. But you can also imagine the possibilities throughout the enterprise and entertainment markets. It's very exciting. Transformational projects like this are exactly why we reorganized our Professional Solutions division. 
Turning specifically to the quarter, HARMAN's entertainment and enterprise solutions were selected by eBay Corporation, Dubai Parks and Resorts, London Business School and the U.S. presidential inauguration to be held in January. As a matter of fact, we're starting to see some nice order pickup, which will convert into revenue in the coming quarters. 
Some notable installations during the quarter include the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., Sky Harbor Airport in Phoenix and the U.S. Naval Command Center in San Diego. HARMAN solutions also powered a wide range of high-profile special events, including the Tony Award-winning musical Hamilton, G20 gala in China as well as world tours for the bands like Metallica and Coldplay. Yes, hard rock bands, Metallica and Coldplay. We remain confident in our strategy for the Professional Solutions division. Our integrated vertical market strategy is gaining traction, and we are focused on new product innovation and cost leadership. We expect to return to growth on a sustainable basis starting next quarter. 
Now turning to the Connected Services division, highlighted on Slide 10 of the investor presentation. During the quarter, we secured awards to provide software services for Honeywell, Intel and Microsoft, among others. We continue to win business with our cloud-based over-the-air software update solutions, including awards from Daimler and LG Electronics. In addition, HARMAN received recognition for its software engineering services capabilities from Cisco and market advisory firm, Zinnov. 
In summary, we are off to a solid start to deliver on our fiscal 2017 targets. We achieved record EBITDA and record earnings per share in the quarter, added over $2 billion of new automotive and software services awards and continued to execute on our backlog successfully. We remain focused on innovation, execution and driving cost leadership, which have become hallmark of this company's success. And that is applying to all our businesses. 
Now I will turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Sandy Rowland, who will give you additional color on our financial results for the quarter."

Let me walk you through our financial highlights for the quarter. As a reminder, most of my financial remarks are provided on an operational basis, which excludes acquisition-related items, restructuring and nonrecurring charges. The full reconciliation of our GAAP to our operational results is included in the press release that we issued this morning. 
This quarter, our revenues were $1.8 billion, an increase of 8% compared to the prior year. Revenue in our Connected Car division increased 6% versus the prior year, primarily due to higher take rates and stronger production. Revenue in our Lifestyle Audio division increased 19% compared to the prior year. The increase in net sales was primarily due to higher consumer audio sales, driven by continued strong demand for smart audio solutions and higher take rates in car audio. Revenue in our Connected Services division increased 4% compared to a year ago, primarily due to higher demand for automotive services, while revenue in our Professional Solutions division decreased 3% compared to the prior year. 
Total company gross margin increased 80 basis points to 30.8%, primarily due to the impact of higher sales volume, leveraging a more efficient fixed production cost base and productivity initiatives. Connected Car gross margin increased 110 basis points to 24.8%, benefiting from better leverage of fixed costs and manufacturing productivity. Lifestyle Audio gross margin increased 290 basis points to 35.4%, primarily due to margin expansion in car audio as a result of operating leverage and manufacturing excellence. Professional Solutions gross margin decreased 240 basis points to 39.2%, driven by product mix. 
We are seeing manufacturing cost savings from our footprint migration initiatives. However, as we continue to focus on bringing down our inventory levels in this division, we have lower fixed cost absorption, impacting gross margin in the near term. 
Connected Services gross margin declined 280 basis points to 31.1%, primarily due to higher revenue recognition of high-margin engineering change orders in the prior year. 
We have started to use percentage of completion accounting for significant new contracts, which is expected to reduce some of the volatility. 
Our SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales decreased 20 basis points from the prior year to 20.1%. Connected Car SG&A increased 60 basis points to 12.6% to support growth in awarded business. 
While R&D expense in car audio increased to support our expanding backlog, Lifestyle Audio SG&A decreased 70 basis points to 20.2% due to better leverage on higher sales. SG&A expense in Professional Solutions increased 20 basis points compared to the prior year. Connected Services SG&A expense decreased 200 basis points to 19.3% as a result of footprint migration initiatives related to the integration of Redbend. Finally, corporate SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased by 10 basis points to 2.1%. 
Putting it all together, our consolidated operating income was $187 million compared to $158 million in the prior year, a 19% increase. Below the line, we had an effective tax rate of 25.2%, which is lower than our guidance of 27.5% to 28% for the full year. Our guidance takes into account potential tax law changes that we are actively monitoring. And at this time, we are maintaining our tax rate guidance. Finally, EPS was $1.87 compared to $1.48 in the prior year, up 27%. 
Let me spend a few minutes on cash and capital allocation. We generated $36 million of free cash flow, which we define as cash flow from operations less CapEx, an improvement of approximately $185 million, driven by strong earnings and effective working capital management. 
During the quarter, we were active buyers of our stock. We repurchased approximately 450,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of $35 million. We now have approximately $325 million remaining on our board-authorized share repurchase program, and we will continue to be opportunistic buyers of our stock. 
We are pleased to be off to a good start in fiscal year 2017. We are on track to deliver on our full year guidance, and we look forward to speaking to you about our business at upcoming investor conferences and seeing you in January at our CES technology event. 
Thank you for your attention. Dinesh and I are now happy to take your questions."

When it comes to proliferation of car audio take rates, yes, of course, China, starting points are very low, low single-digit penetration if you look at whole China. So there, of course, the Chinese consumers, or I would say Asian consumers are very brand-hungry. They want American iconic brands to be in their car, and our car company customers continue to find overwhelmingly market research that branded car audio is helping them differentiate their own cars. Having said that, we're actually seeing the penetration of car audio across the world. I mentioned to you we expanded our relationship with Ford, which is a fantastic news. It's a very good business with Ford. Now we replaced a competitor at the high-end Lincoln. We also replaced a competitor for cross car line globally for Ford worldwide, with both brands coming from HARMAN. In addition, we won business with other German and Asian automakers for car audio. And you saw that I was extremely pleased to share with you our order backlog for car audio, the book-and-bill has gone 2:1 ratio, which means our future is even better.

And then also, is that good news for HARMAN in terms of maybe increasing the take rates at the high end by taking away that objection of I don't need embedded nav?

So first of all, what's happening, as you have heard before, that if you look at the full pie, the whole market, so nearly 50% of the business, the bottom half of the pie has been nothing or simple AM/FM",467,"Good, Brian. Let me sort of bring it all together. So first of all, what's happening, as you have heard before, that if you look at the full pie, the whole market, so nearly 50% of the business, the bottom half of the pie has been nothing or simple AM/FM radio. The top half of the pie was split equally 25-25 into fully embedded, navigation-based infotainment system and another one was display audio, which means, to put simply -- simply put, it's full embedded system minus navigation. So you can bring your own kind of a thing. What we are witnessing, the bottom half of the pie is very fast moving into both quarters of the top pie, which means either going towards display audio or going into embedded audio. My firm belief, supported by big OEMs worldwide, is that you will see fast migration at equal pace. But very soon, in a couple years, you will see even display audio consumers will start to migrate towards fully embedded. Because it's not clear that if cars are going to be autonomous or semi-autonomous, you can't run them from a handheld device. This is a post-device era we are talking about. The very distributed strong compute platform, which HARMAN is leader in, would actually be part of the car embedded system with cloud applications. So that's what we are seeing, and we are happy that we're playing on both sides of display audio as well as embedded audio and winning in both sides. Then you also know what else is happening is OTA. The over-the-air update technology is something which is just emerging, and we have the unique patented technology with 15 years of R&D. And we have won more than a dozen OEMs, including FCA; every single cross-car line FCA received an order for our systems as well as non-HARMAN systems to be updated by our OTA technology. And as far as the large screen, Brian, that seemed to be sort of personal choice, and more and more people are asking for it. Therefore, display unit is becoming a very important part. The user interface, the contextual and the smart user interface, their display devices, display units will play a bigger role. Consolidation of industry here is even likely to happen more because nearly 1/3 of COG, cost of goods sold, is getting to close to display unit. We are supplying large display units. As you mentioned, Uconnect, that is a HARMAN system, has been. It won actually in 2016 Best Infotainment System award by Consumer Report. And we are seeing similarly in our Mercedes S-Class BMW 7 Series, Audi A8, those cars we're also seeing large screen. And I guess, Asian consumers will definitely offer large screen. So I think that seemed to be the trend."

Whether you win display audio or full embedded system, the only difference is navigation, which is a component of multiple parts come together to create compute platform. So we're providing choices of using any nav, whether you use 3D high-definition maps, which we supply to our customers or you can use a simple 2D Google Maps or what have you. So choices are there available to you. But imagine, it's still the whole multimedia, the tuner technology, the hands-free telephony, the interface with other ECUs in the car, that still has to be done even for display audio. And that's what our system for Ford is all about, highly integrated display audio, large screen, but you still would have the choice. And eventually, the system can also integrate onboard navigation. Or you can bring it your own. And we are gaining ground -- as far as the penetration of the take rates, traditionally, we had seen about 300 basis point year-over-year improvement in take rate, whether it's a display audio or fully embedded. We're playing on both and we're seeing same take rate improvement. In fact, slightly more for us because we are working with the customers where the take rates are higher. So I think runway for HARMAN for take rate is pretty strong with nearly $24 billion, $25 billion order backlog. I think we have perhaps the fastest opportunity to grow this business in the next 5 years to 10 years."

Last year, when we acquired them, we moved their manufacturing out from Denmark into our manufacturing operation in Hungary. And now that those operations are running together, we're getting very good synergies there. But if I look at the margin levels, they were right about the same place that they were in Q4.

Second half is slightly weaker because you have the seasonality. But we think our strength is not just coming because of what you just mentioned with the company, but we are seeing incredible penetration of smart portables. We actually became #1 supplier in the world by GfK, a market tracking agency, in smart portable wireless speakers, and we are seeing similar growth now in our smart headphones. Some of the headphones are even now updated over-the-air with the firmware, software, so the incredible technology we're bringing. So Under Armour is a third piece. As an example, the strategic partnerships like Under Armour in consumer audio or IBM Watson in professional audio will continue to bring more momentum. So Under Armour is a great brand. We're developing jointly products. The product which we just launched called in-ear heart rate monitoring. And let me stress that. This is one-of-a-kind product. It's a military-grade heart rate monitoring, absolutely accurate. So this is designed for athletes, but priced for mass market. So we expect it to also take off very nicely. And you will see some incredible product launches at IFA -- I mean, at CES in January in Las Vegas. So we feel good about this division to continue the great momentum we have."

When it comes to sensitivity to the market production, as we guided for the full '17, 2% to 3%. Actually, that -- the production guidance still holds because we guided China to be around 3%, 3.5%.

All 3 are totally worked on. There's a new leader of the division, who brings tremendous sense of urgency. We already consolidated our European footprint, which is flowing through our bottom line, almost 100 basis point improvement in the margins this year, which we confirmed to you last time. This year, we have already announced and we are working on execution of couple U.S. sites, which will also add another 50 to 100 basis point improvement once we are done by end of this year. On top of that, brand-new -- many new products will be launched, and you will see some of them coming out at NAMM, which is North America Professional Audio Society, January 2017. So new products being launched to fulfill the solution needs for enterprise and entertainment. Another great example for that was IBM Watson, the strategic partnership, how we are enabling IoT in professional audio/video, lighting, first time any Pro company is doing, that's HARMAN. And third go-to-market, sales training for our own people and our channels, distributors and reps, is undergoing very well. We're seeing traction. In fact, the orders we have booked in Q1 are very encouraging to me. And that the way we see it, October sales is already in, so we have liberal visibility. Q2 should be a growth quarter. And from this point on, you should expect growth. And in the end, I will say this business is a great business, has been good business for HARMAN, and we expect this business to return to double-digit margin soon, and then from there on, be a good contributor to the company."

Let me take the -- I mean, the cybersecurity first then QNX. So cybersecurity, unless you missed my opening comments, I shared with you one of the breaking news that NHTSA together with University of Michigan, conducted a third-party research and evaluation of available cybersecurity intrusion detection and mitigation solutions, and HARMAN ranked #1, absolutely best in class. And this is extremely encouraging for me personally because we actually double down years ago when no one talked about cybersecurity, we said without cybersecurity, you should not even dream of autonomous or semi-autonomous. As soon as you connect your car, you've got bad guys coming in your car. So we are actually leading that space. And just like we did for QNX, making a standard, we are doing for OTA, Redbend technology, and we think our cybersecurity will become industry standard. So we're very happy about it, and we have number of customers right now in RFQ phase where our cybersecurity would be integral part of their offerings. Turning to QNX. QNX is one of the several operating systems out there. And HARMAN used to own QNX, and we have incredible competence and we use QNX still in some of our systems. Same time, we are also using Linux. We are using Android, and we're using hybrid approaches. So we wanted to be totally agnostic, and we feel very good about. We're developing very large multibillion-dollar programs in Android as well as Linux and QNX."

It's a great question, and it is a strategic question, which I hope gets asked all the time because I think we have clearly broken out from the pack of other Tier 1s. So in Connected Car, what is differentiating HARMAN from rest is we're the only company who has the most powerful compute platform with wide integration capability of multiple ECUs supplied by various other Tier 1s. And we're the one who work agnostically with all silicon or memory suppliers whether it's Intel, Samsung, TI, NVIDIA, Qualcomm, NXP. And we create -- we work with them, design the unique solution for automotive and then we deploy that. In addition, we are also the company who has broken out in telematics space. We have been doing telematics for multiple generations in Germany and in the United States. Now we have launched very first order -- industry's first, I repeat, gateway-based telematics for a German OEM, which we believe will become another trend. And the third is cybersecurity and ADAS solutions. Cybersecurity we're doubling down and also, OTA, we have clear market lead on that. We have won 14 car companies already, 6 or 7 of them through directly to HARMAN and others through other competitors. And ADAS, you heard me say we integrate some of the best of the best, whether it's coming from Mobileye or from somewhere else. And we also develop our own object detection, vision algorithms and the camera 360s surround view, implementing in Asia as well as the German automakers. So that's our differentiation in connected car. In car audio, our key differentiation is having the access to the world's best brand. That is differentiating the top luxury cars from the other premium cars. And then when it comes to creating next-generation solutions, I mentioned, imagine you're sitting in a shared economy in a car with 3 other passengers you don't know you're sitting with, you will need to have your own individual sound/video zone. That's HARMAN's patented technology. So we are doing road noise cancellation. We are doing ambient noise cancellation. We are doing engine order [ph]  cancellation. We are doing individual sound zones. So combine it with unique market-leading iconic brand and sound management systems, that put us apart from anybody. And by the way, I repeat, we're the only company who has that power of car audio and sound management and Connected Car. No other Tier 1 can boast that."

I am pleased to report that our fiscal year is off to a very good start, with solid results for the first quarter. Net sales increased 8% to $1.8 billion. We expanded our operating margins and delivered a 15% year-over-year improvement in EBITDA. This puts our EBITDA margin at a company record of 12.9%, and we achieved 27% year-over-year improvement in earnings per share. 
I'm particularly pleased with the strong results in our Lifestyle Audio division, which posted 19% year-over-year revenue growth and 50% EBITDA growth. Our unmatched brand portfolio and product innovations are paying off. We're gaining market share against competition for our award-winning consumer audio products, and we're building a lot of momentum and increasing take rates for our car audio and sound management solutions. 
I'm very excited to report that we have been successful in keeping up the momentum in new automotive business wins. During the quarter, we secured over $2 billion of awards, complementing our year-end $24 billion auto backlog. 
In the automotive business, we're witnessing a very interesting trend. HARMAN is not only supplying a compute platform with cutting-edge technology, but also a full suite of car audio and sound management solutions. As you all know, we are the market leader in both of these areas, and we're the only company that can deliver this integrated offering. With our innovation, we have been displacing several competitors over the last few years. As we continue to gain market share, the gap between HARMAN and its competitors has been widening at a faster pace. We have broken this down for you on Page 6 of the slide deck. 
If you release -- if you quickly look at slide deck, you will see since the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we have recognized over $9 billion in automotive revenues. During the same period, we booked over $13 billion of new awards. This means our awards are growing faster than our revenue, and our book-to-bill ratio is 1.4:1. 
In our most profitable business, that is car audio and sound management, the awards grew even faster, with a book-to-bill ratio of 2:1. 
Let me talk a little more about our recent wins in the car audio and sound management business. Following the successful launch of the Revel brand in Lincoln vehicles, I'm pleased to announce the expansion of our business with Ford. Under this long-term partnership we will supply B&O PLAY-branded car audio systems to Ford's vehicles, cross car line globally. 
In the Connected Car division, we had wins across geographies and vehicle categories, including orders for high-end, fully-embedded compute platforms to entry-level display audio systems, covering wide spectrum of offerings. We are seeing growing demand from our customers for expanded portfolio of connected car solutions, including telematics, cybersecurity, over-the-air updates and advanced safety features. We continue to integrate third-party ADAS offerings while at the same time, developing proprietary solutions such as ADAS, object detection, vision algorithms and surround view software solutions, to name a few. 
In Connected Services, we achieved a new milestone for our over-the-air update software business. As we speak, more than 1 million vehicles on the road are using HARMAN OTA, and this number is growing rapidly. Automakers' response for this offering has been overwhelmingly positive. Not only have we already secured awards from over a dozen OEMs across 3 continents, half of these awards were secured through other Tier 1s. This demonstrates how our OTA solution is on its way to become the industry standard. These wins are strong evidence that automakers and consumers continue to demand an enhanced in-car experience. We are addressing this trend and winning in the marketplace with a unique portfolio of solutions across Connected Car, Lifestyle Audio and Connected Services. 
Before I talk about divisions in more details, let me briefly discuss our rapid growth in China, which I'm extremely proud of. You may recall in 2009, our revenue in China was less than $50 million. Last year, our revenue reached $800 million. That is 50% cumulative annual growth over the last 7 years. This quarter, we grew our revenue in China over 40%, and we have more than $4 billion of automotive order backlog. Needless to say, we have been taking market share left and right in China from our competition. We're growing our automotive business through imports and with the Chinese OEMs as well. We have a very strong foundation in China, with more than 3,000 people and growing to -- and growing. We have 2 world-class manufacturing plants, multiple state-of-the-art research and development centers, engineering and design centers. China is an important long-term growth market. We are winning in automotive, and our iconic brands are boosting our consumer and professional growth. 
Now let me take a closer look at our divisions and review some recent notable achievements. Let's start with our Connected Car division, which is highlighted on Slide 7 of our investor presentation. During the quarter, we secured new and follow-on awards to provide connected car solutions for customers, including Audi, Geely, Maruti Suzuki in India, Mercedes-Benz, Porsche and heavy-truck manufacturer, MAN of Volkswagen Group. During the quarter, we launched embedded infotainment solutions in Land Rover, Audi, Toyota, Porsche and Skoda vehicles. We also began delivering embedded infotainment solutions to the commercial truck market, launching solutions in Volkswagen Group's MAN and Scania trucks. MAN's infotainment system, developed by HARMAN, includes expanded telematics features like digital radio, hands-free telephony and truck-specific navigations. The HARMAN system for Scania includes innovations such as dual mobile phone connectivity, real-time navigation and cloud-based connectivity to fleet management systems. I'm particularly excited about this potential of growth for HARMAN solutions in the commercial fee space. This is a growing market and provides us with an enormous growth opportunity globally unlike any other Tier 1. 
Building on our momentum in winning telematics business, we entered a strategic partnership with AT&T to support the telematics ecosystem. HARMAN's telematics control unit was selected by AT&T for its Mobile Broadband Accelerator program. This pre-certified solution enables rapid deployment of our offering in the industry. 
We continue to receive accolades for our industry-leading innovation, winning a CTIA wireless award for our pupil-based monitoring software and Best in Category award from Germany's Connect Magazine for our Connected Car systems. HARMAN was the first company to develop a comprehensive cybersecurity framework for automakers. 
We doubled down on research and development investments and acquisitions in the space over the last 2 years. We are setting the industry standard in cybersecurity. And ladies and gentlemen, there would be no autonomous car without the protection of cybersecurity. You have heard me say that many times. Validating our leadership, I'm very proud to share with you first time the following extensive third-party evaluations conducted by NHTSA and the University of Michigan: HARMAN's suite of intrusion detection and mitigation technologies was rated best in class. That is incredible news for the whole industry. 
Now turning to the Lifestyle Audio division, some of our recent notable achievements are highlighted on Slide 8 of the investor presentation. Audio and sound management are essential parts of the connected car experience, and our award-winning car audio solutions continue to resonate with drivers, leading to another strong quarter of double-digit growth in the car audio business. OEMs are recognizing the growing importance of audio and sound management solutions, both in current vehicle design as well as a critical part of the in-car experience in semi-autonomous and fully autonomous vehicles. This trend is validated by our recent wins and our growing audio backlog. I already mentioned the Ford expansion. On top of that, we secured additional awards with Lincoln, Maserati of FCA Group and Toyota. 
During the quarter, we launched car audio solutions in Toyota, Lexus and Alfa Romeo vehicles, and HALOsonic and advanced transducer audio solutions in the Mercedes-AMG E-Class vehicles. 
And now turning to consumer audio. We grew double digits in the quarter due to strong demand for connected and personalized smart audio products. We continue to take market share. In fact, the most recent data from Futuresource confirms HARMAN added over 300 basis points in market share from early 2015 to summer of 2016. This signals that demand for our award-winning products is growing and our design, technology, brands and distribution strategies are working. 
And we are not stopping here. We continue to bring new award-winning products to the market. At the IFA conference in Berlin last September, we launched 33 new products, including a new wireless headphone lineup, a new waterproof portable speaker series. This fall, we also launched JBL-Under Armour co-branded wireless heart rate monitoring headphones. This was the second product introduced as part of a strategic partnership. Most recently, we announced the JBL Playlist audio speaker featuring Google Cast technology. It connects via WiFi and streams directly from the cloud to the speaker, without requiring Bluetooth pairing. This obviously simplifies the user experience while dramatically improving the audio quality. 
Now turning to the Professional Solutions division, highlighted on Slide 9 of the investor presentation. Over the last couple of quarters, we have been implementing a series of strategic initiatives. On the cost side, we have completed our European consolidation into Hungary, and we are currently executing additional footprint actions in the U.S. On the top line, we have committed to leveraging the strength of our portfolio to better serve our enterprise and entertainment customers through solutions tailored for focused vertical markets. As an example, HARMAN and IBM announced an exciting strategic partnership last week at the World of Watson conference to bring together HARMAN's end-to-end solution with IBM Watson's cognitive computing capability. Together, HARMAN and IBM will integrate artificial intelligence and smart connectivity, enabling IoT in HARMAN's audio, video and lighting products. We have a successful pilot running at Thomas Jefferson Hospital in Philadelphia that allows patients to use voice commands to alter the temperature in the room, turn out the lights or even ask whether their test results have come in yet. The voice-activated assistant can address many of their nonmedical needs, freeing up medical professionals when they are needed most. Additional applications for HARMAN and IBM Watson extend to hotel, conference room, education. But you can also imagine the possibilities throughout the enterprise and entertainment markets. It's very exciting. Transformational projects like this are exactly why we reorganized our Professional Solutions division. 
Turning specifically to the quarter, HARMAN's entertainment and enterprise solutions were selected by eBay Corporation, Dubai Parks and Resorts, London Business School and the U.S. presidential inauguration to be held in January. As a matter of fact, we're starting to see some nice order pickup, which will convert into revenue in the coming quarters. 
Some notable installations during the quarter include the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., Sky Harbor Airport in Phoenix and the U.S. Naval Command Center in San Diego. HARMAN solutions also powered a wide range of high-profile special events, including the Tony Award-winning musical Hamilton, G20 gala in China as well as world tours for the bands like Metallica and Coldplay. Yes, hard rock bands, Metallica and Coldplay. We remain confident in our strategy for the Professional Solutions division. Our integrated vertical market strategy is gaining traction, and we are focused on new product innovation and cost leadership. We expect to return to growth on a sustainable basis starting next quarter. 
Now turning to the Connected Services division, highlighted on Slide 10 of the investor presentation. During the quarter, we secured awards to provide software services for Honeywell, Intel and Microsoft, among others. We continue to win business with our cloud-based over-the-air software update solutions, including awards from Daimler and LG Electronics. In addition, HARMAN received recognition for its software engineering services capabilities from Cisco and market advisory firm, Zinnov. 
In summary, we are off to a solid start to deliver on our fiscal 2017 targets. We achieved record EBITDA and record earnings per share in the quarter, added over $2 billion of new automotive and software services awards and continued to execute on our backlog successfully. We remain focused on innovation, execution and driving cost leadership, which have become hallmark of this company's success. And that is applying to all our businesses. 
Now I will turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Sandy Rowland, who will give you additional color on our financial results for the quarter."

As a reminder, most of my financial remarks are provided on an operational basis, which excludes acquisition-related items, restructuring and nonrecurring charges. The full reconciliation of our GAAP to our operational results is included in the press release that we issued this morning. 
This quarter, our revenues were $1.8 billion, an increase of 8% compared to the prior year. Revenue in our Connected Car division increased 6% versus the prior year, primarily due to higher take rates and stronger production. Revenue in our Lifestyle Audio division increased 19% compared to the prior year. The increase in net sales was primarily due to higher consumer audio sales, driven by continued strong demand for smart audio solutions and higher take rates in car audio. Revenue in our Connected Services division increased 4% compared to a year ago, primarily due to higher demand for automotive services, while revenue in our Professional Solutions division decreased 3% compared to the prior year. 
Total company gross margin increased 80 basis points to 30.8%, primarily due to the impact of higher sales volume, leveraging a more efficient fixed production cost base and productivity initiatives. Connected Car gross margin increased 110 basis points to 24.8%, benefiting from better leverage of fixed costs and manufacturing productivity. Lifestyle Audio gross margin increased 290 basis points to 35.4%, primarily due to margin expansion in car audio as a result of operating leverage and manufacturing excellence. Professional Solutions gross margin decreased 240 basis points to 39.2%, driven by product mix. 
We are seeing manufacturing cost savings from our footprint migration initiatives. However, as we continue to focus on bringing down our inventory levels in this division, we have lower fixed cost absorption, impacting gross margin in the near term. 
Connected Services gross margin declined 280 basis points to 31.1%, primarily due to higher revenue recognition of high-margin engineering change orders in the prior year. 
We have started to use percentage of completion accounting for significant new contracts, which is expected to reduce some of the volatility. 
Our SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales decreased 20 basis points from the prior year to 20.1%. Connected Car SG&A increased 60 basis points to 12.6% to support growth in awarded business. 
While R&D expense in car audio increased to support our expanding backlog, Lifestyle Audio SG&A decreased 70 basis points to 20.2% due to better leverage on higher sales. SG&A expense in Professional Solutions increased 20 basis points compared to the prior year. Connected Services SG&A expense decreased 200 basis points to 19.3% as a result of footprint migration initiatives related to the integration of Redbend. Finally, corporate SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased by 10 basis points to 2.1%. 
Putting it all together, our consolidated operating income was $187 million compared to $158 million in the prior year, a 19% increase. Below the line, we had an effective tax rate of 25.2%, which is lower than our guidance of 27.5% to 28% for the full year. Our guidance takes into account potential tax law changes that we are actively monitoring. And at this time, we are maintaining our tax rate guidance. Finally, EPS was $1.87 compared to $1.48 in the prior year, up 27%. 
Let me spend a few minutes on cash and capital allocation. We generated $36 million of free cash flow, which we define as cash flow from operations less CapEx, an improvement of approximately $185 million, driven by strong earnings and effective working capital management. 
During the quarter, we were active buyers of our stock. We repurchased approximately 450,000 shares in the quarter at a cost of $35 million. We now have approximately $325 million remaining on our board-authorized share repurchase program, and we will continue to be opportunistic buyers of our stock. 
We are pleased to be off to a good start in fiscal year 2017. We are on track to deliver on our full year guidance, and we look forward to speaking to you about our business at upcoming investor conferences and seeing you in January at our CES technology event. 
Thank you for your attention. Dinesh and I are now happy to take your questions."

When it comes to proliferation of car audio take rates, yes, of course, China, starting points are very low, low single-digit penetration if you look at whole China. So there, of course, the Chinese consumers, or I would say Asian consumers are very brand-hungry. They want American iconic brands to be in their car, and our car company customers continue to find overwhelmingly market research that branded car audio is helping them differentiate their own cars. Having said that, we're actually seeing the penetration of car audio across the world. I mentioned to you we expanded our relationship with Ford, which is a fantastic news. It's a very good business with Ford. Now we replaced a competitor at the high-end Lincoln. We also replaced a competitor for cross car line globally for Ford worldwide, with both brands coming from HARMAN. In addition, we won business with other German and Asian automakers for car audio. And you saw that I was extremely pleased to share with you our order backlog for car audio, the book-and-bill has gone 2:1 ratio, which means our future is even better.

But interesting what they're doing in the market is offering the big-screen Uconnect, as we understand it, as with or without embedded nav, which could take away some of what we -- well, the question is that I can see the consumer appeal there for younger people who don't believe in embedded nav and believe in their smartphones, especially as now Google lets you preload your local maps, reducing the data usage. But as you think about what they've done, do you see that spreading to other OEMs? And then also, is that good news for HARMAN in terms of maybe increasing the take rates at the high end by taking away that objection of I don't need embedded nav? Or bad news because even if that happens, there's loss of markup on the nav?"

Let me sort of bring it all together. So first of all, what's happening, as you have heard before, that if you look at the full pie, the whole market, so nearly 50% of the business, the bottom half of the pie has been nothing or simple AM/FM",467,"Good, Brian. Let me sort of bring it all together. So first of all, what's happening, as you have heard before, that if you look at the full pie, the whole market, so nearly 50% of the business, the bottom half of the pie has been nothing or simple AM/FM radio. The top half of the pie was split equally 25-25 into fully embedded, navigation-based infotainment system and another one was display audio, which means, to put simply -- simply put, it's full embedded system minus navigation. So you can bring your own kind of a thing. What we are witnessing, the bottom half of the pie is very fast moving into both quarters of the top pie, which means either going towards display audio or going into embedded audio. My firm belief, supported by big OEMs worldwide, is that you will see fast migration at equal pace. But very soon, in a couple years, you will see even display audio consumers will start to migrate towards fully embedded. Because it's not clear that if cars are going to be autonomous or semi-autonomous, you can't run them from a handheld device. This is a post-device era we are talking about. The very distributed strong compute platform, which HARMAN is leader in, would actually be part of the car embedded system with cloud applications. So that's what we are seeing, and we are happy that we're playing on both sides of display audio as well as embedded audio and winning in both sides. Then you also know what else is happening is OTA. The over-the-air update technology is something which is just emerging, and we have the unique patented technology with 15 years of R&D. And we have won more than a dozen OEMs, including FCA; every single cross-car line FCA received an order for our systems as well as non-HARMAN systems to be updated by our OTA technology. And as far as the large screen, Brian, that seemed to be sort of personal choice, and more and more people are asking for it. Therefore, display unit is becoming a very important part. The user interface, the contextual and the smart user interface, their display devices, display units will play a bigger role. Consolidation of industry here is even likely to happen more because nearly 1/3 of COG, cost of goods sold, is getting to close to display unit. We are supplying large display units. As you mentioned, Uconnect, that is a HARMAN system, has been. It won actually in 2016 Best Infotainment System award by Consumer Report. And we are seeing similarly in our Mercedes S-Class BMW 7 Series, Audi A8, those cars we're also seeing large screen. And I guess, Asian consumers will definitely offer large screen. So I think that seemed to be the trend."

Whether you win display audio or full embedded system, the only difference is navigation, which is a component of multiple parts come together to create compute platform. So we're providing choices of using any nav, whether you use 3D high-definition maps, which we supply to our customers or you can use a simple 2D Google Maps or what have you. So choices are there available to you. But imagine, it's still the whole multimedia, the tuner technology, the hands-free telephony, the interface with other ECUs in the car, that still has to be done even for display audio. And that's what our system for Ford is all about, highly integrated display audio, large screen, but you still would have the choice. And eventually, the system can also integrate onboard navigation. Or you can bring it your own. And we are gaining ground -- as far as the penetration of the take rates, traditionally, we had seen about 300 basis point year-over-year improvement in take rate, whether it's a display audio or fully embedded. We're playing on both and we're seeing same take rate improvement. In fact, slightly more for us because we are working with the customers where the take rates are higher. So I think runway for HARMAN for take rate is pretty strong with nearly $24 billion, $25 billion order backlog. I think we have perhaps the fastest opportunity to grow this business in the next 5 years to 10 years."

Can you say how much is new or conquest of the $2 billion in new awards versus replacements? And then the 25% step-up in your award activity relative to today's connected car revenue base. If I think about 25%, that's probably a 3-year future value, if you will, thinking about the timing of when those will launch. If I do a compound growth rate on that, that's maybe a high single-digit rate of growth. Is that the right rate of growth to think about for your infotainment business?"

So based on that knowledge, do you expect any material change in your gross margin or operating margin profile in the Connected Car division as that mix changes towards Display Audio going forward? And then secondly, I wonder if you could discuss a little bit the kind of the sensitivity to the model. If we get a decline in auto production next year given investor concerns right now, maybe a bit of an explanation of how the cost structure's changed since the last recession.

So great, Tavis, let me answer the first question, and maybe Sandy will give more color on the second. But first of all, display audio or embedded audio -- as a blend, our margins continue to improve. As you have heard us say and we have validated, we are very margin-driven management team. We will walk away from business if it does not meet our margin requirements, and we have done it and it won't be the last time. We will do it in the future because there's plenty of business out there. Yes, we are market leader with 25% of the world market and then rest is sharing 75%, so we win obviously a lot of business, but we also walk away from others. Having said that, Display Audio is a good business. It meets our margin requirements. It's not dilutive, actually, it's accretive, all in all. When it comes to sensitivity to the market production, as we guided for the full '17, 2% to 3%. Actually, that -- the production guidance still holds because we guided China to be around 3%, 3.5%. China is tracking over 6%. We guided Europe to be right around 0% to 1%. Europe came in slightly weaker. U.S. is holding. So all in all, global production for our fiscal year is in line, and we feel good about our full year guidance. Hypothetically, if production becomes flat or even lower than that, I think that's where the cost advantage and the baseline cost comes in. And I'll let Sandy give some color."

I think the way to break it down is if you look at our portfolio of businesses, remember that we have business that's outside of the automotive space. So overall, about 65% of our revenues across connected car and car audio come from automotive. So it's about 65% of our company exposure, which is right around $4.7 billion. So each point of production is worth somewhere between $45 million and $50 million to the top line. And if you look at it from a leverage standpoint, we've typically said that we get about 20% operating leverage on the upside. And it works that way on the downside as well, typically between 20% to 25%. And if it stays down longer, we'll take -- continue to take cost actions to mitigate any of the erosion."

All 3 are totally worked on. There's a new leader of the division, who brings tremendous sense of urgency. We already consolidated our European footprint, which is flowing through our bottom line, almost 100 basis point improvement in the margins this year, which we confirmed to you last time. This year, we have already announced and we are working on execution of couple U.S. sites, which will also add another 50 to 100 basis point improvement once we are done by end of this year. On top of that, brand-new -- many new products will be launched, and you will see some of them coming out at NAMM, which is North America Professional Audio Society, January 2017. So new products being launched to fulfill the solution needs for enterprise and entertainment. Another great example for that was IBM Watson, the strategic partnership, how we are enabling IoT in professional audio/video, lighting, first time any Pro company is doing, that's HARMAN. And third go-to-market, sales training for our own people and our channels, distributors and reps, is undergoing very well. We're seeing traction. In fact, the orders we have booked in Q1 are very encouraging to me. And that the way we see it, October sales is already in, so we have liberal visibility. Q2 should be a growth quarter. And from this point on, you should expect growth. And in the end, I will say this business is a great business, has been good business for HARMAN, and we expect this business to return to double-digit margin soon, and then from there on, be a good contributor to the company."

Let me take the -- I mean, the cybersecurity first then QNX. So cybersecurity, unless you missed my opening comments, I shared with you one of the breaking news that NHTSA together with University of Michigan, conducted a third-party research and evaluation of available cybersecurity intrusion detection and mitigation solutions, and HARMAN ranked #1, absolutely best in class. And this is extremely encouraging for me personally because we actually double down years ago when no one talked about cybersecurity, we said without cybersecurity, you should not even dream of autonomous or semi-autonomous. As soon as you connect your car, you've got bad guys coming in your car. So we are actually leading that space. And just like we did for QNX, making a standard, we are doing for OTA, Redbend technology, and we think our cybersecurity will become industry standard. So we're very happy about it, and we have number of customers right now in RFQ phase where our cybersecurity would be integral part of their offerings. Turning to QNX. QNX is one of the several operating systems out there. And HARMAN used to own QNX, and we have incredible competence and we use QNX still in some of our systems. Same time, we are also using Linux.

It's a great question, and it is a strategic question, which I hope gets asked all the time because I think we have clearly broken out from the pack of other Tier 1s. So in Connected Car, what is differentiating HARMAN from rest is we're the only company who has the most powerful compute platform with wide integration capability of multiple ECUs supplied by various other Tier 1s. And we're the one who work agnostically with all silicon or memory suppliers whether it's Intel, Samsung, TI, NVIDIA, Qualcomm, NXP. And we create -- we work with them, design the unique solution for automotive and then we deploy that. In addition, we are also the company who has broken out in telematics space. We have been doing telematics for multiple generations in Germany and in the United States. Now we have launched very first order -- industry's first, I repeat, gateway-based telematics for a German OEM, which we believe will become another trend. And the third is cybersecurity and ADAS solutions. Cybersecurity we're doubling down and also, OTA, we have clear market lead on that. We have won 14 car companies already, 6 or 7 of them through directly to HARMAN and others through other competitors. And ADAS, you heard me say we integrate some of the best of the best, whether it's coming from Mobileye or from somewhere else. And we also develop our own object detection, vision algorithms and the camera 360s surround view, implementing in Asia as well as the German automakers. So that's our differentiation in connected car. In car audio, our key differentiation is having the access to the world's best brand. That is differentiating the top luxury cars from the other premium cars. And then when it comes to creating next-generation solutions, I mentioned, imagine you're sitting in a shared economy in a car with 3 other passengers you don't know you're sitting with, you will need to have your own individual sound/video zone. That's HARMAN's patented technology. So we are doing road noise cancellation. We are doing ambient noise cancellation. We are doing engine order [ph]  cancellation. We are doing individual sound zones. So combine it with unique market-leading iconic brand and sound management systems, that put us apart from anybody. And by the way, I repeat, we're the only company who has that power of car audio and sound management and Connected Car. No other Tier 1 can boast that."
