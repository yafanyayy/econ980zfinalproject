This morning, we reported fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.61. Our adjusted segment operating profit was $599 million. For the calendar year, our adjusted earnings per share was $2.60. 
Global dynamics reduced margins across the U.S. agricultural exports sector, the U.S. ethanol industry and in the soybean crushing industry worldwide. Adverse market conditions that impacted many of our businesses early in the year continued through the fourth quarter. Despite the challenging conditions, we achieved 2015 adjusted ROIC of 7.3%, 70 basis points above our annual cost of capital generating positive EVA. 
In the fourth quarter, we advanced our strategic plan by expanding our international corn processing footprint with the acquisition of Eaststarch, progressing our destination marketing strategy with the announcement of the Medsoft Egyptian joint venture and strengthening our European refined oils joint venture. And today, we're announcing an investment in the controlling stake in harvest innovations, a leading producer of non-GMO, organic and gluten-free ingredients. 
From the portfolio management perspective, we completed the sale of our global cocoa business. In addition, 2015 was the safest year in the history of ADM with the lowest level of recordable and loss time injuries. I'm pleased with how we were disciplined, focused and process improvement have translated into the safety results in 2015.
Recurring headwinds is likely to persist. We'll remain focused on the areas within our control. We will continue to implement our pipeline of operational excellence initiatives, with an objective of an incremental $275 million of run rate savings by the end of the calendar year. As part of our -- of the evolution of our strategic plan, we're also taking a fresh look at the capital intensity of our operations and portfolio, seeking innovative ways to lighten up and redeploy capital in our efforts to drive long-term returns. 
In 2016, our balanced capital allocation framework remains a priority, including a quarterly dividend rate increase of more than 7% to $0.30 per share and share repurchases of between $1 billion to $1.5 billion, subject to strategic capital requirements. With a strong balance sheet, we will also remain opportunistic for investments, especially bolt-ons in this more challenged microenvironment. I'll provide more detail on our 2015 accomplishments as well as perspectives on 2016 later in the call. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Ray."

Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.61, down 39% from 1 dollar last year. We've been busy this quarter as we continue to manage our portfolio to drive returns, which has resulted in a larger than usual number of specified items. 
Excluding specified items and also excluding net timing effects, adjusted segment operating profit was $599 million, down $529 million. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was negative 2% compared to 29% in the fourth quarter of the prior year. 
Our reported tax rate was negative this quarter due to the low tax rates and the gains related to the cocoa and the  Eaststarch transactions, together with the one-time favorable $66 million valuation allowance impact. 
If we excluded specified items, the related tax impacts and the valuation allowance, the effective tax rate for the calendar year was approximately 27% in 2015, in line with 2014. The rate has been slightly lower than the recent historical tax rates due to a more favorable geographic mix this year in some favored discrete items this year. For 2016, I would expect our tax rate to be in the 28% to 30% range. 
Our trailing 4 quarter average adjusted ROIC of 7.3% is down 170 basis points from the 9.0% at the end of the fourth quarter last year. The 7.3% adjusted ROIC is above our 6.6% annual WACC for 2015, but the lower long term WACC of 8.0% as reflected in the graph on Slide 20 in the appendix. Our objective remains to earn 200 basis points over our WACC. 
In the fourth quarter, we did create value based upon our trailing 4-quarter average EVA, which was positive $173 million. 
On Chart 18, 19 in the appendix, you can see the reconciliation of a reported quarterly earnings of $1.19 per share to the adjusted earnings of $0.61. For this quarter, we had gains on sales and revaluations of assets amounting to $0.70 per share, primarily related to the cocoa transaction in Eaststarch. We have charges related to impairments, restructurings and settlements amounting to $0.24 per share, the largest being related to our Brazilian sugar operations. 
We also made an adjustment to -- Q4 adjusted earnings to reflect the reallocation of the biodiesel credits to the previous quarters when shipped of about $0.05 per share. And there are 2 tax adjustments in the fourth quarter, the valuation allowance impact of $0.11 per share that I mentioned earlier and the true-up of the quarterly tax rates to the calendar year adjusted rate of $0.03 per share.
Slide 5 provides an operating profit summary in the components of our corporate line. Before Juan discusses the operating results, I'd like to highlight some of the unique items impacting our quarterly results. 
In the Corn Processing segment, we had $185 million gain on the revaluation of the company's previously held investment in Eaststarch, our former European joint venture with in conjunction with the acquisition of the remaining interest. This transaction closed in early November. 
We also recorded an impairment and restructuring charges of $102 million, primarily related to our Brazilian sugar operations. 
In oilseeds, we record a $206 million of gains on sales of assets, primarily related to the sale of our global cocoa business. We also had impairment in restructuring charges of $34 million for various underperformed businesses within the segment. 
In the corporate lines, net interest expense was down due to lower interest rates and the favorable effects of the debt restructuring we affected earlier this year. I now locate corporate cost of $89 million were lower than the run rate for previous quarters due to favorable foreign-exchange translation, people related cost and some timing effects in 2015 spend, offset partially by higher project costs. 
I would also like to comment on our GAAP net revenue number that can be found in the appendix. GAAP net revenues for the quarter of $16.4 billion were down significantly from last year, driven by large declines in commodity prices and foreign-exchange translation. But these factors also favorably impacted our cost of goods sold as our input costs were lower. 
Turning to the cash flow statement on Slide 6. We generated $2 billion from operations before working capital changes lower than the prior year. Total capital spending for the year was $1.1 billion, up from the prior year's $900 million, but in the lower end of our $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion capital spending guidance we provided early in the year. Given the more challenging business conditions we encountered in 2015, we're even more prudent in our capital spending. 
We made acquisitions totaling $0.5 billion in 2015, which included AOR, the European oil company, Eatem Foods and the remaining interest in the remaining port and also Eaststarch. 
The other investing activities line of the cash flow statement mainly reflects the proceeds from divestitures, such as our global cocoa and chocolate businesses and the sale of our 50% stake in our port in Northern Brazil plus the incremental investments we made in the Walmart or approximately $1.5 billion of net divestment proceeds. 
During the year, we spent about $2 billion to repurchase shares, finishing up at the high end of our $1.5 billion to $2 billion target. Our average share count for the year was 621 million diluted shares outstanding, down 35 million from that time 1 year ago. At the end of the year, we had approximately 601 million shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis. Our total return of capital to shareholders, including dividends of almost $700 million, was more than $2.7 billion for 2015. 
When I think about our capital allocation framework for 2015, if we take our operating cash flows before working capital plus the net divestment proceeds or approximately $3.6 billion in total cash flows, we spent about 30% of that amount on capital spending and returned about 75% of that amount to shareholders. This is in line with the capital allocation targets with a bit more tilted towards capital returns to shareholders in 2015. 
Slide 7 shows the highlights of our balance sheet as of December 31, 2015, and '14. Our balance sheet remains strong. Our operating working capital of $7.1 billion was down $700 million from the year-ago period. Total debt was about $5.9 billion resulting in a net debt balance that is debt less cash of $4.5 billion, up from the 2014 net debt level of $4 billion, in part reflecting the issuance this year of EUR 1.1 billion -- of Euro debt or about $1.2 billion in U.S. dollar terms and the subsequent repurchase of about $900 million of U.S. debt. 
Our leverage position remains healthy with a net-debt-to-total-capital ratio of about 20%. Our shareholder's equity of $17.9 billion is $1.7 billion lower than the level last year due to the shareholder capital returns in excess of net income by $900 million in the cumulative translation and count, which is down about $800 million due to the strength of the U.S. dollar. We had $6 billion in available global credit capacity at end of December. If you add the available cash with access to $7.3 billion of short-term liquidity. 
Next, Juan will take us through a review of our business performance."
251704,316347818,924542,"Archer-Daniels-Midland Company, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2016",2016-02-02,"Earnings Calls","Archer-Daniels-Midland Company","Executives","Thank you, Ray. Please turn to Slide 8. In the fourth quarter, we earned $599 million of operating profit, excluding specified items, down from the $1.1 billion results from last year's strong fourth quarter. Operating conditions in the fourth quarter d",2077,"Thank you, Ray. Please turn to Slide 8. In the fourth quarter, we earned $599 million of operating profit, excluding specified items, down from the $1.1 billion results from last year's strong fourth quarter. 
Operating conditions in the fourth quarter deteriorated from the already challenging conditions we faced earlier in 2015. After last year's large harvest around the world and with the strong U.S. dollar, a lack of this locations significantly reduced U.S. exports and limited merchandising opportunities in Ag Services. 
In December, we saw further downward pressure on global soybean crush margins as a result of Argentine government policies. Also, dramatic declines in crude oil prices impacted ethanol margins. As a result, full year segment operating profit was down nearly 21%. 
Now I will review the performance of each segment and provide additional detail.
Starting on Slide 9. In the fourth quarter, Ag Services results were down significantly compared to last year's very strong fourth quarter where we handled record volumes and has record exports from the large 2014 U.S. harvest. 
In merchandising and handling, despite the large U.S. growth, low commodity prices limited grain movements, resulting in fewer merchandising opportunities. In addition, the strong U.S. dollar, along with ample global crop supplies, limited U.S. export volumes and margins. For perspective, Ag Services U.S. export volumes this fourth quarter were down about 20% compared to last year.  This decline was partially offset by improved performance and expanded the reach of the ADM's global trade desk. For example, in Argentina, we benefited from higher volumes and margins with the changes in the export taxes and the depreciation in the currency. 
In transportation, lower U.S. export volumes reduced by freight rates and volumes. High with the levels in the Mississippi River system in the later part of December had some small negative impact on our transportation results for the quarter, but a greater impact will be felt in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
Mailing and other, again, had another solid quarter. For the year, we generated $684 million of operating profits on an adjusted basis and below our historical levels. There were a number of factors that impacted our results, including a lack of global dislocations and the strong U.S. dollar versus the weakening currencies of other major crop growing areas. This reduced both volumes and margins.
Please turn to Slide 10. Corn Processing results declined from the year-ago period. Sweeteners and starches continued to perform well, with lower input costs and good demand. Results also were impacted by costs related to the ramp up of commercialization of our plant in Tianjing. 
Bioproducts results were lower as a steep declines in crude oil prices drove lower ethanol prices. This, combined with continued high industry production levels, progressively reduced industry margins through the quarter. Our ethanol profitability reflects fourth quarter ethanol EBITDA margins estimated at around $0.18 per dollar. In addition, operating profits were challenged by excess global supply resulting in declines in pricing and margins and some production outages in our plant. 
For the year, sweeteners and starches performed well with the solid demands throughout the year in a well-balance of supply/demand environment for the industry. On the other hand, lower crude oil prices and high industry production levels created the challenging market environment for the U.S. ethanol industry despite growth in U.S. domestic demand for ethanol brought about by increasing U.S. gasoline consumption.
Slide 11, please. Oilseeds results were down in the quarter versus a very strong quarter 1 year ago. In crushing and origination, we saw declining global soybean crush margins throughout the quarter as buyers anticipated more competitive South American soybean mill entering well supplied markets following the presidential elections in Argentina. 
Ample global mill supplies, in combination with the strong U.S. dollar, further pressured U.S. mill exports. 
Brazilian origination results were lower as grain commercialized earlier in the year compared to the prior year. In addition, the very volatile Rial exchange rate in the fourth quarter slowed grain movement as well. 
Refining, packaging, biodiesel and other was down in the quarter and declining crude oil prices and weaker global demand pressured global biodiesel margins. Another results decreased, reflecting the sale of the cocoa business in October 2015. 
Results from Asia fell from the year-ago period due primarily to the nonoperating charges, including Wilmar's Q3 results. For the year, there was a strong global and U.S. demand for protein and as a result, our global oilseeds operations set the crushing volume record in 2015. However, with more ample global supplies of mill through the year in combination with the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, we saw our soy crush margin begin softening in the third quarter with a more substantial drop in the fourth quarter, caused in part by the impact of the Argentine policy changes.
Slide 12, please. In the fourth quarter, WFSI earned $47 million with positive contribution from WILD Flavors, SEI and Eatem Foods. As a reminder, the fourth quarter is generally the weakest quarter of the year for WFSI due to seasonality impact. This result helps offset declines in some of our legacy specialty ingredients businesses where we saw weaker sales overseas and some ForEx hedging costs related to our Brazilian specialty protein project. 
Since the WILD acquisition, the team has implemented about $40 million in annualized run rate cost synergies. We remain confident that the team will deliver EUR 100 million of run rate synergies from the WILD acquisition by the end of 2017. 
And in its first full year as part of ADM, WILD Flavors contributed $0.10 of earnings accretion to ADM.
Now on Slide 13, I'd like to update you on how we're strengthening and growing our company. This is the quarter we were presented that Investor Day in 2014. It lists the actions we were taking to help grow our business and our returns. We have highlighted some of the areas in which we have made significant progress in 2015. I'll discuss a few. 
In Ag Services, for example, we've seen the benefits of our global trade desk we created after we acquired. We advanced our global ports strategy with actions in Romania and Argentina, and we're growing destination marketing with our Medsoft joint venture in Egypt. 
In corn, we continued our geographic diversification in Europe with the Eaststarch acquisition and in China with the Tianjing sweeteners and soluble fiber plants and with the premixed plans. 
In oilseeds, we sold our global cocoa and chocolate businesses, allowing us to improve forward returns. We created a joint venture to quadruple the size of our port in Northern Brazil, we acquired the AOR oil bottling business in Belgium and ADM agreed to turn into a full-fledged joint venture, helping us to drive additional efficiencies into that business. 
And in WFSI, we acquired Eatem Foods, a leading developer of savory flavors, adding deep expertise in savory flavors and cuisines. And this morning, we are now seeing that we have reached an agreement to purchase a controlling stake in harvest innovations, a leading producer on known GMO, organic and gluten-free ingredients that consumers are demanding in increasing numbers. We'll continue to update you on our score progress each quarter. And over time, you should expect to see the result of these actions in improved earnings and returns. 
Now before we take your questions, I wanted to offer some additional perspective as we look forward. The global macroeconomic situation has been extremely volatile. We continue to face headwinds related to currencies among crude oil, Argentine policy changes and a growing supply of commodities. Barring any material changes to the macro situation, we expect the environment in 2016 to be similar to the second half of 2015. Whatever the conditions, we remain focused on driving improvements in the business. 
For Ag Services, we expect the strong U.S. dollar to continue through '16. The last South American harvest that's forecast would add to already strong global crop supplies, an Argentine exports will be more competitive in the near term following the recent policy changes. All of these presents continued challenges for our U.S. export business, though it will support our Argentine export business. We do expect an improvement from Ag Services in 2015 -- 2016, but it's not likely the segment will reach a historical operating profit range this year.
For the corn, sweeteners and starches will benefit from the improved pricing environment, the flexibility of our mills, solid demand and low input costs. And Eaststarch will be accretive to earnings. 
In ethanol, industry margins remained uncertain with low crude prices and high industry production levels. 
While we continue our efforts to reduce costs at our corn dry mills, we are now also undertaking a study of the strategic options for those. We do expect overall corn operating profits to improve from 2015 levels though this will depend on ethanol industry conditions in the back half of the year.
For oilseeds, with current global soy crush margin down significantly from 2015 levels, the continued strength of the U.S. dollar and the low crude oil prices impacting global biodiesel margins, we expect 2015 -- '16 to be lower than 2015. We continue to take actions to improve our oilseeds operations around the world. 
For WFSI with a robust pipeline, continued realization of synergies and accretion from recent acquisitions, we expect double-digit percentage growth in operating profit in the 15% to 20% range in 2016. We are pleased that WILD Flavors contributed to result in 2015 despite microeconomics and ForEx headwinds.
In this challenging environment, we remain focused on the areas under our control. We continue to execute our strategic plan to grow our earnings power, which will translate into strong earnings when the business to normalize.
From a cost management perspective, we have made significant progress on our operational excellence initiatives. By the end of 2015, we have achieved more than $200 million of run rate savings. We continued to execute in our pipeline and subsequent objective of $275 million in additional run rate savings implemented by the end of 2016.
As part of the continued evolution of our strategic plan, we are taking a fresh look at the capital intensity of our operations and portfolio. We will be seeking innovative ways to lighten and redeploy capital in our business. Unlike the Billion Dollar Challenge in 2012 where we look at unlocking the value from noncore assets or from efficiencies in working capital, now we are embarking on a multi-year program to examine which assets are underutilized or where the ownership structure will be more efficient, while maintaining on appropriate level of operational control. 
In some instances, the may be able to help us better utilize the asset. We started this process by selling a 50% interest in our Brazilian port in 2015. We believe we can reduce the asset intensity in various businesses, which will help improve our long-term returns even in a more challenging operating environment. We have set the preliminary target of reducing the invested capital of our businesses by at least $1 billion over time. 
In 2016, our balance capital allocation framework remains a priority. In terms of returning capital to shareholders, we have announced a 7% increase in our dividend rates. Our board recognizes the importance of the dividend to our investors. We also plan to repurchase $1 billion to $1.5 billion of shares in 2015 -- '16, subject to strategic M&A opportunities. We believe the shares are very attractive investment at current levels. 
And through strong cash flow generation, monetization of assets and a strong balance sheet, we continue to look at strategic growth opportunities. Our priorities in growing our geographic footprint and expanding our specialty ingredients business. With our strong balance sheet, we will be looking for opportunistic acquisitions around the world, including bolt-ons with investment decisions that even by hard look at the returns and inherent risk.
We continue to believe that by executing our strategic and capital plans, we can achieve a $1 to $1.50 per share of earnings improvement over the medium term, and we are encouraged by the fact the global demand for grains, oilseeds and proteins remains solid. What we don't know is when the macro in business conditions will improve, returning our earnings space to more normalized levels. And so, we continue to focus on what we can control to grow earnings and create value for our colleagues, our customers and our shareholders. With that,, operator, please open the lines for questions."

Slow prices are not incenting farmers to commercialize their crops yet. So movements of soybeans was, obviously, a little bit more brisk maybe in late Q4 and continue into Q1, mainly maybe due to farmer cash flows. We have seen in the past that U.S. stocks will be commercialized through the year, either through a strong U.S. demand for U.S. products and cash flow need from the farmers or spikes in gold prices. That's where we're seeing it right now we're seeing it farmers selling in broad. If you go to Brazil or Argentina, we've seen a strong dependency on what's happening with the currencies. We've seen in Brazil we have a day in which the dollar is $4.18, and we see a lot of farmer selling moves back to $4.11 or $3.97. And we see farmers selling a slowing down. We see a little bit of that in Argentina. We saw a little bit more farmer selling of corn and wheat, a little bit less soybean as the farmer maybe was not that happy with a reduction in export potential that they have over there. So still, I would say with these low prices due, then customers or farmers will sell through rallies when they have a cash flow needs."

And now we've seen the industry adjusting operating rates and things starting to ease off from the lows, if you will, that we hit in January. Obviously, this is the low season in the U.S. anyway, so there is a shift to crush margins into South America. South America still have an expanded crush margin because they haven't been -- haven't had the benefit of the harvest, but we'll get that soon in Brazil. And Europe, we see it okay kind of stable until maybe March, April and then we have the dynamic that we probably see more export from South America. But also, we have the rapeseed harvest in Europe and we have the ability so switch our assets a little bit between soybean and rapeseeds over there. So that's kind of what we see the evolution across margins at this point in time."

They have an adviser helping them on that, and we're going to run through the different scenarios all the way from one extreme to the other when we will explore all this scenario. So we have the rush for this. We -- in the whole operation is having positive cash flows, positive contribution so there's no need to panic. We just want to be prepared to look at the industry long term and see from this industry present the returns that we expect and what are the options to maximize our return for ADM. So there is not a clear time line or a clear direction on what we really want to see. We want to see the analysis of the option team will bring. In the meantime, the improvements in cost continue, and we have seen in 2015 improvements in enzymes, improvement in yields, improvement in corn oil recovery, so we're very pleased with the what the teams are doing in that. It's just we have an industry problem, and we want to see how we can participate in addressing the strategic options."

If you look at our evolution and our focus on returns, I mean, we are very pleased with the pipeline we have in operational excellence. We think we have a very good cost position in the company. We have addressed the portfolio with divestitures of cocoa, fertilizer and chocolate. We have set up a lot of growth engines through M&A or CapEx project. The next evolution in this is that will look at our the way we operate and we see we're very productive from a people perspective. We make north of $600 million of earnings this quarter with 33,000 people, so we feel we're very productive from a people intensity perspective. When we look at the asset intensity, we don't feel that great about that. We think that there is still some ability to flex our assets a little bit better. That is the nature of the industry, which is some seasonality and you need to have some assets for some peak periods. But we have started to undergo an analysis of all our businesses in value chains. You have to realize, sometimes we keep assets and we think about them as cost centers, if you will. And we're trying to look at them more as businesses in itself and having to provide the return. So also, technology is providing some tools. We have, today, software -- if I give you an example, ADM, because it's a large company, we have many, many warehouses around the U.S. and around the world. Today, we have software that allows us to look at the freight rates, look at the inventory needs and look at the number of warehouses and can provide a significant optimization to our warehouses network, if you will, that could end up in the selling some of those properties. You mentioned some of the transportation. We do believe that we have a very tax efficient ownership of our transportation asset. But then, maybe aspects of that maybe first than where we of opportunity to do something better. So again, this is a multi-year process and they were going to be looking at several parts of our operations, but we have looked at that with a target of about $1 billion, and we believe that is a realistic target overtime in looking at what I just described."

We actually believe that and we did some analysis that it actually is going to be positive towards our forward ROIC by divesting those businesses and taking the proceeds and bought back here reduced our invested capital base. So that's going to be actually positive towards our ROIC, going forward. In terms of 2016, you asked about net -- what is the M&A divestment kind of look like. And we generally, as you can -- as you expect, I mean, we are budgeting or planning CapEx around $1 billion for 2016. On the M&A front, we always have a little bit in terms of just bolt-on acquisitions for a couple of hundred million dollars. Net divestment proceeds divestitures, we achieved a lot already in terms of divestitures. And so at this point, I'm not planning for a large divesture number there. But in general, when I think about the impact of our recent M&As that we did in 2015, as an example, we did quite of few bolt-ons including the Eaststarch. I mean, those have been accretive and we're going to be accretive to our earnings, going forward.

Domestic demand has increased because of low oil prices and high gasoline consumption. And export demand has been very good and the expected to be even better to 2016. It's just a matter of that the production in the industry has kept this industry margin very, very low and the we are really surprised by that. We've been running our plans for yield, as I said before. We've seen improvements in our operations based on that, but this margin continues to be stubbornly low. So we want to analyze what happened at lower oil prices. What happened if these things recover. So we have an internal review to see the different scenarios and what do we do under those different scenarios. So it's just a matter that you look at how much can you improve your cost position.

If you compare last year with this year, last year, North America came into the export season with a big book of export on nontraditional destinations, which we didn't have this year. So I think that when you look at Argentina, the farmers selling in soybeans have been disappointing for what everybody was expecting. Soy crush has improved, but not that much, but I think have created expectation in a lot of the buyers that maybe Argentina will increase crush and will become a bigger player in the mill worldwide. And maybe it was wise to wait a little bit and wait for all that come to market. Again, it hasn't come yet. If you look at what crushing in Argentina is about 3 million tons per month, capacities maybe 4.5 million or something like that. We're still thinking about 40 million tons of crushing for next year, so we haven't seen the explosion. But I think it has been the psychological impact in all the buyers of nontraditional destinations for the U.S., so we could use and apply the traditional destinations to the U.S.. We have lost that ability to sell aggressively to nontraditional destinations, partly the U.S. dollar, partly the expectations of that Argentina will come into that. So a long-winded answer to your question. It's probably yes, although not in because of increased production, more for psychological impact of their ability to produce more."

Just -- there's different currency impacts that impact us. If you look at just pure translation impact, Rob, over the calendar year and then just the classical accounting translation, translation impact on our operating that was about roughly $130 million negative impact for us, okay. It's just pure currency translation. So, therefore, it was an impact was not -- I would say that's not a dramatic impact. The big issue really is the competitive issue. And the competitiveness issue is really driven by not just the strength of the U.S. dollar, but also the fact that 2 other factors. We've got large crops around the world, right? So the fact that you got well supplied inventories of crops around the world had an impact. And then secondly, for the major crop growing areas, there currencies actually devalued far more than what the basket of currencies that the U.S. dollar is weighed against. So when you saw what happened this year, you saw the because of the political situation really depreciate. You saw the Argentine policy changes. You've seen what happened with Russia and Ukraine. So what happened was for the major crop growing areas, their currencies actually devalued significantly relative to the basket of currencies. And then you also anticipate a lot of supplier around the world. Because under normal situations, Rob, when the U.S. dollar strengthens, let say under a normal cycle of U.S. dollar strengthen, and when there's a more balanced supply of crops around the world, they will still come to the U.S. for the crops. But so that's what, in my mind, that's what really changed in this year. And I don't believe this is structural. I mean, this is temporary. I mean, we're going to the cycle here. I do believe at some juncture, I mean, the U.S. dollar will correct itself. Timing will be determined, but I don't think this is a structural issues.

So when you have margins, you want to be able to have your lowest cost position, your best cost position. And it's not necessarily through volume that you get that, and we have proven that in our own facilities. But anyway so those are the 2 main factors. In terms of growing exports, we do see places like India and China that are dealing with environmental issues due to smog. That's how they are increasing the use of ethanol to fight their environmental -- their air issue, air pollution issue. So we see that demand growing. We see how demands have grown in China, and we expect for next year to be even bigger, so we expect 2016 net exports from the U.S. to be probably between $50 million to $100 million higher than what they were in 2015, driven by all these 2 main markets."

So this is a commodity industry, and you really need very, very tight capacity utilization. So maybe low 90s doesn't make if you need to be like 96%, 97% on that. It's every time that we get to that level, somebody brings a little bit more capacity. We continue to hover in this level that doesn't benefit anybody. So to me, we continue to be optimistic as we were before. We continue to improve our operations. It's just one point reality needs to match our optimism. And so far, it hasn't done it."

And then we have emerging market issues that move our demand. And even our seasonal high periods, they move a little bit. So it was a very unusual year. With also a lot of customers focusing much more sometimes in cost reductions than in revenue enhancement opportunities. We are very pleased though with the way where customers have reacted to our value proposition, and we see that in the engagement that we have in our customers. So our expectations for the pipeline and at the deliverance of synergy has not changed. Maybe it has changed a little bit the composition of that in the short term. I think if we're going to be talking in the year 3 of this, we probably be reporting a little bit higher cost synergies than we originally expected, and we will still be targeting the same amount or more of revenue synergies, maybe a little bit longer in the time line just because we continue to incorporate products to our product line and our value proposition. And that continues to open doors with customers, but the customer projects are normally a little bit slower or less in our control from a timing perspective on the cost synergies. But the response to customers to our value proposition has been very, very good. We have -- when we originally target this, we had $94 million originally targeted in revenue synergies. We have built a pipeline of already $67 million to $70 million, and we have more than 700 projects in the pipeline. So we feel very, very good about having created this pipeline that will turn into execution and into wins, and you will see that accelerating in 2016."

There's the political factor also impacted presumably the Brazilian currency at this point in time. I mean, you also have to remember that in some respect, with all these countries that are getting the windfall right in terms of the competitiveness of the crop because you've got the devaluation that occurred this year, but the input cost was prior to the currency devaluing, so they were able to still get some competitive input cost in terms of whether the seed or chemicals. Now that's going to change as you go into 2016 because what will happen is they'll have to buy that at a higher cost because while this is actually denominated more in U.S. dollar terms. And so all these countries is going to have to grapple with higher input cost in terms of their grains, going forward, whether the seeds chemicals, et cetera, et cetera. So what to see? I mean, is the worst behind us? It's difficult to predict. What we do know is currencies go through cycles. And so from our perspective, we're going through a cyclical downturn with some of these currencies -- political influences have some impact. Our job is just to manage this, and we'll continue to focus on expanding our footprint in South America, as for example. I mean, we've made investments down there. And we're going to continue to manage our cost. The other factor, Anne, is really the balancing of the global supply/demand of grains. And oftentimes, at low prices sort a lot of issues, so with the current low prices, expectations that you should see a lot more consumption around the world and that could probably help us in terms of the global supply-demand balance, which will also be important in terms of getting the situation back to normal."

So I think the U.S. banks will probably have more to determine what -- how much farmers get to plant and that may have an impact on planting numbers. But it doesn't seem like these low prices have at least started to discourage production in the U.S. And then you still got about 200 million metric tons sitting in China. They don't know what to do with it. I guess time with  China would be -- with China, they have such poor storage that maybe it all just goes bad, which should be a good scenario. But could you kind of for wrap-up your thought -- can you wrap-up your thoughts on global supply as we put all these factors together, South America, what the U.S. planting season might look like in acreage?

So at this point in time, given that South America is probably not having any major threatening weather events, the U.S. seems to be forecasting wet spring. And we have good soil moisture solar probe expect there continue to be ample supply going into next year. There has been some dislocations. We shouldn't forget El Niño created some problems and that's why we are exporting so much soybeans oil to India, for example.

And so I mean, you can't necessary multiply by 4, but what we're saying is that the conditions are not going to be at least what we see in terms of the visibility at this point in time, not materially different. As we kind of move through the year, I mean, clearly, you're going to have certain benefits there. As you would expect, we are on a startup flow in the first quarter. I mean, this is based upon the conditions that we end up at the end of December where ethanol margins have ended up. And I mentioned to you the high water impacts that we had in the Mississippi River that -- I mean, that would impact us in January in the first quarter. We'll start up slower in the front half of the year. We'll start up slower in the first quarter and we expect some gradual recovery as we kind of move through the year. We will get accretion from the investments that we've made. We will get accretion from the cost reductions that we're doing. Well, again, as Juan indicated, we expect the margin environment for ethanol should improve as we kind of move through the year. Again, that's going to be a variable that we're going to analyze very, very carefully. And so is it kind of look at how we think the Euro play out, again, as Juan indicated, we do expect Ag Services to be a little better. We expect corn to be a little bit better. Again, I love that function of where the ethanol margins for the industry and up in the back half of the year. We see -- well, it seems this is based upon the global crush margins right now to be were soft. And then double up the size, it should have a good year. So with all these puts and takes, I think we can make a judgment in terms of how we end up over all. At least based upon what we see in terms of visibility, the front -- first quarter front half will be tougher then what we think the second half will look like."

Global dynamics reduced margins across the U.S. agricultural export sector, the U.S. ethanol industry and in the soybean crushing industry worldwide. Adverse market conditions that impacted many of our businesses earlier in the year continued through the fourth quarter. Despite the challenging conditions, we achieved 2015 adjusted ROIC of 7.3%, 70 basis points above our annual cost of capital generating positive EVA. 
In the fourth quarter, we advanced our strategic plan by expanding our international corn-processing footprint with the acquisition of Eaststarch, progressing our destination marketing strategy with the announcement of the Medsofts Egyptian joint venture and strengthening our European Olenex refined oils joint venture. And today, we're announcing an investment in the controlling stake in Harvest Innovations, a leading producer of non-GMO, organic and gluten-free ingredients. 
From a portfolio management perspective, we completed the sale of our global cocoa business.
In addition, 2015 was the safest year in the history of ADM with the lowest level of recordable and loss time injuries. I'm pleased with how our discipline, focus and process improvements have translated to these safety results in 2015.
With current headwinds likely to persist, we'll remain focused on the areas within our control. We will continue to implement our pipeline of operational excellence initiatives, with an objective of an incremental $275 million of run rate savings by the end of the calendar year. As part of our -- of the evolution of our strategic plan, we're also taking a fresh look at the capital intensity of our operations and portfolio, seeking innovative ways to lighten up and redeploy capital in our efforts to drive long-term returns.
In 2016, our balanced capital allocation framework remains a priority, including a quarterly dividend rate increase of more than 7% to $0.30 per share and share repurchases of between $1 billion to $1.5 billion, subject to strategic capital requirements. With a strong balance sheet, we will also remain opportunistic for investments, especially bolt-ons in this more challenged macro environment. I'll provide more detail on our 2015 accomplishments as well as perspectives on 2016 later in the call.
Now I'll turn the call over to Ray."

Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.61, down 39% from $1 last year. We've been busy this quarter as we continue to manage our portfolio to drive returns, which has resulted in a larger-than-usual number of specified items.
Excluding specified items and also excluding net timing effects, adjusted segment operating profit was $599 million, down $529 million. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was negative 2% compared to 29% in the fourth quarter of the prior year.
Our reported tax rate was negative this quarter due to the low tax rates and the gains related to the cocoa and the Eaststarch transactions, together with a onetime favorable $66 million valuation allowance impact.
If we excluded specified items, the related tax impacts and the valuation allowance, the effective tax rate for the calendar year was approximately 27% in 2015, in line with 2014. The rate has been slightly lower than the recent historical tax rates due to a more favorable geographic mix this year in some favorable discrete tax items this year. For 2016, I would expect our tax rate to be in the 28% to 30% range.
Our trailing 4 quarter average adjusted ROIC of 7.3% is down 170 basis points from the 9.0% at the end of the fourth quarter last year. The 7.3% adjusted ROIC is above our 6.6% annual WACC for 2015 but below our long-term WACC of 8.0%, as reflected in the graph on Slide 20 in the appendix. Our objective remains to earn 200 basis points over our WACC.
In the fourth quarter, we did create value based upon our trailing 4 quarter average EVA, which was positive $173 million.
On Chart 18, 19 in the appendix, you can see the reconciliation of our reported quarterly earnings of $1.19 per share to the adjusted earnings of $0.61. For this quarter, we had gains on sales and revaluations of assets amounting to $0.70 per share, primarily related to the cocoa transaction and Eaststarch. We had charges related to impairments, restructurings and settlements amounting to $0.24 per share, the largest being related to our Brazilian sugar operations.
We also made an adjustment to Q4 adjusted earnings to reflect the reallocation of the biodiesel credits to the previous quarters when shipped of about $0.05 per share. And there are 2 tax adjustments in the fourth quarter: the valuation allowance impact of $0.11 per share that I mentioned earlier and the true-up of the quarterly tax rates to the calendar year adjusted rate of $0.03 per share.
Slide 5 provides an operating profit summary and the components of our corporate line. Before Juan discusses the operating results, I'd like to highlight some of the unique items impacting our quarterly results.
In the Corn Processing segment, we had $185 million gain on the revaluation of the company's previously held investment in Eaststarch, our former European joint venture with Tate & Lyle in conjunction with the acquisition of the remaining interest. This transaction closed in early November.
We also recorded impairment and restructuring charges of $102 million, primarily related to our Brazilian sugar operations.
In oilseeds, we record a $206 million of gains on sales of assets, primarily related to the sale of our global cocoa business. We also had impairment and restructuring charges of $34 million for various underperformed businesses within the segment.
In the corporate lines, net interest expense was down due to lower interest rates, and the favorable effects of the debt restructuring we effected earlier this year. Unallocated corporate costs of $89 million were lower than the run rate for previous quarters due to favorable foreign exchange translation, favorable people-related costs and some timing effects in 2015 spend, offset partially by higher project costs. 
I would also like to comment on our GAAP net revenue number that can be found in the appendix. GAAP net revenues for the quarter of $16.4 billion were down significantly from last year, driven by large declines in commodity prices and foreign exchange translation. But these factors also favorably impacted our cost of goods sold as our input costs were lower. 
Turning to the cash flow statement on Slide 6. We generated $2 billion from operations before working capital changes, lower than the prior year. Total capital spending for the year was $1.1 billion, up from the prior year's $900 million but in the lower end of our $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion capital spending guidance we provided earlier in the year. Given the more challenging business conditions we encountered in 2015, we're even more prudent in our capital spending.
We made acquisitions totaling $0.5 billion in 2015, which included AOR, the European bottle oil company; Eatem Foods; and the remaining interest in the Romanian port; and also Eaststarch. 
The other investing activities line of the cash flow statement mainly reflects the proceeds from divestitures, such as our global cocoa and chocolate businesses and the sale of our 50% stake in our port in Northern Brazil, plus the incremental investments we made in Wilmar or approximately $1.5 billion of net divestment proceeds.
During the year, we spent about $2 billion to repurchase shares, finishing up at the high end of our $1.5 billion to $2 billion target. Our average share count for the year was 621 million diluted shares outstanding, down 35 million from the time 1 year ago. At the end of the year, we had approximately 601 million shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis. Our total return of capital to shareholders, including dividends of almost $700 million, was more than $2.7 billion for 2015.
When I think about our capital allocation framework for 2015, if we take our operating cash flows before working capital plus the net divestment proceeds or approximately $3.6 billion in total cash flows, we spent about 30% of that amount on capital spending and returned about 75% of that amount to shareholders. This is in line with the capital allocation targets with a bit more tilted towards capital returns to shareholders in 2015.
Slide 7 shows the highlights of our balance sheet as of December 31, 2015, and '14. Our balance sheet remains strong. Our operating working capital of $7.1 billion was down $700 million from the year-ago period. Total debt was about $5.9 billion, resulting in a net debt balance that is debt less cash of $4.5 billion, up from the 2014 net debt level of $4 billion, in part reflecting the issuance this year of EUR 1.1 billion -- of euro debt or about $1.2 billion in U.S. dollar terms and the subsequent repurchase of about $900 million of U.S. debt. 
Our leverage position remains healthy with a net debt to total capital ratio of about 20%. Our shareholders' equity of $17.9 billion is $1.7 billion lower than the level last year due to the shareholder capital returns in excess of net income by $900 million and the cumulative translation account, which was down about $800 million due to the strength of the U.S. dollar. We had $6 billion in available global credit capacity at the end of December. If you add the available cash, we had access to $7.3 billion of short-term liquidity.
Next, Juan will take us through a review of our business performance."
251704,316347818,924751,"Archer-Daniels-Midland Company, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2016",2016-02-02,"Earnings Calls","Archer-Daniels-Midland Company","Executives","Thank you, Ray. Please turn to Slide 8. In the fourth quarter, we earned $599 million of operating profit excluding specified items, down from the $1.1 billion results from last year's strong fourth quarter. Operating conditions in the fourth quarter de",2082,"Thank you, Ray. Please turn to Slide 8. In the fourth quarter, we earned $599 million of operating profit excluding specified items, down from the $1.1 billion results from last year's strong fourth quarter. 
Operating conditions in the fourth quarter deteriorated from the already challenging conditions we faced earlier in 2015. After last year's large harvest around the world and with a strong U.S. dollar, a lack of dislocation significantly reduced U.S. exports and limited merchandising opportunities in Ag Services. 
In December, we saw further downward pressure on global soybean crush margins as a result of Argentine government policies. Also, the dramatic declines in crude oil prices impacted ethanol margins. As a result, full year segment operating profit was down nearly 21%.
Now I will review the performance of each segment and provide additional detail.
Starting on Slide 9. In the fourth quarter, Ag Services results were down significantly compared to last year's very strong fourth quarter, where we handled record volumes and has record exports from the large 2014 U.S. harvest.
In merchandising and handling, despite the large U.S. growth, low commodity prices limited grain movements, resulting in fewer merchandising opportunities. In addition, the strong U.S. dollar, along with ample global crop supplies, limited U.S. export volumes and margins. For perspective, Ag Services U.S. export volumes this fourth quarter were down about 20% compared to last year.  These declines were partially offset by improved performance and expanded reach of the ADM's Global Trade Desk. For example, in Argentina, we benefited from higher volumes and margins with the changes in the export taxes and the depreciation of the currency.
In transportation, lower U.S. export volumes reduced barge freight rates and volumes. High water levels in the Mississippi River system in the later part of December had some small negative impact on our transportation results for the quarter, but a greater impact will be felt in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
Milling and other again had another solid quarter. For the year, we generated $684 million of operating profits on an adjusted basis and below our historical levels. There were a number of factors that impacted our results, including a lack of global dislocations and the strong U.S. dollar versus the weakening currencies of other major crop-growing areas. This reduced both volumes and margins.
Please turn to Slide 10. Corn Processing results declined from the year-ago period. Sweeteners and starches continued to perform well, with low input costs and good demand. Results also were impacted by costs related to the ramp-up of commercialization at our plant in Tianjin.
Bioproducts results were lower as the steep declines in crude oil prices drove lower ethanol prices. This, combined with continued high industry production levels progressively reduced industry margins through the quarter. Our ethanol profitability reflects fourth quarter ethanol EBITDA margins estimated at around $0.18 per gallon. In addition, lysine operating profits were challenged by excess global supply, resulting in declines in pricing and margins; and some production outages in our plant.
For the year, sweeteners and starches performed well, with the solid demand throughout the year in a well-balanced supply-demand environment for the industry. On the other hand, lower crude oil prices and high industry production levels created a challenging margin environment for the U.S. ethanol industry despite growth in U.S. domestic demand for ethanol, brought about by increase in U.S. gasoline consumption.
Slide 11, please. Oilseeds results were down in the quarter versus a very strong quarter 1 year ago. In crushing and origination, we saw declining global soybean crush margins throughout the quarter, as buyers anticipated a more competitive South American soybean meal entering well-supplied world markets following the presidential elections in Argentina. Ample global meal supplies, in combination with the strong U.S. dollar, further pressured U.S. meal exports. 
Brazilian origination results were lower as grain commercialized earlier in the year compared to the prior year. In addition, the very volatile real exchange rate in the fourth quarter slowed grain movement as well.
Refining, packaging, biodiesel and other was down in the quarter, and declining crude oil prices and weaker global demand pressured global biodiesel margins.  Cocoa and other results decreased, reflecting the sale of the cocoa business in October 2015.
Results from Asia fell from the year-ago period due primarily to nonoperating charges included in Wilmar's Q3 results.
For the year, there was a strong global and U.S. demand for protein. And as a result, our global oilseeds operations set the crushing volume record in 2015. However, with more ample global supplies of meal through the year in combination with the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, we saw our soy crush margin begin softening in the third quarter with a more substantial drop in the fourth quarter, caused in part by the impact of the Argentine policy changes.
Slide 12, please. In the fourth quarter, WFSI earned $47 million with positive contribution from WILD Flavors, SCI and Eatem Foods. As a reminder, the fourth quarter is generally the weakest quarter of the year for WFSI due to seasonality impact. These results helped offset declines in some of our legacy specialty ingredients businesses, where we saw weaker sales overseas and some ForEx hedging costs related to our Brazilian specialty protein project.
Since the WILD acquisition, the team has implemented about $40 million in annualized run rate cost synergies. We remain confident that the team will deliver EUR 100 million of run rate synergies from the WILD acquisition by the end of 2017.
And in its first full year as part of ADM, WILD Flavors contributed $0.10 of earnings accretion to ADM.
Now on Slide 13, I'd like to update you on how we're strengthening and growing our company. This is the scorecard we presented at the Investor Day in 2014. It lists the actions we were taking to help grow our business and our returns. We have highlighted some of the areas in which we have made significant progress in 2015. I'll discuss a few.
In Ag Services, for example, we've seen the benefits of our Global Trade Desk we created after we acquired Toepfer. We advanced our global ports strategy with actions in Romania and Argentina, and we're growing destination marketing with our Medsofts joint venture in Egypt.
In corn, we continued our geographic diversification in Europe with the Eaststarch acquisition and in China with the Tianjin sweeteners and soluble fiber plants and with the feed-premix plants.
In oilseeds, we sold our global cocoa and chocolate businesses, allowing us to improve forward returns. We created a joint venture to quadruple the size of our port in Northern Brazil. We acquired the AOR oil bottling business in Belgium. And ADM and Wilmar agreed to turn Olenex into a full-fledged joint venture, helping us to drive additional efficiencies into that business.
And in WFSI, we acquired Eatem Foods, a leading developer of savory flavors, adding deep expertise in savory flavors and ethnic cuisines. And this morning, we're announcing that we have reached an agreement to purchase a controlling stake in Harvest Innovations, a leading producer on non-GMO, organic and gluten-free ingredients that consumers are demanding in increasing numbers. We'll continue to update you on our scorecard progress each quarter. And over time, you should expect to see the result of these actions in improved earnings and returns.
Now before we take your questions, I wanted to offer some additional perspective as we look forward. The global macroeconomic situation has been extremely volatile. We continue to face headwinds related to currencies, crude oil, Argentine policy changes and a growing supply of commodities. Barring any material changes to the macro situation, we expect the environment in 2016 to be similar to the second half of 2015. Whatever the conditions, we remain focused on driving improvements in the business.
For Ag Services, we expect the strong U.S. dollar to continue through '16. The large South American harvest that's forecast would add to already strong global crop supplies, and Argentine exports will be more competitive in the near term following the recent policy changes. All of this presents continued challenges for our U.S. export business, though it will support our Argentine export business. We do expect an improvement from Ag Services in 2015 -- 2016, but it's not likely the segment will reach a historical operating profit range this year.
For corn, sweeteners and starches will benefit from the improved pricing environment, the flexibility at our wet mills, solid demand and low input costs. And Eaststarch will be accretive to earnings.
In ethanol, industry margins remain uncertain with low crude prices and high industry production levels.
While we continue our efforts to reduce costs at our corn dry mills, we are now also undertaking a study of the strategic options for those. We do expect overall corn operating profits to improve from 2015 levels, though this will depend on ethanol industry conditions in the back half of the year.
For oilseeds, with current global soy crush margin down significantly from 2015 levels, the continued strength of the U.S. dollar and with low crude oil prices impacting global biodiesel margins, we expect 2015 -- '16 to be lower than 2015. We continue to take actions to improve our oilseeds operations around the world.
For WFSI, with a robust pipeline, continued realization of synergies and accretion from recent acquisitions, we expect double-digit percentage growth in operating profit in the 15% to 20% range in 2016. We are pleased that WILD Flavors contributed to results in 2015 despite microeconomic and ForEx headwinds.
In this challenging environment, we remain focused on the areas under our control. We continue to execute our strategic plan to grow our earnings power, which will translate into stronger earnings when conditions normalize.
From a cost management perspective, we have made significant progress on our operational excellence initiatives. By the end of 2015, we had achieved more than $200 million of run rate savings. We continue to execute on our pipeline and substantive [ph] objective of $275 million in additional run rate savings implemented by the end of 2016.
As part of the continued evolution of our strategic plan, we are taking a fresh look at the capital intensity of our operations and portfolio. We will be seeking innovative ways to lighten and redeploy capital in our business. Unlike the Billion Dollar Challenge launched in 2012 where we look at unlocking value from noncore assets or from ways to wring efficiencies in working capital, now we are embarking on a multiyear program to examine which assets are underutilized or where the ownership structure could be more efficient, while maintaining an appropriate level of operational control.
In some instances, a partner may be able to help us better utilize the asset. We started this process by selling a 50% interest in our Brazilian port in 2015. We believe we can reduce the asset intensity in various businesses, which will help improve our long-term returns even in a more challenged operating environment. We have set a preliminary target of reducing the invested capital of our businesses by at least $1 billion over time.
In 2016, our balanced capital allocation framework remains a priority. In terms of returning capital to shareholders, we have announced a 7% increase in our dividend rate. Our board recognizes the importance of the dividend to our investors. We also plan to repurchase $1 billion to $1.5 billion of shares in 2015 -- '16, subject to strategic M&A opportunities. We believe the shares are a very attractive investment at current levels.
And through strong cash flow generation, monetization of assets and a strong balance sheet, we continue to look at the strategic growth opportunities. Our priorities are growing our geographic footprint and expanding our specialty ingredients business. With our strong balance sheet, we will be looking for opportunistic acquisitions around the world, including bolt-ons with investment decisions driven by hard look at the returns and inherent risks.
We continue to believe that by executing our strategic and capital plans, we can achieve a $1 to $1.50 per share of earnings improvement over the medium term, and we are encouraged by the fact that global demand for grains, oilseeds and proteins remains solid. What we don't know is when the macro and business conditions will improve, returning our earnings base to more normalized levels. And so we continue to focus on what we can control to grow earnings and create value for our colleagues, our customers and our shareholders.
With that, operator, please open the line for questions."

Grain movement continues to be slow, behind the pace of last year, as low prices are not incenting farmers to commercialize their crops yet. So movements of soybeans was obviously a little bit more brisk maybe in late Q4 and continue into Q1, mainly maybe due to farmer cash flows. We have seen in the past that U.S. exports will be commercialized through the year, either through a strong demand for U.S. products, the cash flow need for the farmer or spikes in broad prices. That's how we're seeing it right now. Right now we're seeing the farmers selling in broad rallies. If you go to Brazil or Argentina, we've seen a strong dependency on what's happening with the currencies. We've seen in Brazil we have a day in which the dollar is $4.18, and we see a lot of farmer selling. It moved back to $4.11 or $3.97, and we see farmers selling slowing down. We see a little bit of that in Argentina. We saw a little bit more farmer selling of corn and wheat, a little bit less of soybean as the farmer maybe was not that happy with the reduction in export retention that they have over there. So still, I would say with these low prices subdued and customer -- or farmers will sell through rallies when they have cash flow needs."

So in the U.S., we have seen a big deterioration during Q4 and some deterioration also into January. And now we've seen the industry adjusting operating rates and things starting to ease off from the lows, if you will, that we hit in January. Obviously, this is the low season in the U.S., anyway, so there is a shift to crush margins into South America. South America still have an expanded crush margin because they haven't been -- haven't had the benefit of the harvest, but we'll get that soon in Brazil. Europe, we see it okay, kind of stable until maybe March, April and then we have the dynamics that we'd probably see more exports from South America. But also, we have the rapeseed harvest in Europe, and we have the ability so switch our assets a little bit between soybean and rapeseeds over there. So that's kind of what we see the evolution of crush margins at this point in time, Farha."

So we have no rush for this. We -- the whole operation is having positive cash flows, positive contribution, so there's no need to panic. We just want to be prepared, to look at the industry long term and see can this industry present the returns that we expect and what are the options to maximize our return for ADM. So there is not a clear time line or a clear direction on what we really want to see. We want to see the analysis or the option the team will bring. In the meantime, the improvements in costs continue, and we have seen in 2015 improvements in enzymes, improvement in yields, improvement in corn oil recovery. So we're very pleased with what the teams are doing in that. It's just we have an industry problem, and we want to see how we can participate in addressing those strategic options."

The next evolution in these is that we'll look at our -- the way we operate and we see we're very productive from a people perspective. We make north of $600 million of earning this quarter with 33,000 people, so we feel we're very productive from a people intensity perspective. When we look at the asset intensity, we don't feel that great about that. We think that there is still some ability to flex our assets a little bit better. That is the nature of the industry, which is, it has got some seasonality and you need to have some assets for some peak periods. But we have started to undergo an analysis of all our businesses and value chains. You have to realize, sometimes we keep assets that we think about them as cost centers, if you will. And we're trying to look at them more as businesses in itself and having to provide the return. So -- also technology is providing some tools. We have, today, software -- if I give you an example, ADM, because it's a large company, we have many, many warehouses around the U.S. and around the world. Today, we have software that allows us to look at the freight rates, look at the inventory needs and look at the number of warehouses and can provide a significant optimization to our warehouses network, if you will, that could end up in selling some of those properties. You mentioned some of the transportation. We do believe that we have a very tax efficient ownership of our transportation asset. But there maybe aspects of that maybe in force where we have opportunity to do something better. So again, this is a multi-year process and we're going to be looking at several parts of our operations, but we have looked at that with a target of about $1 billion, and we believe that it is a realistic target overtime in looking at what I just described."

This year, as you know, we actually had a lot in terms of net divestment proceeds from the cocoa and chocolate business. As you know, those businesses were not really generating much profitability, they're being extremely volatile. We actually believe that and we did some analysis that it actually is going to be positive towards our forward ROICs by divesting those businesses and taking the proceeds and we bought back shares to reduce our invested capital base. So that's going to be actually positive towards our ROIC, going forward. In terms of 2016, you asked about net -- what is the M&A divestment kind of look like. Generally, as you can -- as you expect, we are budgeting or planning CapEx around $1 billion for 2016. On the M&A front, we always have a little bit in terms of just bolt-on acquisitions for a couple of hundred million dollars. Net divestment proceeds divestitures, we achieved a lot already in terms of divestitures. And so at this point, I'm not planning for a large divesture number there. But in general, when I think about the impact of our recent M&As that we did in 2015, as an example, we did quite of few bolt-ons including the Eaststarch. Those have been accretive and will continue to be accretive to our earnings, going forward. Its part of the -- our bridge towards a $1 to $1.50 of improvements, if you recall, these types of strategic projects over a 3-year period will add probably around $0.30 a share towards our earnings power over a 3-year period when you kind of accumulate what we've already announced plus some of the projects that we're working on right now."

Domestic demand has increased because of low oil prices and high gasoline consumption. And export demand has been very good and we expect it to be even better through 2016. It's just a matter that the production in the industry has kept this industry margins very, very low and we are really surprised by that. We've been running our plants for yield, as I said before. We've seen improvements in our operations based on that, but this margin continues to be stubbornly low. So we want to analyze what happened at lower oil prices. What happened if these things recover. So we have an internal review to see the different scenarios and what do we do under those different scenarios.

If you compare last year with this year, last year, North America came into the export season with a big book of export on nontraditional destinations, which we didn't have this year. So I think that when I look at Argentina, the farmers selling in soybeans have been disappointing for what everybody was expecting. So crush has improved, but not that much, but I think it has created the expectation in a lot of the buyers that maybe Argentina will increase crush and will become a bigger player in the mill worldwide. And maybe it was wise to wait a little bit and wait for all that to come to market. Again, it hasn't come yet. If you look at what crushing capacity rates in Argentina is, its about 3 million tons per month, capacities maybe 4.5 million or something like that. We're still thinking about 40 million tons of crushing for next year, so we haven't seen the explosion. But I think it has been the psychological impact in all the buyers of nontraditional destinations for the U.S., so we continue to supply the traditional destinations to the U.S.. We have lost that ability to sell aggressively to nontraditional destinations, partly the U.S. dollar, partly the expectations that Argentina will come into that. So a long-winded answer to your question. It's probably yes, although not yet because of increased production, more for psychological impact of their ability to produce more."

Just -- there's different currency impacts that impact us. If you look at just pure translation impact, Rob, over the calendar year, I mean this is a classical accounting translation, translation impact on our operating profit was about a roughly $130 million negative impact for us, okay. It's just pure currency translation. So, therefore, it was an impact that was not -- I would say that's not a dramatic impact. The bigger issue is really the competitive issue. And the competitiveness issue is really driven by not just the strength of the U.S. dollar, but also the fact that 2 other factors. We've got large crops around the world, right? So the fact that you got well supplied inventories of crops around the world had an impact. And then secondly, for the major crop growing areas, their currencies actually devalued far more than what the basket of currencies that the U.S. dollar is weighed against. So when you saw what happened this year, you saw the chaos because the political situation really depreciated. You saw the Argentine policy changes. You've seen what happened with Russia and Ukraine. So what happened was for the major crop growing areas, their currencies actually devalued significantly relative to the basket of currencies. And then you also anticipate a lot of supply around the world. Because under normal situations, Rob, when the U.S. dollar strengthens, lets say under a normal cycle of U.S. dollar strength, and when there's a more balanced supply of crops around the world, they will still come to the U.S. for the crops. But so that's what, in my mind, that's what really changed this year. And I don't believe this is structural. I mean, this is temporary. I mean, we're going onboard to this cycle here. I do believe at some juncture, I mean, the U.S. dollar will correct itself. Timings will be determined, but I don't think this is a structural issue. It's a cyclical issue that we're going to have to manage through here."

So when you have seen margins, you want to be able to have your lowest cost position, your best cost position. And it's not necessarily through volume that you get that, and we have proven that in our own facilities. But anyway so those are the 2 main factors. In terms of growing exports, we do see places like India and China that are dealing with environmental issues due to smog. That's how they are increasing the use of ethanol to fight their environmental -- their air issue, air pollution issue. So we see that demand growing. We see how demands have grown in China, and we expect for next year to be even bigger, so we expect 2016 net exports from the U.S. to be probably between 50 million to 100 million gallons higher than what they were in 2015, driven by all these 2 main markets."

In the absence of any more information than that in a very volatile environment, we still believe that as I said from an alkalise perspective, as you said some octane enhancers were still cheaper. And we still see continued demand from our destinations. We see us, as I was answering to Ken, gladly that there are new markets like again India and China that are increasingly taking based on air pollution issues and the benefit of ethanol to do that. So at this point, we are estimating on a flat crude oil environment, if you will."

And then we have emerging market issues that move our demand. And even our seasonal high periods, they move a little bit. So it was a very unusual year. With also a lot of customers focusing much more sometimes in cost reductions than in revenue enhancement opportunities. We are very pleased though with the way the customers have reacted to our value proposition, and we see that in the engagement that we have in our customers. So our expectations for the pipeline and the deliverance of synergy have not changed. Maybe it has changed a little bit the composition of that in the short term. I think if we're going to be talking in the year 3 of this, we probably be reporting a little bit higher cost synergies than we originally expected, and we will still be targeting the same amount or more of revenue synergies, maybe a little bit longer in the time line just because we continue to incorporate products to our product line and our value proposition. And that continues to open doors with customers, but the customer projects are normally a little bit slower or less in our control from a timing perspective and the cost synergies. But the response to customers to our value proposition has been very, very good. We have -- when we originally target this, Sandy, we had $94 million originally target in revenue synergies. We have built a pipeline of already $67 million to $70 million, and we have more than 700 projects in the pipeline. So we feel very, very good about having created this pipeline that will turn into execution and into wins, and you will see that accelerating in 2016."

There's --  the political factors are also impacting, presumably the Brazilian currency at this point in time. You also have to remember that in some respects, lot of these countries are getting a windfall right now in terms of the competitiveness of the crop because they've got the devaluation that occurred this year, yet the input cost was prior to the currency devaluing, so they were able to still get competitive input cost in terms of whether it be seed or chemicals. Now that's going to change as you go into 2016 because what will happen is they'll have to buy that at a higher cost because while this is actually denominated more in U.S. dollar terms. And so lot of these countries are going to have to grapple with higher input cost in terms of their grains, going forward, whether it be seeds, chemicals, et cetera, et cetera. So what to see? I mean, is the worst behind us? It's difficult to predict. What we do know is currencies go through cycles. And so from our perspective, we're going through a cyclical downturn with some of these currencies -- political influences have some impact. Our job is just to manage this, and we'll continue to focus on expanding our footprint in South America, as for example. I mean, we've made investments down there. And we're going to continue to manage our cost. The other factor, Ann, is really the balancing the global supply/demand of grains. And oftentimes, low prices solve a lot of issues, and so with the current low prices, expectations that you should see a lot more consumption around the world and that could probably help us in terms of the global supply/demand balance, which will also be important in terms of getting the situation back to normal."

So I think the U.S. banks will probably have more to determine what -- how much farmers get to plant and that may have an impact on planting numbers. But it doesn't seem like these low prices have at least started to discourage production in the U.S. And then you still got about 200 million metric tons sitting in China. They don't know what to do with it. I guess time with China would be -- with China, they have such poor storage that maybe it all just goes bad, which should be a good scenario. But can you kind of wrap-up your thought -- can you wrap-up your thoughts on global supply as we put all these factors together, South America, what the U.S. planting season might look like on the acreage? What China might do with their corn? We're putting a lot of variables in there, but this is really kind of a key to what I think is going to be a turnaround for your industry fundamentals."

The globe have increased their stocks this year in the tune of maybe 20 million, 25 million tons so the world is well supplied. And yes, China is sitting on inventory. So although we never know the quality of those inventories. So at this point in time, given that South America is probably not having any major threatening weather events, the U.S. seems to be forecasting a wet spring. And we have good soil moisture, so we'll probably expect that there continues to be ample supply going into next year. There has been some dislocations. We shouldn't forget El Niño created some problems and that's why we are exporting so much soybean oil to India, for example. Or we are exporting now more corn to South Africa because of the drought there. But probably, this is locations where regional in nature and didn't get to global levels.

And so I mean, you can't necessarily multiply by 4, but what we're saying is that the conditions are not going to be at least what we see in terms of just visibility at this point in time, not materially different. As we kind of move through the year, I mean, clearly, you're going to have certain benefits there. As you would expect, we are on a startup flow in the first quarter. I mean, this is based upon the conditions that we end up at the end of December where ethanol margins have ended up. And I mentioned to you the high water impacts that we had in the Mississippi River that -- that will impact us in January, in the first quarter. We'll start off slower in the front half of the year. We'll start off slower in the first quarter and we expect some gradual recovery as we kind of move through the year. We will get accretion from the investments that we've made. We will get accretion from the cost reductions that we're doing. Well, again, as Juan indicated, we expect the margin environment for ethanol should improve as we kind of move through the year. Again, that's going to be a variable that we're going to analyze very, very carefully. And so as you kind of look at how we think the Euro play out, again, as Juan indicated, we do expect Ag Services to be a little better. We expect corn to be a little bit better. Again, a lot of it a function of where the ethanol margins for the industry end up in the back half of the year. We see -- [indiscernible]  upon the global crush margins right now to be worst off. And then WFSI should have a good year. So with all those puts and takes, I think we can make a judgment in terms of how we end up over all.

This morning, we reported fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.61. Our adjusted segment operating profit was $599 million. For the calendar year, our adjusted earnings per share was $2.60. 
Global dynamics reduced margins across the U.S. agricultural export sector, the U.S. ethanol industry and in the soybean crushing industry worldwide. Adverse market conditions that impacted many of our businesses earlier in the year continued through the fourth quarter. Despite the challenging conditions, we achieved 2015 adjusted ROIC of 7.3%, 70 basis points above our annual cost of capital, generating positive EVA. 
In the fourth quarter, we advanced our strategic plan by expanding our international corn-processing footprint with the acquisition of Eaststarch, progressing our destination marketing strategy with the announcement of the Medsofts Egyptian joint venture and strengthening our European Olenex refined oils joint venture. And today, we're announcing an investment in the controlling stake in Harvest Innovations, a leading producer of non-GMO, organic and gluten-free ingredients. 
From a portfolio management perspective, we completed the sale of our global cocoa business.
In addition, 2015 was the safest year in the history of ADM with the lowest level of recordable and loss time injuries. I'm pleased with how our discipline, focus and process improvements have translated to these safety results in 2015.
With current headwinds likely to persist, we'll remain focused on the areas within our control. We will continue to implement our pipeline of operational excellence initiatives, with an objective of an incremental $275 million of run rate savings by the end of the calendar year. As part of our -- of the evolution of our strategic plan, we're also taking a fresh look at the capital intensity of our operations and portfolio, seeking innovative ways to lighten up and redeploy capital in our efforts to drive long-term returns.
In 2016, our balanced capital allocation framework remains a priority, including a quarterly dividend rate increase of more than 7% to $0.30 per share and share repurchases of between $1 billion to $1.5 billion, subject to strategic capital requirements. With a strong balance sheet, we will also remain opportunistic for investments, especially bolt-ons in this more challenged macro environment. I'll provide more detail on our 2015 accomplishments as well as perspectives on 2016 later in the call.
Now I'll turn the call over to Ray."

Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.61, down 39% from $1 last year. We've been busy this quarter as we continue to manage our portfolio to drive returns, which has resulted in a larger-than-usual number of specified items.
Excluding specified items and also excluding net timing effects, adjusted segment operating profit was $599 million, down $529 million. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was negative 2% compared to 29% in the fourth quarter of the prior year.
Our reported tax rate was negative this quarter due to the low tax rates and the gains related to the cocoa and the Eaststarch transactions, together with a onetime favorable $66 million valuation allowance impact.
If we excluded specified items, the related tax impacts and the valuation allowance, the effective tax rate for the calendar year was approximately 27% in 2015, in line with 2014. The rate has been slightly lower than the recent historical tax rates due to a more favorable geographic mix this year in some favorable discrete tax items this year. For 2016, I would expect our tax rate to be in the 28% to 30% range.
Our trailing 4 quarter average adjusted ROIC of 7.3% is down 170 basis points from the 9.0% at the end of the fourth quarter last year. The 7.3% adjusted ROIC is above our 6.6% annual WACC for 2015 but below our long-term WACC of 8.0%, as reflected in the graph on Slide 20 in the appendix. Our objective remains to earn 200 basis points over our WACC.
In the fourth quarter, we did create value based upon our trailing 4 quarter average EVA, which was positive $173 million.
On Chart 18, 19 in the appendix, you can see the reconciliation of our reported quarterly earnings of $1.19 per share to the adjusted earnings of $0.61. For this quarter, we had gains on sales and revaluations of assets amounting to $0.70 per share, primarily related to the cocoa transaction and Eaststarch. We had charges related to impairments, restructurings and settlements amounting to $0.24 per share, the largest being related to our Brazilian sugar operations.
We also made an adjustment to Q4 adjusted earnings to reflect the reallocation of the biodiesel credits to the previous quarters when shipped of about $0.05 per share. And there are 2 tax adjustments in the fourth quarter: the valuation allowance impact of $0.11 per share that I mentioned earlier and the true-up of the quarterly tax rates to the calendar year adjusted rate of $0.03 per share.
Slide 5 provides an operating profit summary and the components of our corporate line. Before Juan discusses the operating results, I'd like to highlight some of the unique items impacting our quarterly results.
In the Corn Processing segment, we had $185 million gain on the revaluation of the company's previously held investment in Eaststarch, our former European joint venture with Tate & Lyle in conjunction with the acquisition of the remaining interest. This transaction closed in early November.
We also recorded impairment and restructuring charges of $102 million, primarily related to our Brazilian sugar operations.
In oilseeds, we record a $206 million of gains on sales of assets, primarily related to the sale of our global cocoa business. We also had impairment and restructuring charges of $34 million for various underperformed businesses within the segment.
In the corporate lines, net interest expense was down due to lower interest rates, and the favorable effects of the debt restructuring we effected earlier this year. Unallocated corporate costs of $89 million were lower than the run rate for previous quarters due to favorable foreign exchange translation, favorable people-related costs and some timing effects in 2015 spend, offset partially by higher project costs. 
I would also like to comment on our GAAP net revenue number that can be found in the appendix. GAAP net revenues for the quarter of $16.4 billion were down significantly from last year, driven by large declines in commodity prices and foreign exchange translation. But these factors also favorably impacted our cost of goods sold as our input costs were lower. 
Turning to the cash flow statement on Slide 6. We generated $2 billion from operations before working capital changes, lower than the prior year. Total capital spending for the year was $1.1 billion, up from the prior year's $900 million but in the lower end of our $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion capital spending guidance we provided earlier in the year. Given the more challenging business conditions we encountered in 2015, we're even more prudent in our capital spending.
We made acquisitions totaling $0.5 billion in 2015, which included AOR, the European bottle oil company; Eatem Foods; and the remaining interest in the Romanian port; and also Eaststarch. 
The other investing activities line of the cash flow statement mainly reflects the proceeds from divestitures, such as our global cocoa and chocolate businesses and the sale of our 50% stake in our port in Northern Brazil, plus the incremental investments we made in Wilmar or approximately $1.5 billion of net divestment proceeds.
During the year, we spent about $2 billion to repurchase shares, finishing up at the high end of our $1.5 billion to $2 billion target. Our average share count for the year was 621 million diluted shares outstanding, down 35 million from the time 1 year ago. At the end of the year, we had approximately 601 million shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis. Our total return of capital to shareholders, including dividends of almost $700 million, was more than $2.7 billion for 2015.
When I think about our capital allocation framework for 2015, if we take our operating cash flows before working capital plus the net divestment proceeds or approximately $3.6 billion in total cash flows, we spent about 30% of that amount on capital spending and returned about 75% of that amount to shareholders. This is in line with the capital allocation targets with a bit more tilted towards capital returns to shareholders in 2015.
Slide 7 shows the highlights of our balance sheet as of December 31, 2015, and '14. Our balance sheet remains strong. Our operating working capital of $7.1 billion was down $700 million from the year-ago period. Total debt was about $5.9 billion, resulting in a net debt balance that is debt less cash of $4.5 billion, up from the 2014 net debt level of $4 billion, in part reflecting the issuance this year of EUR 1.1 billion -- of euro debt or about $1.2 billion in U.S. dollar terms and the subsequent repurchase of about $900 million of U.S. debt. 
Our leverage position remains healthy with a net debt to total capital ratio of about 20%. Our shareholders' equity of $17.9 billion is $1.7 billion lower than the level last year due to the shareholder capital returns in excess of net income by $900 million and the cumulative translation account, which was down about $800 million due to the strength of the U.S. dollar. We had $6 billion in available global credit capacity at the end of December. If you add the available cash, we had access to $7.3 billion of short-term liquidity.
Next, Juan will take us through a review of our business performance."
251704,316347818,924876,"Archer-Daniels-Midland Company, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2016",2016-02-02,"Earnings Calls","Archer-Daniels-Midland Company","Executives","Thank you, Ray. Please turn to Slide 8. In the fourth quarter, we earned $599 million of operating profit excluding specified items, down from the $1.1 billion results from last year's strong fourth quarter. Operating conditions in the fourth quarter de",2080,"Thank you, Ray. Please turn to Slide 8. In the fourth quarter, we earned $599 million of operating profit excluding specified items, down from the $1.1 billion results from last year's strong fourth quarter. 
Operating conditions in the fourth quarter deteriorated from the already challenging conditions we faced earlier in 2015. After last year's large harvest around the world and with a strong U.S. dollar, a lack of dislocation significantly reduced U.S. exports and limited merchandising opportunities in Ag Services. 
In December, we saw further downward pressure on global soybean crush margins as a result of Argentine government policies. Also, the dramatic declines in crude oil prices impacted ethanol margins. As a result, full year segment operating profit was down nearly 21%.
Now I will review the performance of each segment and provide additional detail.
Starting on Slide 9. In the fourth quarter, Ag Services results were down significantly compared to last year's very strong fourth quarter, where we handled record volumes and had record exports from the large 2014 U.S. harvest.
In merchandising and handling, despite the large U.S. crop, low commodity prices limited grain movements, resulting in fewer merchandising opportunities. In addition, the strong U.S. dollar, along with ample global crop supplies, limited U.S. export volumes and margins. For perspective, Ag Services U.S. export volumes this fourth quarter were down about 20% compared to last year.  These declines were partially offset by improved performance and expanded reach of the ADM's Global Trade Desk. For example, in Argentina, we benefited from higher volumes and margins with the changes in the export taxes and the depreciation of the currency.
In transportation, lower U.S. export volumes reduced barge freight rates and volumes. High water levels in the Mississippi River system in the later part of December had some small negative impact on our transportation results for the quarter, but a greater impact will be felt in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
Milling and other again had another solid quarter. For the year, we generated $684 million of operating profits on an adjusted basis and below our historical levels. There were a number of factors that impacted our results, including a lack of global dislocations and the strong U.S. dollar versus the weakening currencies of other major crop-growing areas. This reduced both volumes and margins.
Please turn to Slide 10. Corn Processing results declined from the year-ago period. Sweeteners and starches continued to perform well, with low input costs and good demand. Results also were impacted by costs related to the ramp-up of commercialization at our plant in Tianjin.
Bioproducts results were lower as the steep declines in crude oil prices drove lower ethanol prices. This, combined with continued high industry production levels progressively reduced industry margins through the quarter. Our ethanol profitability reflects fourth quarter ethanol EBITDA margins estimated at around $0.18 per gallon. In addition, lysine operating profits were challenged by excess global supply, resulting in declines in pricing and margins; and some production outages in our plant.
For the year, sweeteners and starches performed well, with solid demand throughout the year in a well-balanced supply-demand environment for the industry. On the other hand, lower crude oil prices and high industry production levels created a challenging margin environment for the U.S. ethanol industry despite growth in U.S. domestic demand for ethanol, brought about by increasing U.S. gasoline consumption.
Slide 11, please. Oilseeds results were down in the quarter versus a very strong quarter 1 year ago. In crushing and origination, we saw declining global soybean crush margins throughout the quarter, as buyers anticipated a more competitive South American soybean meal entering well-supplied world markets following the presidential elections in Argentina. Ample global meal supplies, in combination with the strong U.S. dollar, further pressured U.S. meal exports. 
Brazilian origination results were lower as grain commercialized earlier in the year compared to the prior year. In addition, the very volatile real exchange rate in the fourth quarter slowed grain movement as well.
Refining, packaging, biodiesel and other was down in the quarter, and declining crude oil prices and weaker global demand pressured global biodiesel margins.  Cocoa and other results decreased, reflecting the sale of the cocoa business in October 2015.
Results from Asia fell from the year-ago period due primarily to nonoperating charges included in Wilmar's Q3 results.
For the year, there was a strong global and U.S. demand for protein. And as a result, our global oilseeds operations set the crushing volume record in 2015. However, with more ample global supplies of meal through the year in combination with the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, we saw our soy crush margin begin softening in the third quarter with a more substantial drop in the fourth quarter, caused in part by the impact of the Argentine policy changes.
Slide 12, please. In the fourth quarter, WFSI earned $47 million with positive contribution from WILD Flavors, SCI and Eatem Foods. As a reminder, the fourth quarter is generally the weakest quarter of the year for WFSI due to seasonality impact. These results helped offset declines in some of our legacy specialty ingredients businesses, where we saw weaker sales overseas and some ForEx hedging costs related to our Brazilian specialty protein project.
Since the WILD acquisition, the team has implemented about $40 million in annualized run rate cost synergies. We remain confident that the team will deliver EUR 100 million of run rate synergies from the WILD acquisition by the end of 2017.
And in its first full year as part of ADM, WILD Flavors contributed $0.10 of earnings accretion to ADM.
Now on Slide 13, I'd like to update you on how we're strengthening and growing our company. This is the scorecard we presented at the Investor Day in 2014. It lists the actions we were taking to help grow our business and our returns. We have highlighted some of the areas in which we have made significant progress in 2015. I'll discuss a few.
In Ag Services, for example, we've seen the benefits of our Global Trade Desk we created after we acquired Toepfer. We advanced our global ports strategy with actions in Romania and Argentina, and we're growing destination marketing with our Medsofts joint venture in Egypt.
In corn, we continued our geographic diversification in Europe with the Eaststarch acquisition and in China with the Tianjin sweeteners and soluble fiber plants and with the feed-premix plants.
In oilseeds, we sold our global cocoa and chocolate businesses, allowing us to improve forward returns. We created a joint venture to quadruple the size of our port in Northern Brazil. We acquired the AOR oil bottling business in Belgium. And ADM and Wilmar agreed to turn Olenex into a full-fledged joint venture, helping us to drive additional efficiencies into that business.
And in WFSI, we acquired Eatem Foods, a leading developer of savory flavors, adding deep expertise in savory flavors and ethnic cuisines. And this morning, we're announcing that we have reached an agreement to purchase a controlling stake in Harvest Innovations, a leading producer on non-GMO, organic and gluten-free ingredients that consumers are demanding in increasing numbers. We'll continue to update you on our scorecard progress each quarter. And over time, you should expect to see the result of these actions in improved earnings and returns.
Now before we take your questions, I wanted to offer some additional perspective as we look forward. The global macroeconomic situation has been extremely volatile. We continue to face headwinds related to currencies, crude oil, Argentine policy changes and a growing supply of commodities. Barring any material changes to the macro situation, we expect the environment in 2016 to be similar to the second half of 2015. Whatever the conditions, we remain focused on driving improvements in the business.
For Ag Services, we expect the strong U.S. dollar to continue through '16. The large South American harvest that's forecast would add to already strong global crop supplies, and Argentine exports will be more competitive in the near term following the recent policy changes. All of this presents continued challenges for our U.S. export business, though it will support our Argentine export business. We do expect an improvement from Ag Services in 2015 -- 2016, but it's not likely the segment will reach a historical operating profit range this year.
For corn, sweeteners and starches will benefit from the improved pricing environment, the flexibility at our wet mills, solid demand and low input costs. And Eaststarch will be accretive to earnings.
In ethanol, industry margins remain uncertain with low crude prices and high industry production levels.
While we continue our efforts to reduce costs at our corn dry mills, we are now also undertaking a study of the strategic options for those. We do expect overall corn operating profits to improve from 2015 levels, though this will depend on ethanol industry conditions in the back half of the year.
For oilseeds, with current global soy crush margin down significantly from 2015 levels, the continued strength of the U.S. dollar and with low crude oil prices impacting global biodiesel margins, we expect 2015 -- '16 to be lower than 2015. We continue to take actions to improve our oilseeds operations around the world.
For WFSI, with a robust pipeline, continued realization of synergies and accretion from recent acquisitions, we expect double-digit percentage growth in operating profit in the 15% to 20% range in 2016. We are pleased that WILD Flavors contributed to results in 2015 despite microeconomic and ForEx headwinds.
In this challenging environment, we remain focused on the areas under our control. We continue to execute our strategic plan to grow our earnings power, which will translate into stronger earnings when conditions normalize.
From a cost management perspective, we have made significant progress on our operational excellence initiatives. By the end of 2015, we had achieved more than $200 million of run rate savings. We continue to execute on our pipeline and substantive [ph] objective of $275 million in additional run rate savings implemented by the end of 2016.
As part of the continued evolution of our strategic plan, we are taking a fresh look at the capital intensity of our operations and portfolio. We will be seeking innovative ways to lighten and redeploy capital in our business. Unlike the Billion Dollar Challenge launched in 2012 where we look at unlocking value from noncore assets or from ways to wring efficiencies in working capital, now we are embarking on a multiyear program to examine which assets are underutilized or where the ownership structure could be more efficient, while maintaining an appropriate level of operational control.
In some instances, a partner may be able to help us better utilize the asset. We started this process by selling a 50% interest in our Brazilian port in 2015. We believe we can reduce the asset intensity in various businesses, which will help improve our long-term returns even in a more challenged operating environment. We have set a preliminary target of reducing the invested capital of our businesses by at least $1 billion over time.
In 2016, our balanced capital allocation framework remains a priority. In terms of returning capital to shareholders, we have announced a 7% increase in our dividend rate. Our board recognizes the importance of the dividend to our investors. We also plan to repurchase $1 billion to $1.5 billion of shares in 2015 -- '16, subject to strategic M&A opportunities. We believe the shares are a very attractive investment at current levels.
And through strong cash flow generation, monetization of assets and a strong balance sheet, we continue to look at the strategic growth opportunities. Our priorities are growing our geographic footprint and expanding our specialty ingredients business. With our strong balance sheet, we will be looking for opportunistic acquisitions around the world, including bolt-ons with investment decisions driven by hard look at the returns and inherent risks.
We continue to believe that by executing our strategic and capital plans, we can achieve a $1 to $1.50 per share of earnings improvement over the medium term, and we are encouraged by the fact that global demand for grains, oilseeds and proteins remains solid. What we don't know is when the macro and business conditions will improve, returning our earnings base to more normalized levels. And so we continue to focus on what we can control to grow earnings and create value for our colleagues, our customers and our shareholders.
With that, operator, please open the line for questions."

Grain movement continues to be slow, behind the pace of last year, as low prices are not incenting farmers to commercialize their crops yet. So movements of soybeans was obviously a little bit more brisk maybe in late Q4 and continue into Q1, mainly maybe due to farmer cash flows. We have seen in the past that U.S. ag stocks will be commercialized through the year, either through a strong demand for U.S. products, the cash flow need for the farmer or spikes in board [ph] prices. That's how we're seeing it right now. Right now we're seeing the farmers selling in board [ph] rallies. If you go to Brazil or Argentina, we've seen a strong dependency on what's happening with the currencies. We've seen in Brazil we have a day in which the dollar is $4.18, and we see a lot of farmer selling. It moved back to $4.11 or $3.97, and we see farmers selling slowing down. We see a little bit of that in Argentina. We saw a little bit more farmer selling of corn and wheat, a little bit less of soybean as the farmer maybe was not that happy with the reduction in export retention that they have over there. So still, I would say with these low prices subdued and customer -- or farmers will sell through rallies when they have cash flow needs."

So in the U.S., we have seen a big deterioration during Q4 and some deterioration also into January. And now we've seen the industry adjusting operating rates and things starting to ease off from the lows, if you will, that we hit in January. Obviously, this is the low season in the U.S., anyway, so there is a shift to crush margins into South America. South America still have an expanded crush margin because they haven't been -- haven't had the benefit of the harvest, but we'll get that soon in Brazil. Europe, we see it okay, kind of stable until maybe March, April and then we have the dynamics that we'd probably see more exports from South America. But also, we have the rapeseed harvest in Europe, and we have the ability so switch our assets a little bit between soybean and rapeseeds over there. So that's kind of what we see the evolution of crush margins at this point in time, Farha."

So we have asked the team to undertake a strategic review of that. They have an adviser helping them on that, and we're going to run through the different scenarios, all the way from one extreme to the other. We will explore all the scenarios. So we have no rush for this. We -- the whole operation is having positive cash flows, positive contribution, so there's no need to panic. We just want to be prepared, to look at the industry long term and see can this industry present the returns that we expect and what are the options to maximize our return for ADM. So there is not a clear time line or a clear direction on what we really want to see. We want to see the analysis or the option the team will bring. In the meantime, the improvements in costs continue, and we have seen in 2015 improvements in enzymes, improvement in yields, improvement in corn oil recovery. So we're very pleased with what the teams are doing in that. It's just we have an industry problem, and we want to see how we can participate in addressing those strategic options."

The next evolution in these is that we look at our -- the way we operate and we see we're very productive from a people perspective. We make north of $600 million of earning this quarter with 33,000 people, so we feel we're very productive from a people intensity perspective. When we look at the asset intensity, we don't feel that great about that. We think that there is still some ability to flex our assets a little bit better. That is the nature of the industry, which is, it has got some seasonality and you need to have some assets for some peak periods. But we have started to undergo an analysis of all our businesses and value chains. You have to realize, sometimes we keep assets that we think about them as cost centers, if you will. And we're trying to look at them more as businesses in itself and having to provide the return. So -- also technology is providing some tools. We have, today, software -- if I give you an example, ADM, because it's a large company, we have many, many warehouses around the U.S. and around the world. Today, we have software that allows us to look at the freight rates, look at the inventory needs and look at the number of warehouses and can provide a significant optimization to our warehouses network, if you will, that could end up in selling some of those properties. You mentioned some of the transportation. We do believe that we have a very tax efficient ownership of our transportation asset. But there may be aspects of that maybe in ports where we have opportunity to do something better.

This year, as you know, we actually had a lot in terms of net divestment proceeds from the cocoa and chocolate business. As you know, those businesses were not really generating much profitability, they being extremely volatile. We actually believe that and we did some analysis that it actually is going to be positive towards our forward ROICs by divesting those businesses and taking the proceeds and we bought back shares to reduce our invested capital base. So that's going to be actually positive towards our ROIC, going forward. In terms of 2016, you asked about net -- what is the M&A divestment kind of look like. Generally, as you can -- as you expect, we are budgeting or planning CapEx around $1 billion for 2016. On the M&A front, we always have a little bit in terms of just bolt-on acquisitions, probably a couple of hundred million dollars. Net divestment proceeds divestitures, we achieved a lot already in terms of divestitures. And so at this point, I'm not planning for a large divesture number there. But in general, when I think about the impact of our recent M&As that we did in 2015, as an example, we did quite of few bolt-ons including the Eaststarch. Those have been accretive and will continue to be accretive to our earnings, going forward. Its part of the -- our bridge towards a $1 to $1.50 of improvements. And if you recall, these types of strategic projects over a 3-year period will add probably around $0.30 a share towards our earnings power over a 3-year period when you kind of accumulate what we've already announced plus some of the projects that we're working on right now."

Domestic demand has increased because of low oil prices and high gasoline consumption. And export demand has been very good and we expect it to be even better through 2016. It's just a matter that the production in the industry has kept this industry margins very, very low and we are really surprised by that. We've been running our plants for yield, as I said before. We've seen improvements in our operations based on that, but this margin continues to be stubbornly low. So we want to analyze what happened at lower oil prices. What happened if these things recover. So we have an internal review to see the different scenarios and what do we do under those different scenarios. So it's just a matter that you look at how much can you improve your cost position. We have a good view now into how much we can improve our cost position, and we want to test that against lower oil prices or higher industry rates if they don't go down."

But what seems to have changed is the South American currencies, but then maybe if we really, really zone in on here, it's Argentina.

If you compare last year with this year, last year, North America came into the export season with a big book of export on nontraditional destinations, which we didn't have this year. So I think that when I look at Argentina, the farmers selling in soybeans have been disappointing for what everybody was expecting. So crush has improved, but not that much, but I think it has created the expectation in a lot of the buyers that maybe Argentina will increase crush and will become a bigger player in mill worldwide. And maybe it was wise to wait a little bit and wait for all that to come to market. Again, it hasn't come yet. If you look at what crushing operating in Argentina is, its about 3 million tons per month, capacities maybe 4.5 million or something like that. We're still thinking about 40 million tons of crushing for next year, so we haven't seen the explosion. But I think it has been the psychological impact in all the buyers of nontraditional destinations for the U.S., so we continue to supply the traditional destinations to the U.S.. We have lost that ability to sell aggressively to nontraditional destinations, partly the U.S. dollar, partly the expectations that Argentina will come into that. So a long-winded answer to your question. It's probably yes, although not yet because of increased production, more for psychological impact of their ability to produce more."

Just -- there's different currency impacts that impact us. If you look at just pure translation impact, Rob, over the calendar year, I mean this is a classical accounting translation, translation impact on our operating profit was about a roughly $130 million negative impact for us, okay. So just pure currency translation. So, therefore, it was an impact that was not -- I would say that's not a dramatic impact. The bigger issue is really the competitive issue. And the competitiveness issue is really driven by not just the strength of the U.S. dollar, but also the fact that -- 2 other factors. We've got large crops around the world, right? So the fact that you got well supplied inventories of crops around the world had an impact. And then secondly, for the major crop growing areas, their currencies actually devalued far more than what the basket of currencies that the U.S. dollar is weighed against. So when you saw what happened this year, you saw the real because the political situation really depreciated. You saw the Argentine policy changes. You've seen what happened with Russia and Ukraine. So what happened was for the major crop growing areas, their currencies actually devalued significantly relative to the basket of currencies. And then you also anticipate a lot of supply around the world. Because under normal situations, Rob, when the U.S. dollar strengthens, lets say under a normal cycle of U.S. dollar strength, and when there's a more balanced supply of crops around the world, they will still come to the U.S. for the crops. But so that's what, in my mind, that's what really changed this year. And I don't believe this is structural. I mean, this is temporary. I mean, we're going onboard to this cycle here. I do believe at some juncture, I mean, the U.S. dollar will correct itself. Timing to be determined, but I don't think this is a structural issue. It's a cyclical issue that we're going to have to manage through here."

I mean, I think we know what the domestic markets will be, so is expanding export market. Thankfully -- and the second is probably cut in rates domestically. And I think that as people -- we're seeing it ourselves. When we ran these things for yield, our cost position becomes better. So when you have thin margins, you want to be able to have your lowest cost position, your best cost position. And it's not necessarily through volume that you get that, and we have proven that in our own facilities. But anyway so those are the 2 main factors. In terms of growing exports, we do see places like India and China that are dealing with environmental issues due to smog. That -- how they are increasing the use of ethanol to fight their environmental -- their air issue, air pollution issue. So we see that demand growing. We see how demands have grown in China, and we expect for next year to be even bigger, so we expect 2016 net exports from the U.S. to be probably between 50 million to 100 million gallons higher than what they were in 2015, driven by all these 2 main markets."

With also a lot of customers focusing much more sometimes in cost reductions than in revenue enhancement opportunities. We are very pleased though with the way the customers have reacted to our value proposition, and we see that in the engagement that we have in our customers. So our expectations for the pipeline and the deliverance of synergy have not changed. Maybe it has changed a little bit the composition of that in the short term. I think if we're going to be talking in the year 3 of this, we probably be reporting a little bit higher cost synergies than we originally expected, and we will still be targeting the same amount or more of revenue synergies, maybe a little bit longer in the time line just because we continue to incorporate products to our product line and our value proposition. And that continues to open doors with customers, but the customer projects are normally a little bit slower or less in our control from a timing perspective and the cost synergies. But the response to customers to our value proposition has been very, very good. We have -- when we originally target this, Sandy, we had $94 million originally target in revenue synergies.

As currencies remain about where they are today, could we see additional downside pressure around the world just from places like South America, Eastern Europe, all the various countries that are concerned about deflation of their own currencies just planting more crops just because they need to get their hands on dollars versus the world needing more crops? So I guess my question is, could things get worse before they get better if currencies remain as is?"

There's --  the political factors are also impacting, presumably the Brazilian currency at this point in time. You also have to remember that in some respects, lot of these countries are getting a windfall right now in terms of the competitiveness of the crop because they've got the devaluation that occurred this year, yet the input cost was prior to the currency devaluing, so they were able to still get competitive input costs in terms of whether it be seed or chemicals. Now that's going to change as you go into 2016 because what will happen is they'll have to buy that at a higher cost because while this is actually denominated more in U.S. dollar terms. And so lot of these countries are going to have to grapple with higher input costs in terms of their grains, going forward, whether it be seeds, chemicals, et cetera, et cetera. So what to see? I mean, is the worst behind us? It's difficult to predict. What we do know is currencies go through cycles. And so from our perspective, we're going through a cyclical downturn with some of these currencies -- political influences have some impact. Our job is just to manage this, and we'll continue to focus on expanding our footprint in South America, as for example. I mean, we've made investments down there. And we're going to continue to manage our costs. The other factor, Ann, is really the balancing the global supply/demand of grains. And oftentimes, low prices solve a lot of issues, and so with the current low prices, expectations that you should see a lot more consumption around the world and that could probably help us in terms of the global supply/demand balance, which will also be important in terms of getting the situation back to normal."

We're seeing in the U.S. estimates are coming out that corn and soybeans will be 174 million acres, which is not demonstrably different from what it was last year. So I think the U.S. banks will probably have more to determine what -- how much farmers get to plant and that may have an impact on planting numbers. But it doesn't seem like these low prices have at least started to discourage production in the U.S. And then you've still got about 200 million metric tons sitting in China. They don't know what to do with it. I guess time with China would be -- with China, they have such poor storage that maybe it all just goes bad, which should be a good scenario. But can you kind of wrap-up your thought -- can you wrap-up your thoughts on global supply as we put all these factors together, South America, what the U.S. planting season might look like on the acreage? What China might do with their corn? We're putting a lot of variables in there, but this is really kind of a key to what I think is going to be a turnaround for your industry fundamentals."

The globe have increased their stocks this year in the tune of maybe 20 million, 25 million tons so the world is well supplied. And yes, China is sitting on inventory, so -- though we never know the quality of those inventories. So at this point in time, given that South America is probably not having any major threatening weather events, the U.S. seems to be forecasting a wet spring. And we have good soil moisture, so we'll probably expect that there continues to be ample supply going into next year. There has been some dislocations. We shouldn't forget El Niño created some problems and that's why we are exporting so much soybean oil to India, for example. Or we are exporting now more corn to South Africa because of the drought there. But probably, this is locations where regional in nature and didn't get to global levels. So at this point, in time, the scenario is for still plentiful supplies as we see forward."

As we kind of move through the year, I mean, clearly, you're going to have certain benefits there. As you would expect, we are going to start off slow in the first quarter. I mean, this is based upon the conditions that we end up at the end of December where ethanol margins have ended up. And I mentioned to you the high water impacts that we had in the Mississippi River that -- that will impact us in January, in the first quarter. We'll start off slower in the front half of the year. We'll start off slower in the first quarter and we expect some gradual recovery as we kind of move through the year. We will get accretion from the investments that we've made. We will get accretion from the cost reductions that we're doing. We'll, again, as Juan indicated, we expect the margin environment for ethanol should improve as we kind of move through the year. Again, that's going to be a variable that we're going to analyze very, very carefully. And so as you kind of look at how we think the year will play out, again, as Juan indicated, we do expect Ag Services to be a little better. We expect corn to be a little bit better. Again, a lot of it a function of where the ethanol margins for the industry end up in the back half of the year. We see -- oilseeds is based  upon the global crush margins right now to be worst off. And then WFSI should have a good year. So with all those puts and takes, I think we can make a judgment in terms of how we end up over all. But at least based upon what we see in terms of visibility, the front -- first quarter, front half will be tougher then what we think the second half will look like."

This morning, we reported fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.61. Our adjusted segment operating profit was $599 million. For the calendar year, our adjusted earnings per share was $2.60. 
Global dynamics reduced margins across the U.S. agricultural export sector, the U.S. ethanol industry and in the soybean crushing industry worldwide. Adverse market conditions that impacted many of our businesses earlier in the year continued through the fourth quarter. Despite the challenging conditions, we achieved 2015 adjusted ROIC of 7.3%, 70 basis points above our annual cost of capital, generating positive EVA. 
In the fourth quarter, we advanced our strategic plan by expanding our international corn-processing footprint with the acquisition of Eaststarch, progressing our destination marketing strategy with the announcement of the Medsofts Egyptian joint venture and strengthening our European Olenex refined oils joint venture. And today, we're announcing an investment in the controlling stake in Harvest Innovations, a leading producer of non-GMO, organic and gluten-free ingredients. 
From a portfolio management perspective, we completed the sale of our global cocoa business.
In addition, 2015 was the safest year in the history of ADM with the lowest level of recordable and loss time injuries. I'm pleased with how our discipline, focus and process improvements have translated to these safety results in 2015.
With current headwinds likely to persist, we'll remain focused on the areas within our control. We will continue to implement our pipeline of operational excellence initiatives, with an objective of an incremental $275 million of run rate savings by the end of the calendar year. As part of our -- of the evolution of our strategic plan, we're also taking a fresh look at the capital intensity of our operations and portfolio, seeking innovative ways to lighten up and redeploy capital in our efforts to drive long-term returns.
In 2016, our balanced capital allocation framework remains a priority, including a quarterly dividend rate increase of more than 7% to $0.30 per share and share repurchases of between $1 billion to $1.5 billion, subject to strategic capital requirements. With a strong balance sheet, we will also remain opportunistic for investments, especially bolt-ons in this more challenged macro environment. I'll provide more detail on our 2015 accomplishments as well as perspectives on 2016 later in the call.
Now I'll turn the call over to Ray."

Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.61, down 39% from $1 last year. We've been busy this quarter as we continue to manage our portfolio to drive returns, which has resulted in a larger-than-usual number of specified items.
Excluding specified items and also excluding net timing effects, adjusted segment operating profit was $599 million, down $529 million. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was negative 2% compared to 29% in the fourth quarter of the prior year.
Our reported tax rate was negative this quarter due to the low tax rates and the gains related to the cocoa and the Eaststarch transactions, together with a onetime favorable $66 million valuation allowance impact.
If we excluded specified items, the related tax impacts and the valuation allowance, the effective tax rate for the calendar year was approximately 27% in 2015, in line with 2014. The rate has been slightly lower than the recent historical tax rates due to a more favorable geographic mix this year in some favorable discrete tax items this year. For 2016, I would expect our tax rate to be in the 28% to 30% range.
Our trailing 4 quarter average adjusted ROIC of 7.3% is down 170 basis points from the 9.0% at the end of the fourth quarter last year. The 7.3% adjusted ROIC is above our 6.6% annual WACC for 2015 but below our long-term WACC of 8.0%, as reflected in the graph on Slide 20 in the appendix. Our objective remains to earn 200 basis points over our WACC.
In the fourth quarter, we did create value based upon our trailing 4 quarter average EVA, which was positive $173 million.
On Chart 18, 19 in the appendix, you can see the reconciliation of our reported quarterly earnings of $1.19 per share to the adjusted earnings of $0.61. For this quarter, we had gains on sales and revaluations of assets amounting to $0.70 per share, primarily related to the cocoa transaction and Eaststarch. We had charges related to impairments, restructurings and settlements amounting to $0.24 per share, the largest being related to our Brazilian sugar operations.
We also made an adjustment to Q4 adjusted earnings to reflect the reallocation of the biodiesel credits to the previous quarters when shipped of about $0.05 per share. And there are 2 tax adjustments in the fourth quarter: the valuation allowance impact of $0.11 per share that I mentioned earlier and the true-up of the quarterly tax rates to the calendar year adjusted rate of $0.03 per share.
Slide 5 provides an operating profit summary and the components of our corporate line. Before Juan discusses the operating results, I'd like to highlight some of the unique items impacting our quarterly results.
In the Corn Processing segment, we had $185 million gain on the revaluation of the company's previously held investment in Eaststarch, our former European joint venture with Tate & Lyle in conjunction with the acquisition of the remaining interest. This transaction closed in early November.
We also recorded impairment and restructuring charges of $102 million, primarily related to our Brazilian sugar operations.
In oilseeds, we record a $206 million of gains on sales of assets, primarily related to the sale of our global cocoa business. We also had impairment and restructuring charges of $34 million for various underperformed businesses within the segment.
In the corporate lines, net interest expense was down due to lower interest rates, and the favorable effects of the debt restructuring we effected earlier this year. Unallocated corporate costs of $89 million were lower than the run rate for previous quarters due to favorable foreign exchange translation, favorable people-related costs and some timing effects in 2015 spend, offset partially by higher project costs. 
I would also like to comment on our GAAP net revenue number that can be found in the appendix. GAAP net revenues for the quarter of $16.4 billion were down significantly from last year, driven by large declines in commodity prices and foreign exchange translation. But these factors also favorably impacted our cost of goods sold as our input costs were lower. 
Turning to the cash flow statement on Slide 6. We generated $2 billion from operations before working capital changes, lower than the prior year. Total capital spending for the year was $1.1 billion, up from the prior year's $900 million but in the lower end of our $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion capital spending guidance we provided earlier in the year. Given the more challenging business conditions we encountered in 2015, we're even more prudent in our capital spending.
We made acquisitions totaling $0.5 billion in 2015, which included AOR, the European bottle oil company; Eatem Foods; and the remaining interest in the Romanian port; and also Eaststarch. 
The other investing activities line of the cash flow statement mainly reflects the proceeds from divestitures, such as our global cocoa and chocolate businesses and the sale of our 50% stake in our port in Northern Brazil, plus the incremental investments we made in Wilmar or approximately $1.5 billion of net divestment proceeds.
During the year, we spent about $2 billion to repurchase shares, finishing up at the high end of our $1.5 billion to $2 billion target. Our average share count for the year was 621 million diluted shares outstanding, down 35 million from the time 1 year ago. At the end of the year, we had approximately 601 million shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis. Our total return of capital to shareholders, including dividends of almost $700 million, was more than $2.7 billion for 2015.
When I think about our capital allocation framework for 2015, if we take our operating cash flows before working capital plus the net divestment proceeds or approximately $3.6 billion in total cash flows, we spent about 30% of that amount on capital spending and returned about 75% of that amount to shareholders. This is in line with the capital allocation targets with a bit more tilted towards capital returns to shareholders in 2015.
Slide 7 shows the highlights of our balance sheet as of December 31, 2015, and '14. Our balance sheet remains strong. Our operating working capital of $7.1 billion was down $700 million from the year-ago period. Total debt was about $5.9 billion, resulting in a net debt balance that is debt less cash of $4.5 billion, up from the 2014 net debt level of $4 billion, in part reflecting the issuance this year of EUR 1.1 billion -- of euro debt or about $1.2 billion in U.S. dollar terms and the subsequent repurchase of about $900 million of U.S. debt. 
Our leverage position remains healthy with a net debt to total capital ratio of about 20%. Our shareholders' equity of $17.9 billion is $1.7 billion lower than the level last year due to the shareholder capital returns in excess of net income by $900 million and the cumulative translation account, which was down about $800 million due to the strength of the U.S. dollar. We had $6 billion in available global credit capacity at the end of December. If you add the available cash, we had access to $7.3 billion of short-term liquidity.
Next, Juan will take us through a review of our business performance."
251704,316347818,925101,"Archer-Daniels-Midland Company, Q4 2015 Earnings Call, Feb 02, 2016",2016-02-02,"Earnings Calls","Archer-Daniels-Midland Company","Executives","Thank you, Ray. Please turn to Slide 8. In the fourth quarter, we earned $599 million of operating profit excluding specified items, down from the $1.1 billion results from last year's strong fourth quarter. Operating conditions in the fourth quarter de",2080,"Thank you, Ray. Please turn to Slide 8. In the fourth quarter, we earned $599 million of operating profit excluding specified items, down from the $1.1 billion results from last year's strong fourth quarter. 
Operating conditions in the fourth quarter deteriorated from the already challenging conditions we faced earlier in 2015. After last year's large harvest around the world and with a strong U.S. dollar, a lack of dislocation significantly reduced U.S. exports and limited merchandising opportunities in Ag Services. 
In December, we saw further downward pressure on global soybean crush margins as a result of Argentine government policies. Also, the dramatic declines in crude oil prices impacted ethanol margins. As a result, full year segment operating profit was down nearly 21%.
Now I will review the performance of each segment and provide additional detail.
Starting on Slide 9. In the fourth quarter, Ag Services results were down significantly compared to last year's very strong fourth quarter, where we handled record volumes and had record exports from the large 2014 U.S. harvest.
In merchandising and handling, despite the large U.S. crop, low commodity prices limited grain movements, resulting in fewer merchandising opportunities. In addition, the strong U.S. dollar, along with ample global crop supplies, limited U.S. export volumes and margins. For perspective, Ag Services U.S. export volumes this fourth quarter were down about 20% compared to last year.  These declines were partially offset by improved performance and expanded reach of the ADM's Global Trade Desk. For example, in Argentina, we benefited from higher volumes and margins with the changes in the export taxes and the depreciation of the currency.
In transportation, lower U.S. export volumes reduced barge freight rates and volumes. High water levels in the Mississippi River system in the later part of December had some small negative impact on our transportation results for the quarter, but a greater impact will be felt in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
Milling and other again had another solid quarter. For the year, we generated $684 million of operating profits on an adjusted basis and below our historical levels. There were a number of factors that impacted our results, including a lack of global dislocations and the strong U.S. dollar versus the weakening currencies of other major crop-growing areas. This reduced both volumes and margins.
Please turn to Slide 10. Corn Processing results declined from the year-ago period. Sweeteners and starches continued to perform well, with low input costs and good demand. Results also were impacted by costs related to the ramp-up of commercialization at our plant in Tianjin.
Bioproducts results were lower as the steep declines in crude oil prices drove lower ethanol prices. This, combined with continued high industry production levels progressively reduced industry margins through the quarter. Our ethanol profitability reflects fourth quarter ethanol EBITDA margins estimated at around $0.18 per gallon. In addition, lysine operating profits were challenged by excess global supply, resulting in declines in pricing and margins; and some production outages in our plant.
For the year, sweeteners and starches performed well, with solid demand throughout the year in a well-balanced supply-demand environment for the industry. On the other hand, lower crude oil prices and high industry production levels created a challenging margin environment for the U.S. ethanol industry despite growth in U.S. domestic demand for ethanol, brought about by increasing U.S. gasoline consumption.
Slide 11, please. Oilseeds results were down in the quarter versus a very strong quarter 1 year ago. In crushing and origination, we saw declining global soybean crush margins throughout the quarter, as buyers anticipated a more competitive South American soybean meal entering well-supplied world markets following the presidential elections in Argentina. Ample global meal supplies, in combination with the strong U.S. dollar, further pressured U.S. meal exports. 
Brazilian origination results were lower as grain commercialized earlier in the year compared to the prior year. In addition, the very volatile real exchange rate in the fourth quarter slowed grain movement as well.
Refining, packaging, biodiesel and other was down in the quarter, and declining crude oil prices and weaker global demand pressured global biodiesel margins.  Cocoa and other results decreased, reflecting the sale of the cocoa business in October 2015.
Results from Asia fell from the year-ago period due primarily to nonoperating charges included in Wilmar's Q3 results.
For the year, there was a strong global and U.S. demand for protein. And as a result, our global oilseeds operations set the crushing volume record in 2015. However, with more ample global supplies of meal through the year in combination with the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, we saw our soy crush margin begin softening in the third quarter with a more substantial drop in the fourth quarter, caused in part by the impact of the Argentine policy changes.
Slide 12, please. In the fourth quarter, WFSI earned $47 million with positive contribution from WILD Flavors, SCI and Eatem Foods. As a reminder, the fourth quarter is generally the weakest quarter of the year for WFSI due to seasonality impact. These results helped offset declines in some of our legacy specialty ingredients businesses, where we saw weaker sales overseas and some ForEx hedging costs related to our Brazilian specialty protein project.
Since the WILD acquisition, the team has implemented about $40 million in annualized run rate cost synergies. We remain confident that the team will deliver EUR 100 million of run rate synergies from the WILD acquisition by the end of 2017.
And in its first full year as part of ADM, WILD Flavors contributed $0.10 of earnings accretion to ADM.
Now on Slide 13, I'd like to update you on how we're strengthening and growing our company. This is the scorecard we presented at the Investor Day in 2014. It lists the actions we were taking to help grow our business and our returns. We have highlighted some of the areas in which we have made significant progress in 2015. I'll discuss a few.
In Ag Services, for example, we've seen the benefits of our Global Trade Desk we created after we acquired Toepfer. We advanced our global ports strategy with actions in Romania and Argentina, and we're growing destination marketing with our Medsofts joint venture in Egypt.
In corn, we continued our geographic diversification in Europe with the Eaststarch acquisition and in China with the Tianjin sweeteners and soluble fiber plants and with the feed-premix plants.
In oilseeds, we sold our global cocoa and chocolate businesses, allowing us to improve forward returns. We created a joint venture to quadruple the size of our port in Northern Brazil. We acquired the AOR oil bottling business in Belgium. And ADM and Wilmar agreed to turn Olenex into a full-fledged joint venture, helping us to drive additional efficiencies into that business.
And in WFSI, we acquired Eatem Foods, a leading developer of savory flavors, adding deep expertise in savory flavors and ethnic cuisines. And this morning, we're announcing that we have reached an agreement to purchase a controlling stake in Harvest Innovations, a leading producer on non-GMO, organic and gluten-free ingredients that consumers are demanding in increasing numbers. We'll continue to update you on our scorecard progress each quarter. And over time, you should expect to see the result of these actions in improved earnings and returns.
Now before we take your questions, I wanted to offer some additional perspective as we look forward. The global macroeconomic situation has been extremely volatile. We continue to face headwinds related to currencies, crude oil, Argentine policy changes and a growing supply of commodities. Barring any material changes to the macro situation, we expect the environment in 2016 to be similar to the second half of 2015. Whatever the conditions, we remain focused on driving improvements in the business.
For Ag Services, we expect the strong U.S. dollar to continue through '16. The large South American harvest that's forecast would add to already strong global crop supplies, and Argentine exports will be more competitive in the near term following the recent policy changes. All of this presents continued challenges for our U.S. export business, though it will support our Argentine export business. We do expect an improvement from Ag Services in 2015 -- 2016, but it's not likely the segment will reach a historical operating profit range this year.
For corn, sweeteners and starches will benefit from the improved pricing environment, the flexibility at our wet mills, solid demand and low input costs. And Eaststarch will be accretive to earnings.
In ethanol, industry margins remain uncertain with low crude prices and high industry production levels.
While we continue our efforts to reduce costs at our corn dry mills, we are now also undertaking a study of the strategic options for those. We do expect overall corn operating profits to improve from 2015 levels, though this will depend on ethanol industry conditions in the back half of the year.
For oilseeds, with current global soy crush margin down significantly from 2015 levels, the continued strength of the U.S. dollar and with low crude oil prices impacting global biodiesel margins, we expect 2015 -- '16 to be lower than 2015. We continue to take actions to improve our oilseeds operations around the world.
For WFSI, with a robust pipeline, continued realization of synergies and accretion from recent acquisitions, we expect double-digit percentage growth in operating profit in the 15% to 20% range in 2016. We are pleased that WILD Flavors contributed to results in 2015 despite microeconomic and ForEx headwinds.
In this challenging environment, we remain focused on the areas under our control. We continue to execute our strategic plan to grow our earnings power, which will translate into stronger earnings when conditions normalize.
From a cost management perspective, we have made significant progress on our operational excellence initiatives. By the end of 2015, we had achieved more than $200 million of run rate savings. We continue to execute on our pipeline and substantive [ph] objective of $275 million in additional run rate savings implemented by the end of 2016.
As part of the continued evolution of our strategic plan, we are taking a fresh look at the capital intensity of our operations and portfolio. We will be seeking innovative ways to lighten and redeploy capital in our business. Unlike the Billion Dollar Challenge launched in 2012 where we look at unlocking value from noncore assets or from ways to wring efficiencies in working capital, now we are embarking on a multiyear program to examine which assets are underutilized or where the ownership structure could be more efficient, while maintaining an appropriate level of operational control.
In some instances, a partner may be able to help us better utilize the asset. We started this process by selling a 50% interest in our Brazilian port in 2015. We believe we can reduce the asset intensity in various businesses, which will help improve our long-term returns even in a more challenged operating environment. We have set a preliminary target of reducing the invested capital of our businesses by at least $1 billion over time.
In 2016, our balanced capital allocation framework remains a priority. In terms of returning capital to shareholders, we have announced a 7% increase in our dividend rate. Our board recognizes the importance of the dividend to our investors. We also plan to repurchase $1 billion to $1.5 billion of shares in 2015 -- '16, subject to strategic M&A opportunities. We believe the shares are a very attractive investment at current levels.
And through strong cash flow generation, monetization of assets and a strong balance sheet, we continue to look at the strategic growth opportunities. Our priorities are growing our geographic footprint and expanding our specialty ingredients business. With our strong balance sheet, we will be looking for opportunistic acquisitions around the world, including bolt-ons with investment decisions driven by hard look at the returns and inherent risks.
We continue to believe that by executing our strategic and capital plans, we can achieve a $1 to $1.50 per share of earnings improvement over the medium term, and we are encouraged by the fact that global demand for grains, oilseeds and proteins remains solid. What we don't know is when the macro and business conditions will improve, returning our earnings base to more normalized levels. And so we continue to focus on what we can control to grow earnings and create value for our colleagues, our customers and our shareholders.
With that, operator, please open the line for questions."

Grain movement continues to be slow, behind the pace of last year, as low prices are not incenting farmers to commercialize their crops yet. So movements of soybeans was obviously a little bit more brisk maybe in late Q4 and continue into Q1, mainly maybe due to farmer cash flows. We have seen in the past that U.S. ag stocks will be commercialized through the year, either through a strong demand for U.S. products, the cash flow need for the farmer or spikes in board [ph] prices. That's how we're seeing it right now. Right now we're seeing the farmers selling in board [ph] rallies. If you go to Brazil or Argentina, we've seen a strong dependency on what's happening with the currencies. We've seen in Brazil we have a day in which the dollar is $4.18, and we see a lot of farmer selling. It moved back to $4.11 or $3.97, and we see farmers selling slowing down. We see a little bit of that in Argentina. We saw a little bit more farmer selling of corn and wheat, a little bit less of soybean as the farmer maybe was not that happy with the reduction in export retention that they have over there. So still, I would say with these low prices subdued and customer -- or farmers will sell through rallies when they have cash flow needs."

So in the U.S., we have seen a big deterioration during Q4 and some deterioration also into January. And now we've seen the industry adjusting operating rates and things starting to ease off from the lows, if you will, that we hit in January. Obviously, this is the low season in the U.S., anyway, so there is a shift to crush margins into South America. South America still have an expanded crush margin because they haven't been -- haven't had the benefit of the harvest, but we'll get that soon in Brazil. Europe, we see it okay, kind of stable until maybe March, April and then we have the dynamics that we'd probably see more exports from South America. But also, we have the rapeseed harvest in Europe, and we have the ability so switch our assets a little bit between soybean and rapeseeds over there. So that's kind of what we see the evolution of crush margins at this point in time, Farha."

So we have asked the team to undertake a strategic review of that. They have an adviser helping them on that, and we're going to run through the different scenarios, all the way from one extreme to the other. We will explore all the scenarios. So we have no rush for this. We -- the whole operation is having positive cash flows, positive contribution, so there's no need to panic. We just want to be prepared, to look at the industry long term and see can this industry present the returns that we expect and what are the options to maximize our return for ADM. So there is not a clear time line or a clear direction on what we really want to see. We want to see the analysis or the option the team will bring. In the meantime, the improvements in costs continue, and we have seen in 2015 improvements in enzymes, improvement in yields, improvement in corn oil recovery. So we're very pleased with what the teams are doing in that. It's just we have an industry problem, and we want to see how we can participate in addressing those strategic options."

The next evolution in these is that we look at our -- the way we operate and we see we're very productive from a people perspective. We make north of $600 million of earning this quarter with 33,000 people, so we feel we're very productive from a people intensity perspective. When we look at the asset intensity, we don't feel that great about that. We think that there is still some ability to flex our assets a little bit better. That is the nature of the industry, which is, it has got some seasonality and you need to have some assets for some peak periods. But we have started to undergo an analysis of all our businesses and value chains. You have to realize, sometimes we keep assets that we think about them as cost centers, if you will. And we're trying to look at them more as businesses in itself and having to provide the return. So -- also technology is providing some tools. We have, today, software -- if I give you an example, ADM, because it's a large company, we have many, many warehouses around the U.S. and around the world. Today, we have software that allows us to look at the freight rates, look at the inventory needs and look at the number of warehouses and can provide a significant optimization to our warehouses network, if you will, that could end up in selling some of those properties. You mentioned some of the transportation. We do believe that we have a very tax efficient ownership of our transportation asset. But there may be aspects of that maybe in ports where we have opportunity to do something better. So again, this is a multi-year process and we're going to be looking at several parts of our operations, but we have looked at that with a target of about $1 billion, and we believe that it is a realistic target over time in looking at what I just described."

This year, as you know, we actually had a lot in terms of net divestment proceeds from the cocoa and chocolate business. As you know, those businesses were not really generating much profitability, they being extremely volatile. We actually believe that and we did some analysis that it actually is going to be positive towards our forward ROICs by divesting those businesses and taking the proceeds and we bought back shares to reduce our invested capital base. So that's going to be actually positive towards our ROIC, going forward. In terms of 2016, you asked about net -- what is the M&A divestment kind of look like. Generally, as you can -- as you expect, we are budgeting or planning CapEx around $1 billion for 2016. On the M&A front, we always have a little bit in terms of just bolt-on acquisitions, probably a couple of hundred million dollars. Net divestment proceeds divestitures, we achieved a lot already in terms of divestitures. And so at this point, I'm not planning for a large divesture number there. But in general, when I think about the impact of our recent M&As that we did in 2015, as an example, we did quite of few bolt-ons including the Eaststarch. Those have been accretive and will continue to be accretive to our earnings, going forward. It’s part of the -- our bridge towards a $1 to $1.50 of improvements. And if you recall, these types of strategic projects over a 3-year period will add probably around $0.30 a share towards our earnings power over a 3-year period when you kind of accumulate what we've already announced plus some of the projects that we're working on right now."

Domestic demand has increased because of low oil prices and high gasoline consumption. And export demand has been very good and we expect it to be even better through 2016. It's just a matter that the production in the industry has kept this industry margins very, very low and we are really surprised by that. We've been running our plants for yield, as I said before. We've seen improvements in our operations based on that, but this margin continues to be stubbornly low. So we want to analyze what happened at lower oil prices. What happened if these things recover. So we have an internal review to see the different scenarios and what do we do under those different scenarios.

If you compare last year with this year, last year, North America came into the export season with a big book of export on nontraditional destinations, which we didn't have this year. So I think that when I look at Argentina, the farmers selling in soybeans have been disappointing for what everybody was expecting. So crush has improved, but not that much, but I think it has created the expectation in a lot of the buyers that maybe Argentina will increase crush and will become a bigger player in mill worldwide. And maybe it was wise to wait a little bit and wait for all that to come to market. Again, it hasn't come yet. If you look at what crushing operating in Argentina is, it’s about 3 million tons per month, capacities maybe 4.5 million or something like that. We're still thinking about 40 million tons of crushing for next year, so we haven't seen the explosion. But I think it has been the psychological impact in all the buyers of nontraditional destinations for the U.S., so we continue to supply the traditional destinations to the U.S.. We have lost that ability to sell aggressively to nontraditional destinations, partly the U.S. dollar, partly the expectations that Argentina will come into that. So a long-winded answer to your question. It's probably yes, although not yet because of increased production, more for psychological impact of their ability to produce more."

Just -- there's different currency impacts that impact us. If you look at just pure translation impact, Rob, over the calendar year, I mean this is a classical accounting translation, translation impact on our operating profit was about a roughly $130 million negative impact for us, okay. So just pure currency translation. So, therefore, it was an impact that was not -- I would say that's not a dramatic impact. The bigger issue is really the competitive issue. And the competitiveness issue is really driven by not just the strength of the U.S. dollar, but also the fact that -- 2 other factors. We've got large crops around the world, right? So the fact that you got well supplied inventories of crops around the world had an impact. And then secondly, for the major crop growing areas, their currencies actually devalued far more than what the basket of currencies that the U.S. dollar is weighed against. So when you saw what happened this year, you saw the real because the political situation really depreciated. You saw the Argentine policy changes. You've seen what happened with Russia and Ukraine. So what happened was for the major crop growing areas, their currencies actually devalued significantly relative to the basket of currencies. And then you also anticipate a lot of supply around the world. Because under normal situations, Rob, when the U.S. dollar strengthens, let’s say under a normal cycle of U.S. dollar strength, and when there's a more balanced supply of crops around the world, they will still come to the U.S. for the crops. But so that's what, in my mind, that's what really changed this year. And I don't believe this is structural. I mean, this is temporary. I mean, we're going onboard to this cycle here. I do believe at some juncture, I mean, the U.S. dollar will correct itself. Timing to be determined, but I don't think this is a structural issue. It's a cyclical issue that we're going to have to manage through here."

And I think that as people -- we're seeing it ourselves. When we ran these things for yield, our cost position becomes better. So when you have thin margins, you want to be able to have your lowest cost position, your best cost position. And it's not necessarily through volume that you get that, and we have proven that in our own facilities. But anyway so those are the 2 main factors. In terms of growing exports, we do see places like India and China that are dealing with environmental issues due to smog. That -- how they are increasing the use of ethanol to fight their environmental -- their air issue, air pollution issue. So we see that demand growing. We see how demands have grown in China, and we expect for next year to be even bigger, so we expect 2016 net exports from the U.S. to be probably between 50 million to 100 million gallons higher than what they were in 2015, driven by all these 2 main markets."

So our expectations for the pipeline and the deliverance of synergy have not changed. Maybe it has changed a little bit the composition of that in the short term. I think if we're going to be talking in the year 3 of this, we probably be reporting a little bit higher cost synergies than we originally expected, and we will still be targeting the same amount or more of revenue synergies, maybe a little bit longer in the time line just because we continue to incorporate products to our product line and our value proposition. And that continues to open doors with customers, but the customer projects are normally a little bit slower or less in our control from a timing perspective and the cost synergies. But the response to customers to our value proposition has been very, very good. We have -- when we originally target this, Sandy, we had $94 million originally target in revenue synergies. We have built a pipeline of already $67 million to $70 million, and we have more than 700 projects in the pipeline.

Now that's going to change as you go into 2016 because what will happen is they'll have to buy that at a higher cost because while this is actually denominated more in U.S. dollar terms. And so lot of these countries are going to have to grapple with higher input costs in terms of their grains, going forward, whether it be seeds, chemicals, et cetera, et cetera. So what to see? I mean, is the worst behind us? It's difficult to predict. What we do know is currencies go through cycles. And so from our perspective, we're going through a cyclical downturn with some of these currencies -- political influences have some impact. Our job is just to manage this, and we'll continue to focus on expanding our footprint in South America, as for example. I mean, we've made investments down there. And we're going to continue to manage our costs. The other factor, Ann, is really the balancing the global supply/demand of grains. And oftentimes, low prices solve a lot of issues, and so with the current low prices, expectations that you should see a lot more consumption around the world and that could probably help us in terms of the global supply/demand balance, which will also be important in terms of getting the situation back to normal."

We're seeing in the U.S. estimates are coming out that corn and soybeans will be 174 million acres, which is not demonstrably different from what it was last year. So I think the U.S. banks will probably have more to determine what -- how much farmers get to plant and that may have an impact on planting numbers. But it doesn't seem like these low prices have at least started to discourage production in the U.S. And then you've still got about 200 million metric tons sitting in China. They don't know what to do with it. I guess time with China would be -- with China, they have such poor storage that maybe it all just goes bad, which should be a good scenario. But can you kind of wrap-up your thought -- can you wrap-up your thoughts on global supply as we put all these factors together, South America, what the U.S. planting season might look like on the acreage? What China might do with their corn? We're putting a lot of variables in there, but this is really kind of a key to what I think is going to be a turnaround for your industry fundamentals."

The globe have increased their stocks this year in the tune of maybe 20 million, 25 million tons so the world is well supplied. And yes, China is sitting on inventory, so -- though we never know the quality of those inventories. So at this point in time, given that South America is probably not having any major threatening weather events, the U.S. seems to be forecasting a wet spring. And we have good soil moisture, so we'll probably expect that there continues to be ample supply going into next year. There has been some dislocations. We shouldn't forget El Niño created some problems and that's why we are exporting so much soybean oil to India, for example. Or we are exporting now more corn to South Africa because of the drought there. But probably, this is locations where regional in nature and didn't get to global levels. So at this point, in time, the scenario is for still plentiful supplies as we see forward."

As we kind of move through the year, I mean, clearly, you're going to have certain benefits there. As you would expect, we are going to start off slow in the first quarter. I mean, this is based upon the conditions that we end up at the end of December where ethanol margins have ended up. And I mentioned to you the high water impacts that we had in the Mississippi River that -- that will impact us in January, in the first quarter. We'll start off slower in the front half of the year. We'll start off slower in the first quarter and we expect some gradual recovery as we kind of move through the year. We will get accretion from the investments that we've made. We will get accretion from the cost reductions that we're doing. We'll, again, as Juan indicated, we expect the margin environment for ethanol should improve as we kind of move through the year. Again, that's going to be a variable that we're going to analyze very, very carefully. And so as you kind of look at how we think the year will play out, again, as Juan indicated, we do expect Ag Services to be a little better. We expect corn to be a little bit better. Again, a lot of it a function of where the ethanol margins for the industry end up in the back half of the year. We see -- oilseeds is based  upon the global crush margins right now to be worst off. And then WFSI should have a good year. So with all those puts and takes, I think we can make a judgment in terms of how we end up over all. But at least based upon what we see in terms of visibility, the front -- first quarter, front half will be tougher then what we think the second half will look like."

This morning, we reported first quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.42. Our adjusted segment operating profit was $573 million. Global dynamics reduced margins across the U.S. agricultural export sector, the U.S. ethanol industry and in the soybean crushing industry worldwide. 
Challenging market conditions continued in the first quarter, particularly affecting Ag Services. Low U.S. export volumes and weak margins continued, and in the quarter, poor results from the global trade desk impacted results for Ag Services. 
Results for corn improved compared to the first quarter one year ago, led by strong performance in sweeteners and starches. For Oilseeds, global protein demand remains solid. However, first quarter results were impacted by weak global crush margins. 
WFSI results were in line with expectations. So while adjusted ROIC was below WACC on a 4-quarter trailing average basis, we expect to be above WACC for the full year. We continue to take actions to mitigate the impact of near-term market conditions. During the quarter, we continued to advance our strategic plan. We acquired controlling stake in Harvest Innovations, enhancing ADM's planned protein gluten-free ingredient portfolio. We announced the purchase of a corn wheat mill in Morocco that will further expand our global sweeteners footprints. We opened our new state-of-the-art flavor creation application and customer innovation center in Cranbury, New Jersey. And as part of our ongoing portfolio management efforts, we've reached an agreement to sell our Brazilian sugarcane ethanol operations. 
In addition, we achieved almost $50 million of run rate savings in the quarter and remain on track to meet our $275 million target by the end of the calendar year. We've repurchased about $300 million of shares in the quarter and paid dividends of about $200 million as we continue to execute on our balanced capital allocation framework. 
The first half of the year continues to present a challenging environment. However, we are cautiously optimistic that reduced South American soybean and corn production could bring improved soybean crush margin and merchandising opportunities in the second half of the year. I'll provide more detail on our scorecard progress later in the call. Now I'll turn the call over to Ray."

Slide 4 provides some financial highlights for the quarter. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.42, down from the $0.78 in the year ago quarter. Excluding specified items, adjusted segment operating profit was $573 million, down $319 million",790,"Thanks, Juan. Slide 4 provides some financial highlights for the quarter. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.42, down from the $0.78 in the year ago quarter. Excluding specified items, adjusted segment operating profit was $573 million, down $319 million. 
The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 25% compared to 29% in the first quarter of the prior year, largely due to differing geographic mix of earnings. Although it is still early in the year and our full year tax rate will largely depend upon a number of factors going forward, at this point, I would expect our tax rate to be at the lower end or below the 28% to 30% range that I mentioned in the fourth quarter earnings call. 
Our trailing 4-quarter average adjusted ROIC of 6.3% is 30 basis points below our 2016 annual WACC of 6.6%. Our objective for the full year 2016 is to earn an ROIC in excess for cost of capital despite the challenging operating environment that's likely to persist for the majority of the year. 
On Charts 18 in the appendix, you can see the reconciliation of our reported quarterly earnings of $0.39 per share to the adjusted earnings of $0.42 per share. For this quarter, we had asset impairment and restructuring charges of approximately $0.01 per share and LIFO charges of approximately $0.02 per share. 
Slide 5 provides an operating profit summary and the components of our corporate line. Before Juan discusses the operating results, I'd like to highlight some of the unique item impacting our quarterly results. There was nothing extraordinary in terms of unique accounting or special items in the offering lines to note this quarter. 
In the corporate lines, net interest expense was down due to lower interest rates and the favorable effects of the debt restructuring from last year. Unallocated corporate costs of $116 million were slightly higher than the year ago quarter due to asset impairment charges of approximately $11 million primarily from some software impairment. Going forward, unallocated corporate costs should be in the area of $120 million per quarter, as I have outlined in prior earnings calls. 
A minority interest in other with significantly and favorable to the prior year after absorbing $50 million for equity income losses or $0.08 per share after-tax book in this quarter and which was included in both reported EPS and adjusted EPS related to updated portfolio investment valuations in CIP, an investment joint venture that without since the late 1980s and in which ADM currently has a 43.7% equity interest.
Turning to the cash flow statement on Slide 6. Here's the cash flow statement of our 3-month period ending March 31, 2016 compared to the same period the prior year. We generated $557 million from operations before working capital changes in the quarter, slightly lower than the first quarter of last year. Total capital spending for the quarter was $180 million, down from the prior year's $244 million. Included in the other investing activities line is our increased investment in Walmart to a 20% level. 
During the quarter, we spent about $0.3 billion to repurchase of approximately 9 million shares. Objective remains to repurchase 1 billion to 1.5 billion of our own stock in calendar year 2016. Our average share count for the quarter was 597 million diluted shares outstanding, down 42 million from the same period one year ago. 
Our total return of capital to shareholders, including dividends, was about $0.5 billion for the quarter. We can see that there was a balanced use of cash between CapEx, M&A and capital return to shareholders in the quarter. 
Slide 7 shows the highlights of our balance sheet as of March 31. Our operating working capital of $7.7 billion was down $0.5 billion from the year-ago period. Total debt was approximately $6.6 billion, resulting in net debt balance of $5.4 billion, up slightly from the 2015 net debt level of $5.1 billion, in part, reflecting the issuance in June 2015 of the EUR 1.1 billion of your debt and the subsequent repurchase of $0.9 billion of U.S. debt. 
Our leverage position remains healthy with a net debt-to-total capital ratio of about 22%. Our shareholders equity of $17.9 billion was down from the $18.8 billion level last year, due to shareholder capital's returns in excess of net income by approximately $870 million and the cumulative translation account, also down about $80 million due to the strength of the U.S. dollar. We had $5.9 billion available global credit capacity at the end of March. If you add the available cash, we had access to over $7 billion of short-term liquidity. Our balance sheet remains solid.

Please turn to Slide 8. In the first quarter, we earned $573 million of operating profit, excluding specified items, down from the $892 million from last year's first quarter. Ag Services results were challenged by lower U.S. export volume",1787,"Thank you, Ray. Please turn to Slide 8. In the first quarter, we earned $573 million of operating profit, excluding specified items, down from the $892 million from last year's first quarter. Ag Services results were challenged by lower U.S. export volumes, significantly lower margins and unfavorable merchandising positions from the global trade desk. Results from corn improved in the quarter compared to the first quarter last year, led by strong performance in sweeteners and starches. 
For Oilseeds, results were impacted by lower global crush margins compared to an exceptional strong year ago quarter. WFSI was in line with expectations, half from the prior year with solid performance from WILD Flavors and higher results from specialty proteins. As a result, segment operating was down 36% versus the year ago quarter. 
Now we'll review the performance of fake segment and provide additional details. Starting on Slide 9. In the first quarter, Ag Services results were down significantly compared to last year's first quarter. In merchandising and handling, we continue to see a challenging merchandising environment for our Ag Services North American footprint. We saw weak U.S. export competitiveness, lower North American volumes and significantly reduced margins. In addition, we had a quarterly loss for the global trade desk compared to positive results last year. 
Losses from the global trade desk were caused in part by unfavorable merchandising positions. This were unrealized losses generated in part by the significant movements in prices at the end of March. In transportation, results declined due to low U.S. exports and high water conditions under Mississippi River system that drove lower large volumes and higher operating costs. 
Milling and others had a solid quarter, but the results were down due to lower grain and feed margins. Please turn to Slide 10. Corn Processing results were up slightly, led by results in sweeteners and starches, which performed well with an improved cost environment and strong capacity utilization. In addition, Eaststarch's results were up in part due to the consolidation of the results of the acquired operations in November 2015. Our own all mix joint venture also had a strong results in the quarter with solid sweetener demand in Mexico. 
Bioproducts results were down in the quarter due to tough lysine and ethanol margins. Ethanol margins continue to be driven by high industry production levels that caused inventories to build throughout the quarter. 
In April, we saw inventories came -- come down in the month as domestic and export demands remains solid and production levels slowed. This is due in part to seasonal maintenance programs of many plans in our industry. In addition, the continued overcapacity of the global lysine market negatively impacted results. 
While we expect this to continue through the second quarter, we are taking actions to further improve our lysine operations and are looking to stabilize the business in the second half of the year. Slide 11, please. 
Oilseeds results were down in the quarter versus an exceptionally strong quarter one year ago. Crushing and origination declined from last year's high levels. While global protein demands remain solid, global soybean crushing origination results were down significantly due to lower global margins resulting from increased Argentine soymeal exports. U.S. crush volumes were down primarily due to reduced U.S. mill exports. 
In addition, lower softseed crush volumes and weaker Brazilian commercialization that slowed throughout the quarter negatively affected results. Refined oils, package oils and biodiesel was down with stronger results from North America and Europe, partially offset by weaker results in South America. North American biodiesel demand was strong with the extension of the biodiesel credit to the end of the year. 
With the sale of the cocoa business in October 2015, results decreased $24 million compared to last year. Oilseeds results in Asia for the quarter declined due primarily to Wilmar's lower fourth quarter earnings. 
In April, we started to see improvements in soybean crush margins. While these movements create near-term negative mark-to-market implications for our positions in the second quarter, this improved crush margins, if sustained, should translate to better results in the second half of the year compared to the first half. Slide 12, please. 
WFSI results were up from last year and in line with our expectations for the quarter. We saw solid performance from WILD Flavors and higher results from Specialty Ingredients, including specialty proteins, folios and national health and nutrition products. Results included more than $3 million in operational start-up costs for the Tianjin Fibersol facility in China and the Campo Grande specialty protein complex in Brazil. 
With more than 900 revenue synergy projects identified, WFSI remains on track to achieve this 2016 targets. Only 2 months in, we're excited about what we see for Harvest Innovations. It's a great example of how you can flag the right bolt-on and drive results. We can leverage our internal origination strength, originate all the soybeans and contract the acres, yet benefits from the Specialty Ingredients components of WFSI. 
Harvest is in the nice business, quality facility and provides a great complement to our existing commodity network, yet allows us to feed our specialty business while building out our portfolio. 
We'll remain on track to achieve our 15% to 20% operating profit growth target for 2016. In the second quarter, we expect some modest underlying growth on a year-over-year basis and we'll continue to see some additional start-up costs. Our growth will be more concentrated in the second half based upon the pattern of new business and synergy realizations, the startup of Campo Grande, as well as of the avoidance of some unique, one-time costs incurred last year. Now on Slide 13, 
I'd like to update you on how we're strengthening and growing our company. We highlighted some of the early which we made significant progress recently. I'll discuss a few.
In Ag Services, we continue to grow our destination market and capabilities as we recently closed in April our Medsofts joint venture in Egypt. In corn, we announced plans to acquire a Casablanca Morocco-based corn wheat mill that produces glucose and native starch. The facility is the leading sweeteners and starch supplier in the country that should see substantial demand growth in the coming years. 
In the quarter, we also announced the agreement to sell our sugarcane ethanol operations in Brazil. And we are making good progress with a strategic review of our ethanol dry mill operations, which we announced in February. 
In oilseeds, we began a significant expansion and modernization of the CytoSport in Brazil, expanding annual storage and great handling capacity from 6 million to 8 million metric tons. And in WFSI, we acquired Harvest Innovations, a leading producer of non-GMO organic and gluten-free ingredients that consumers are demanding in increasing numbers. We also expect our Campo Grande soy protein complex in Brazil to begin ramping up production during the second half of the year. We have targeted plans to expand our business with existing customers and gain new customer business in this important region. 
In March, we opened our new WFSI state-of-the-art flavor creation application and customer innovation center in Cranbury, New Jersey. Also just 2 weeks ago, ADM celebrated the grand opening of the new headquarters of National Food Work Services, a full innovation center indicator Illinois. And we announced the launch of the food innovation challenge designed to inspire more entrepreneurs to develop and commercialize their food innovations in the Midwest. 
Together, these initiatives leverage the growth strengths of ADM and the flood ingredients strengths of our WFSI business. So these were just a few of the highlights from the quarter. We'll continue to update you on our scorecard progress each quarter. And over time, you should expect to see the results of all this.
So before we take your questions, I wanted to offer also some additional forward perspectives. As I indicated earlier, the first half of the year continues to present the challenging environment. And our performance in the first quarter reinforces that we have more work to do to focus on actions that we can control and which will make the company better in the long run. These actions include our ongoing focus on costs, lightening up the amount of capital in our business, additional geographic diversification and our continued efforts to move further downstream in the value chain. 
Separately, there are some new global development that make us cautiously optimistic as we look at the second half of the year. First, the heavy rain in Argentina is reducing the size of the Argentine soybean crop, creating a tighter soybean balance sheet that supports higher global crush margins. 
Second, dry weather in Brazil is also reducing the sides of the soybean crop and the stuff corn crop. Third, the U.S. dollar has stabilized against the currencies of other crop growing regions. And finally, the tighter soybean balance sheet is further supported by strong global protein demand. 
For Ag Services, the second quarter is a seasonal low-volume quarter. However, we are seeing a large North American corn crop get planted in additional questions, which supports larger production. With a reduced South American crop, this could bring added export volumes and merchandising opportunities in the later part of the third quarter and fourth quarter. 
For corn, sweeteners and starches, continues to benefit from the flexibly at our Web mills early demand and low costs. The integration of the Eaststarch acquisition is going better than expected, and will continue to help expand our global product portfolio and customer reach. 
The ethanol industry margins remained challenged, although domestic and export demand remains strong and inventories have started to come down recently. The second half of 2016 currently has the potential for a better pricing environment with a tighter supply/demand but the key driver will be future production versus demand. 
For oilseeds, in the second quarter, South America will continue to have more favorable supply economics. South America conditions are reducing global supply, creating a tighter global stocks to usage scenario. This, along with solid growth in protein demand, is creating a better margin environment for soybeans. This market events have the potential for a more modest improvement in late 2016. 
For WFSI, on trend items like clean label, GMO free, organic and natural all fit well within the ADM strategy and leverage the WFSI portfolio with our diverse product portfolio. With a diverse product portfolio, turnkey system solutions and more than 900 revenue synergy projects identified, we continue to build this business for the future and WFSI remains on track to achieve second half weighted 2016 profit targets. 
So thank you for joining us today. Slide 15 notes some of the upcoming investor events we will be participating. Now we will like to open for Q&A."

If you look at the oilseeds, we said that oilseeds, we were expecting a down year versus the strong 2015. And we still expect that, but as you described, we are more optimistic about the second half of the year, given some of the tightness in South America. In WFSI, we continue to be excited about the future of that business and we continue to be in line with our previous forecast of growing 15% to 20% year-over-year.

When our cautious look to Q2 and is mostly on Ag Services because when we think about it, part of that is second quarter is traditionally our lower export volume. South America becomes more competitive with the harvest. And in general, our exports, even in good time, they've been to drop about 20% from Q1 to Q2. So they become -- Q2 is the low margin. But also, even if the exports will increase a little bit, there's still ample capacity. And we don't foresee a big pickup in margins even if exports climb from these different levels. So we want to be mindful that it may look a little bit better volume into Q2, it may not be reflected completely in a significant pickup in margins. That's what our view at the moment."

I encourage you that in terms of the improvements, the $1 to $1.50 of earnings improvements that we're driving over the medium term, I am encouraged that we're still on track for those $1 to $1.50.

So when you take domestic demand plus the strong exports, we're thinking something in the range of 15 billion gallons, and maybe we think that the capacity is slightly above 15 billion gallons. So I think a lot will be determined by the strengths of these driving season we will not be heading into now with the summer and how the some of the producers react. I think that you have seen some of the shutdowns mostly due to planned maintenance in anticipation of the driving season that has cleaned up part of the inventory backlog that we have built over this year.

There is -- that there's software now that we can use to reduce shipments, to reduce storage. So -- and then there is the issue, the contribution of purchasing.

This morning, we reported first quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.42. Our adjusted segment operating profit was $573 million. Global dynamics reduced margins across the U.S. agricultural export sector, the U.S. ethanol industry and in the soybean crushing industry worldwide. 
Challenging market conditions continued in the first quarter, particularly affecting Ag Services. Low U.S. export volumes and weak margins continued, and in the quarter, poor results from the Global Trade Desk impacted results for Ag Services. 
Results for corn improved compared to the first quarter 1 year ago, led by strong performance in sweeteners and starches. For oilseeds, global protein demand remains solid. However, first quarter results were impacted by weak global crush margins. 
WFSI results were in line with expectations. So while adjusted ROIC was below WACC on a 4-quarter trailing average basis, we expect to be above WACC for the full year. We continue to take actions to mitigate the impact of near-term market conditions. 
During the quarter, we continued to advance our strategic plan. We acquired controlling stake in Harvest Innovations, enhancing ADM's plant protein, gluten-free ingredient portfolio. We announced the purchase of a corn wet mill in Morocco that will further expand our global sweeteners footprint. We opened our new state-of-the-art flavor creation, application and customer innovation center in Cranbury, New Jersey. And as part of our ongoing portfolio management efforts, we've reached an agreement to sell our Brazilian sugarcane ethanol operations. 
In addition, we achieved almost $50 million of run rate savings in the quarter and remain on track to meet our $275 million target by the end of the calendar year. We repurchased about $300 million of shares in the quarter and paid dividends of about $200 million as we continue to execute on our balanced capital allocation framework. 
The first half of the year continues to present a challenging environment. However, we are cautiously optimistic that reduced South American soybean and corn production could bring improved soybean crush margins and merchandising opportunities in the second half of the year. I'll provide more detail on our scorecard progress later in the call. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Ray."

Slide 4 provides some financial highlights for the quarter. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.42, down from the $0.78 in the year-ago quarter. Excluding specified items, adjusted segment operating profit was $573 million, down $319 million",787,"Thanks, Juan. Slide 4 provides some financial highlights for the quarter. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.42, down from the $0.78 in the year-ago quarter. Excluding specified items, adjusted segment operating profit was $573 million, down $319 million. 
The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 25% compared to 29% in the first quarter of the prior year, largely due to differing geographic mix of earnings. Although it is still early in the year and our full year tax rate will largely depend upon a number of factors going forward, at this point, I would expect our tax rate to be at the lower end or below the 28% to 30% range that I mentioned in the fourth quarter earnings call. 
Our trailing 4-quarter average adjusted ROIC of 6.3% is 30 basis points below our 2016 annual WACC of 6.6%. Our objective for the full year 2016 is to earn an ROIC in excess for cost of capital despite the challenging operating environment that's likely to persist for the majority of the year. 
On Charts 18 in the appendix, you can see the reconciliation of our reported quarterly earnings of $0.39 per share to the adjusted earnings of $0.42 per share. For this quarter, we had asset impairment and restructuring charges of approximately $0.01 per share and LIFO charges of approximately $0.02 per share. 
Slide 5 provides an operating profit summary and the components of our corporate line. Before Juan discusses the operating results, I'd like to highlight some of the unique items impacting our quarterly results. There was nothing extraordinary in terms of unique accounting or special items in the offering lines to note this quarter. 
In the corporate lines, net interest expense was down due to lower interest rates and the favorable effects of the debt restructuring from last year. Unallocated corporate costs of $116 million were slightly higher than the year-ago quarter due to asset impairment charges of approximately $11 million, primarily from some software impairment. Going forward, unallocated corporate costs should be in the area of $120 million per quarter, as I have outlined in prior earnings calls. 
And minority interest and other was significantly unfavorable to the prior year after absorbing $50 million of equity income losses or $0.08 per share aftertax book in this quarter and which was included in both reported EPS and adjusted EPS related to updated portfolio investment valuations in CIP, an investment joint venture that withheld since the late 1980s and in which ADM currently has a 43.7% equity interest.
Turning to the cash flow statement on Slide 6. Here's the cash flow statement for our 3-month period ending March 31, 2016 compared to the same period the prior year. We generated $557 million from operations before working capital changes in the quarter, slightly lower than the first quarter of last year. Total capital spending for the quarter was $180 million, down from the prior year's $244 million. Included in the other investing activities line is our increased investment in Wilmar to a 20% level. 
During the quarter, we spent about $0.3 billion to repurchase approximately 9 million shares. Objective remains to repurchase 1 billion to 1.5 billion of our own stock in calendar year 2016. Our average share count for the quarter was 597 million diluted shares outstanding, down 42 million from the same period 1 year ago. 
Our total return of capital to shareholders, including dividends, was about $0.5 billion for the quarter. We can see that there was a balanced use of cash between CapEx, M&A and capital return to shareholders in the quarter. 
Slide 7 shows the highlights of our balance sheet as of March 31. Our operating working capital of $7.7 billion was down $0.5 billion from the year-ago period. Total debt was approximately $6.6 billion, resulting in net debt balance of $5.4 billion, up slightly from the 2015 net debt level of $5.1 billion, in part, reflecting the issuance in June 2015 of the EUR 1.1 billion of your euro debt and the subsequent repurchase of $0.9 billion of U.S. debt. 
Our leverage position remains healthy, with a net debt-to-total capital ratio of about 22%. Our shareholders equity of $17.9 billion was down from the $18.8 billion level last year due to shareholder capital's returns in excess of net income by approximately $870 million and the cumulative translation account, also down about $80 million due to the strength of the U.S. dollar. We had $5.9 billion available global credit capacity at the end of March. If you add the available cash, we had access to over $7 billion of short-term liquidity. Our balance sheet remains solid. 
Next, Juan will take us through a review of the business performance. Juan?"

Please turn to Slide 8. In the first quarter, we earned $573 million of operating profit, excluding specified items, down from the $892 million from last year's first quarter. Ag Services results were challenged by lower U.S. export volume",1779,"Thank you, Ray. Please turn to Slide 8. In the first quarter, we earned $573 million of operating profit, excluding specified items, down from the $892 million from last year's first quarter. Ag Services results were challenged by lower U.S. export volumes, significantly lower margins and unfavorable merchandising positions from the Global Trade Desk. Results from corn improved in the quarter compared to the first quarter last year, led by strong performance in sweeteners and starches. 
For oilseeds, results were impacted by lower global crush margins compared to an exceptional strong year-ago quarter. WFSI was in line with expectations, up from the prior year with solid performance from WILD Flavors and higher results from specialty proteins. As a result, segment operating was down 36% versus the year-ago quarter. 
Now we'll review the performance of each segment and provide additional details. Starting on Slide 9. In the first quarter, Ag Services results were down significantly compared to last year's first quarter. 
In merchandising and handling, we continue to see a challenging merchandising environment for our Ag Services North American footprint. We saw weak U.S. export competitiveness, lower North American volumes and significantly reduced margins. In addition, we had a quarterly loss for the Global Trade Desk compared to positive results last year. Losses from the Global Trade Desk were caused in part by unfavorable merchandising positions. These were unrealized losses generated in part by the significant movements in prices at the end of March. 
In transportation, results declined due to low U.S. exports and high water conditions on the Mississippi River system that drove lower March volumes and higher operating costs. 
Milling and others had a solid quarter, but the results were down due to lower grain and feed margins. 
Please turn to Slide 10. Corn Processing results were up slightly, led by results in sweeteners and starches, which performed well with an improved cost environment and strong capacity utilization. In addition, Eaststarch's results were up in part due to the consolidation of the results of the acquired operations in November 2015. Our ALMEX joint venture also had stronger results in the quarter, with solid sweetener demand in Mexico. 
Bioproducts results were down in the quarter due to tough lysine and ethanol margins. Ethanol margins continue to be driven by high industry production levels that caused inventories to build throughout the quarter. In April, we saw inventories came -- come down in the month as domestic and export demands remains solid and production levels slowed. This is due in part to seasonal maintenance programs of many plants in our industry. 
In addition, the continued overcapacity of the global lysine market negatively impacted results. While we expect this to continue through the second quarter, we are taking actions to further improve our lysine operations and are looking to stabilize the business in the second half of the year. 
Slide 11, please. Oilseeds results were down in the quarter versus an exceptionally strong quarter 1 year ago. Crushing and origination declined from last year's high levels. While global protein demand remains solid, global soybean crushing origination results were down significantly due to lower global margins resulting from increased Argentine soymeal exports. U.S. crush volumes were down, primarily due to reduced U.S. mill exports. In addition, lower softseed crush volumes and weaker Brazilian commercialization that slowed throughout the quarter negatively affected results. 
Refined oils, package oils and biodiesel was down with stronger results from North America and Europe, partially offset by weaker results in South America. North American biodiesel demand was strong with the extension of the biodiesel credit to the end of the year. 
With the sale of the cocoa business in October 2015, results decreased $24 million compared to last year. Oilseeds results in Asia for the quarter declined due primarily to Wilmar's lower fourth quarter earnings. 
In April, we started to see improvements in soybean crush margins. While these movements create near-term negative mark-to-market implications for our positions in the second quarter, this improved crush margins, if sustained, should translate to better results in the second half of the year compared to the first half. 
Slide 12, please. WFSI results were up from last year and in line with our expectations for the quarter. We saw solid performance from WILD Flavors and higher results from Specialty Ingredients, including specialty proteins, folios and national health and nutrition products. Results included more than $3 million in operational start-up costs for the Tianjin Fibersol facility in China and the Campo Grande specialty protein complex in Brazil. 
With more than 900 revenue synergy projects identified, WFSI remains on track to achieve this 2016 targets. Only 2 months in, we're excited about what we see for Harvest Innovations. It's a great example of how you can flag the right bolt-on and drive results. We can leverage our internal origination strength, originate all the soybeans and contract the acres, yet benefits from the Specialty Ingredients components of WFSI. 
Harvest is in a nice business, a quality facility and provides a great complement to our existing commodity network, yet allows us to feed our specialty business while building out our portfolio. 
We'll remain on track to achieve our 15% to 20% operating profit growth target for 2016. In the second quarter, we expect some modest underlying growth on a year-over-year basis and we'll continue to see some additional start-up costs. Our growth will be more concentrated in the second half based upon the pattern of new business and synergy realizations, the start-up of Campo Grande as well as of the avoidance of some unique, onetime costs incurred last year. 
Now on Slide 13. I'd like to update you on how we're strengthening and growing our company. We've highlighted some of the areas in which we made significant progress recently. I'll discuss a few.
In Ag Services, we continue to grow our destination marketing capabilities as we recently closed in April our Medsofts joint venture in Egypt. In corn, we announced plans to acquire a Casablanca, Morocco-based corn wet mill that produces glucose and native starch. The facility is the leading sweeteners and starch supplier in the country that should see substantial demand growth in the coming years. 
In the quarter, we also announced the agreement to sell our sugarcane ethanol operations in Brazil. And we are making good progress with a strategic review of our ethanol dry mill operations, which we announced in February. In oilseeds, we began a significant expansion and modernization of the Santos port in Brazil, expanding annual storage and grain handling capacity from 6 million to 8 million metric tons. 
And in WFSI, we acquired Harvest Innovations, a leading producer of non-GMO organic and gluten-free ingredients that consumers are demanding in increasing numbers. We also expect our Campo Grande soy protein complex in Brazil to begin ramping up production during the second half of the year. We have targeted plans to expand our business with existing customers and gain new customer business in this important region. 
In March, we opened our new WFSI state-of-the-art flavor creation, application and customer innovation center in Cranbury, New Jersey. Also, just 2 weeks ago, ADM celebrated the grand opening of the new headquarters of National Foodworks Services, a food innovation center in Decatur, Illinois. And we announced the launch of the Food Innovation Challenge designed to inspire more entrepreneurs to develop and commercialize their food innovations in the Midwest. Together, these initiatives leverage the broad strengths of ADM and the food ingredients strengths of our WFSI business. 
So these were just a few of the highlights from the quarter. We'll continue to update you on our scorecard progress each quarter. And over time, you should expect to see the results of all this.
So before we take your questions, I wanted to offer also some additional forward perspectives. As I indicated earlier, the first half of the year continues to present a challenging environment. And our performance in the first quarter reinforces that we have more work to do to focus on actions that we can control and which will make the company better in the long run. These actions include our ongoing focus on costs, lightening up the amount of capital in our business, additional geographic diversification and our continued efforts to move further downstream in the value chain. 
Separately, there are some new global development that make us cautiously optimistic as we look at the second half of the year. First, the heavy rain in Argentina is reducing the size of the Argentine soybean crop, creating a tighter soybean balance sheet that supports higher global crush margins.  Second, dry weather in Brazil is also reducing the size of the soybean crop and the safrinha corn crop. Third, the U.S. dollar has stabilized against the currencies of other crop-growing regions. And finally, the tighter soybean balance sheet is further supported by strong global protein demand. 
For Ag Services, the second quarter is a seasonal low-volume quarter. However, we are seeing a large North American corn crop get planted in ideal conditions, which supports larger production. With a reduced South American crop, this could bring added export volumes and merchandising opportunities in the later part of the third quarter and fourth quarter. 
For corn, sweeteners and starches, continues to benefit from the flexibly at our wet mills, early demand and low costs. The integration of the Eaststarch acquisition is going better than expected and will continue to help to more expand our global product portfolio and customer reach. 
The ethanol industry margins remain challenged, although domestic and export demand remains strong and inventories have started to come down recently. The second half of 2016 currently has the potential for a better pricing environment with tighter supply/demand, but the key driver will be future production versus demand. 
For oilseeds, in the second quarter, South America will continue to have more favorable supply economics. South America conditions are reducing global supplies, creating a tighter global stocks to usage scenario. This, along with solid growth in protein demand, is creating a better margin environment for soybeans. This market events have the potential for a more modest improvement in late 2016. 
For WFSI, home-trend items like clean label, GMO free, organic and natural all fit well within the ADM strategy and leverage the WFSI portfolio. With a diverse product portfolio, turnkey system solutions and more than 900 revenue synergy projects identified, we continue to build this business for the future. And WFSI remains on track to achieve second half weighted 2016 profit targets. 
So thank you for joining us today. Slide 15 notes some of the upcoming investor events where we'll be participating. Now we will like to open for Q&A."

In corn, what we said that we will see improvements in '16 over '15, we are even more confident about that, given the strength of our sweeteners and starches and how the year is evolving. If you look at the oilseeds, we said that oilseeds, we were expecting a down year versus the strong 2015, and we still expect that. But as you described, we are more optimistic about the second half of the year, given some of the tightness in South America. In WFSI, we continue to be excited about the future of that business, and we continue to be in line with our previous forecast of growing 15% to 20% year-over-year.

South America becomes more competitive with the harvest. And in general, our exports, even in good times, they tend to drop about 20% from Q1 to Q2. So they become -- Q2 is the low margin. But also, even if exports will increase a little bit, there's still ample capacity and we don't foresee a big pickup in margins even if exports climb from these different levels. So we want to be mindful that it may look a little bit better volume into Q2, it may not be reflected completely in a significant pickup in margins. That's our view at the moment."

So when you take domestic demand plus the strong exports, we're thinking something in the range of 15 billion gallons, and maybe we think that the capacity is slightly above 15 billion gallons. So I think a lot will be determined by the strengths of this driving season we will now be heading into now with the summer and how the -- some of the producers react. I think that you have seen some of the shutdowns, mostly due to plant maintenance in anticipation of the driving season that has cleaned up part of the inventory backlog that we have built over this year. But we're still above -- 4% higher than inventories of last year. So although we are getting better at that, there's still a significant amount of product out there.

There is -- that there's software now that we can use to reduce shipments, to reduce storage. So -- and then there is the issue, the contribution of purchasing.

This morning, we reported first quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.42. Our adjusted segment operating profit was $573 million. Global dynamics reduced margins across the U.S. agricultural export sector, the U.S. ethanol industry and in the soybean crushing industry worldwide. 
Challenging market conditions continued in the first quarter, particularly affecting Ag Services. Low U.S. export volumes and weak margins continued, and in the quarter, poor results from the Global Trade Desk impacted results for Ag Services. 
Results for corn improved compared to the first quarter 1 year ago, led by strong performance in sweeteners and starches. For oilseeds, global protein demand remains solid. However, first quarter results were impacted by weak global crush margins. 
WFSI results were in line with expectations. So while adjusted ROIC was below WACC on a 4-quarter trailing average basis, we expect to be above WACC for the full year. We continue to take actions to mitigate the impact of near-term market conditions. 
During the quarter, we continued to advance our strategic plan. We acquired a controlling stake in Harvest Innovations, enhancing ADM's plant protein, gluten-free ingredient portfolio. We announced the purchase of a corn wet mill in Morocco that will further expand our global sweeteners footprint. We opened our new state-of-the-art flavor creation, application and customer innovation center in Cranbury, New Jersey. And as part of our ongoing portfolio management efforts, we've reached an agreement to sell our Brazilian sugarcane ethanol operations. 
In addition, we achieved almost $50 million of run rate savings in the quarter and remain on track to meet our $275 million target by the end of the calendar year. We repurchased about $300 million of shares in the quarter and paid dividends of about $200 million as we continue to execute on our balanced capital allocation framework. 
The first half of the year continues to present a challenging environment. However, we are cautiously optimistic that reduced South American soybean and corn production could bring improved soybean crush margins and merchandising opportunities in the second half of the year. I'll provide more detail on our scorecard progress later in the call. 
Now I'll turn the call over to Ray."

Slide 4 provides some financial highlights for the quarter. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.42, down from the $0.78 in the year-ago quarter. Excluding specified items, adjusted segment operating profit was $573 million, down $319 million",789,"Thanks, Juan. Slide 4 provides some financial highlights for the quarter. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.42, down from the $0.78 in the year-ago quarter. Excluding specified items, adjusted segment operating profit was $573 million, down $319 million. 
The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 25% compared to 29% in the first quarter of the prior year, largely due to differing geographic mix of earnings. Although it is still early in the year and our full year tax rate will largely depend upon a number of factors going forward, at this point, I would expect our tax rate to be at the lower end or below the 28% to 30% range that I mentioned in the fourth quarter earnings call. 
Our trailing 4-quarter average adjusted ROIC of 6.3% is 30 basis points below our 2016 annual WACC of 6.6%. Our objective for the full year 2016 is to earn an ROIC in excess of our cost of capital despite the challenging operating environment that's likely to persist for the majority of the year. 
On Charts 18 in the appendix, you can see the reconciliation of our reported quarterly earnings of $0.39 per share to the adjusted earnings of $0.42 per share. For this quarter, we had asset impairment and restructuring charges of approximately $0.01 per share and LIFO charges of approximately $0.02 per share. 
Slide 5 provides an operating profit summary and the components of our corporate line. Before Juan discusses the operating results, I'd like to highlight some of the unique items impacting our quarterly results. There was nothing extraordinary in terms of unique accounting or special items in the operating lines to note this quarter. 
In the corporate lines, net interest expense was down due to lower interest rates and the favorable effects of the debt restructuring from last year. Unallocated corporate costs of $116 million were slightly higher than the year-ago quarter due to asset impairment charges of approximately $11 million, primarily from some software impairment. Going forward, unallocated corporate costs should be in the area of $120 million per quarter, as I have outlined in prior earnings calls. 
And minority interest and other was significantly unfavorable to the prior year after absorbing $50 million of equity income losses or $0.08 per share aftertax booked in this quarter and which was included in both reported EPS and adjusted EPS, related to updated portfolio investment valuations in CIP, an investment joint venture that we've held since the late 1980s and in which ADM currently has a 43.7% equity interest.
Turning to the cash flow statement on Slide 6. Here's the cash flow statement for our 3-month period ending March 31, 2016 compared to the same period the prior year. We generated $557 million from operations before working capital changes in the quarter, slightly lower than the first quarter of last year. Total capital spending for the quarter was $180 million, down from the prior year's $244 million. Included in the other investing activities line is our increased investment in Wilmar to a 20% level. 
During the quarter, we spent about $0.3 billion to repurchase approximately 9 million shares. Our objective remains to repurchase $1 billion to $1.5 billion of our own stock in calendar year 2016. Our average share count for the quarter was 597 million diluted shares outstanding, down 42 million from the same period 1 year ago. 
Our total return of capital to shareholders, including dividends, was about $0.5 billion for the quarter. We can see that there was a balanced use of cash between CapEx, M&A and capital return to shareholders in the quarter. 
Slide 7 shows the highlights of our balance sheet as of March 31. Our operating working capital of $7.7 billion was down $0.5 billion from the year-ago period. Total debt was approximately $6.6 billion, resulting in net debt balance of $5.4 billion, up slightly from the 2015 net debt level of $5.1 billion, in part reflecting the issuance in June 2015 of the EUR 1.1 billion of euro debt and the subsequent repurchase of $0.9 billion of U.S. debt. 
Our leverage position remains healthy, with a net debt-to-total capital ratio of about 22%. Our shareholders' equity of $17.9 billion was down from the $18.8 billion level last year due to shareholder capital's returns in excess of net income by approximately $870 million and the cumulative translation account, also down about $80 million, due to the strength of the U.S. dollar. We had $5.9 billion available global credit capacity at the end of March. If you add the available cash, we had access to over $7 billion of short-term liquidity. Our balance sheet remains solid. 
Next, Juan will take us through a review of the business performance. Juan?"

In the first quarter, we earned $573 million of operating profit, excluding specified items, down from the $892 million from last year's first quarter. Ag Services results were challenged by lower U.S. export volumes, significantly lower margins and unfavorable merchandising positions from the Global Trade Desk. Results from corn improved in the quarter compared to the first quarter last year, led by strong performance in sweeteners and starches. 
For oilseeds, results were impacted by lower global crush margins compared to an exceptional strong year-ago quarter. WFSI was in line with expectations, up from the prior year with solid performance from WILD Flavors and higher results from specialty proteins. As a result, segment operating was down 36% versus the year-ago quarter. 
Now we'll review the performance of each segment and provide additional details. Starting on Slide 9. In the first quarter, Ag Services results were down significantly compared to last year's first quarter. 
In merchandising and handling, we continued to see a challenging merchandising environment for our Ag Services North American footprint. We saw weak U.S. export competitiveness, lower North American volumes and significantly reduced margins. In addition, we had a quarterly loss for the Global Trade Desk compared to positive results last year. Losses from the Global Trade Desk were caused in part by unfavorable merchandising positions. These were unrealized losses generated in part by the significant movements in prices at the end of March. 
In transportation, results declined due to low U.S. exports and high water conditions on the Mississippi River system that drove lower barge volumes and higher operating costs. 
Milling and other had a solid quarter, but the results were down due to lower grain and feed margins. 
Please turn to Slide 10. Corn Processing results were up slightly, led by results in sweeteners and starches, which performed well with an improved cost environment and strong capacity utilization. In addition, Eaststarch results were up in part due to the consolidation of the results of the acquired operations in November 2015. Our ALMEX joint venture also had stronger results in the quarter, with solid sweetener demand in Mexico. 
Bioproducts results were down in the quarter due to tough lysine and ethanol margins. Ethanol margins continue to be driven by high industry production levels that caused inventories to build throughout the quarter. In April, we saw inventories came -- come down in the month as domestic and export demand remained solid and production levels slowed. This is due in part to seasonal maintenance programs of many plants in our industry. 
In addition, the continued overcapacity of the global lysine market negatively impacted results. While we expect this to continue through the second quarter, we are taking actions to further improve our lysine operations and are looking to stabilize the business in the second half of the year. 
Slide 11, please. Oilseeds results were down in the quarter versus an exceptionally strong quarter 1 year ago. Crushing and origination declined from last year's high levels. While global protein demand remains solid, global soybean crushing origination results were down significantly due to lower global margins resulting from increased Argentine soymeal exports. U.S. crush volumes were down, primarily due to reduced U.S. mill exports. In addition, lower softseed crush volumes and weaker Brazilian commercialization that slowed throughout the quarter negatively affected results. 
Refined oils, packaged oils and biodiesel was down with stronger results from North America and Europe, partially offset by weaker results in South America. North American biodiesel demand was strong with the extension of the biodiesel credit to the end of the year. 
With the sale of the cocoa business in October 2015, results decreased $24 million compared to last year. Oilseeds results in Asia for the quarter declined due primarily to Wilmar's lower fourth quarter earnings. 
In April, we started to see improvements in soy board crush margins. While these movements create near-term negative mark-to-market implications for our positions in the second quarter, these improved crush margins, if sustained, should translate to better results in the second half of the year compared to the first half. 
Slide 12, please. WFSI results were up from last year and in line with our expectations for the quarter. We saw solid performance from WILD Flavors and higher results from Specialty Ingredients, including specialty proteins, oils and natural health and nutrition products. Results included more than $3 million in operational start-up costs for the Tianjin Fibersol facility in China and the Campo Grande specialty protein complex in Brazil. 
With more than 900 revenue synergy projects identified, WFSI remains on track to achieve its 2016 targets. Only 2 months in, we're excited about what we see for Harvest Innovations. It's a great example of how you can plug the right bolt-on and drive results. We can leverage our internal origination strength, originate all the soybeans and contract the acres, yet benefit from the Specialty Ingredients component of WFSI. 
Harvest is a nice business, a quality facility and provides a great complement to our existing commodity network, yet allows us to feed our specialty business while building out our portfolio. 
We remain on track to achieve our 15% to 20% operating profit growth target for 2016. In the second quarter, we expect some modest underlying growth on a year-over-year basis and we'll continue to see some additional start-up costs. Our growth will be more concentrated in the second half based upon the pattern of new business and synergy realizations, the startup of Campo Grande as well as of the avoidance of some unique, onetime costs incurred last year. 
Now on Slide 13, I'd like to update you on how we're strengthening and growing our company. We've highlighted some of the areas in which we made significant progress recently. I'll discuss a few.
In Ag Services, we continue to grow our destination marketing capabilities as we recently closed in April our Medsofts joint venture in Egypt. In corn, we announced plans to acquire a Casablanca, Morocco-based corn wet mill that produces glucose and native starch. The facility is the leading sweeteners and starch supplier in the country that should see substantial demand growth in the coming years. 
In the quarter, we also announced the agreement to sell our sugarcane ethanol operations in Brazil. And we are making good progress with a strategic review of our ethanol dry mill operations, which we announced in February. In oilseeds, we began a significant expansion and modernization of the Santos port in Brazil, expanding annual storage and grain handling capacity from 6 million to 8 million metric tons. 
And in WFSI, we acquired Harvest Innovations, a leading producer of non-GMO organic and gluten-free ingredients that consumers are demanding in increasing numbers. We also expect our Campo Grande soy protein complex in Brazil to begin ramping up production during the second half of the year. We have targeted plans to expand our business with existing customers and gain new customer business in this important region. 
In March, we opened our new WFSI state-of-the-art flavor creation, application and customer innovation center in Cranbury, New Jersey. Also, just 2 weeks ago, ADM celebrated the grand opening of the new headquarters of National Foodworks Services, a food innovation center in Decatur, Illinois. And we announced the launch of the Food Innovation Challenge designed to inspire more entrepreneurs to develop and commercialize their food innovations in the Midwest. Together, these initiatives leverage the broad strengths of ADM and the food ingredients strengths of our WFSI business unit. 
So these were just a few of the highlights from the quarter. We'll continue to update you on our scorecard progress each quarter. And over time, you should expect to see the results of all this.
So before we take your questions, I wanted to offer also some additional forward perspectives. As I indicated earlier, the first half of the year continues to present a challenging environment. And our performance in the first quarter reinforces that we have more work to do to focus on actions that we can control and which will make the company better in the long run. These actions include our ongoing focus on costs, lightening up the amount of capital in our business, additional geographic diversification and our continued efforts to move further downstream in the value chain. 
Separately, there are some new global developments that make us cautiously optimistic as we look at the second half of the year. First, the heavy rain in Argentina is reducing the size of the Argentine soybean crop, creating a tighter soybean balance sheet that supports higher global crush margins.  Second, dry weather in Brazil is also reducing the size of the soybean crop and the safrinha corn crop. Third, the U.S. dollar has stabilized against the currencies of other crop-growing regions. And finally, the tighter soybean balance sheet is further supported by strong global protein demand. 
For Ag Services, the second quarter is a seasonal low-volume quarter. However, we are seeing a large North American corn crop get planted in ideal conditions, which supports larger production. With a reduced South American crop, this could bring added export volumes and merchandising opportunities in the later part of the third quarter and fourth quarter. 
For corn, sweeteners and starches, continues to benefit from the flexibly at our wet mills, growing demand and low costs. The integration of the Eaststarch acquisition is going better than expected and will continue to help to mass [ph] expand our global product portfolio and customer reach. 
The ethanol industry margins remain challenged, although domestic and export demand remains strong and inventories have started to come down recently. The second half of 2016 currently has the potential for a better pricing environment with tighter supply/demand, but the key driver will be future production versus demand. 
For oilseeds, in the second quarter, South America will continue to have more favorable supply economics. South America conditions are reducing global supplies, creating a tighter global stocks to usage scenario. This, along with solid growth in protein demand, is creating a better margin environment for soybeans. These market events have the potential for a modest improvement in late 2016. 
For WFSI, on-trend items like clean label, GMO-free, organic and natural all fit well within the ADM strategy and leverage the WFSI portfolio. With a diverse product portfolio, turnkey system solutions and more than 900 revenue synergy projects identified, we continue to build this business for the future. And WFSI remains on track to achieve second half weighted 2016 profit targets. 
So thank you for joining us today. Slide 15 notes some of the upcoming investor events where we'll be participating. Now we would like to open for Q&A."

In corn, where we said that we would see improvements in '16 over '15, we are even more confident about that, given the strength of our sweeteners and starches and how the year is evolving. If you look at oilseeds, we said that oilseeds, we were expecting a down year versus the strong 2015, and we still expect that. But as you described, we are more optimistic about the second half of the year, given some of the tightness in South America. In WFSI, we continue to be excited about the future of that business, and we continue to be in line with our previous forecast of growing 15% to 20% year-over-year.

When our cautious look to Q2 and it's mostly on Ag Services, because when we think about it, part of that is second quarter is traditionally our lower export volume. South America becomes more competitive with the harvest. And in general, our exports, even in good times, they tend to drop about 20% from Q1 to Q2. So they become -- Q2 is the low margin. But also, even if exports will increase a little bit, there is still ample capacity and we don't foresee a big pickup in margins, even if exports climb from these depressed levels. So we want to be mindful that it may look a little bit better volume into Q2, it may not be reflected completely in a significant pickup in margins. That's our view at the moment."

Although, as Juan indicated, there could be some upside as it relates to where Ag Services and where oilseeds may end up in the fourth quarter with the impact of the South American harvest. And so, I guess, from my perspective, Farha, I think we're in the same ballpark at this point in time. I am encouraged that in terms of the improvements, the $1 to $1.50 of earnings improvements that we're driving over the medium term, I am encouraged that we believe we're still on track for those $1 to $1.50.

We've seen exports to China continues to be strong other than the traditional destination, because there's been a significant growth versus last year of China.

So when you take domestic demand plus the strong exports, we're thinking something in the range of 15 billion gallons, and maybe we think that the capacity is slightly above 15 billion gallons. So I think a lot will be determined by the strengths of this driving season we are going to be heading into now with the summer and how the -- some of the producers react. I think that you have seen some of the shutdowns, mostly due to plant maintenance in anticipation of the driving season, that has cleaned up part of the inventory backlog that we have built over this year. But we're still about 4% higher than inventories of last year. So although we are getting better at that, there's still a significant amount of product out there.

And obviously, with low energy prices, some of that shifted a little bit versus maybe what they used to be a couple of years ago. There is a lot going on also in terms of optimization of logistics. There is better software now that we can use to reduce shipments, to reduce storage. So -- and then there is the issue, the contribution of purchasing. And I will say the contribution of purchasing in reduced raw material cost and consolidation of supply and SKUs, that normally shows in oilseeds and in corn, where they both buy chemicals. So I would say, the operational 50%, 60% in corn, the rest is probably a split between corn and oilseeds, with the smallest part going to Ag Services, which is mostly a storage business, have less opportunities to improve cost of operations."

You had been at, I think, 28% to 30%. It's coming in lower. It sounds like it's more of a geographic mix as to where you're sourcing your earnings. Is there anything more to it than that?"

And so, unfortunately, with weakness in terms of U.S. ethanol margins and weakness in terms of U.S. Ag Services exports, the amount of U.S. earnings, relative to our total earnings, has come down. And that actually results in a lower tax rate. Now to the extent that in the back half, U.S. exports pick up dramatically beyond what we're expecting and to the extent that U.S. ethanol margins improve dramatically relative to what we expect, then that could actually drive our tax rate a little bit higher. But I guess what I'm saying right now is I think that we're going to be in the lower end of the 28% to 30% range and maybe even slightly below that range."

So the environment in the Agro industry and Ag Services changes every year. And with that, our business continue to adapt. And sometimes, we shift storage capacity.

This morning, we reported second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.41. Our adjusted segment operating profit was $573 million. After a challenging start of the year, general market conditions began to turn at the end of the second quarter, providing us with improved opportunities for the second half of the year. 
Wheat grain handling margins and merchandising results continued product services, results for corn, including the strong performance in sweeteners and starches, offset by lower ethanol results. Our oilseeds operations leverage their flex capacity to quash record volumes of soybeans in the second quarter as global protein demand continues to grow. WFSI saw strong growth in flavors and systems with operating profit in line with the year ago quarter.
During the quarter, we continued to advance our strategic plan, acquiring full ownership of Amazon Flavors, a leading Brazilian manufacturer of natural extracts, emulsions and compounds. We added soybean crushing capability to our facility in Strawvine Germany, allowing us to utilize flex capacity while also meeting customer demand for non-GMO soybean meal and oil in Western Europe. 
We continue to invest in Asia's growing and evolving foot demand by further increasing our strategic ownerships, taking Wilmar from 20% to 22%. In addition, we continue to make progress in the strategic review of our ethanol dry mills. We have implemented almost $150 million of new run rate savings actions in the first half of the year and remain on track to meet our $275 million target by the end of the calendar year.
Also, we repurchased about $500 million of shares in the first half as we continue to execute on our balanced capital location framework. The first half of the year was very challenging. However, with improved fundamentals, we anticipate a more favorable second half of the year.

Excluding specified items, adjusted segment operating profit was $573 mi",1016,"Thanks, Juan. Good morning, everyone. Slide 4 provides some financial highlights for the quarter. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.41, down from the $0.60 in the year ago quarter. Excluding specified items, adjusted segment operating profit was $573 million, down $151 million. 
The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 29%, compared to 27% in the second quarter of the prior year, largely due to a $20 million of unique discrete tax items in the quarter that negatively impacted our effective tax rate, as well as our second quarter EPS by approximately $0.03 per share. Note, we did not impact our adjusted EPS for these $0.03 of discrete tax items. Although our full year tax rate will largely depend on a number of factors going forward, at this point, I would expect our calendar year tax rate to be about 28%.
Our strong 4 quarter average adjusted ROIC of 5.7% is 90 basis points below our 2016 annual WACC of 6.6%. Our objective for the full year 2016 remains to earn an ROIC equal to or in excess of our cost of capital. On Chart 18 of the appendix, you can see the reconciliation of a reported quarterly earnings of $0.48 per share to the adjusted earnings of $0.41 per share. For this quarter, we had gains on sales or asset revaluations at $0.17 per share, asset impairments of approximately $0.01 per share and LIFO charges of approximately $0.09 per share.
Slide 5 provides an operating profit summary in the components of our corporate line. I'd like to highlight some of the unique items impacting our quarterly results. 
In the Ag Services segment, there was a net gain of $43 million, reflecting the collection of the final deferred proceeds from the sale of Gruma shares in 2012, offset by some small impairment charges. In the Corn Processing segment, there was a net gain of $63 million related to sale of our Brazilian sugar assets, partially offset by $6 million of small impairment charges. 
In Oilseeds Processing, we did not have any material items that impacted adjusted EPS. Over the course of the second quarter, we did have unprecedented volatility in the soybean crush margins. Early in the second quarter, we had expected the run-up in the board crush margins to have a significant negative mark-to-market impact on our second quarter results. In June, however, margins fell dramatically and the net impact from a mark-to-market perspective ended up being minimal for the second quarter. We did have some negative accounting effects related to softseed crush and biodiesel hedges, and the these negative impacts should reverse themselves in the second half of the calendar year.
As a reminder, the results of the equity earnings of Wilmar are reported by ADM on a 1-quarter lag basis. To note, Wilmar issued a profit warning in the middle of July announcing that it expects to report net losses of approximately $230 million for its second quarter. As a result, we expect to pick up about $50 million of equity losses in our third quarter results compared to the prior consensus estimates of about $50 million of equity earnings for the third quarter or about $100 million swing in ADM's expected third quarter results.
The tax rate we applied to Wilmar equity earnings is 0%. Hence, the EPS impact of this $100 million swing will be about a negative $0.17 per share for our third quarter. In WFSI, there was a $12 million revaluation gain related to our acquisition of the remaining interest in the wild Amazonas joint venture. In the corporate lines, net interest expense was down due to lower interest rates, the favorable effects of the debt restructuring from last year and the revaluation of our liability to purchase the remaining stake in Harvest Innovations. Unallocated corporate costs of $160 [ph] million were down from the year ago quarter, primarily due to strong cost management.
Turning to cash flow statement on Slide 6. Here's the cash flow statement for the 6 months ending June 30, 2016, compared to the same period to prior year. We generate over $1 billion from operations before working capital changes in the first half, slightly lower than the first half of last year. 
Total capital spending for the first half was $396 million, down from the prior year's $540 million. Capital spending has been lower during this more challenging first half of the year. Acquisitions of $120 million during the first half of 2016 include Harvest Innovations and WFSI, Medsofts in Ag Services and Morocco in Corn Processing. Included in the other investing activities line is our increased investment in Wilmar to a 22% level. 
During the first half of 2016, we spent about $487 million to repurchase approximately 13.5 million shares of ADM. Our objective remains to repurchase $1 billion to $1.5 billion of our own stock in calendar year 2016. Our average share count for the first half of the year was 594 million diluted shares. Our total return of capital to shareholders, including dividends, was about $800 million for the first half of the year.
We can see that there was a balanced use of cash between CapEx, M&A and capital return to shareholders. Slide 7 shows the highlights of our balance sheet as of June 30. Our operating working capital of $8.2 billion was down $0.1 billion from the year-ago period. Total debt was approximately $7.4 billion, resulting in net debt balance of $6.7 billion, up from the 2015 net debt level of $5.7 billion. Our leverage position remains healthy with a net debt-to-total capital ratio of about 27%. 
Our shareholders equity of $17.7 billion was down from the $18.6 billion level last year due primarily to capital returns in excess of net income and a decrease in the cumulative translation account. We had $4.9 billion in available global credit capacity at the end of June if you had available cash with access to $5.6 billion of short-term liquidity. Our balance sheet remains very, very solid. Next, Juan will take us through a review of the business performance. Juan?"

Please turn to Slide 8. In the second quarter, we earned $573 million of operating profit, excluding specified items, down from the $724 million from last year's second quarter.

In the second quarter, we earned $573 million of operating profit, excluding specified items, down from the $724 million from last year's second quarter. In Ag Services, wheat grain handling margins and merchandising results continue. Results for corn were down slightly compared to the second quarter last year with continued strong performance in sweeteners and starches, offset by weaker bioproducts results. With continued strong global protein demand, our oilseeds operations were able to utilize flex capacity to crush record volumes of soybeans in the quarter. Excluding the start-up items, WFSI operating profit results were in line with the year ago quarter. As a result, adjusted segment operating profit was flat versus last quarter and down 21% versus the year ago quarter.
Late in the quarter, market conditions began to turn lining up a more favorable outlook for the second half. Now I will review the performance of each segment and provide additional detail.
Starting on Slide 9. We indicated last quarter that Ag Services in the second quarter will be challenged. And as it turned out, adjusted results were down significantly compared to one year ago due to compressed U.S. grain handling margins. In the U.S, we saw limited merchandising warehousing and storage opportunities due to reduced grain carriage. International merchandising results remained weak overall, but were up versus one year ago, due to the strong origination results in Argentina and the addition of destination market in Egypt through our Medsofts joint venture. Net timing effects did not have a material impact on results.
In transportation, results declined due to weak barge demand and lower freight rates. In Milling and other, ADM milling had a strong second quarter driven by product margins and merchandising results. Please turn to Slide 10. 
Corn Processing results were up sequentially, but down slightly versus the second quarter last year. Sweeteners and starches result were higher as the business continued to perform well with higher volumes and pricing and improved margins from optimizing further grain in our corn wheat mills. In addition, the integration of the recent Eaststarch and Morocco acquisitions have gone better than planned, contributing to our global sweeteners and starches portfolio and results.
Bioproducts results were down in the quarter. With high industry ethanol inventory levels coming into the quarter, we decreased production. While ethanol margins have improved modestly and demand for both domestic consumption and exports continued to be strong, margins remain very volatile and extremely sensitive to industry production grades and inventory levels.
Lysine results continue to be pressured by large global production, particularly early in the quarter. However, results improved in June as global inventories declined and strong demand continue. Slide 11, please. 
Oilseeds results were solid for the second quarter, but were down versus a strong quarter one year ago. Crushing and origination declined from last year's high levels, primarily due to weak canola margins, as well as lower soy crush margins, which were historically high last year. Strong global demand for protein mill and the continued weak economics for softseed allowed us to flex the capacity of our end market crush plants in Europe. This added positive contributions to our network and allowed our North American and European crush operations to set new second quarter soy crush volume records.
During the quarter, the team effectively managed unprecedented ball crush movements that were caused by South American crop uncertainty. By the end of the quarter, supply demand fundamental stabilized crush margins. Earlier in the quarter, we had expected significant soybean crush negative mark-to-market impacts for the second quarter, due to significant increase in board margins. But the actual net income turned out to be quite minimal as board crush margins fell in June.
Refining, packaging, biodiesel and other results were down from one year ago, mainly due to negative biodiesel timing effects despite strong results in Specialty Fats and Oils and Golden Peanut. oilseeds results in Asia for the quarter improved partially due to Wilmar's first quarter errands. As Ray indicated earlier, Wilmar has issued a second quarter profit warning in July that we expect will have a negative impact for the ADM's third quarter results.
On Slide 12. Excluding start-up costs, WFSI results were in line with the second quarter last year with a strong growth in flavors and systems, offset by a slower separate individual included in sales. In the quarter, we added to our ingredient capabilities in South America with a full ownership acquisition of Amazon Flavors, a leading Brazilian manufacturer of natural extracts, emulsions and compounds. This gives us the full capability of flavors and systems in Brazil, with boots on the ground to develop systems and provide customers with rapid prototype delivery to meet local taste. Results included about $4 million in operational startup costs for DNG and Campo Grande. We expect WILD Flavors to have an extremely strong second half of the year, which should result in year-over-year operator profit growth of more than 20%.
However, continuing challenges with some of our legacy ingredients businesses, demand factors in the case of hydro, near-term pricing pressures in the case of fibers and some inventory management issues at SCI, will limit overall WFSI segment operating profit growth this calendar year to lower double-digit percentages. Now on Slide 13, I'd like to update you on how we're strengthening our -- and growing our company. We've highlighted some of the areas in which we made significant progress recently. I'll discuss a few.
In Ag Services, in the second quarter, we started operations in our Medsofts' joint venture in Egypt as we continue to expand our distribution value chain through our destination marketing capabilities and an asset light approach. The Medsofts joint venture help us -- helps us diversify and expand our merchandising footprint, grow our logistics services and gets us closer to our customers as we deliver products directly to them. 
In corn, we completed the sale of our sugarcane ethanol operations in Brazil. We began operation of our Casablanca Morocco-based corn wheat mill as we continue to expand the geographic footprint of our sweeteners and starches business. We expanded our sweetener portfolio by entering into a partnership to offer low-calorie, non-GMO stevia and monk fruit ingredients. Within our animal nutrition business, we introduced new products and announced plans to expand and modernize facilities. In our lysine business, we made progress -- process improvements that should improve yields in the second half of the year. And we are advancing on the strategic review of our ethanol dry mills assets. 
We have made management presentations to 7 parties that have indicated interest in our dry mill assets. We will await all the proposals to determine what is the best value maximizing strategy for ADM. We anticipate receiving bids back by the end of August, and we'll then evaluate and determine our next steps in the process. 
In oilseed, we completed the canola crush expansion project at our plant in Windsor, Canada, and we added soybean crushing capacity at our facility in Istro, Germany, allowing us to meet customer demand for non-GMO soybean mean and oil in Western Europe. And in WFSI, we built out additional synergy projects and now have more than 1,300 project in the pipeline. Our latest forecast for the end of 2017 is shifting to about 2/3 cost synergies and 1/3 revenue synergies due to revenue synergies taking a little longer to realize.
We added to our ingredient capabilities in South America with a full ownership acquisition of Amazon Flavors, and we have another productive higher fee just a week, a few weeks ago, highlighting recent additions in SCI, Eatem Foods and Harvest Innovations. Together, we show taste of industries progress and deepest ingredient portfolio, giving customers access to innovative products, extensive technical expertise and best-in-class service.
These are just a few of the highlights from the quarter. We'll continue to update you on our progress each quarter. And over time, you should expect to see the results of this. Before we take your questions, I wanted to offer some additional forward perspectives. 
As I indicated earlier, both the second quarter and the the first half of the year were challenging. Throughout this period, we continued our ongoing focus on costs. And importantly, we continue to execute on our strategy, which includes additional geographic diversification and moving further downstream in the value chain. Now looking ahead, with recent improved market dynamics, we anticipate better opportunities.
The outlook for the large U.S. crop and some of our U.S. businesses experiencing the margin conditions creates a platform for a more favorable environment in the second half of the year and some optimism as we start to move into early 2017. For Ag Services, current U.S. crop conditions indicate the growing season is progressing very well. This is expected to translate into improved export volumes and margins, higher utilization of our transportation network and better merchandising and handling opportunities for the second half of the year.
For corn, the strategy and flexibility of our wheat mills, along with continued operational excellence achievements and high capacity utilization rates, should support improved margins for our sweeteners and starches business for the second half of the year. Into the future, as global sweeteners and starch demand continues to grow, our product and footprint expansions will provide diversification of both geography and starch sources to help maximize cost positions and drive value creation.
Ethanol margins have improved since the beginning of the year and the forward demand environment from domestic consumption and exports would appear favorable. However, the future margin environment will remain dependent upon industry production levels relative to demand and the result in inventory levels. We have seen this inventory to margins relationships over the years, and we have seen the margins being somewhat volatile as well.
In oilseeds, the outlook for the second half of the year has improved due to continued strong global protein demand, leveraging our flex capacity and improved crush margins. Looking ahead, on Trent, complex consumer demands are creating value for our oils portfolio and oilseeds network. For WFSI, increasing the ratio in natural health and nutritional products and leveraging our industry leadership in plant-based proteins, founders and specialty grains are all are positive supports for the future progress of WFSI. With organic growth, synergy execution and small bolt-on M&A, we continue to build this business for the future. 
With that, operator, please open the line for questions."

We expect in the same area that the Asian market can continue to increase for us, the impact of that, and we expect an even more impact in 2017. Milling volumes normally get into our high season in Q3. So we expect another pickup from there. And in general, transportation results are expected to improve or increase loads some higher freight rates. We expect southbound volume broil increase in the range of 30% in Q3. So all in all, we are optimistic by the picture we are seeing in Ag Services after many months of subdued performance, if you will."

And obviously, China is the second largest market of ethanol in the world. And we have seen there, both in China and in India, the export -- the imports picking up. And that has been a boost, obviously, for U.S. exports. Your concerns are probably given by the change in corn policy in China and to what extent that will reduce the imports. We believe in that range in the 850 to 900 million. We continue to see other markets coming on again strongly, like India. We believe China may or may not reduce there. We believe China that will be there. We believe Mexico will join. So in general, we feel strongly about it. And we could argue China may dedicate some of that corn to make ethanol. But also, there are questions about the quality of those reserves and how much of that can actually be returning to ethanol. So again, when we look at the forecast and without having a significant amount of China exports in the second half, we believe into the -- in the 850 to 900 million-gallon range for net exports for the U.S."

I mean, the way we kind of look at it this year, second half compared to the, let's say, the second half of last year, I mean, there are several variables that have moved in our favor. And first of all, the U.S. dollar actually has stabilized compared to where we were last year. In fact, you've seen that relative to what other crop growing regions, the dollar has actually become a lot more competitive. And that's a favorable factor for Ag Services as we look towards exports in the back half of the year. And frankly, that's being reflected in terms of elevation markets, forward elevation margins that we're seeing right now compared to what we saw last year. And secondly, if you recall, last year, there was a this overhang regarding Argentina. Remember, and margin the second half of there, there was a lot of concern that with the change in the government, that there was to be a flood of Argentinean products entering will markets, and that actually depressed margins significantly. What we've seen this year is in fact due to some weather issues down Argentina and Brazil, this overhang doesn't exist. In fact, a lot of the surplus corn and wheat that was in Argentina, actually moved to the world markets already. And hence, you don't have the Argentine overhang. And that's going to be favorable in terms of how U.S. experts going to look like. I mean, thirdly, global demand remains very, very strong in terms of what we're seeing, in terms of demand factors. And then as I indicate, there has been, due to weather factors, shortages that have occurred other South America that actually helped in terms of global supply demand balance that we're seeing right now, and that's of favorable with respect to U.S. exports in the back half of the year. Then lastly, you take a look at the U.S. crop, maybe -- the USDA numbers are very, very healthy. But I mean, expectations are that potentially crop could actually be bigger than what the USDA is predicting. So the supply environment and the opportunity look for basis opportunities in the U.S. to actually becomes a lot real as we move into the back half of this year compared to where we were last year. So in general, that's the reason why we're seeing a lot more optimism, particularly for the Ag Services division as we move into the back half of this year compared to where we were last year."

So at this point in time, we will continue to take rate that whether we run for yield, as I described some time, or we'll run for volume, I think that given the volatility of the ethanol results would probably always keep an eye on running full yield.

Hydrocolloid's goal like about half of it to food applications, and that continues to go very well. But about half of it goes to drilling fluids. And as you can read, the industry had basically reduced significantly the drilling in the U.S. So that market has been significantly impacted. So nothing to do with our food strategy, if you will, but it happens that we'll reported in that segment. The second is related to fibers. The fibers market has a little of over capacity. So prices have been soft there and we have more competition. And one of the businesses that we acquired, SCI, have had some issues with inventory that we needed to write off or sell it at a discount because it might not have been integrated of conditions. So all those 3 things basically impacted the WFSI business. On the other hand, WILD Flavors is growing significantly and is going to post growth, so it's about 20% year-over-year on the -- basically, on innovations that is happening at a customer level. So when we talk about the revenue synergies being a little bit slow, it's because obviously, you need to, first of all, you need to think about how to combine all these products into a new solution. And then you create the prototypes and then you present those to the customer and the customers great the marketing campaign and also look at the potential for that product and look at the stability of those products. So that approval process takes a little bit longer, especially in some of the companies that are very much focusing nowadays on costs, on productivity, and it may not have that many people to take care of these products. So that's why we try to ramp up a little bit more of the cost synergies to make sure we don't fall behind in our promises. But as I said, the WILD Flavors business is going strong and having again probably a 20% increase in profits versus already a record year like it was 2015. So we are extremely proud of the business."

This morning, we reported second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.41. Our adjusted segment operating profit was $573 million. After a challenging start of the year, general market conditions began to turn at the end of the second quarter, providing us with improved opportunities for the second half of the year. 
Wheat grain handling margins and merchandising results continued for Ag Services. Results for corn, including the strong performance in sweeteners and starches, offset by lower ethanol results. Our oilseeds operations leverage their flex capacity to quash record volumes of soybeans in the second quarter as global protein demand continues to grow. WFSI saw strong growth in flavors and systems with operating profit in line with the year ago quarter.
During the quarter, we continued to advance our strategic plan, acquiring full ownership of Amazon Flavors, a leading Brazilian manufacturer of natural extracts, emulsions and compounds. We added soybean crushing capability to our facility in Strawvine Germany, allowing us to utilize flex capacity while also meeting growing customer demand for non-GMO soybean meal and oil in Western Europe. 
We continued to invest in Asia's growing and evolving foot demand by further increasing our strategic ownerships, taking Wilmar from 20% to 22%. In addition, we continue to make progress in the strategic review of our ethanol dry mills. We have implemented almost $150 million of new run rate savings actions in the first half of the year and remain on track to meet our $275 million target by the end of the calendar year.
Also, we repurchased about $500 million of shares in the first half as we continue to execute on our balanced capital location framework. The first half of the year was very challenging. However, with improved fundamentals, we anticipate a more favorable second half of the year. 
I'll provide more detail on our scorecard progress later in the call. Now I'll turn the call over to Ray."

Excluding specified items, adjusted segment operating profit was $573 mi",1016,"Thanks, Juan. Good morning, everyone. Slide 4 provides some financial highlights for the quarter. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.41, down from the $0.60 in the year ago quarter. Excluding specified items, adjusted segment operating profit was $573 million, down $151 million. 
The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 29%, compared to 27% in the second quarter of the prior year, largely due to a $20 million of unique discrete tax items in the quarter that negatively impacted our effective tax rate, as well as our second quarter EPS by approximately $0.03 per share. Note, we did not impact our adjusted EPS for these $0.03 of discrete tax items. Although our full year tax rate will largely depend on a number of factors going forward, at this point, I would expect our calendar year tax rate to be about 28%.
Our strong 4 quarter average adjusted ROIC of 5.7% is 90 basis points below our 2016 annual WACC of 6.6%. Our objective for the full year 2016 remains to earn an ROIC equal to or in excess of our cost of capital. On Chart 18 of the appendix, you can see the reconciliation of a reported quarterly earnings of $0.48 per share to the adjusted earnings of $0.41 per share. For this quarter, we had gains on sales or asset revaluations at $0.17 per share, asset impairments of approximately $0.01 per share and LIFO charges of approximately $0.09 per share.
Slide 5 provides an operating profit summary in the components of our corporate line. I'd like to highlight some of the unique items impacting our quarterly results. 
In the Ag Services segment, there was a net gain of $43 million, reflecting the collection of the final deferred proceeds from the sale of Gruma shares in 2012, offset by some small impairment charges. In the Corn Processing segment, there was a net gain of $63 million related to sale of our Brazilian sugar assets, partially offset by $6 million of small impairment charges. 
In Oilseeds Processing, we did not have any material items that impacted adjusted EPS. Over the course of the second quarter, we did have unprecedented volatility in the soybean crush margins. Earlier in the second quarter, we had expected the run-up in the board crush margins to have a significant negative mark-to-market impact on our second quarter results. In June, however, margins fell dramatically and the net impact from a mark-to-market perspective ended up being minimal for the second quarter. We did have some negative accounting effects related to softseed crush and biodiesel hedges, and these negative impacts should reverse themselves in the second half of the calendar year.
As a reminder, the results of the equity earnings of Wilmar are reported by ADM on a 1-quarter lag basis. To note, Wilmar issued a profit warning in the middle of July announcing that it expects to report net losses of approximately $230 million for its second quarter. As a result, we expect to pick up about $50 million of equity losses in our third quarter results compared to the prior consensus estimates of about $50 million of equity earnings for the third quarter or about $100 million swing in ADM's expected third quarter results.
The tax rate we applied to Wilmar equity earnings is 0%. Hence, the EPS impact of this $100 million swing will be about a negative $0.17 per share for our third quarter. In WFSI, there was a $12 million revaluation gain related to our acquisition of the remaining interest in the wild Amazonas joint venture. In the corporate lines, net interest expense was down due to lower interest rates, the favorable effects of the debt restructuring from last year and the revaluation of our liability to purchase the remaining stake in Harvest Innovations. Unallocated corporate costs of $116 million were down from the year ago quarter, primarily due to strong cost management.
Turning to the cash flow statement on Slide 6. Here's the cash flow statement for the 6 months ending June 30, 2016, compared to the same periods of prior year. We generated over $1 billion from operations before working capital changes in the first half, slightly lower than the first half of last year. 
Total capital spending for the first half was $396 million, down from the prior year's $540 million. Capital spending has been lower during this more challenging first half of the year. Acquisitions of $120 million during the first half of 2016 include Harvest Innovations in WFSI, Medsofts in Ag Services and Morocco in Corn Processing. Included in the other investing activities line is our increased investment in Wilmar to a 22% level. 
During the first half of 2016, we spent about $487 million to repurchase approximately 13.5 million shares of ADM. Our objective remains to repurchase $1 billion to $1.5 billion of our own stock in calendar year 2016. Our average share count for the first half of the year was 594 million diluted shares. Our total return of capital to shareholders, including dividends, was about $800 million for the first half of the year.
We can see that there was a balanced use of cash between CapEx, M&A and capital return to shareholders. Slide 7 shows the highlights of our balance sheet as of June 30. Our operating working capital of $8.2 billion was down $0.1 billion from the year-ago period. Total debt was approximately $7.4 billion, resulting in net debt balance of $6.7 billion, up from the 2015 net debt level of $5.7 billion. Our leverage position remains healthy with a net debt-to-total capital ratio of about 27%. 
Our shareholders equity of $17.7 billion was down from the $18.6 billion level last year due primarily to capital returns in excess of net income and a decrease in the cumulative translation account. We had $4.9 billion in available global credit capacity at the end of June. If you had available cash, we had access to $5.6 billion of short-term liquidity. Our balance sheet remains very, very solid. Next, Juan will take us through a review of the business performance. Juan?"

Please turn to Slide 8. In the second quarter, we earned $573 million of operating profit, excluding specified items, down from the $724 million from last year's second quarter. In Ag Services, wheat grain handling margins and merchandising r",1744,"Thanks, Ray. Please turn to Slide 8. In the second quarter, we earned $573 million of operating profit, excluding specified items, down from the $724 million from last year's second quarter. In Ag Services, wheat grain handling margins and merchandising results continued. Results for corn were down slightly compared to the second quarter last year with continued strong performance in sweeteners and starches, offset by weaker bioproducts results. With continued strong global protein demand, our oilseeds operations were able to utilize flex capacity to crush record volumes of soybeans in the quarter. Excluding the start-up items, WFSI operating profit results were in line with a year ago quarter. As a result, adjusted segment operating profit was flat versus last quarter and down 21% versus the year ago quarter.
Late in the quarter, market conditions began to turn lining up a more favorable outlook for the second half. Now I will review the performance of each segment and provide additional detail.
Starting on the Slide 9. We indicated last quarter that Ag Services in the second quarter will be challenged. And as it turned out, adjusted results were down significantly compared to one year ago due to compressed U.S. grain handling margins. In the U.S., we saw limited merchandising, warehousing and storage opportunities due to reduced grain carries. International merchandising results remained weak overall, but were up versus one year ago, due to the strong origination results in Argentina and the addition of destination market in Egypt through our Medsofts joint venture. Net timing effects did not have a material impact on results.
In transportation, results declined due to weak barge demand and lower freight rates. In Milling and Other, ADM Milling had a strong second quarter driven by product margins and merchandising results.  
Please turn to Slide 10. 
Corn Processing results were up sequentially, but down slightly versus the second quarter last year. Sweeteners and starches result were higher as the business continued to perform well with higher volumes and pricing and improved margins from optimizing for the grain in our corn wet mills. In addition, the integration of the recent Eaststarch and Morocco acquisitions have gone better than planned, contributing to our global sweeteners and starches portfolio and results.
Bioproducts results were down in the quarter. With high industry ethanol inventory levels coming into the quarter, we decreased production. While ethanol margins have improved modestly and demand for both domestic consumption and exports continued to be strong, margins remain very volatile and extremely sensitive to industry production grades and inventory levels.
Lysine results continue to be pressured by large global production, particularly early in the quarter. However, results improved in June as global inventories declined and a strong demand continued. 
Slide 11, please. 
Oilseeds results were solid for the second quarter, but were down versus a strong quarter one year ago. Crushing and origination declined from last year's high levels, primarily due to weak canola margins, as well as lower soy crush margins, which were historically high last year. Strong global demand for protein mill and the continued weak economics for softseed allowed us to flex the capacity of our end market crush plants in Europe. This added positive contributions to our network and allowed our North American and European crush operations to set new second quarter soy crush volume records.
During the quarter, the team effectively managed unprecedented ball crush movements that were caused by South American crop uncertainty. By the end of the quarter, supply demand fundamental stabilized crush margins. Earlier in the quarter, we had expected significant soybean crush negative mark-to-market impacts for the second quarter, due to significant increase in board margins. But the actual net income turned out to be quite minimal as board crush margins fell in June.
Refining, packaging, biodiesel and other results were down from one year ago, mainly due to negative biodiesel timing effects despite strong results in Specialty Fats and Oils and Golden Peanut. Oilseeds results in Asia for the quarter improved partially due to Wilmar's first quarter errands. As Ray indicated earlier, Wilmar has issued a second quarter profit warning in July that we expect will have a negative impact for the ADM's third quarter results.
On Slide 12. Excluding start-up costs, WFSI results were in line with the second quarter last year with a strong growth in flavors and systems, offset by a slower separate individual included in sales. In the quarter, we added to our ingredient capabilities in South America with a full ownership acquisition of Amazon Flavors, a leading Brazilian manufacturer of natural extracts, emulsions and compounds. This gives us the full capability of flavors and systems in Brazil, with boots on the ground to develop systems and provide customers with rapid prototype delivery to meet local taste. Results included about $4 million in operational startup costs for Tianjin and Campo Grande. We expect WILD Flavors to have an extremely strong second half of the year, which should result in year-over-year operating profit growth of more than 20%.
However, continuing challenges with some of our legacy ingredients businesses, demand factors in the case of hydrocolloids, near-term pricing pressures in the case of fibers and some inventory management issues at SCI, will limit overall WFSI segment operating profit growth this calendar year to lower double-digit percentages. Now on the Slide 13, I'd like to update you how we're strengthening our -- and growing our company. We've highlighted some of the areas in which we made significant progress recently. I'll discuss a few.
In Ag Services, in the second quarter, we started operations in our Medsofts' joint venture in Egypt as we continue to expand our distribution value chain through our destination marketing capabilities and an asset light approach. The Medsofts joint venture help us -- helps us diversify and expand our merchandising footprint, grow our logistic services and gets us closer to our customers as we deliver products directly to them. 
In corn, we completed the sale of our sugarcane ethanol operations in Brazil. We began operation of our Casablanca Morocco-based corn wet mill, as we continue to expand the geographic footprint of our sweeteners and starches business. We expanded our sweetener portfolio by entering into a partnership to offer low-calorie, non-GMO stevia and monk fruit ingredients. Within our animal nutrition business, we introduced new products and announced plans to expand and modernize facilities. In our lysine business, we made progress -- process improvements that should improve yields in the second half of the year. And we are advancing on the strategic review of our ethanol dry mills assets. 
We have made management presentations to 7 parties that have indicated interest in our dry mill assets. We will await all the proposals to determine what is the best value maximizing strategy for ADM. We anticipate receiving bids back by the end of August, and we'll then evaluate and determine our next steps in the process. 
In oilseeds, we completed the canola crush expansion project at our plant in Lloydminster, Canada, and we added soybean crushing capacity at our facility in Istro, Germany, allowing us to meet customer demand for non-GMO soybean meal and oil in Western Europe. And in WFSI, we built out additional synergy projects and now have more than 1,300 projects in the pipeline. Our latest forecast for the end of 2017 is shifting to about 2/3 cost synergies and 1/3 revenue synergies due to revenue synergies taking a little longer to realize.
We added to our ingredient capabilities in South America with a full ownership acquisition of Amazon Flavors, and we have another productive IST just a week -- a few weeks ago, highlighting recent additions in SCI, Eatem Foods and Harvest Innovations. Together, we show taste of the industries progress and deepest ingredient portfolio, giving customers access to innovative products, extensive technical expertise and best-in-class service.
These are just a few of the highlights from the quarter. We'll continue to update you on our progress each quarter. And over time, you should expect to see the results of this. Before we take your questions, I wanted to offer some additional forward perspectives. 
As I indicated earlier, both the second quarter and the the first half of the year were challenging. Throughout this period, we continued our ongoing focus on costs. And importantly, we continue to execute on our strategy, which includes additional geographic diversification and moving further downstream in the value chain. Now looking ahead, with recent improved market dynamics, we anticipate better opportunities.
The outlook for the large U.S. crop and some of our businesses experienced in improved margin conditions creates a platform for a more favorable environment in the second half of the year and some optimism as we start to move into early 2017. For Ag Services, current U.S. crop conditions indicates a growing season is progressing very well. This is expected to translate into improved export volumes and margins, higher utilization of our transportation network and better merchandising and handling opportunities for the second half of the year.
For corn, the strategy and flexibility of our wet mills, along with continued operational excellence achievements and high capacity utilization rates, should support improved margins for our sweeteners and starches business for the second half of the year. Into the future, as global sweeteners and starch demand continues to grow, our product and footprint expansions will provide diversification of both geography and starch sources to help maximize cost positions and drive value creation.
Ethanol margins have improved since the beginning of the year and the forward demand environment from domestic consumption and exports would appear favorable. However, the future margin environment will remain dependent upon industry production levels relative to demand and the result in inventory levels. We have seen this inventory to margins relationships over the years, and we have seen the margins being somewhat volatile as well.
In oilseeds, the outlook for the second half of the year has improved due to continued strong global protein demand, leveraging our flex capacity and improved crush margins. Looking ahead, on Trent, complex consumer demands are creating value for our oils portfolio and oilseeds network. For WFSI, increasing the ratio in natural health and nutritional products and leveraging our industry leadership in plant-based proteins, powders and specialty grains all are positive supports for the future progress of WFSI. With organic growth, synergy execution and small bolt-on M&A, we continue to build this business for the future. 
With that, operator, please open the line for questions."

We also are seeing wheat carriers and basis gains that had returned to the market. We expect in the same area that the Asian marketing continued to increase for us, the impact of that, and we expect an even more impact in 2017. Milling volumes normally get into our high season in Q3. So we expect another pickup from there. And in general, transportation results are expected to improve or increase loads some higher freight rates. We expect southbound volume broil increase in the range of 30% in Q3. So all in all, we are optimistic by the picture we are seeing in Ag Services after many months of subdued performance, if you will."

And obviously, China is the second largest market of ethanol in the world. And we have seen there, both in China and in India, the export -- the imports picking up. And that has been a boost, obviously, for U.S. exports. Your concerns are probably given by the change in corn policy in China and to what extent that will reduce the imports. We believe in that range in the 850 million to 900 million. We continue to see other markets coming on again strongly, like India. We believe China may or may not reduce there. We believe China that will be there. We believe Mexico will join. So in general, we feel strongly about it. And we could argue China may dedicate some of that corn to make ethanol. But also, there are questions about the quality of those reserves and how much of that can actually be returning to ethanol. So again, when we look at the forecast and without having a significant amount of China exports in the second half, we believe into the -- in the 850 million to 900 million gallon range for net exports for the U.S."

I mean, the way we kind of look at this year second half compared to, let's say, the second half of last year, I mean, there are several variables that have moved in our favor. In first of all, the U.S. dollar actually has stabilized compared to where we were last year. In fact, you've seen that relative to what other crop growing regions, the dollar has actually become a lot more competitive. And that's a favorable factor for Ag Services as we look towards exports in the back half of the year. And frankly, that's being reflected in terms of elevation markets, forward elevation margins that we're seeing right now compared to what we saw last year. And secondly, if you recall, last year, there was this overhang regarding Argentina. Remember it went into the second half of the year, there was a lot of concern that with the change in the government, that there was to be a flood of Argentinean products entering world markets, and that actually depressed margins significantly. What we've seen this year is in fact due to some weather issues down in Argentina and Brazil, this overhang doesn't exist. In fact, a lot of the surplus corn and wheat that was in Argentina, actually moved to the world markets already. And hence, you don't have the Argentine overhang. And that's going to be favorable in terms of how U.S. experts going to look like. I mean, thirdly, global demand remains very, very strong in terms of what we're seeing, in terms of demand factors. And then as I indicate, there has been, due to weather factors, shortages that have occurred out of South America that's actually helped in terms of global supply demand balance that we're seeing right now, and that's a favorable with respect to U.S. exports in the back half of the year. Then lastly, you take a look at the U.S. crop, maybe -- the USDA numbers are very, very healthy. But I mean, expectations are that potentially crop could actually be bigger than what the USDA is predicting. So the supply environment and the opportunity look for basis opportunities in the U.S. actually becomes a lot real as we move into the back half of this year compared to where we were last year. So in general, that's the reason why we're seeing a lot more optimism, particularly for the Ag Services division as we move into the back half of this year compared to where we were last year."

So at this point in time, we will continue to titrate that whether we run for yield as I described some times or we'll run for volume.

So some of the legacy business is one of the businesses for example, hydrocolloids. Hydrocolloids goal like about half of it to food applications, and that continues to go very well, but about half of it goes to drilling fluids. And as you can read, the industry had basically reduced significantly the drilling in the U.S. So that market has been significantly impacted. So nothing to do with our food strategy, if you will, but it happens that we'll report it in that segment. The second is related to fibers. The fibers market has a little of over capacity. So prices have been soft there and we have more competition. And one of the businesses that we acquired, SCI, have had some issues with inventory that we needed to write off or sell it at a discount, because it might not have been integrated of conditions. So all those 3 things basically impacted the WFSI business. On the other hand, WILD Flavors is growing significantly and is going to post growth, so if about 20% year-over-year on the -- basically, on innovation that is happening at a customer level. So when we talked about the revenue synergies being a little bit slow, it's because obviously, you need to -- first of all, you need to think about how to combine all these products into a new solution. And then you create the prototypes and then you present those to the customer and the customers great the marketing campaign and also look at the potential for that product and look at the stability of those products. So that approval process takes a little bit longer, especially in some of the companies that are very much focusing nowadays on costs, on productivity, and it may not have that many people to take care of these products. So that's why we try to ramp up a little bit more of the cost synergies to make sure we don't fall behind in our promises. But as I said, the WILD Flavors business is going strong and having again probably a 20% increase in profits versus already a record year like it was 2015. So we are extremely proud of the business."

And some of these products are more at the developmental stage, if you will, but some you can see in the press releases that we continue to launch these products. At this point in time, I cannot give you top of my head something that you could look at to track the progression of that portfolio. But traditionally, 5 years ago, we look at trying to replace 10% of the grind, if you will, just in case a high fructose content were going to decline 2% per year, which it hasn't happened.

This morning, we reported second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.41. Our adjusted segment operating profit was $573 million. After a challenging start of the year, general market conditions began to turn at the end of the second quarter, providing us with improved opportunities for the second half of the year. 
Wheat grain handling margins and merchandising results continued for Ag Services. Results for corn, including the strong performance in sweeteners and starches, offset by lower ethanol results. Our oilseeds operations leveraged their flex capacity to crush record volumes of soybeans in the second quarter as global protein demand continues to grow. WFSI saw strong growth in flavors and systems with operating profit in line with the year ago quarter.
During the quarter, we continued to advance our strategic plan, acquiring full ownership of Amazon Flavors, a leading Brazilian manufacturer of natural extracts, emulsions and compounds. We added soybean crushing capability to our facility in Straubing, Germany, allowing us to utilize flex capacity while also meeting growing customer demand for non-GMO soybean meal and oil in Western Europe. 
We continued to invest in Asia's growing and evolving foot demand by further increasing our strategic ownership stake in Wilmar from 20% to 22%. In addition, we continue to make progress in the strategic review of our ethanol dry mills. We have implemented almost $150 million of new run rate savings actions in the first half of the year and remain on track to meet our $275 million target by the end of the calendar year.
Also, we repurchased about $500 million of shares in the first half as we continue to execute on our balanced capital allocation framework. The first half of the year was very challenging. However, with improved fundamentals, we anticipate a more favorable second half of the year. 
I'll provide more detail on our scorecard progress later in the call. Now I'll turn the call over to Ray."

Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.41, down from the $0.60 in the year ago quarter. Excluding specified items, adjusted segment operating profit was $573 million, down $151 million. 
The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 29%, compared to 27% in the second quarter of the prior year, largely due to a $20 million of unique discrete tax items in the quarter that negatively impacted our effective tax rate, as well as our second quarter EPS by approximately $0.03 per share. Note, we did not impact our adjusted EPS for these $0.03 of discrete tax items. Although our full year tax rate will largely depend on a number of factors going forward, at this point, I would expect our calendar year tax rate to be about 28%.
Our strong 4 quarter average adjusted ROIC of 5.7% is 90 basis points below our 2016 annual WACC of 6.6%. Our objective for the full year 2016 remains to earn an ROIC equal to or in excess of our cost of capital. On Chart 18 of the appendix, you can see the reconciliation of a reported quarterly earnings of $0.48 per share to the adjusted earnings of $0.41 per share. For this quarter, we had gains on sales or asset revaluations of $0.17 per share, asset impairments of approximately $0.01 per share and LIFO charges of approximately $0.09 per share.
Slide 5 provides an operating profit summary in the components of our corporate line. I'd like to highlight some of the unique items impacting our quarterly results. 
In the Ag Services segment, there was a net gain of $43 million, reflecting the collection of the final deferred proceeds from the sale of Gruma shares in 2012, offset by some small impairment charges. In the Corn Processing segment, there was a net gain of $63 million related to sale of our Brazilian sugar assets, partially offset by $6 million of small impairment charges. 
In Oilseeds Processing, we did not have any material items that impacted adjusted EPS. Over the course of the second quarter, we did have unprecedented volatility in the soybean crush margins. Earlier in the second quarter, we had expected the run-up in the board crush margins to have a significant negative mark-to-market impact on our second quarter results. In June, however, margins fell dramatically, and the net impact from a mark-to-market perspective ended up being minimal for the second quarter. We did have some negative accounting effects related to softseed crush and biodiesel hedges, and these negative impacts should reverse themselves in the second half of the calendar year.
As a reminder, the results of the equity earnings of Wilmar are reported by ADM on a 1-quarter lag basis. To note, Wilmar issued a profit warning in the middle of July announcing that it expects to report net losses of approximately $230 million for its second quarter. As a result, we expect to pick up about $50 million of equity losses in our third quarter results compared to the prior consensus estimates of about $50 million of equity earnings for the third quarter or about a $100 million swing in ADM's expected third quarter results.
The tax rate we applied to Wilmar equity earnings is 0%. Hence, the EPS impact of this $100 million swing will be about a negative $0.17 per share for our third quarter. In WFSI, there was a $12 million revaluation gain related to our acquisition of the remaining interest in the wild Amazonas joint venture. In the corporate lines, net interest expense was down due to lower interest rates, the favorable effects of the debt restructuring from last year and the revaluation of our liability to purchase the remaining stake in Harvest Innovations. Unallocated corporate costs of $116 million were down from the year ago quarter, primarily due to strong cost management.
Turning to the cash flow statement on Slide 6. Here's the cash flow statement for the 6 months ending June 30, 2016, compared to the same period the prior year. We generated over $1 billion from operations before working capital changes in the first half, slightly lower than the first half of last year. 
Total capital spending for the first half was $396 million, down from the prior year's $540 million. Capital spending has been lower during this more challenging first half of the year. Acquisitions of $120 million during the first half of 2016 include Harvest Innovations in WFSI, Medsofts in Ag Services and Morocco in Corn Processing. Included in the other investing activities line is our increased investment in Wilmar to a 22% level. 
During the first half of 2016, we spent about $487 million to repurchase approximately 13.5 million shares of ADM. Our objective remains to repurchase $1 billion to $1.5 billion of our own stock in calendar year 2016. Our average share count for the first half of the year was 594 million diluted shares. Our total return of capital to shareholders, including dividends, was about $800 million for the first half of the year.
We can see that there was a balanced use of cash between CapEx, M&A and capital return to shareholders. Slide 7 shows the highlights of our balance sheet as of June 30. Our operating working capital of $8.2 billion was down $0.1 billion from the year-ago period. Total debt was approximately $7.4 billion, resulting in net debt balance of $6.7 billion, up from the 2015 net debt level of $5.7 billion. Our leverage position remains healthy with a net debt-to-total capital ratio of about 27%. 
Our shareholders equity of $17.7 billion was down from the $18.6 billion level last year due primarily to capital returns in excess of net income and a decrease in the cumulative translation account. We had $4.9 billion in available global credit capacity at the end of June. If you add the available cash, we had access to $5.6 billion of short-term liquidity. Our balance sheet remains very, very solid. Next, Juan will take us through a review of the business performance. Juan?"

In the second quarter, we earned $573 million of operating profit, excluding specified items, down from the $724 million from last year's second quarter. In Ag Services, wheat grain handling margins and merchandising results continued. Results for corn were down slightly compared to the second quarter last year with continued strong performance in sweeteners and starches, offset by weaker bioproducts results. With continued strong global protein demand, our oilseeds operations were able to utilize flex capacity to crush record volumes of soybeans in the quarter. Excluding the start-up items, WFSI operating profit results were in line with a year ago quarter. As a result, adjusted segment operating profit was flat versus last quarter and down 21% versus the year ago quarter.
Late in the quarter, market conditions began to turn lining up a more favorable outlook for the second half. Now I will review the performance of each segment and provide additional detail.
Starting on the Slide 9. We indicated last quarter that Ag Services in the second quarter will be challenged. And as it turned out, adjusted results were down significantly compared to one year ago due to compressed U.S. grain handling margins. In the U.S., we saw limited merchandising, warehousing and storage opportunities due to reduced grain carries. International merchandising results remained weak overall, but were up versus one year ago, due to the strong origination results in Argentina and the addition of destination market in Egypt through our Medsofts joint venture. Net timing effects did not have a material impact on results.
In transportation, results declined due to weak barge demand and lower freight rates. In Milling and Other, ADM Milling had a strong second quarter driven by product margins and merchandising results.  
Please turn to Slide 10. 
Corn Processing results were up sequentially, but down slightly versus the second quarter last year. Sweeteners and starches result were higher as the business continued to perform well with higher volumes and pricing and improved margins from optimizing product grind in our corn wet mills. In addition, the integration of the recent Eaststarch and Morocco acquisitions have gone better than planned, contributing to our global sweeteners and starches portfolio and results.
Bioproducts results were down in the quarter. With high industry ethanol inventory levels coming into the quarter, we decreased production. While ethanol margins have improved modestly and demand for both domestic consumption and exports continued to be strong, margins remain very volatile and extremely sensitive to industry production grades and inventory levels.
Lysine results continue to be pressured by large global production, particularly early in the quarter. However, results improved in June as global inventories declined and a strong demand continued. 
Slide 11, please. 
Oilseeds results were solid for the second quarter, but were down versus a strong quarter one year ago. Crushing and origination declined from last year's high levels, primarily due to weak canola margins, as well as lower soy crush margins, which were historically high last year. Strong global demand for protein mill and the continued weak economics for softseed allowed us to flex the capacity of our end market crush plants in Europe. This added positive contributions to our network and allowed our North American and European crush operations to set new second quarter soy crush volume records.
During the quarter, the team effectively managed unprecedented ball crush movements that were caused by South American crop uncertainty. By the end of the quarter, supply demand fundamentals stabilized crush margins. Earlier in the quarter, we had expected significant soybean crush negative mark-to-market impacts for the second quarter, due to significant increase in board margins. But the actual net impact turned out to be quite minimal as board crush margins fell in June.
Refining, packaging, biodiesel and other results were down from one year ago, mainly due to negative biodiesel timing effects despite strong results in Specialty Fats and Oils and Golden Peanut. Oilseeds results in Asia for the quarter improved partially due to Wilmar's first quarter earnings. As Ray indicated earlier, Wilmar has issued a second quarter profit warning in July that we expect will have a negative impact for ADM's third quarter results.
On Slide 12. Excluding start-up costs, WFSI results were in line with the second quarter last year with a strong growth in flavors and systems, offset by a slower separate individual ingredient sales. In the quarter, we added to our ingredient capabilities in South America with a full ownership acquisition of Amazon Flavors, a leading Brazilian manufacturer of natural extracts, emulsions and compounds. This gives us the full capability of flavors and systems in Brazil, with boots on the ground to develop systems and provide customers with rapid prototype delivery to meet local tastes. Results included about $4 million in operational startup costs for Tianjin and Campo Grande. We expect WILD Flavors to have an extremely strong second half of the year, which should result in year-over-year operating profit growth of more than 20%.
However, continuing challenges with some of our legacy ingredients businesses, demand factors in the case of hydrocolloids, near-term pricing pressures in the case of fibers and some inventory management issues at SCI, will limit overall WFSI segment operating profit growth this calendar year to lower double-digit percentages.
Now on the Slide 13, I'd like to update you how we're strengthening our -- and growing our company. We've highlighted some of the areas in which we made significant progress recently. I'll discuss a few.
In Ag Services, in the second quarter, we started operations in our Medsofts joint venture in Egypt as we continue to expand our distribution value chain through our destination marketing capabilities and an asset light approach. The Medsofts joint venture help us -- helps us diversify and expand our merchandising footprint, grow our logistic services and gets us closer to our customers as we deliver products directly to them. 
In corn, we completed the sale of our sugarcane ethanol operations in Brazil. We began operation of our Casablanca Morocco-based corn wet mill, as we continue to expand the geographic footprint of our sweeteners and starches business. We expanded our sweetener portfolio by entering into a partnership to offer low-calorie, non-GMO stevia and monk fruit ingredients. Within our animal nutrition business, we introduced new products and announced plans to expand and modernize facilities. In our lysine business, we made progress -- process improvements that should improve yields in the second half of the year. And we are advancing on the strategic review of our ethanol dry mills assets. 
We have made management presentations to 7 parties that have indicated interest in our dry mill assets. We will await all the proposals to determine what is the best value-maximizing strategy for ADM. We anticipate receiving bids back by the end of August, and we'll then evaluate and determine our next steps in the process. 
In oilseeds, we completed the canola crush expansion project at our plant in Lloydminster, Canada, and we added soybean crushing capacity at our facility in Straubing, Germany, allowing us to meet customer demand for non-GMO soybean meal and oil in Western Europe. And in WFSI, we built out additional synergy projects and now have more than 1,300 projects in the pipeline. Our latest forecast for the end of 2017 is shifting to about 2/3 cost synergies and 1/3 revenue synergies due to revenue synergies taking a little longer to realize.
We added to our ingredient capabilities in South America with a full ownership acquisition of Amazon Flavors, and we have another productive IFT just a week -- a few weeks ago, highlighting recent additions in SCI, Eatem Foods and Harvest Innovations. Together, we showcased the industry’s broadest and deepest ingredient portfolio, giving customers access to innovative products, extensive technical expertise and best-in-class service.
These are just a few of the highlights from the quarter. We'll continue to update you on our progress each quarter. And over time, you should expect to see the results of this. Before we take your questions, I wanted to offer some additional forward perspectives. 
As I indicated earlier, both the second quarter and the first half of the year were challenging. Throughout this period, we continued our ongoing focus on costs. And importantly, we continued to execute on our strategy, which includes additional geographic diversification and moving further downstream in the value chain. Now looking ahead, with recent improved market dynamics, we anticipate better opportunities.
The outlook for the large U.S. crop and some of our businesses experienced in improved margin conditions creates a platform for a more favorable environment in the second half of the year and some optimism as we start to move into early 2017. For Ag Services, current U.S. crop conditions indicate the growing season is progressing very well. This is expected to translate into improved export volumes and margins, higher utilization of our transportation network and better merchandising and handling opportunities for the second half of the year.
For corn, the strategy and flexibility of our wet mills, along with continued operational excellence achievements and high capacity utilization rates, should support improved margins for our sweeteners and starches business for the second half of the year. Into the future, as global sweeteners and starch demand continues to grow, our product and footprint expansions will provide diversification of both geography and starch sources to help maximize cost positions and drive value creation.
Ethanol margins have improved since the beginning of the year and the forward demand environment from domestic consumption and exports would appear favorable. However, the future margin environment will remain dependent upon industry production levels relative to demand and the resultant inventory levels. We have seen this inventory to margins relationships over the years, and we have seen the margins being somewhat volatile as well.
In oilseeds, the outlook for the second half of the year has improved due to continued strong global protein demand, leveraging our flex capacity and improved crush margins. Looking ahead on trend, complex consumer demands are creating value for our oils portfolio and oilseeds network. For WFSI, increasing the ratio in natural health and nutritional products and leveraging our industry leadership in plant-based proteins, powders and specialty grains all are positive supports for the future progress of WFSI. With organic growth, synergy execution and small bolt-on M&A, we continue to build this business for the future.

We also are seeing wheat carriers and basis gains that have returned to the market. We expect in the same area that the Asian marketing continued to increase for us, the impact of that, and we expect an even more impact in 2017. Milling volumes normally get into our high season in Q3. So we expect another pickup from there. And in general, transportation results are expected to improve or increase loads some higher freight rates. We expect southbound volume broadly increase in the range of 30% in Q3. So all in all, we are optimistic by the picture we are seeing in Ag Services after many months of subdued performance, if you will."

And obviously, China is the second-largest market of ethanol in the world. And we have seen there, both in China and in India, the export -- the imports picking up. And that has been a boost, obviously, for U.S. exports. Your concerns are probably given by the change in corn policy in China and to what extent that will reduce the imports. We believe in that range in the 850 million to 900 million. We continue to see other markets coming on again strongly, like India. We believe China may or may not reduce there. We believe Canada will be there. We believe Mexico will join. So in general, we feel strongly about it. And we could argue China may dedicate some of that corn to make ethanol. But also, there are questions about the quality of those reserves and how much of that can actually be turned into ethanol. So again, when we look at the forecast and without having a significant amount of China exports in the second half, we believe into the -- in the 850 million to 900 million gallon range for net exports for the U.S."

I mean, the way we kind of look at this year second half compared to, let's say, the second half of last year, I mean, there are several variables that have moved in our favor. And first of all, the U.S. dollar actually has stabilized compared to where we were last year. In fact, you've seen that relative to other crop-growing regions, the dollar has actually become a lot more competitive. And that's a favorable factor for Ag Services as we look towards exports in the back half of the year. And frankly, that's being reflected in terms of elevation margins, forward elevation margins that we're seeing right now compared to what we saw last year. And secondly, if you recall, last year, there was this overhang regarding Argentina. Remember when we went into the second half of the year, there was a lot of concern that with the change in the government, that there was to be a flood of Argentinean products entering world markets, and that actually depressed margins significantly. What we've seen this year is in fact due to some weather issues down in Argentina and Brazil, this overhang doesn't exist. In fact, a lot of the surplus corn and wheat that was in Argentina, actually moved to the world markets already. And hence, you don't have the Argentine overhang. And that's going to be favorable in terms of how U.S. exports are going to look like. I mean, thirdly, global demand remains very, very strong in terms of what we're seeing, in terms of demand factors. And then as I indicate, there has been, due to weather factors, shortages that have occurred out of South America that's actually helped in terms of global supply demand balance that we're seeing right now, and that's a favorable with respect to U.S. exports in the back half of the year. Then lastly, you take a look at the U.S. crop. I mean, the USDA numbers are very, very healthy. But I mean, expectations are that potentially crop could actually be bigger than what the USDA is predicting. So the supply environment and the opportunity look for basis opportunities in the U.S. actually becomes a lot real as we move into the back half of this year compared to where we were last year. So in general, that's the reason why we're seeing a lot more optimism, particularly for the Ag Services division as we move into the back half of this year compared to where we were last year."

The Wilmar risk management, to the extent that I can comment on that, I mean, they're going to be releasing earnings next week, so I need to be prudent here. But the Wilmar risk management process included having risk limits and loss limits and having stop-losses on positions, like every risk company. And with the abrupt movement in prices, these stop-losses were triggered in Q2. Without going into the details of their performance, we do believe this being a one-off situation. And if you think about Wilmar that participate in a very, I mean, they are very large crusher and they participate in a very volatile part of the world. This is the first quarterly loss since their IPO in 2006. So this is -- it's not that this is a common occurrence. And as unfortunate as it is, we do believe that, hopefully, it's a one-off. But again, I will relate you to their earnings call that what's going to happen in -- I think, in August 12.

We have a big book on already with strong elevation margins.

Wheat carriers are there. And I think with a little bit of softening on the dollar plus, their big crops, the U.S. is competitive in soybeans, is competitive -- certainly is competitive in corn, is competitive in soybeans and is getting competitive in wheat.

So we believe in growing margins going forward, and we believe that we are in excellent position to do that. You heard me saying several times about our flex capacity and how we have added to our plans the ability to crush more soybeans. And we have done that in several parts of the world, not only North America, but also in Europe. And there has been the bottlenecks. We reported this quarter record soybean crush in both Europe and North America. And that's the fruits basically of our operational excellence supporting which every plant is being able to turn a little bit more of a bigger output as the market demand. So we think we are very well positioned and we think that the market requires that. So we tend to agree with you. We think that '17 and forward could be good years for us."

So some of the legacy business is one of the businesses for example, hydrocolloids. Hydrocolloids go like about half of it to food applications, and that continues to go very well, but about half of it goes to drilling fluids. And as you can read, the industry had basically reduced significantly the drilling in the U.S. So that market has been significantly impacted. So nothing to do with our food strategy, if you will, but it happens that we'll report it in that segment. The second is related to fibers. The fibers market has a little bit of overcapacity. So prices have been soft there and we have more competition. And one of the businesses that we acquired, SCI, have had some issues with inventory that we needed to write off or sell it at a discount, because it might not have been in the greatest of conditions. So all those 3 things basically impacted the WFSI business. On the other hand, WILD Flavors is growing significantly and is going to post growth of about 20% year-over-year on the -- basically, on innovation that is happening at the customer level. So when we talked about the revenue synergies being a little bit slow, it's because, obviously, you need to -- first of all, you need to think about how to combine all these products into a new solution. And then you create the prototypes and then you present those to the customer and the customers create the marketing campaign and also look at the potential for that product and look at the stability of those products. So that approval process takes a little bit longer, especially in some of the companies that are very much focusing nowadays on costs, on productivity, and it may not have that many people to take care of these products. So that's why we try to ramp up a little bit more of the cost synergies to make sure we don't fall behind in our promises. But as I said, the WILD Flavors business is going strong and having again probably a 20% increase in profits versus already a record year like it was 2015. So we are extremely proud of the business."

And what we continue to do, which we like and it bodes well for the future of the business, is we continue to introduce new products. And some of these products are more at the developmental stage, if you will, but some you can see in the press releases that we continue to launch these products. At this point in time, I cannot give you top of my head something that you could look at to track the progression of that portfolio. But traditionally, 5 years ago, we look at trying to replace 10% of the grind, if you will, just in case high fructose corn syrup were going to decline 2% per year, which it hasn't happened. So we haven't needed to bring all those products, but we have all those developments.

This morning, we reported second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.41. Our adjusted segment operating profit was $573 million. After a challenging start of the year, general market conditions began to turn at the end of the second quarter, providing us with improved opportunities for the second half of the year. 
Wheat grain handling margins and merchandising results continued for Ag Services. Results for corn, including the strong performance in sweeteners and starches, offset by lower ethanol results. Our oilseeds operations leveraged their flex capacity to crush record volumes of soybeans in the second quarter as global protein demand continues to grow. WFSI saw strong growth in flavors and systems with operating profit in line with the year ago quarter.
During the quarter, we continued to advance our strategic plan, acquiring full ownership of Amazon Flavors, a leading Brazilian manufacturer of natural extracts, emulsions and compounds. We added soybean crushing capability to our facility in Straubing, Germany, allowing us to utilize flex capacity while also meeting growing customer demand for non-GMO soybean meal and oil in Western Europe. 
We continued to invest in Asia's growing and evolving foot demand by further increasing our strategic ownership stake in Wilmar from 20% to 22%. In addition, we continue to make progress in the strategic review of our ethanol dry mills. We have implemented almost $150 million of new run rate savings actions in the first half of the year and remain on track to meet our $275 million target by the end of the calendar year.
Also, we repurchased about $500 million of shares in the first half as we continue to execute on our balanced capital allocation framework. The first half of the year was very challenging. However, with improved fundamentals, we anticipate a more favorable second half of the year.

Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.41, down from the $0.60 in the year ago quarter. Excluding specified items, adjusted segment operating profit was $573 million, down $151 million. 
The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 29%, compared to 27% in the second quarter of the prior year, largely due to a $20 million of unique discrete tax items in the quarter that negatively impacted our effective tax rate as well as our second quarter EPS by approximately $0.03 per share. Note, we did not impact our adjusted EPS for these $0.03 of discrete tax items. Although our full year tax rate will largely depend on a number of factors going forward, at this point, I would expect our calendar year tax rate to be about 28%.
Our strong 4 quarter average adjusted ROIC of 5.7% is 90 basis points below our 2016 annual WACC of 6.6%. Our objective for the full year 2016 remains to earn an ROIC equal to or in excess of our cost of capital. On Chart 18 of the appendix, you can see the reconciliation of a reported quarterly earnings of $0.48 per share to the adjusted earnings of $0.41 per share. For this quarter, we had gains on sales or asset revaluations of $0.17 per share, asset impairments of approximately $0.01 per share and LIFO charges of approximately $0.09 per share.
Slide 5 provides an operating profit summary in the components of our corporate line. I'd like to highlight some of the unique items impacting our quarterly results. 
In the Ag Services segment, there was a net gain of $43 million, reflecting the collection of the final deferred proceeds from the sale of Gruma shares in 2012, offset by some small impairment charges. In the Corn Processing segment, there was a net gain of $63 million related to sale of our Brazilian sugar assets, partially offset by $6 million of small impairment charges. 
In Oilseeds Processing, we did not have any material items that impacted adjusted EPS. Over the course of the second quarter, we did have unprecedented volatility in the soybean crush margins. Earlier in the second quarter, we had expected the run-up in the board crush margins to have a significant negative mark-to-market impact on our second quarter results. In June, however, margins fell dramatically, and the net impact from a mark-to-market perspective ended up being minimal for the second quarter. We did have some negative accounting effects related to softseed crush and biodiesel hedges, and these negative impacts should reverse themselves in the second half of the calendar year.
As a reminder, the results of the equity earnings of Wilmar are reported by ADM on a 1-quarter lag basis. To note, Wilmar issued a profit warning in the middle of July announcing that it expects to report net losses of approximately $230 million for its second quarter. As a result, we expect to pick up about $50 million of equity losses in our third quarter results compared to the prior consensus estimates of about $50 million of equity earnings for the third quarter or about a $100 million swing in ADM's expected third quarter results.
The tax rate we applied to Wilmar equity earnings is 0%. Hence, the EPS impact of this $100 million swing will be about a negative $0.17 per share for our third quarter. In WFSI, there was a $12 million revaluation gain related to our acquisition of the remaining interest in the wild Amazonas joint venture. In the corporate lines, net interest expense was down due to lower interest rates, the favorable effects of the debt restructuring from last year and the revaluation of our liability to purchase the remaining stake in Harvest Innovations. Unallocated corporate costs of $116 million were down from the year ago quarter, primarily due to strong cost management.
Turning to the cash flow statement on Slide 6. Here's the cash flow statement for the 6 months ending June 30, 2016, compared to the same period the prior year. We generated over $1 billion from operations before working capital changes in the first half, slightly lower than the first half of last year. 
Total capital spending for the first half was $396 million, down from the prior year's $540 million. Capital spending has been lower during this more challenging first half of the year. Acquisitions of $120 million during the first half of 2016 include Harvest Innovations in WFSI, Medsofts in Ag Services and Morocco in Corn Processing. Included in the other investing activities line is our increased investment in Wilmar to a 22% level. 
During the first half of 2016, we spent about $487 million to repurchase approximately 13.5 million shares of ADM. Our objective remains to repurchase $1 billion to $1.5 billion of our own stock in calendar year 2016. Our average share count for the first half of the year was 594 million diluted shares. Our total return of capital to shareholders, including dividends, was about $800 million for the first half of the year.
We can see that there was a balanced use of cash between CapEx, M&A and capital return to shareholders. Slide 7 shows the highlights of our balance sheet as of June 30. Our operating working capital of $8.2 billion was down $0.1 billion from the year-ago period. Total debt was approximately $7.4 billion, resulting in net debt balance of $6.7 billion, up from the 2015 net debt level of $5.7 billion. Our leverage position remains healthy with a net debt-to-total capital ratio of about 27%. 
Our shareholders equity of $17.7 billion was down from the $18.6 billion level last year due primarily to capital returns in excess of net income and a decrease in the cumulative translation account. We had $4.9 billion in available global credit capacity at the end of June. If you add the available cash, we had access to $5.6 billion of short-term liquidity. Our balance sheet remains very, very solid. 
Next, Juan will take us through a review of the business performance. Juan?"

In Ag Services, wheat grain handling margins and merchandising r",1736,"Thanks, Ray. Please turn to Slide 8. In the second quarter, we earned $573 million of operating profit, excluding specified items, down from the $724 million from last year's second quarter. In Ag Services, wheat grain handling margins and merchandising results continued. Results for corn were down slightly compared to the second quarter last year with continued strong performance in sweeteners and starches, offset by weaker bioproducts results. With continued strong global protein demand, our oilseeds operations were able to utilize flex capacity to crush record volumes of soybeans in the quarter. Excluding the start-up items, WFSI operating profit results were in line with a year ago quarter. As a result, adjusted segment operating profit was flat versus last quarter and down 21% versus the year ago quarter.
Late in the quarter, market conditions began to turn lining up a more favorable outlook for the second half. Now I will review the performance of each segment and provide additional detail.
Starting on the Slide 9. We indicated last quarter that Ag Services in the second quarter will be challenged. And as it turned out, adjusted results were down significantly compared to one year ago due to compressed U.S. grain handling margins. In the U.S., we saw limited merchandising, warehousing and storage opportunities due to reduced grain carries. International merchandising results remained weak overall, but were up versus one year ago, due to the strong origination results in Argentina and the addition of destination market in Egypt through our Medsofts joint venture. Net timing effects did not have a material impact on results.
In transportation, results declined due to weak barge demand and lower freight rates. In Milling and Other, ADM Milling had a strong second quarter driven by product margins and merchandising results. 
Please turn to Slide 10. 
Corn Processing results were up sequentially, but down slightly versus the second quarter last year. Sweeteners and starches result were higher as the business continued to perform well with higher volumes and pricing and improved margins from optimizing product grind in our corn wet mills. In addition, the integration of the recent Eaststarch and Morocco acquisitions have gone better than planned, contributing to our global sweeteners and starches portfolio and results.
Bioproducts results were down in the quarter. With high industry ethanol inventory levels coming into the quarter, we decreased production. While ethanol margins have improved modestly and demand for both domestic consumption and exports continued to be strong, margins remain very volatile and extremely sensitive to industry production grades and inventory levels.
Lysine results continue to be pressured by large global production, particularly early in the quarter. However, results improved in June as global inventories declined and a strong demand continued. 
Slide 11, please. Oilseeds results were solid for the second quarter, but were down versus a strong quarter one year ago. Crushing and origination declined from last year's high levels, primarily due to weak canola margins, as well as lower soy crush margins, which were historically high last year. Strong global demand for protein mill and the continued weak economics for softseed allowed us to flex the capacity of our end market crush plants in Europe. This added positive contributions to our network and allowed our North American and European crush operations to set new second quarter soy crush volume records.
During the quarter, the team effectively managed unprecedented ball crush movements that were caused by South American crop uncertainty. By the end of the quarter, supply demand fundamentals stabilized crush margins. Earlier in the quarter, we had expected significant soybean crush negative mark-to-market impacts for the second quarter, due to significant increase in board margins. But the actual net impact turned out to be quite minimal as board crush margins fell in June.
Refining, packaging, biodiesel and other results were down from one year ago, mainly due to negative biodiesel timing effects despite strong results in Specialty Fats and Oils and Golden Peanut. Oilseeds results in Asia for the quarter improved partially due to Wilmar's first quarter earnings. As Ray indicated earlier, Wilmar has issued a second quarter profit warning in July that we expect will have a negative impact for ADM's third quarter results.
On Slide 12. Excluding start-up costs, WFSI results were in line with the second quarter last year with a strong growth in flavors and systems, offset by a slower separate individual ingredient sales. In the quarter, we added to our ingredient capabilities in South America with a full ownership acquisition of Amazon Flavors, a leading Brazilian manufacturer of natural extracts, emulsions and compounds. This gives us the full capability of flavors and systems in Brazil, with boots on the ground to develop systems and provide customers with rapid prototype delivery to meet local tastes. Results included about $4 million in operational startup costs for Tianjin and Campo Grande. We expect WILD Flavors to have an extremely strong second half of the year, which should result in year-over-year operating profit growth of more than 20%.
However, continuing challenges with some of our legacy ingredients businesses, demand factors in the case of hydrocolloids, near-term pricing pressures in the case of fibers and some inventory management issues at SCI, will limit overall WFSI segment operating profit growth this calendar year to lower double-digit percentages.
Now on the Slide 13, I'd like to update you how we're strengthening our -- and growing our company. We've highlighted some of the areas in which we made significant progress recently. I'll discuss a few.
In Ag Services, in the second quarter, we started operations in our Medsofts joint venture in Egypt as we continue to expand our distribution value chain through our destination marketing capabilities and an asset light approach. The Medsofts joint venture help us -- helps us diversify and expand our merchandising footprint, grow our logistic services and gets us closer to our customers as we deliver products directly to them. 
In corn, we completed the sale of our sugarcane ethanol operations in Brazil. We began operation of our Casablanca Morocco-based corn wet mill, as we continue to expand the geographic footprint of our sweeteners and starches business. We expanded our sweetener portfolio by entering into a partnership to offer low-calorie, non-GMO stevia and monk fruit ingredients. Within our animal nutrition business, we introduced new products and announced plans to expand and modernize facilities. In our lysine business, we made progress -- process improvements that should improve yields in the second half of the year. And we are advancing on the strategic review of our ethanol dry mills assets. 
We have made management presentations to 7 parties that have indicated interest in our dry mill assets. We will await all the proposals to determine what is the best value-maximizing strategy for ADM. We anticipate receiving bids back by the end of August, and we'll then evaluate and determine our next steps in the process. 
In oilseeds, we completed the canola crush expansion project at our plant in Lloydminster, Canada, and we added soybean crushing capacity at our facility in Straubing, Germany, allowing us to meet customer demand for non-GMO soybean meal and oil in Western Europe. And in WFSI, we built out additional synergy projects and now have more than 1,300 projects in the pipeline. Our latest forecast for the end of 2017 is shifting to about 2/3 cost synergies and 1/3 revenue synergies due to revenue synergies taking a little longer to realize.
We added to our ingredient capabilities in South America with a full ownership acquisition of Amazon Flavors, and we have another productive IFT just a week -- a few weeks ago, highlighting recent additions in SCI, Eatem Foods and Harvest Innovations. Together, we showcased the industry’s broadest and deepest ingredient portfolio, giving customers access to innovative products, extensive technical expertise and best-in-class service.
These are just a few of the highlights from the quarter. We'll continue to update you on our progress each quarter. And over time, you should expect to see the results of this. Before we take your questions, I wanted to offer some additional forward perspectives. 
As I indicated earlier, both the second quarter and the first half of the year were challenging. Throughout this period, we continued our ongoing focus on costs. And importantly, we continued to execute on our strategy, which includes additional geographic diversification and moving further downstream in the value chain. Now looking ahead, with recent improved market dynamics, we anticipate better opportunities.
The outlook for the large U.S. crop and some of our businesses experienced in improved margin conditions creates a platform for a more favorable environment in the second half of the year and some optimism as we start to move into early 2017. For Ag Services, current U.S. crop conditions indicate the growing season is progressing very well. This is expected to translate into improved export volumes and margins, higher utilization of our transportation network and better merchandising and handling opportunities for the second half of the year.
For corn, the strategy and flexibility of our wet mills, along with continued operational excellence achievements and high capacity utilization rates, should support improved margins for our sweeteners and starches business for the second half of the year. Into the future, as global sweeteners and starch demand continues to grow, our product and footprint expansions will provide diversification of both geography and starch sources to help maximize cost positions and drive value creation.
Ethanol margins have improved since the beginning of the year and the forward demand environment from domestic consumption and exports would appear favorable. However, the future margin environment will remain dependent upon industry production levels relative to demand and the resultant inventory levels. We have seen this inventory to margins relationships over the years, and we have seen the margins being somewhat volatile as well.
In oilseeds, the outlook for the second half of the year has improved due to continued strong global protein demand, leveraging our flex capacity and improved crush margins. Looking ahead on trend, complex consumer demands are creating value for our oils portfolio and oilseeds network. For WFSI, increasing the ratio in natural health and nutritional products and leveraging our industry leadership in plant-based proteins, powders and specialty grains all are positive supports for the future progress of WFSI. With organic growth, synergy execution and small bolt-on M&A, we continue to build this business for the future.

We also are seeing wheat carriers and basis gains that have returned to the market. We expect in the same area that the Asian marketing continued to increase for us, the impact of that, and we expect an even more impact in 2017. Milling volumes normally get into our high season in Q3. So we expect another pickup from there. And in general, transportation results are expected to improve or increase loads some higher freight rates. We expect southbound volume broadly increase in the range of 30% in Q3. So all in all, we are optimistic by the picture we are seeing in Ag Services after many months of subdued performance, if you will."

And obviously, China is the second-largest market of ethanol in the world. And we have seen there, both in China and in India, the export -- the imports picking up. And that has been a boost, obviously, for U.S. exports. Your concerns are probably given by the change in corn policy in China and to what extent that will reduce the imports. We believe in that range in the 850 million to 900 million. We continue to see other markets coming on again strongly, like India. We believe China may or may not reduce there. We believe Canada will be there. We believe Mexico will join. So in general, we feel strongly about it. And we could argue China may dedicate some of that corn to make ethanol. But also, there are questions about the quality of those reserves and how much of that can actually be turned into ethanol. So again, when we look at the forecast and without having a significant amount of China exports in the second half, we believe into the -- in the 850 million to 900 million gallon range for net exports for the U.S."

I mean, the way we kind of look at this year second half compared to, let's say, the second half of last year, I mean, there are several variables that have moved in our favor. And first of all, the U.S. dollar actually has stabilized compared to where we were last year. In fact, you've seen that relative to other crop-growing regions, the dollar has actually become a lot more competitive. And that's a favorable factor for Ag Services as we look towards exports in the back half of the year. And frankly, that's being reflected in terms of elevation margins, forward elevation margins that we're seeing right now compared to what we saw last year. And secondly, if you recall, last year, there was this overhang regarding Argentina. Remember when we went into the second half of the year, there was a lot of concern that with the change in the government, that there was to be a flood of Argentinean products entering world markets, and that actually depressed margins significantly. What we've seen this year is in fact due to some weather issues down in Argentina and Brazil, this overhang doesn't exist. In fact, a lot of the surplus corn and wheat that was in Argentina, actually moved to the world markets already. And hence, you don't have the Argentine overhang. And that's going to be favorable in terms of how U.S. exports are going to look like. I mean, thirdly, global demand remains very, very strong in terms of what we're seeing, in terms of demand factors. And then as I indicate, there has been, due to weather factors, shortages that have occurred out of South America that's actually helped in terms of global supply demand balance that we're seeing right now, and that's a favorable with respect to U.S. exports in the back half of the year. Then lastly, you take a look at the U.S. crop. I mean, the USDA numbers are very, very healthy. But I mean, expectations are that potentially crop could actually be bigger than what the USDA is predicting. So the supply environment and the opportunity look for basis opportunities in the U.S. actually becomes a lot real as we move into the back half of this year compared to where we were last year. So in general, that's the reason why we're seeing a lot more optimism, particularly for the Ag Services division as we move into the back half of this year compared to where we were last year."

The Wilmar risk management, to the extent that I can comment on that, I mean, they're going to be releasing earnings next week, so I need to be prudent here. But the Wilmar risk management process included having risk limits and loss limits and having stop-losses on positions, like every risk company. And with the abrupt movement in prices, these stop-losses were triggered in Q2. Without going into the details of their performance, we do believe this being a one-off situation. And if you think about Wilmar that participate in a very, I mean, they are very large crusher and they participate in a very volatile part of the world. This is the first quarterly loss since their IPO in 2006. So this is -- it's not that this is a common occurrence. And as unfortunate as it is, we do believe that, hopefully, it's a one-off. But again, I will relate you to their earnings call that what's going to happen in -- I think, in August 12.

Wheat carriers are there.

You heard me saying several times about our flex capacity and how we have added to our plans the ability to crush more soybeans. And we have done that in several parts of the world, not only North America, but also in Europe. And there has been the bottlenecks. We reported this quarter record soybean crush in both Europe and North America. And that's the fruits basically of our operational excellence supporting which every plant is being able to turn a little bit more of a bigger output as the market demand.

So some of the legacy business is one of the businesses for example, hydrocolloids. Hydrocolloids go like about half of it to food applications, and that continues to go very well, but about half of it goes to drilling fluids. And as you can read, the industry had basically reduced significantly the drilling in the U.S. So that market has been significantly impacted. So nothing to do with our food strategy, if you will, but it happens that we'll report it in that segment. The second is related to fibers. The fibers market has a little bit of overcapacity. So prices have been soft there and we have more competition. And one of the businesses that we acquired, SCI, have had some issues with inventory that we needed to write off or sell it at a discount, because it might not have been in the greatest of conditions. So all those 3 things basically impacted the WFSI business. On the other hand, WILD Flavors is growing significantly and is going to post growth of about 20% year-over-year on the -- basically, on innovation that is happening at the customer level. So when we talked about the revenue synergies being a little bit slow, it's because, obviously, you need to -- first of all, you need to think about how to combine all these products into a new solution. And then you create the prototypes and then you present those to the customer and the customers create the marketing campaign and also look at the potential for that product and look at the stability of those products. So that approval process takes a little bit longer, especially in some of the companies that are very much focusing nowadays on costs, on productivity, and it may not have that many people to take care of these products. So that's why we try to ramp up a little bit more of the cost synergies to make sure we don't fall behind in our promises. But as I said, the WILD Flavors business is going strong and having again probably a 20% increase in profits versus already a record year like it was 2015. So we are extremely proud of the business."

And some of these products are more at the developmental stage, if you will, but some you can see in the press releases that we continue to launch these products. At this point in time, I cannot give you top of my head something that you could look at to track the progression of that portfolio. But traditionally, 5 years ago, we look at trying to replace 10% of the grind, if you will, just in case high fructose corn syrup were going to decline 2% per year, which it hasn't happened. So we haven't needed to bring all those products, but we have all those developments.

This morning, we reported third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.59. Our adjusted segment operating profit was $650 million. After working through the challenging environment in the first half of the year, we capitalized on improving operating conditions in the third quarter and are positioned well for a solid finish to the year. 
Ag Services results were driven by U.S. exports that surged through the quarter, creating improved merchandising opportunities as the global market relied heavily on U.S. exports of corn and soybeans. Results for corn included strong performance in North American sweeteners and starches, growth from our international corn operations and a steady results for bioproducts. Oilseeds results were impacted by significantly lower global soy crush margins, weaker origination results in Brazil and the unusual equity loss from our Wilmar investment. WFSI results included strong growth from WILD Flavors with mixed results from our specialty ingredients businesses. 
During the quarter, we continued to execute on our strategic plan. We acquired Caterina Foods, a manufacturer of specialty gluten-free and high-protein pastas. in addition, we further invested in Asia's growing and evolving food demand by increasing our strategic ownership stake in Wilmar to 23%. Our ethanol dry mill review has progressed, and we are targeting receipt of final proposal from a short list of interested parties by the end of the calendar year. And we have implemented nearly $250 million of new run rate savings actions through the third quarter and expect to exceed our $275 million target by the end of the calendar year.  In line with our balanced capital allocation framework, we have returned $1.3 billion to shareholders in dividends and share buybacks through the first 9 months of the year. 
With improving market conditions and a large U.S. harvest, combined with the team's solid execution capabilities, we feel good about the remainder of the year and a stronger 2017. I'll provide more detail on our scorecard progress later in the call. Now I'll turn the call over to Ray."

Slide 4 provides some financial highlights for the quarter. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.59 versus $0.60 in the year-ago quarter. Excluding specified items, adjustment -- adjusted segment operating profit was $650 million, down $34 mi",816,"Thanks, Juan. Slide 4 provides some financial highlights for the quarter. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.59 versus $0.60 in the year-ago quarter. Excluding specified items, adjustment -- adjusted segment operating profit was $650 million, down $34 million, mostly on Wilmar results. 
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 28% compared to 31% in the third quarter of the prior year. Our tax rate is lower this quarter compared to last year due to the geographic mix of earnings and the tax impact of portfolio management actions taken last year and this year.  Our effective tax rate this quarter is consistent with the 28% guidance for the calendar year that I provided to you at the last quarter's call. 
Our trailing 4-quarter average ROIC of 5.8% is 80 basis points below our 2016 annual WACC of 6.6%. The lower ROIC reflects the challenging operating conditions that we have experienced during the latter part of 2015 and the first half of 2016. We do expect our 4-quarter trailing ROIC to improve as we move to the end of this year.
On Chart 18 in the appendix, you can see the reconciliation of our recorded quarterly earnings of $0.58 per share to the adjusted earnings of $0.59 per share. For this quarter, we had impairments, restructuring and settlement charges of $0.08 per share. We had losses on sales of assets of both $0.02 per share. These were offset by about $0.09 of LIFO inventory credit.
Slide 5 provides an operating profit summary in the [ph] components of our corporate line. Before Juan discusses the operating results, I'd like to highlight some of the unique items impacting our quarterly results. 
In the operating segments, we had some small impairments and restructuring costs and loss on disposals of assets. As a reminder, the results of the equity earnings at Wilmar are reported by ADM on a 1-quarter lag basis. The Asia loss in oilseeds reflects ADM's portion of the Wilmar loss reported in their second quarter results. 
In the corporate line, net interest expense was up slightly due to interest on $1 billion of new long-term debt issued this quarter and the absence of an interest credit related to tax provisions in the prior year. Unallocated corporate costs of $106 million were down from the year-ago quarter, primarily due to lower SG&A costs and lower spending on various strategic projects.  Minority interest and other include some impairment charges on certain investments and a settlement in related expenses. I'd also like to highlight that our prior year numbers included a charge of $198 million related to buying back higher-cost U.S. debt and issuing lower-cost euro-denominated debt.
Turning to the cash flow statement on Slide 6. You can see that cash flow statement for the first 9 months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period the prior year. We generated about $1.6 billion from operations before working capital changes during the period, slightly higher than the same period last year. Total capital spending for the period was $621 million, down from the prior year's $819 million. Capital spending has been lower during the more challenging first half of 2016, and we do expect to finish up the year spending below $1 billion. 
Acquisitions of $136 million to date includes Harvest Innovations; Medsofts, the Moroccan corn processing operation; and Caterina Foods. Included in the other investing activities line is our increased investment in Wilmar to a 23% level. 
During the current period, we spent $754 million to repurchase approximately 20 million shares. We're heading towards repurchasing about $1 billion this calendar year. Our average share count for the period was 589 million diluted shares outstanding.  Our total return of capital to shareholders, including dividends, was about $1.3 billion for this 9-month period. 
Slide 7 shows the highlights of our balance sheet as of September 30, 2016, and 2015. Our operating working capital of $7.3 billion was down about $600 million from the year-ago period. Total debt was approximately $7.1 billion, resulting in a net debt balance, that is debt less cash, of $6.1 billion, up slightly from the 2015 net debt level of $5.6 billion.  Earlier in the third quarter, we issued $1 billion of U.S. 10-year debt at a coupon of 2.5%, the lowest-cost U.S. long-term debt in our portfolio. 
Our leverage position remains comfortable with a net debt-to-total capital ratio of about 25%. Our shareholders' equity of $17.6 billion was down from the $17.9 billion level last year, due primarily to shareholder capital returns in the excess of net income and a decrease in the cumulative translation account. We had $6.1 billion in available global credit capacity at the end of September. If you add the available cash, we had access to over $7 billion of short-term liquidity.  Our balance sheet remains solid. 
Next, Juan will take us through a review of the business performance and drivers."

Please turn to Slide 8. In the third quarter, we earned $650 million of operating profit, excluding specified items, down from the $684 million from last year's third quarter. As we explained last quarter, some of the challenging condition",1852,"Thank you, Ray. Please turn to Slide 8. In the third quarter, we earned $650 million of operating profit, excluding specified items, down from the $684 million from last year's third quarter. As we explained last quarter, some of the challenging conditions we saw in the first half of the year began to subside late in the second quarter. This led to a more favorable environment in the third quarter.  As a result, we were able to execute well and capitalize on the more favorable environment. 
Adjusted segment operating profit was up about 13% versus last quarter, but down about 5% versus the year-ago quarter.  It is important to note that the unusual loss related to our equity earnings of [ph] Wilmar negatively impacted us this quarter. Excluding Wilmar, our third quarter operating profit would have been up about 8% year-over-year. 
Following are some of brief highlights. In Ag Services, we saw improving market conditions, particularly increased competitiveness of U.S. corn and soybeans especially late in the quarter as we were able to export record volumes. Results for corn included continued strong performance in sweeteners and starches as the North American business continued to perform well with solid demand, production efficiencies and improved raw material costs.
Oilseeds results were impacted by lower global soy crush margins, lower origination volumes due to the reduced Brazilian soybean and corn crop and the Wilmar results in Asia. Excluding the start-up items, WFSI operating profit was up slightly compared to the year-ago quarter. 
Now I'll review the performance of each segment and provide additional detail. So starting on Slide 9. Ag Services results benefited from record export volumes as crop shortages in South America accelerated this year's seasonal shift in global demand to North America. In addition, as the record North American harvest started in the quarter, we saw improved merchandising, warehousing and storage opportunities as well as improved margins. Our global trade desk results were lower in the quarter as some commodity prices declined, causing global buyers to draw down their inventories, which limited merchandising opportunities.
In transportation, results were up due to increased utilization, strong exports and improved freight rates. Milling and Other had another solid quarter, with results consistent with the third quarter last year on strong product margins related to seasonal demand.
Please turn to Slide 10. Corn Processing results were up sequentially and year-over-year. Sweeteners and starches results improved as the North American business continued to perform well with solid demand in the U.S. and Mexico, continued production efficiency improvements and lower raw material costs. The company's international corn operations performed very well in the quarter. We continue to integrate our European Eaststarch operations and are tracking well on fully capturing their identified synergies.
Our Olenex joint venture in Mexico also performed well in the quarter. Bioproducts results, excluding last year's Brazilian sugar impairment charge, were essentially flat with improved operational performance and margins from Animal Nutrition offset by the slightly lower ethanol results compared to last year.
Slide 11, please. Oilseeds results were down in the third quarter versus a strong quarter 1 year ago. Crushing and origination results declined significantly versus a strong year-ago quarter due to lower soybean crushing margins as competing proteins, such as DDGs end feed weed, displaced soy mill in some filtrations. [ph] We also saw some period of increased competitiveness of Argentine mill. Oilseeds results were also impacted by weaker origination in Brazil due to the smaller soybean and corn crop, which created a high cost structure in our silo and transportation network during the quarter.
In addition, producer commercialization of next year's soybean and corn crop decreased due to lower commodity prices and the continued strength of the Brazilian real. Refining, packaging, biodiesel and other results were up from 1 year ago, mainly due to good performance in biodiesel and Specialty Fats and Oils. In addition, our refined oils business continued to have a strong performance supported by solid food demand and strong biodiesel volumes.
Our Golden Peanut and Tree Nuts business had a good quarter, benefiting from the facility expansion at our plant in Dawson, Georgia. We also saw the results from the operational efficiency improvements we made in our procurement and Chilean operations throughout our network. 
Oilseeds results in Asia for the quarter declined from the year-ago period due to the impact of ADM's share of Wilmar's unusual loss in the second quarter. In fact, it was Wilmar's first-ever quarterly loss. ADM records the share of Wilmar results on a 1-quarter lag basis and recorded $48 million of equity losses in the third quarter versus a $36 million gain in the third quarter of 2015. 
On Slide 12, please. WFSI results were up slightly compared to the third quarter last year. We saw strong operating profit growth for WILD Flavors and good performance from Eatem Foods, offset by mixed results from our specialty ingredients businesses. In protein, we saw strong overall demand, led by functional concentrate and textured concentrate.
Results for the quarter included operational start-up costs for Tianjin and Campo Grande. Also in the quarter, we again added to our capabilities with the acquisition of Caterina Foods, a leading sole [ph] manufacturer of specialty gluten-free and high-protein pastas. Adding the Caterina business help us as we continue building our portfolio to meet the needs of health-conscious consumers.
WILD Flavors saw an 8% increase in revenue with a 20% increase in operating profit. However, the challenges we've highlighted in recent quarters with some of our specialty ingredients business, SCI, edible beans and hydrocolloids, have continued. 
Our fibers business has been subject to industry oversupply issues that have kept pricing down. Partially offsetting these negatives have seen -- has been some strength in our specialty proteins business in the quarter.
Our SCI business has experienced some operational issues that have resulted in inventory write-downs and some lost sales over the past year. We are addressing these issues aggressively. As we've continued to work with customers and other businesses within ADM, we've recognized that we can be more effective at meeting customer needs and driving performance by aligning SCI's businesses into other areas of the company. We believe that we can more easily achieve synergies and improve top line sales under a new organizational structure. I have teams working through those details right now.
Now on Slide 13, I'd like to update you on how we continue to strengthen and grow our company. We've highlighted some of the areas in which we made significant progress. I'll discuss a few. We recently expanded and streamlined operations at our Golden Peanut and Tree Nuts crush facility in Dawson, Georgia, and we are already seeing the result of this operational efficiency improvement.
We have progressed our ethanol dry mill review. We are targeting receipt of final proposals from a shortlist of interested parties by the end of the calendar year. We have implemented nearly $250 million of new run rate savings actions through the end of the third quarter and expect to exceed our $275 million target by the end of the calendar year.
During the third quarter, we completed the successful deployment and go-live of our One ADM business transformation with our Ag Services U.S. elevator system covering more than 200 locations. Our One ADM program is our multiyear global investment that will help the company improve and standardize our business processes and deliver greater efficiency and effectiveness in our activities. I am proud that this significant deployment was delivered on time and under budget and with quality levels of execution, providing us confidence as we move to the next phases of the One ADM program.
We also during the quarter acquired Caterina Foods, a manufacturer of specialty gluten-free and high-protein pastas to continue meeting the needs of health-conscious consumers. And our Stratas Foods joint venture recently acquired Supreme Oils, a U.S.-based manufacturer and distributor of edible oils and related products. Stratas Foods is our joint venture with ACH Food Companies and is North America's leading supplier of fats and oils to the foodservice, food ingredients and retail private-label markets. Adding Supreme Oils provides a JV with manufacturing locations in Tennessee, Alabama and New Jersey. The Northeast presence is important and is one of the largest consumer consumption areas for edible oils and one where Stratas lack a presence. This acquisition provides Stratas with entry into the growing seasonings, sauces and condiments category, and its products and operations offer good opportunities for both cost and revenue synergies.
These are just a few of the highlights from the quarter. We'll continue to update you on our progress each quarter. 
And now before we take your questions, I wanted to offer some additional forward perspectives. As I indicated last quarter, the first half of the year presented some challenging conditions. However, we are seeing an improving operating environment in the second half of the year that we believe sets the stage for a stronger 2017. For Ag Services, the North American Harvest is progressing well, and we're seeing record yields and production for both corn and soybeans. We expect this to translate into continued solid results for export volumes and better global merchandising and handling opportunities as we finish out the year. Export origination margins, while good and improved versus last year, are not at the same levels we realized in 2014.
For corn, while fourth quarter volumes are expected to be down due to normal seasonality, we are optimistic in 2017 for our sweeteners and starches business, with global sugar prices up significantly year-over-year and the ongoing progress of our operational excellence initiatives. Ethanol margins are currently being supported by strong domestic and export demand.  As in the past, margins will be a function of the supply/demand balance and the impact of net inventory levels. 
As I mentioned earlier, we have made progress with our ethanol dry mill review. We have 7 original parties express interest, and we have now narrowed that list to a smaller number. We are having these parties undertake some additional due diligence prior to them submitting final proposals, which we are targeting for the end of the calendar year.
For Oilseeds, with ample soybeans from the record U.S. harvest, along with solid domestic demand, crushing volumes are expected to be seasonally high in the coming months. Crush margins could experience some short-term resistance from competing global proteins.
South America grain origination margin will be depending on new crop volumes. At present, new crop origination volumes are slow and behind plan. However, we do anticipate ultimately procuring the crop. The fundamentals of increased global protein consumption point to a long-term sustainable trend, which supports higher soymilk demand and higher industry capacity utilization into the future.
For WFSI, the fourth quarter is traditionally our low-volume quarter as WILD Flavors experiences some typical seasonality from the beverage industry. We expect continuous strong results from protein in the fourth quarter. We will incur continued start-up cost for our Tianjin and Campo Grande plants as they begin their first phases of production late in the quarter.
So with that, operator, please open the line for questions."

But early planting conditions have maybe making a little bit more difficult to that than some people have had started to plant some soybeans. So I think it's a fluid situation.

At the same time, we saw our base being impacted by some of these headwinds going down from maybe a $3 level to maybe a $2.40 level. Obviously, we're coming back from that. As you can see this quarter, and as you're going to see in Q4 and hopefully, with a stronger '17, still difficult to quantify given that we have only 1 quarter of that, how much of that base deterioration are you going to recover. With regards to the ethanol dry mills, as you heard me say in the prepared remarks, we are waiting for the second round of beats before the end of the year. And at that point in time, Farha, we will sit down and assess the offer so that we have in front of us and we will make a decision based on that.

So if you look at the underperformance of oilseeds, 60% of that is explained by the Wilmar, which is very unusual results. So when you look at the performance of oilseeds per se, we have origination inside oilseeds for Brazil. And the farmer in Brazil, there was 40% sold by this time last year, it's only 20% sold now. So we had less volume going through our operations. And if you think about the crush margins in the U.S, we didn't have some of the pressure that exports of mill of broad maybe last year to the U.S. So obviously, with a big run-up in mill price by mid-of the year, by June or something like that, other things became more competitive, whether it's a low-quality feed wheat or whether it's DDGs or corn, got a little bit into the rush. And so we think that demand is very strong. Still, we're thinking about 5% mill consumption growth for next year. And we believe that the U.S. will have high crush margins.

In terms of the exports, we said before that 2014 was an unusual year because with all the fracking that was basically taking a big part of the rail system in the U.S., there was a little bit of a glut going into the New Orleans area. This year, although maybe you were reflecting on some recent issues with transportation, in general, if you compare to 2014, oil velocity have been so much better. Freights have been lowered. So in general, we didn't get to the same level of elevation margins that we get into 2014. So volumes are good. Volumes continue to be very, very strong into Q4 and margins are okay.

One thing I do want to point out, I mean, as Juan indicated, we talked about the One ADM program, whereby we're actually implementing this business transformation program within the company. It does cost money. For example, this year, on One ADM, we're spending about $100 million as part of that project. Some of it is capital. Some of it is operating expenses. This program is ramping up. So therefore, I do expect next year, our spending will increase as we ramp up this program. We'll provide more context in the fourth quarter call because we're still working through what the actual spend will be.

This morning, we reported third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.59. Our adjusted segment operating profit was $650 million. After working through the challenging environment in the first half of the year, we capitalized on improving operating conditions in the third quarter and are positioned well for a solid finish to the year. 
Ag Services results were driven by U.S. exports that surged through the quarter, creating improved merchandising opportunities as the global market relied heavily on U.S. exports of corn and soybeans. Results for corn included strong performance in North American sweeteners and starches, growth from our international corn operations and a steady results for bioproducts. Oilseeds results were impacted by significantly lower global soy crush margins, weaker origination results in Brazil and the unusual equity loss from our Wilmar investment. WFSI results included strong growth from WILD Flavors with mixed results from our specialty ingredients businesses. 
During the quarter, we continued to execute on our strategic plan. We acquired Caterina Foods, a manufacturer of specialty gluten-free and high-protein pastas. in addition, we further invested in Asia's growing and evolving food demand by increasing our strategic ownership stake in Wilmar to 23%. Our ethanol dry mill review has progressed, and we are targeting receipt of final proposal from a short list of interested parties by the end of the calendar year. And we have implemented nearly $250 million of new run rate savings actions through the third quarter and expect to exceed our $275 million target by the end of the calendar year. In line with our balanced capital allocation framework, we have returned $1.3 billion to shareholders in dividends and share buybacks through the first 9 months of the year. 
With improving market conditions and a large U.S. harvest, combined with the team's solid execution capabilities, we feel good about the remainder of the year and a stronger 2017. I'll provide more detail on our scorecard progress later in the call. Now I'll turn the call over to Ray."

Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.59 versus $0.60 in the year-ago quarter. Excluding specified items, adjustment -- adjusted segment operating profit was $650 million, down $34 million, mostly on Wilmar results. 
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 28% compared to 31% in the third quarter of the prior year. Our tax rate is lower this quarter compared to last year due to the geographic mix of earnings and the tax impact of portfolio management actions taken last year and this year. Our effective tax rate this quarter is consistent with the 28% guidance for the calendar year that I provided to you at the last quarter's call. 
Our trailing 4-quarter average ROIC of 5.8% is 80 basis points below our 2016 annual WACC of 6.6%. The lower ROIC reflects the challenging operating conditions that we have experienced during the latter part of 2015 and the first half of 2016. We do expect our 4-quarter trailing ROIC to improve as we move to the end of this year.
On Chart 18 in the appendix, you can see the reconciliation of our recorded quarterly earnings of $0.58 per share to the adjusted earnings of $0.59 per share. For this quarter, we had impairments, restructuring and settlement charges of $0.08 per share. We had losses on sales of assets of both $0.02 per share. These were offset by about $0.09 of LIFO inventory credit.
Slide 5 provides an operating profit summary and the components of our corporate line. Before Juan discusses the operating results, I'd like to highlight some of the unique items impacting our quarterly results. 
In the operating segments, we had some small impairments and restructuring costs and loss on disposals of assets. As a reminder, the results of the equity earnings at Wilmar are reported by ADM on a 1-quarter lag basis. The Asia loss in oilseeds reflects ADM's portion of the Wilmar loss reported in their second quarter results. 
In the corporate line, net interest expense was up slightly due to interest on $1 billion of new long-term debt issued this quarter and the absence of an interest credit related to tax provisions in the prior year. Unallocated corporate costs of $106 million were down from the year-ago quarter, primarily due to lower SG&A costs and lower spending on various strategic projects. Minority interest and other include some impairment charges on certain investments and a settlement in related expenses. I'd also like to highlight that our prior year numbers included a charge of $198 million related to buying back higher-cost U.S. debt and issuing lower-cost euro-denominated debt.
Turning to the cash flow statement on Slide 6. You can see that cash flow statement for the first 9 months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period the prior year. We generated about $1.6 billion from operations before working capital changes during the period, slightly higher than the same period last year. Total capital spending for the period was $621 million, down from the prior year's $819 million. Capital spending has been lower during the more challenging first half of 2016, and we do expect to finish up the year spending below $1 billion. 
Acquisitions of $136 million to date includes Harvest Innovations; Medsofts, the Moroccan corn processing operation; and Caterina Foods. Included in the other investing activities line is our increased investment in Wilmar to a 23% level. 
During the current period, we spent $754 million to repurchase approximately 20 million shares. We're heading towards repurchasing about $1 billion this calendar year. Our average share count for the period was 589 million diluted shares outstanding. Our total return of capital to shareholders, including dividends, was about $1.3 billion for this 9-month period. 
Slide 7 shows the highlights of our balance sheet as of September 30, 2016, and 2015. Our operating working capital of $7.3 billion was down about $600 million from the year-ago period. Total debt was approximately $7.1 billion, resulting in a net debt balance, that is debt less cash, of $6.1 billion, up slightly from the 2015 net debt level of $5.6 billion. Earlier in the third quarter, we issued $1 billion of U.S. 10-year debt at a coupon of 2.5%, the lowest-cost U.S. long-term debt in our portfolio. 
Our leverage position remains comfortable with a net debt-to-total capital ratio of about 25%. Our shareholders' equity of $17.6 billion was down from the $17.9 billion level last year, due primarily to shareholder capital returns in the excess of net income and a decrease in the cumulative translation account. We had $6.1 billion in available global credit capacity at the end of September. If you add the available cash, we had access to over $7 billion of short-term liquidity. Our balance sheet remains solid. 
Next, Juan will take us through a review of the business performance and drivers."

Please turn to Slide 8. In the third quarter, we earned $650 million of operating profit, excluding specified items, down from the $684 million from last year's third quarter. As we explained last quarter, some of the challenging condition",1850,"Thank you, Ray. Please turn to Slide 8. In the third quarter, we earned $650 million of operating profit, excluding specified items, down from the $684 million from last year's third quarter. As we explained last quarter, some of the challenging conditions we saw in the first half of the year began to subside late in the second quarter. This led to a more favorable environment in the third quarter. As a result, we were able to execute well and capitalize on the more favorable environment. 
Adjusted segment operating profit was up about 13% versus last quarter, but down about 5% versus the year-ago quarter. It is important to note that the unusual loss related to our equity earnings of Wilmar negatively impacted us this quarter. Excluding Wilmar, our third quarter operating profit would have been up about 8% year-over-year. 
Following are some of brief highlights. In Ag Services, we saw improving market conditions, particularly increased competitiveness of U.S. corn and soybeans especially late in the quarter as we were able to export record volumes. Results for corn included continued strong performance in sweeteners and starches as the North American business continued to perform well with solid demand, production efficiencies and improved raw material costs.
Oilseeds results were impacted by lower global soy crush margins, lower origination volumes due to the reduced Brazilian soybean and corn crop and the Wilmar results in Asia. Excluding the start-up items, WFSI operating profit was up slightly compared to the year-ago quarter. 
Now I'll review the performance of each segment and provide additional detail. So starting on Slide 9. Ag Services results benefited from record export volumes as crop shortages in South America accelerated this year's seasonal shift in global demand to North America. In addition, as the record North American harvest started in the quarter, we saw improved merchandising, warehousing and storage opportunities as well as improved margins. Our global trade desk results were lower in the quarter as some commodity prices declined, causing global buyers to draw down their inventories, which limited merchandising opportunities.
In transportation, results were up due to increased utilization, strong exports and improved freight rates. Milling and Other had another solid quarter, with results consistent with the third quarter last year on strong product margins related to seasonal demand.
Please turn to Slide 10. Corn Processing results were up sequentially and year-over-year. Sweeteners and starches results improved as the North American business continued to perform well with solid demand in the U.S. and Mexico, continued production efficiency improvements and lower raw material costs. The company's international corn operations performed very well in the quarter. We continue to integrate our European Eaststarch operations and are tracking well on fully capturing their identified synergies.
Our Olenex joint venture in Mexico also performed well in the quarter. Bioproducts results, excluding last year's Brazilian sugar impairment charge, were essentially flat with improved operational performance and margins from Animal Nutrition offset by the slightly lower ethanol results compared to last year.
Slide 11, please. Oilseeds results were down in the third quarter versus a strong quarter 1 year ago. Crushing and origination results declined significantly versus a strong year-ago quarter due to lower soybean crushing margins as competing proteins, such as DDGs end feed weed, displaced soy mill in some feed rations. We also saw some period of increased competitiveness of Argentine mill. Oilseeds results were also impacted by weaker origination in Brazil due to the smaller soybean and corn crop, which created a high cost structure in our silo and transportation network during the quarter.
In addition, producer commercialization of next year's soybean and corn crop decreased due to lower commodity prices and the continued strength of the Brazilian real. Refining, packaging, biodiesel and other results were up from 1 year ago, mainly due to good performance in biodiesel and Specialty Fats and Oils. In addition, our refined oils business continued to have a strong performance supported by solid food demand and strong biodiesel volumes.
Our Golden Peanut and Tree Nuts business had a good quarter, benefiting from the facility expansion at our plant in Dawson, Georgia. We also saw the results from the operational efficiency improvements we made in our procurement and Chilean operations throughout our network. 
Oilseeds results in Asia for the quarter declined from the year-ago period due to the impact of ADM's share of Wilmar's unusual loss in the second quarter. In fact, it was Wilmar's first-ever quarterly loss. ADM records the share of Wilmar results on a 1-quarter lag basis and recorded $48 million of equity losses in the third quarter versus a $36 million gain in the third quarter of 2015. 
On Slide 12, please. WFSI results were up slightly compared to the third quarter last year. We saw strong operating profit growth for WILD Flavors and good performance from Eatem Foods, offset by mixed results from our specialty ingredients businesses. In protein, we saw strong overall demand, led by functional concentrate and textured concentrate.
Results for the quarter included operational start-up costs for Tianjin and Campo Grande. Also in the quarter, we again added to our capabilities with the acquisition of Caterina Foods, a leading toll manufacturer of specialty gluten-free and high-protein pastas. Adding the Caterina business help us as we continue building our portfolio to meet the needs of health-conscious consumers.
WILD Flavors saw an 8% increase in revenue with a 20% increase in operating profit. However, the challenges we've highlighted in recent quarters with some of our specialty ingredients business, SCI, edible beans and hydrocolloids, have continued. 
Our fibers business has been subject to industry oversupply issues that have kept pricing down. Partially offsetting these negatives have seen -- has been some strength in our specialty proteins business in the quarter.
Our SCI business has experienced some operational issues that have resulted in inventory write-downs and some lost sales over the past year. We are addressing these issues aggressively. As we've continued to work with customers and other businesses within ADM, we've recognized that we can be more effective at meeting customer needs and driving performance by aligning SCI's businesses into other areas of the company. We believe that we can more easily achieve synergies and improve top line sales under a new organizational structure. I have teams working through those details right now.
Now on Slide 13, I'd like to update you on how we continue to strengthen and grow our company. We've highlighted some of the areas in which we made significant progress. I'll discuss a few. We recently expanded and streamlined operations at our Golden Peanut and Tree Nuts crush facility in Dawson, Georgia, and we are already seeing the result of this operational efficiency improvement.
We have progressed our ethanol dry mill review. We are targeting receipt of final proposals from a shortlist of interested parties by the end of the calendar year. We have implemented nearly $250 million of new run rate savings actions through the end of the third quarter and expect to exceed our $275 million target by the end of the calendar year.
During the third quarter, we completed the successful deployment and go-live of our One ADM business transformation with our Ag Services U.S. elevator system covering more than 200 locations. Our One ADM program is our multiyear global investment that will help the company improve and standardize our business processes and deliver greater efficiency and effectiveness in our activities. I am proud that this significant deployment was delivered on time and under budget and with quality levels of execution, providing us confidence as we move to the next phases of the One ADM program.
We also during the quarter acquired Caterina Foods, a manufacturer of specialty gluten-free and high-protein pastas to continue meeting the needs of health-conscious consumers. And our Stratas Foods joint venture recently acquired Supreme Oils, a U.S.-based manufacturer and distributor of edible oils and related products. Stratas Foods is our joint venture with ACH Food Companies and is North America's leading supplier of fats and oils to the foodservice, food ingredients and retail private-label markets. Adding Supreme Oils provides a JV with manufacturing locations in Tennessee, Alabama and New Jersey. The Northeast presence is important and is one of the largest consumer consumption areas for edible oils and one where Stratas lack a presence. This acquisition provides Stratas with entry into the growing seasonings, sauces and condiments category, and its products and operations offer good opportunities for both cost and revenue synergies.
These are just a few of the highlights from the quarter. We'll continue to update you on our progress each quarter. 
And now before we take your questions, I wanted to offer some additional forward perspectives. As I indicated last quarter, the first half of the year presented some challenging conditions. However, we are seeing an improving operating environment in the second half of the year that we believe sets the stage for a stronger 2017. For Ag Services, the North American Harvest is progressing well, and we're seeing record yields and production for both corn and soybeans. We expect this to translate into continued solid results for export volumes and better global merchandising and handling opportunities as we finish out the year. Export origination margins, while good and improved versus last year, are not at the same levels we realized in 2014.
For corn, while fourth quarter volumes are expected to be down due to normal seasonality, we are optimistic in 2017 for our sweeteners and starches business, with global sugar prices up significantly year-over-year and the ongoing progress of our operational excellence initiatives. Ethanol margins are currently being supported by strong domestic and export demand. As in the past, margins will be a function of the supply/demand balance and the impact of net inventory levels. 
As I mentioned earlier, we have made progress with our ethanol dry mill review. We have 7 original parties express interest, and we have now narrowed that list to a smaller number. We are having these parties undertake some additional due diligence prior to them submitting final proposals, which we are targeting for the end of the calendar year.
For Oilseeds, with ample soybeans from the record U.S. harvest, along with solid domestic demand, crushing volumes are expected to be seasonally high in the coming months. Crush margins could experience some short-term resistance from competing global proteins.
South America grain origination margin will be depending on new crop volumes. At present, new crop origination volumes are slow and behind plan. However, we do anticipate ultimately procuring the crop. The fundamentals of increased global protein consumption point to a long-term sustainable trend, which supports higher soymilk demand and higher industry capacity utilization into the future.
For WFSI, the fourth quarter is traditionally our low-volume quarter as WILD Flavors experiences some typical seasonality from the beverage industry. We expect continuous strong results from protein in the fourth quarter. We will incur continued start-up cost for our Tianjin and Campo Grande plants as they begin their first phases of production late in the quarter.
So with that, operator, please open the line for questions."

But early planting conditions are maybe making it a little bit more difficult to that than and some people have started to plant some soybeans. So I think it's a fluid situation.

I will say, from our perspective, first of all, you were comparing with a very strong quarter last year. So if you look at the underperformance of Oilseeds, 60% of that is explained by the Wilmar, which is a very unusual result. So when you look at the performance of Oilseeds per se, we have origination inside Oilseeds for Brazil. And the farmer in Brazil, there was 40% sold by this time last year. It's only 20% sold now. So we have less volume going through our operations. And if you think about the crush margins in the U.S., we didn't have some of the pressure that exports of mill brought maybe last year to the U.S. So obviously, with a big run-up in mill prices by mid of the year, by June or something like that, other things became more competitive, whether it's a low-quality feed wheat or whether it's DDGs or corn, got a little bit into the rush. And so we think that demand is very strong. Still, we're thinking about 5% meal consumption growth for next year, and we believe that the U.S. will have high crush margins. And we feel good about the potential expansion of that crushing margin is that it could be a little bit attenuated by the fact that we need to fight with some substitution maybe over the next quarter. But we feel good, in general, about Oilseeds."

In terms of the exports, we said before that 2014 was an unusual year because with all the fracking that was basically taking a big part of the rail system in the U.S., there was a little bit of a glut going into the New Orleans area. This year -- although maybe you were reflecting on some recent issues with transportation. In general, if you compare to 2014, rail velocity has been so much better. Freights have been lowered. So in general, we didn't get to the same level of elevation margins that we got in 2014, so volumes are good. Volumes continue to be very strong into Q4, and margins are okay.

But you should expect us to actually continue to have some good targets in terms of operational excellence because, clearly, there's still more opportunities to be had. One thing I do want to point out, I mean, as Juan indicated, we talked about the One ADM program, whereby we're actually implementing this business transformation program within the company. It does cost money. For example, this year, on One ADM, we're spending about $100 million as part of that project. Some of it's capital. Some of it's operating expenses. This program is ramping up. So therefore, I do expect next year, our spending will increase as we ramp up this program. We'll provide more context in the fourth quarter call because we're still working through what the actual spend will be. But what we're doing is we're actually taking some of these cost savings that we've had, and we're going to reinvest in the company.

This morning, we reported third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.59. Our adjusted segment operating profit was $650 million. After working through the challenging environment in the first half of the year, we capitalized on improving operating conditions in the third quarter and are positioned well for a solid finish to the year. 
Ag Services results were driven by U.S. exports that surged through the quarter, creating improved merchandising opportunities as the global market relied heavily on U.S. exports of corn and soybeans. Results for corn included strong performance in North American sweeteners and starches, growth from our international corn operations and a steady result for bioproducts. Oilseeds results were impacted by significantly lower global soy crush margins, weaker origination results in Brazil and the unusual equity loss from our Wilmar investment. WFSI results included strong growth from WILD Flavors with mixed results from our specialty ingredients businesses. 
During the quarter, we continued to execute on our strategic plan. We acquired Caterina Foods, a manufacturer of specialty gluten-free and high-protein pastas. In addition, we further invested in Asia's growing and evolving food demand by increasing our strategic ownership stake in Wilmar to 23%. Our ethanol dry mill review has progressed, and we are targeting receipt of final proposal from a short list of interested parties by the end of the calendar year. And we have implemented nearly $250 million of new run rate savings actions through the third quarter and expect to exceed our $275 million target by the end of the calendar year. In line with our balanced capital allocation framework, we have returned $1.3 billion to shareholders in dividends and share buybacks through the first 9 months of the year. 
With improving market conditions and a large U.S. harvest, combined with the team's solid execution capabilities, we feel good about the remainder of the year and a stronger 2017. I'll provide more detail on our scorecard progress later in the call. Now I'll turn the call over to Ray."

Excluding specified items, adjustment -- adjusted segment operating profit was $650 million, down $34 mi",815,"Thanks, Juan. Slide 4 provides some financial highlights for the quarter. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.59 versus $0.60 in the year-ago quarter. Excluding specified items, adjustment -- adjusted segment operating profit was $650 million, down $34 million, mostly on Wilmar results. 
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 28% compared to 31% in the third quarter of the prior year. Our tax rate is lower this quarter compared to last year due to the geographic mix of earnings and the tax impact of portfolio management actions taken last year and this year. Our effective tax rate this quarter is consistent with the 28% guidance for the calendar year that I provided to you at the last quarter's call. 
Our trailing 4-quarter average ROIC of 5.8% is 80 basis points below our 2016 annual WACC of 6.6%. The lower ROIC reflects the challenging operating conditions that we have experienced during the latter part of 2015 and the first half of 2016. We do expect our 4-quarter trailing ROIC to improve as we move to the end of this year.
On Chart 18 in the appendix, you can see the reconciliation of our recorded quarterly earnings of $0.58 per share to the adjusted earnings of $0.59 per share. For this quarter, we had impairments, restructuring and settlement charges of $0.08 per share. We had losses on sales of assets of about $0.02 per share. These were offset by about $0.09 of LIFO inventory credit.
Slide 5 provides an operating profit summary and the components of our corporate line. Before Juan discusses the operating results, I'd like to highlight some of the unique items impacting our quarterly results. 
In the operating segments, we had some small impairments and restructuring costs and loss on disposals of assets. As a reminder, the results of the equity earnings at Wilmar are reported by ADM on a 1-quarter lag basis. The Asia loss in oilseeds reflects ADM's portion of the Wilmar loss reported in their second quarter results. 
In the corporate line, net interest expense was up slightly due to interest on $1 billion of new long-term debt issued this quarter and the absence of an interest credit related to tax provisions in the prior year. Unallocated corporate costs of $106 million were down from the year-ago quarter, primarily due to lower SG&A costs and lower spending on various strategic projects. Minority interest and other include some impairment charges on certain investments and a settlement in related expenses. I'd also like to highlight that our prior year numbers included a charge of $198 million related to buying back higher-cost U.S. debt and issuing lower-cost euro-denominated debt.
Turning to the cash flow statement on Slide 6. You can see the cash flow statement for the first 9 months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period the prior year. We generated about $1.6 billion from operations before working capital changes during the period, slightly higher than the same period last year. Total capital spending for the period was $621 million, down from the prior year's $819 million. Capital spending has been lower during the more challenging first half of 2016, and we do expect to finish up the year spending below $1 billion. 
Acquisitions of $136 million to date include Harvest Innovations; Medsofts, the Moroccan corn processing operation; and Caterina Foods. Included in the other investing activities line is our increased investment in Wilmar to a 23% level. 
During the current period, we spent $754 million to repurchase approximately 20 million shares. We're heading towards repurchasing about $1 billion this calendar year. Our average share count for the period was 589 million diluted shares outstanding. Our total return of capital to shareholders, including dividends, was about $1.3 billion for this 9-month period. 
Slide 7 shows the highlights of our balance sheet as of September 30, 2016, and 2015. Our operating working capital of $7.3 billion was down about $600 million from the year-ago period. Total debt was approximately $7.1 billion, resulting in a net debt balance, that is debt less cash, of $6.1 billion, up slightly from the 2015 net debt level of $5.6 billion. Earlier in the third quarter, we issued $1 billion of U.S. 10-year debt at a coupon of 2.5%, the lowest-cost U.S. long-term debt in our portfolio. 
Our leverage position remains comfortable with a net debt-to-total capital ratio of about 25%. Our shareholders' equity of $17.6 billion was down from the $17.9 billion level last year, due primarily to shareholder capital returns in the excess of net income and a decrease in the cumulative translation account. We had $6.1 billion in available global credit capacity at the end of September. If you add the available cash, we had access to over $7 billion of short-term liquidity. Our balance sheet remains solid. 
Next, Juan will take us through a review of the business performance and drivers."

In the third quarter, we earned $650 million of operating profit, excluding specified items, down from the $684 million from last year's third quarter. As we explained last quarter, some of the challenging conditions we saw in the first half of the year began to subside late in the second quarter. This led to a more favorable environment in the third quarter. As a result, we were able to execute well and capitalize on the more favorable environment. 
Adjusted segment operating profit was up about 13% versus last quarter, but down about 5% versus the year-ago quarter. It is important to note that the unusual loss related to our equity earnings of Wilmar negatively impacted us this quarter. Excluding Wilmar, our third quarter operating profit would have been up about 8% year-over-year. 
Following are some of the brief highlights. In Ag Services, we saw improving market conditions, particularly increased competitiveness of U.S. corn and soybeans especially late in the quarter as we were able to export record volumes. Results for corn included continued strong performance in sweeteners and starches as the North American business continued to perform well with solid demand, production efficiencies and improved raw material costs.
Oilseeds results were impacted by lower global soy crush margins, lower origination volumes due to the reduced Brazilian soybean and corn crop and the Wilmar results in Asia. Excluding the start-up items, WFSI operating profit was up slightly compared to the year-ago quarter. 
Now I'll review the performance of each segment and provide additional detail. So starting on Slide 9. Ag Services results benefited from record export volumes as crop shortages in South America accelerated this year's seasonal shift in global demand to North America. In addition, as the record North American harvest started in the quarter, we saw improved merchandising, warehousing and storage opportunities as well as improved margins. Our global trade desk results were lower in the quarter as some commodity prices declined, causing global buyers to draw down their inventories, which limited merchandising opportunities.
In transportation, results were up due to increased utilization, strong exports and improved freight rates. Milling and Other had another solid quarter, with results consistent with the third quarter last year on strong product margins related to seasonal demand.
Please turn to Slide 10. Corn Processing results were up sequentially and year-over-year. Sweeteners and starches results improved as the North American business continued to perform well with solid demand in the U.S. and Mexico, continued production efficiency improvements and lower raw material costs. The company's international corn operations performed very well in the quarter. We continue to integrate our European Eaststarch operations and are tracking well on fully capturing the identified synergies.
Our Olenex joint venture in Mexico also performed well in the quarter. Bioproducts results, excluding last year's Brazilian sugar impairment charge, were essentially flat, with improved operational performance and margins from Animal Nutrition offset by the slightly lower ethanol results compared to last year.
Slide 11, please. Oilseeds results were down in the third quarter versus a strong quarter 1 year ago. Crushing and origination results declined significantly versus a strong year-ago quarter due to lower soybean crushing margins as competing proteins, such as DDGs end feed weed, displaced soy meal in some feed rations. We also saw some period of increased competitiveness of Argentine mill. Oilseeds results were also impacted by weaker origination in Brazil due to the smaller soybean and corn crop, which created a high cost structure in our silo and transportation network during the quarter.
In addition, producer commercialization of next year's soybean and corn crop decreased due to lower commodity prices and the continued strength of the Brazilian real. Refining, packaging, biodiesel and other results were up from 1 year ago, mainly due to good performance in biodiesel and Specialty Fats and Oils. In addition, our refined oils business continued to have a strong performance supported by solid food demand and strong biodiesel volumes.
Our Golden Peanut and Tree Nuts business had a good quarter, benefiting from the facility expansion at our plant in Dawson, Georgia. We also saw the results from the operational efficiency improvements we made in our procurement and Chilean operations throughout our network. 
Oilseeds results in Asia for the quarter declined from the year-ago period due to the impact of ADM's share of Wilmar's unusual loss in the second quarter. In fact, it was Wilmar's first-ever quarterly loss. ADM records the share of Wilmar results on a 1-quarter lag basis and recorded $48 million of equity losses in the third quarter versus a $36 million gain in the third quarter of 2015. 
On Slide 12, please. WFSI results were up slightly compared to the third quarter last year. We saw strong operating profit growth for WILD Flavors and good performance from Eatem Foods, offset by mixed results from our specialty ingredients businesses. In protein, we saw strong overall demand, led by functional concentrate and textured concentrate.
Results for the quarter included operational start-up costs for Tianjin and Campo Grande. Also in the quarter, we again added to our capabilities with the acquisition of Caterina Foods, a leading toll manufacturer of specialty gluten-free and high-protein pastas. Adding the Caterina business helps us as we continue building our portfolio to meet the needs of health-conscious consumers.
WILD Flavors saw an 8% increase in revenue with a 20% increase in operating profit. However, the challenges we've highlighted in recent quarters with some of our specialty ingredients business, SCI, edible beans and hydrocolloids, have continued. 
Our fibers business has been subject to industry oversupply issues that have kept pricing down. Partially offsetting these negatives have seen -- has been some strength in our specialty proteins business in the quarter.
Our SCI business has experienced some operational issues that have resulted in inventory write-downs and some lost sales over the past year. We are addressing these issues aggressively. As we've continued to work with customers and other businesses within ADM, we've recognized that we can be more effective at meeting customer needs and driving performance by aligning SCI's businesses into other areas of the company. We believe that we can more easily achieve synergies and improve top line sales under a new organizational structure. I have teams working through those details right now.
Now on Slide 13, I'd like to update you on how we continue to strengthen and grow our company. We've highlighted some of the areas in which we made significant progress. I'll discuss a few. We recently expanded and streamlined operations at our Golden Peanut and Tree Nuts crush facility in Dawson, Georgia, and we are already seeing the result of this operational efficiency improvement.
We have progressed our ethanol dry mill review. We are targeting receipt of final proposals from a shortlist of interested parties by the end of the calendar year. We have implemented nearly $250 million of new run rate savings actions through the end of the third quarter and expect to exceed our $275 million target by the end of the calendar year.
During the third quarter, we completed the successful deployment and go-live of our One ADM business transformation with our Ag Services U.S. elevator system covering more than 200 locations. Our One ADM program is our multiyear global investment that will help the company improve and standardize our business processes and deliver greater efficiency and effectiveness in our activities. I am proud that this significant deployment was delivered on time and under budget and with quality levels of execution, providing us confidence as we move to the next phases of the One ADM program.
We also during the quarter acquired Caterina Foods, a manufacturer of specialty gluten-free and high-protein pastas, to continue meeting the needs of health-conscious consumers. And our Stratas Foods joint venture recently acquired Supreme Oils, a U.S.-based manufacturer and distributor of edible oils and related products. Stratas Foods is our joint venture with ACH Food Companies and is North America's leading supplier of fats and oils to the foodservice, food ingredients and retail private-label markets. Adding Supreme Oils provides a JV with manufacturing locations in Tennessee, Alabama and New Jersey. The Northeast presence is important and is one of the largest consumer consumption areas for edible oils and one where Stratas lacked a presence. This acquisition provides Stratas with entry into the growing seasonings, sauces and condiments category, and its products and operations offer good opportunities for both cost and revenue synergies.
These are just a few of the highlights from the quarter. We'll continue to update you on our progress each quarter. 
And now before we take your questions, I wanted to offer some additional forward perspectives. As I indicated last quarter, the first half of the year presented some challenging conditions. However, we are seeing an improving operating environment in the second half of the year that we believe sets the stage for a stronger 2017. For Ag Services, the North American Harvest is progressing well, and we're seeing record yields and production for both corn and soybeans. We expect this to translate into continued solid results for export volumes and better global merchandising and handling opportunities as we finish out the year. Export origination margins, while good and improved versus last year, are not at the same levels we realized in 2014.
For corn, while fourth quarter volumes are expected to be down due to normal seasonality, we are optimistic in 2017 for our sweeteners and our starches business, with global sugar prices up significantly year-over-year and the ongoing progress of our operational excellence initiatives. Ethanol margins are currently being supported by strong domestic and export demand. As in the past, margins will be a function of the supply/demand balance and the impact of net inventory levels. 
As I mentioned earlier, we have made progress with our ethanol dry mill review. We have 7 original parties express interest, and we have now narrowed that list to a smaller number. We are having these parties undertake some additional due diligence prior to them submitting final proposals, which we are targeting for the end of the calendar year.
For Oilseeds, with ample soybeans from the record U.S. harvest along with solid domestic demand, crushing volumes are expected to be seasonally high in the coming months. Crush margins could experience some short-term resistance from competing global proteins.
South America grain origination margin will be depending on new crop volumes. At present, new crop origination volumes are slow and behind plan. However, we do anticipate ultimately procuring the crop. The fundamentals of increased global protein consumption point to a long-term sustainable trend, which supports higher soymilk demand and higher industry capacity utilization into the future.
For WFSI, the fourth quarter is traditionally our low-volume quarter as WILD Flavors experiences some typical seasonality from the beverage industry. We expect continued strong results from protein in the fourth quarter. We will incur continued start-up cost for our Tianjin and Campo Grande plants as they begin their first phases of production late in the quarter.
So with that, operator, please open the line for questions."

As you described, the intentions of the farmers has been to shift to corn, some acreage in Argentina. But early planting conditions are maybe making it a little bit more difficult to do that than and some people have started to plant some soybeans. So I think it's a fluid situation.

I would say, from our perspective, first of all, you were comparing with a very strong quarter last year. So if you look at the underperformance of Oilseeds, 60% of that is explained by the Wilmar, which is a very unusual result. So when you look at the performance of Oilseeds per se, we have origination inside Oilseeds for Brazil. And the farmer in Brazil, there was 40% sold by this time last year. It's only 20% sold now. So we have less volume going through our operations. And if you think about the crush margins in the U.S., we didn't have some of the pressure that exports of mill brought maybe last year to the U.S. So obviously, with a big run-up in mill prices by mid of the year, by June or something like that, other things became more competitive, whether it's a low-quality feed wheat or whether it's DDGs or corn, got a little bit into the rush. And so we think that demand is very strong. Still, we're thinking about 5% meal consumption growth for next year, and we believe that the U.S. will have high crush margins. And we feel good about the potential expansion of that crushing margin is that it could be a little bit attenuated by the fact that we need to fight with some substitution maybe over the next quarter. But we feel good, in general, about Oilseeds."

In terms of the exports, we said before that 2014 was an unusual year because with all the fracking that was basically taking a big part of the rail system in the U.S., there was a little bit of a glut going into the New Orleans area. This year -- although maybe you were reflecting on some recent issues with transportation. In general, if you compare to 2014, rail velocity has been so much better. Freights have been lowered. So in general, we didn't get to the same level of elevation margins that we got in 2014, so volumes are good. Volumes continue to be very strong into Q4, and margins are okay. They are not just the record that maybe it used to be in 2014. I don't know -- Ray, is there anything that you would like to add to this?"

But you should expect us to actually continue to have some good targets in terms of operational excellence because, clearly, there's still more opportunities to be had. One thing I do want to point out, I mean, as Juan indicated, we talked about the One ADM program, whereby we're actually implementing this business transformation program within the company. It does cost money. For example, this year, on One ADM, we're spending about $100 million as part of that project. Some of it's capital. Some of it's operating expenses. This program is ramping up. So therefore, I do expect next year, our spending will increase as we ramp up this program. We'll provide more context in the fourth quarter call because we're still working through what the actual spend will be. But what we're doing is we're actually taking some of these cost savings that we've had, and we're going to reinvest in the company. So we're going to reinvest in terms of whether it be business process improvements or we're going to reinvest in R&D and innovation as well.

This morning, we reported third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.59. Our adjusted segment operating profit was $650 million. After working through the challenging environment in the first half of the year, we capitalized on improving operating conditions in the third quarter and are positioned well for a solid finish to the year. 
Ag Services results were driven by U.S. exports that surged through the quarter, creating improved merchandising opportunities as the global market relied heavily on U.S. exports of corn and soybeans. Results for corn included strong performance in North American sweeteners and starches, growth from our international corn operations and a steady result for bioproducts. Oilseeds results were impacted by significantly lower global soy crush margins, weaker origination results in Brazil and the unusual equity loss from our Wilmar investment. WFSI results included strong growth from WILD Flavors with mixed results from our specialty ingredients businesses. 
During the quarter, we continued to execute on our strategic plan. We acquired Caterina Foods, a manufacturer of specialty gluten-free and high-protein pastas. In addition, we further invested in Asia's growing and evolving food demand by increasing our strategic ownership stake in Wilmar to 23%. Our ethanol dry mill review has progressed, and we are targeting receipt of final proposal from a short list of interested parties by the end of the calendar year. And we have implemented nearly $250 million of new run rate savings actions through the third quarter and expect to exceed our $275 million target by the end of the calendar year. In line with our balanced capital allocation framework, we have returned $1.3 billion to shareholders in dividends and share buybacks through the first 9 months of the year. 
With improving market conditions and a large U.S. harvest, combined with the team's solid execution capabilities, we feel good about the remainder of the year and a stronger 2017. I'll provide more detail on our scorecard progress later in the call.

Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $0.59 versus $0.60 in the year-ago quarter. Excluding specified items, adjustment -- adjusted segment operating profit was $650 million, down $34 million, mostly on Wilmar results. 
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 28% compared to 31% in the third quarter of the prior year. Our tax rate is lower this quarter compared to last year due to the geographic mix of earnings and the tax impact of portfolio management actions taken last year and this year. Our effective tax rate this quarter is consistent with the 28% guidance for the calendar year that I provided to you at the last quarter's call. 
Our trailing 4-quarter average ROIC of 5.8% is 80 basis points below our 2016 annual WACC of 6.6%. The lower ROIC reflects the challenging operating conditions that we have experienced during the latter part of 2015 and the first half of 2016. We do expect our 4-quarter trailing ROIC to improve as we move to the end of this year.
On Chart 18 in the appendix, you can see the reconciliation of our recorded quarterly earnings of $0.58 per share to the adjusted earnings of $0.59 per share. For this quarter, we had impairments, restructuring and settlement charges of $0.08 per share. We had losses on sales of assets of about $0.02 per share. These were offset by about $0.09 of LIFO inventory credit.
Slide 5 provides an operating profit summary and the components of our corporate line. Before Juan discusses the operating results, I'd like to highlight some of the unique items impacting our quarterly results. 
In the operating segments, we had some small impairments and restructuring costs and loss on disposals of assets. As a reminder, the results of the equity earnings at Wilmar are reported by ADM on a 1-quarter lag basis. The Asia loss in oilseeds reflects ADM's portion of the Wilmar loss reported in their second quarter results. 
In the corporate line, net interest expense was up slightly due to interest on $1 billion of new long-term debt issued this quarter and the absence of an interest credit related to tax provisions in the prior year. Unallocated corporate costs of $106 million were down from the year-ago quarter, primarily due to lower SG&A costs and lower spending on various strategic projects. Minority interest and other include some impairment charges on certain investments and a settlement in related expenses. I'd also like to highlight that our prior year numbers included a charge of $198 million related to buying back higher-cost U.S. debt and issuing lower-cost euro-denominated debt.
Turning to the cash flow statement on Slide 6. You can see the cash flow statement for the first 9 months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period the prior year. We generated about $1.6 billion from operations before working capital changes during the period, slightly higher than the same period last year. Total capital spending for the period was $621 million, down from the prior year's $819 million. Capital spending has been lower during the more challenging first half of 2016, and we do expect to finish up the year spending below $1 billion. 
Acquisitions of $136 million to date include Harvest Innovations; Medsofts, the Moroccan corn processing operation; and Caterina Foods. Included in the other investing activities line is our increased investment in Wilmar to a 23% level. 
During the current period, we spent $754 million to repurchase approximately 20 million shares. We're heading towards repurchasing about $1 billion this calendar year. Our average share count for the period was 589 million diluted shares outstanding. Our total return of capital to shareholders, including dividends, was about $1.3 billion for this 9-month period. 
Slide 7 shows the highlights of our balance sheet as of September 30, 2016, and 2015. Our operating working capital of $7.3 billion was down about $600 million from the year-ago period. Total debt was approximately $7.1 billion, resulting in a net debt balance, that is debt less cash, of $6.1 billion, up slightly from the 2015 net debt level of $5.6 billion. Earlier in the third quarter, we issued $1 billion of U.S. 10-year debt at a coupon of 2.5%, the lowest-cost U.S. long-term debt in our portfolio. 
Our leverage position remains comfortable with a net debt-to-total capital ratio of about 25%. Our shareholders' equity of $17.6 billion was down from the $17.9 billion level last year, due primarily to shareholder capital returns in the excess of net income and a decrease in the cumulative translation account. We had $6.1 billion in available global credit capacity at the end of September. If you add the available cash, we had access to over $7 billion of short-term liquidity. Our balance sheet remains solid. 
Next, Juan will take us through a review of the business performance and drivers."

As we explained last quarter, some of the challenging condition",1852,"Thank you, Ray. Please turn to Slide 8. In the third quarter, we earned $650 million of operating profit, excluding specified items, down from the $684 million from last year's third quarter. As we explained last quarter, some of the challenging conditions we saw in the first half of the year began to subside late in the second quarter. This led to a more favorable environment in the third quarter. As a result, we were able to execute well and capitalize on the more favorable environment. 
Adjusted segment operating profit was up about 13% versus last quarter, but down about 5% versus the year-ago quarter. It is important to note that the unusual loss related to our equity earnings of Wilmar negatively impacted us this quarter. Excluding Wilmar, our third quarter operating profit would have been up about 8% year-over-year. 
Following are some of the brief highlights. In Ag Services, we saw improving market conditions, particularly increased competitiveness of U.S. corn and soybeans especially late in the quarter as we were able to export record volumes. Results for corn included continued strong performance in sweeteners and starches as the North American business continued to perform well with solid demand, production efficiencies and improved raw material costs.
Oilseeds results were impacted by lower global soy crush margins, lower origination volumes due to the reduced Brazilian soybean and corn crop and the Wilmar results in Asia. Excluding the start-up items, WFSI operating profit was up slightly compared to the year-ago quarter. 
Now I'll review the performance of each segment and provide additional detail. So starting on Slide 9. Ag Services results benefited from record export volumes as crop shortages in South America accelerated this year's seasonal shift in global demand to North America. In addition, as the record North American harvest started in the quarter, we saw improved merchandising, warehousing and storage opportunities as well as improved margins. Our global trade desk results were lower in the quarter as some commodity prices declined, causing global buyers to draw down their inventories, which limited merchandising opportunities.
In transportation, results were up due to increased utilization, strong exports and improved freight rates. Milling and Other had another solid quarter, with results consistent with the third quarter last year on strong product margins related to seasonal demand.
Please turn to Slide 10. Corn Processing results were up sequentially and year-over-year. Sweeteners and starches results improved as the North American business continued to perform well with solid demand in the U.S. and Mexico, continued production efficiency improvements and lower raw material costs. The company's international corn operations performed very well in the quarter. We continue to integrate our European Eaststarch operations and are tracking well on fully capturing the identified synergies.
Our Olenex joint venture in Mexico also performed well in the quarter. Bioproducts results, excluding last year's Brazilian sugar impairment charge, were essentially flat, with improved operational performance and margins from Animal Nutrition offset by the slightly lower ethanol results compared to last year.
Slide 11, please. Oilseeds results were down in the third quarter versus a strong quarter 1 year ago. Crushing and origination results declined significantly versus a strong year-ago quarter due to lower soybean crushing margins as competing proteins, such as DDGs end feed weed, displaced soy meal in some feed rations. We also saw some period of increased competitiveness of Argentine mill. Oilseeds results were also impacted by weaker origination in Brazil due to the smaller soybean and corn crop, which created a high cost structure in our silo and transportation network during the quarter.
In addition, producer commercialization of next year's soybean and corn crop decreased due to lower commodity prices and the continued strength of the Brazilian real. Refining, packaging, biodiesel and other results were up from 1 year ago, mainly due to good performance in biodiesel and Specialty Fats and Oils. In addition, our refined oils business continued to have a strong performance supported by solid food demand and strong biodiesel volumes.
Our Golden Peanut and Tree Nuts business had a good quarter, benefiting from the facility expansion at our plant in Dawson, Georgia. We also saw the results from the operational efficiency improvements we made in our procurement and Chilean operations throughout our network. 
Oilseeds results in Asia for the quarter declined from the year-ago period due to the impact of ADM's share of Wilmar's unusual loss in the second quarter. In fact, it was Wilmar's first-ever quarterly loss. ADM records the share of Wilmar results on a 1-quarter lag basis and recorded $48 million of equity losses in the third quarter versus a $36 million gain in the third quarter of 2015. 
On Slide 12, please. WFSI results were up slightly compared to the third quarter last year. We saw strong operating profit growth for WILD Flavors and good performance from Eatem Foods, offset by mixed results from our specialty ingredients businesses. In protein, we saw strong overall demand, led by functional concentrate and textured concentrate.
Results for the quarter included operational start-up costs for Tianjin and Campo Grande. Also in the quarter, we again added to our capabilities with the acquisition of Caterina Foods, a leading toll manufacturer of specialty gluten-free and high-protein pastas. Adding the Caterina business helps us as we continue building our portfolio to meet the needs of health-conscious consumers.
WILD Flavors saw an 8% increase in revenue with a 20% increase in operating profit. However, the challenges we've highlighted in recent quarters with some of our specialty ingredients business, SCI, edible beans and hydrocolloids, have continued. 
Our fibers business has been subject to industry oversupply issues that have kept pricing down. Partially offsetting these negatives have seen -- has been some strength in our specialty proteins business in the quarter.
Our SCI business has experienced some operational issues that have resulted in inventory write-downs and some lost sales over the past year. We are addressing these issues aggressively. As we've continued to work with customers and other businesses within ADM, we've recognized that we can be more effective at meeting customer needs and driving performance by aligning SCI's businesses into other areas of the company. We believe that we can more easily achieve synergies and improve top line sales under a new organizational structure. I have teams working through those details right now.
Now on Slide 13, I'd like to update you on how we continue to strengthen and grow our company. We've highlighted some of the areas in which we made significant progress. I'll discuss a few. We recently expanded and streamlined operations at our Golden Peanut and Tree Nuts crush facility in Dawson, Georgia, and we are already seeing the result of this operational efficiency improvement.
We have progressed our ethanol dry mill review. We are targeting receipt of final proposals from a shortlist of interested parties by the end of the calendar year. We have implemented nearly $250 million of new run rate savings actions through the end of the third quarter and expect to exceed our $275 million target by the end of the calendar year.
During the third quarter, we completed the successful deployment and go-live of our One ADM business transformation with our Ag Services U.S. elevator system covering more than 200 locations. Our One ADM program is our multiyear global investment that will help the company improve and standardize our business processes and deliver greater efficiency and effectiveness in our activities. I am proud that this significant deployment was delivered on time and under budget and with quality levels of execution, providing us confidence as we move to the next phases of the One ADM program.
We also during the quarter acquired Caterina Foods, a manufacturer of specialty gluten-free and high-protein pastas, to continue meeting the needs of health-conscious consumers. And our Stratas Foods joint venture recently acquired Supreme Oils, a U.S.-based manufacturer and distributor of edible oils and related products. Stratas Foods is our joint venture with ACH Food Companies and is North America's leading supplier of fats and oils to the foodservice, food ingredients and retail private-label markets. Adding Supreme Oils provides a JV with manufacturing locations in Tennessee, Alabama and New Jersey. The Northeast presence is important and is one of the largest consumer consumption areas for edible oils and one where Stratas lacked a presence. This acquisition provides Stratas with entry into the growing seasonings, sauces and condiments category, and its products and operations offer good opportunities for both cost and revenue synergies.
These are just a few of the highlights from the quarter. We'll continue to update you on our progress each quarter. 
And now before we take your questions, I wanted to offer some additional forward perspectives. As I indicated last quarter, the first half of the year presented some challenging conditions. However, we are seeing an improving operating environment in the second half of the year that we believe sets the stage for a stronger 2017. For Ag Services, the North American Harvest is progressing well, and we're seeing record yields and production for both corn and soybeans. We expect this to translate into continued solid results for export volumes and better global merchandising and handling opportunities as we finish out the year. Export origination margins, while good and improved versus last year, are not at the same levels we realized in 2014.
For corn, while fourth quarter volumes are expected to be down due to normal seasonality, we are optimistic in 2017 for our sweeteners and our starches business, with global sugar prices up significantly year-over-year and the ongoing progress of our operational excellence initiatives. Ethanol margins are currently being supported by strong domestic and export demand. As in the past, margins will be a function of the supply/demand balance and the impact of net inventory levels. 
As I mentioned earlier, we have made progress with our ethanol dry mill review. We have 7 original parties express interest, and we have now narrowed that list to a smaller number. We are having these parties undertake some additional due diligence prior to them submitting final proposals, which we are targeting for the end of the calendar year.
For Oilseeds, with ample soybeans from the record U.S. harvest along with solid domestic demand, crushing volumes are expected to be seasonally high in the coming months. Crush margins could experience some short-term resistance from competing global proteins.
South America grain origination margin will be depending on new crop volumes. At present, new crop origination volumes are slow and behind plan. However, we do anticipate ultimately procuring the crop. The fundamentals of increased global protein consumption point to a long-term sustainable trend, which supports higher soymilk demand and higher industry capacity utilization into the future.
For WFSI, the fourth quarter is traditionally our low-volume quarter as WILD Flavors experiences some typical seasonality from the beverage industry. We expect continued strong results from protein in the fourth quarter. We will incur continued start-up cost for our Tianjin and Campo Grande plants as they begin their first phases of production late in the quarter.
So with that, operator, please open the line for questions."

As you described, the intentions of the farmers has been to shift to corn, some acreage in Argentina. But early planting conditions are maybe making it a little bit more difficult to do that than and some people have started to plant some soybeans. So I think it's a fluid situation.

So we have less volume going through our operations. And if you think about the crush margins in the U.S., we didn't have some of the pressure that exports of mill brought maybe last year to the U.S. So obviously, with a big run-up in mill prices by mid of the year, by June or something like that, other things became more competitive, whether it's a low-quality feed wheat or whether it's DDGs or corn, got a little bit into the rush. And so we think that demand is very strong. Still, we're thinking about 5% meal consumption growth for next year, and we believe that the U.S. will have high crush margins.

And certainly, the pipeline and the storage is becoming fuller and fuller, so you see that reflection a little bit in the basis. So that is good for ADM. We have good ownership, obviously. In terms of the exports, we said before that 2014 was an unusual year because with all the fracking that was basically taking a big part of the rail system in the U.S., there was a little bit of a glut going into the New Orleans area. This year -- although maybe you were reflecting on some recent issues with transportation. In general, if you compare to 2014, rail velocity has been so much better. Freights have been lowered. So in general, we didn't get to the same level of elevation margins that we got in 2014, so volumes are good. Volumes continue to be very strong into Q4, and margins are okay. They are not just the record that maybe it used to be in 2014. I don't know -- Ray, is there anything that you would like to add to this?"

We set a target of $275 million this year, which we'll exceed. I mean, we haven't set our targets for next year. But you should expect us to actually continue to have some good targets in terms of operational excellence because, clearly, there's still more opportunities to be had. One thing I do want to point out, I mean, as Juan indicated, we talked about the One ADM program, whereby we're actually implementing this business transformation program within the company. It does cost money. For example, this year, on One ADM, we're spending about $100 million as part of that project. Some of it's capital. Some of it's operating expenses. This program is ramping up. So therefore, I do expect next year, our spending will increase as we ramp up this program. We'll provide more context in the fourth quarter call because we're still working through what the actual spend will be. But what we're doing is we're actually taking some of these cost savings that we've had, and we're going to reinvest in the company. So we're going to reinvest in terms of whether it be business process improvements or we're going to reinvest in R&D and innovation as well. So again, we'll give more context to this when we get to the fourth quarter call. But I'm very pleased that these savings are coming, but we are going to reinvest some of these savings in order to make this company stronger for the future."
